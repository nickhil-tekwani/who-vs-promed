El Oro is one of the provinces in which measles infection has been
ruled out, hence health authorities have implemented an
epidemiological barrier in order to protect the population.

Although the epidemic re-emerged in the province of Tungurahua, where
82 suspected and 22 confirmed cases have been reported, the Ministry
of Public Health (MSP) has deployed several medical teams to control
the disease and prevent its spread. Cases have also been reported in
Pastaza, Cotopaxi, and Los Rios.

As of Monday of last week [3 Oct 2011], the Provincial Directorate of
Health of El Oro has reported 68 cases of measles in the provinces
mentioned, of which 28 have been confirmed by the INH [National
Institute of Health]-Quito laboratory and 2 identified with genotype
B3, which exists in Africa and the USA.

All these cases were recorded in the communities of Atahualpa, Huachi
Chico, Huachi Loreto, Huachi Totoras, La Merced, Raisin, Pelileo
Pilahuin, Montalvo, and Quisapincha. 58 patients have been
hospitalized, and 10 have remained with home isolation.

The majority of cases (53, 78 percent) have been reported in the
community of Quisapincha, with the other communities registering
between 1-2 cases. The age group with the highest number of cases
reported are children of less than one year (27, 39.7 percent).

There are 51 cases (75 percent) with no MMR [measles, mumps, rubella]
vaccination. Cases were reported during epidemiological weeks 28, 29,
35, 37-39, with most notifications during weeks 38 and 39.

A press release from the Ministry of Public Health [MSP] indicates
that no cases of measles have been reported in Ecuador since 1996 and
that the country, like other countries in the Americas, is working
hard to eradicate measles, rubella, and polio.

In April 2011, the PAHO-WHO alert and response centers declared an
epidemic alert in the region of the Americas because of the increase
in the number of measles cases imported from the United States or from
endemic countries such as in Africa. During week 37 (17 Sep 2011),
1005 cases of measles were reported in the Americas, distributed in
several countries across the continent. Therefore, the MSP [of
Ecuador] initiated a contingency plan which included vaccination of
the population.

The last cases of indigenous measles viral infection in Ecuador were
reported in 1996. The Region of the Americas declared the interruption
of endemic transmission of measles in 2000. However, the persistence
of the virus in countries in other regions constitutes a threat
because of the presence of imported virus. As of epidemiological week
38, PAHO-WHO reported a total of 1015 cases of measles in the Region
of the Americas.

In July 2011, the Ministry of Health of Ecuador surveillance system
for acute febrile illnesses with acute non-vesicular rash identified
the 1st 2 cases of importation-related measles. On 31 Aug 2011, a new
case of measles was detected in Ambato canton, community of
Quisapincha, and since then, there have been secondary cases of the
disease.

Due to the implementation of the alert and the strengthening of the
epidemiological surveillance system, research has been conducted in
the provinces of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, Pastaza, Los Rios,
Imbabura, without any cases of the disease having been confirmed so
far.

All suspected cases have been investigated clinically and
epidemiologically, and notification of all suspected cases has been
intensified. Any suspected case outside of the outbreak area is
managed through rapid monitoring of coverage, vaccination, and
follow-up of direct contacts.

There are already 86 confirmed cases of measles in Ecuador, 83
(including 2 from genotype B2 which is circulating in Africa and the
United States) have been reported in the province of Tunguragua and 3
in Quito. This information was provided by the Ecudorian Minister of
Health, David Chiriboga, this morning [10 Oct 2011]. There are 2
suspected cases in Guayaquil, who are being followed. According to the
Minister, the outbreak was provoked by a virus that arrived from
Minnesota in the United States and that the virus has not been endemic
in Ecuador since 1997. In Minnesota, there was an outbreak of measles
last May [2011].

Last week, Ecuador began a national vaccination campaign in response
to this outbreak, that according to the Minister of Health David
Chiroga "is due to a virus that usually circulated in Africa and the
United States, and which probably came to the country with some person
who travelled outside of the country [Ecuador]."

On the recommendation of the Ministry of Health, all travelers leaving
or entering Ecuador will have to posses a certificate of vaccination
against measles. This proposal is being put into effect at Quito
airport, where such a certificate will be requested in the case of
adult passengers and vaccination documents in the case of children.
This measure will apply also at international airports in other
cities, taking effect from 10 Oct 2011.

However, the statement recognises that it will not be possible to
implement the requirement immediately, as this decision will have to
be approved in consultation with other countries in the region,
because Ecuador is a signatory to the International Health Regulations
governing the establishment of such measures.

In Quito, older individuals [presumably those older than those
targeted for routine vaccination activities] should go to the Health
Center 1, which is located in Rocafuerte Street in the historic centre
of the capital, to be immunized against measles virus infection. As of
yesterday [Wed 12 Oct 2011], 87 cases of measles have been confirmed.
Meanwhile, in the coastal city of Guayaquil, the 2 children admitted
to the Hospital Francisco de Icaza Bustamante -- a child of 2 years
and a 4-year-old girl -- will be discharged within the next few hours,
although the results of confirmatory tests have still to be received.
In addition, 470 workers including doctors and other employees of the
health service are receiving home care to reduce risk of spread of the
infection to the general population.

The outbreak has increased demand for vaccines in the country. As of
today [13 Oct 2011], Ecuador has 440 000 doses of vaccine in reserve.

Three newly suspected cases of measles were diagnosed yesterday [13
Oct 2011] in the province of Guayas, where last week there were 2, one
proven by laboratory analysis to be the African B3 strain. This brings
the nationwide total number of cases to 93.

One of the new suspected case of measles was diagnosed at the
Children's Hospital of Ycaza Francisco Bustamante in Guayaquil on
Thursday afternoon [13 Oct 2011]. This is an 8 month old child, a
relative of the 2 children who were initially diagnosed by the
National Institute of Hygiene (INH). The girl referred to above had
previously been evaluated in the hospital last week following contact
with 2 [known infected] children.

The 2 other suspected cases are patients in a hospital in Milagro,
Carlos Solis, director of the health facility, told reporters. Two
children have symptoms characteristic of measles. Patient samples have
been sent to Guayaquil to confirm the identity [genotype] of the
measles virus involved.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health reported yesterday [13 Oct 2011]
that as of epidemiological week 41 of this year [2011], a total of 93
confirmed cases had been reported. Tungurahua leads the list with 88
cases, Pichincha 4 cases, and Guayas has one case. There are dozens of
other suspected cases, which have yet to be confirmed by laboratory
testing.

The epidemic was presented initially in the parish of Quisapincha in
Ambato in July [2011], supposedly after a tourist who had the virus
arrived in the area from Minnesota (USA).

In its latest bulletin, the Ministry of Health confirmed that a
massive national immunisation campaign will begin in November 2011.
Current activity is being conducted in 2 phases, according to the
agency. The 1st is aimed at the population aged 6 months to children
aged 4 years 11 months 29 days, and will commence all over the country
in late October 2011. The 2nd stage will target the population of
5-year-old to children aged 14 years 11 months 29 days.

Carlos Castillo, delegate from the Pan American Health Organization
for the eradication of measles, last week recommended that the
vaccination be carried out across the country before the November 2011
holiday.

It all started with 5 students who caught measles on an Emirates
flight from Singapore in January [2011]. Those 5 cases quickly became
20, and before long, the disease had spread to Hawkes Bay, where a
further 24 people became ill. Now, 10 months later, the highly
contagious disease has infected nearly 300 other people around the
country, 44 of whom were so ill they needed hospital treatment.

"It's a highly infectious virus, measles; it's really easy to catch if
you are not immune," said Auckland's medical officer of health, Dr
Richard Hoskins. Dr Hoskins does not think this outbreak will come
anywhere near the 1997 epidemic, which affected more than 2000 people,
but he says there is little more authorities can do to slow the spread
of the disease. "We are at the stage now where what we are doing with
quarantine and isolation is only going to have a small effect. "It's
people understanding the significance and making sure they are up to
date with their immunisation that's the important thing."

He said measles is so contagious that people could easily catch it
just by being in the same space as someone who was infected. Not all
of the 8 [5 according to the 1st paragraph?] people who contracted
measles on the Emirates flight were sitting together. "Some of them
were sitting 11 rows and a whole section of the aircraft away," Dr
Hoskins said.

After that initial outbreak, things quieted down until May 2011, when
a person associated with Oratia District School in West Auckland
became sick. That person spent a morning at the school, resulting in
transmission to 7 others. Then a few other pupils and a "lot of other
kids from the extended families" of those initial cases also became
sick. "That's a community where immunisation levels are lower than
other parts of Auckland ... If it hadn't got in there, it probably
would have fizzled out," Dr Hoskins said.

>From there, the disease reached the Ranui Baptist Church, where
several people "had decided not to have their kids immunised." Three
cases were diagnosed, and then 2 weeks later, there were 14 more; but
many of the parents stood by their decision not to have their children
immunised. "I spoke to some parents who were absolutely convinced that
they had made, and were making, the right decisions," Dr Hoskins
said.

The most recent increase in cases has been centred on Auckland's inner
suburbs such as Parnell, Ponsonby, Herne Bay and the CBD [Central
Business District], affecting young people in their 20s and 30s.

Dr Hoskins admits that immunisation is not 100 per cent foolproof. A
small number of immunised people had still caught the disease, but the
vast majority of those who had become sick -- about 80 per cent --
were not immunised.

Rugby World Cup tourists are among the thousands of people exposed to
measles by a Wellington man who worked at a coffee and ice cream shop
during one of the city's busiest weekends this year [2011]. Regional
Public Health Medical Officer of Health Dr Annette Nesdale said the
man did not know he was infectious while working at 3 branches of
Kaffee Eis, which specialises in gourmet gelato and coffee, from
Wednesday until Sunday last week [5-9 Oct 2011]. That weekend [8-9 Oct
2011] was one of the busiest this year for the capital, as thousands
of international and domestic tourists flooded the city for 2 Rugby
World Cup quarter-final games. The man was working at Kaffee Eis in
Frank Kitts, on the waterfront, both days of that weekend, from 9 am -
6 pm on the Saturday and 9 am - 7 pm on the Sunday [8-9 Oct 2011].

Stunning weather on the Sunday [9 Oct 2011] brought locals and
tourists out in their thousands. The man also worked at that Kaffee
Eis on Wednesday, 5 Oct 2011, the Kaffee Eis in Courtenay Place on
Thursday, 6 Oct 2011, and Kaffee Eis in Cable Car Lane -- a tourist
attraction - on Friday, 7 Oct 2011. "These locations are very popular,
and there is the potential that large numbers of people have been
exposed to the infection," Dr Nesdale said. "Over these days, Kaffee
Eis was very busy."

The man also went to Les Mills Gym in Taranaki Street between
6:00-7:30 pm on the Wednesday and from 4:00-6:00 pm on the Thursday
[5-6 Oct 2011]. "We have been informed that approximately 2000 people
attend the Les Mills Extreme Gym each day," Dr Nesdale said. "We are
working closely with the Les Mills Extreme Gym and Kaffee Eis to trace
staff. However, tracing of customers and gym members is not possible.
Anyone who was at these venues should check their immune status, and,
if in doubt, contact their doctor."

The man is the 2nd Wellingtonian confirmed to have measles. Auckland
is experiencing an epidemic.

[Wellington is the capital city and 3rd most populous urban area of
New Zealand. It is at the southwestern tip of the North Island,
between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. The Wellington urban area
is the major population centre of the southern North Island. The
location of Wellington is shown in the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of New Zealand at: http://healthmap.org/r/1kSd.

Reports of cases of measles virus infection in previously unaffected
areas are declining with the exception of Ecuador and New Zealand. The
vast number of cases in various parts of the African continent remain
under-reported.

In New Zealand, Auckland remains the centre of a serious and spreading
outbreak. The upcoming deciding game in the Rugby World cup, to be
played in Auckland on 23 Oct 2011 featuring a Northern hemisphere
country (France) and a Southern hemisphere country (New Zealand), may
prolong and disseminate this outbreak. - Mod.CP]
