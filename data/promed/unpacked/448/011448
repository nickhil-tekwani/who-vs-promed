This information may be of help to someone regarding the transmission of
Legionnaires' Disease.
W Campbell Love, The Lancet, December 9 1978
1978 Glasgow
POSSIBLE PERSON TO PERSON TRANSMISSION OF LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE.
A general practitioner was treated for pneumonia in 1974. The clinical
features suggested infection with _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, chlamydia B or
_Coxiella burnetii_, but the serology was negative. The doctor himself was
positive that he had contracted the infection from a patient whom he had
attended 2 weeks before and had sent to hospital with severe pneumonia
which had developed during a holiday in Benidorm. Sera taken from the
patient during his illness have proved, retrospectively, that he had
Legionnaires' disease. No acute-phase serum was available from the general
practitioner, but a sample taken more than three years later had an antibody
titer of 512.
This is a strong circumstantial evidence of a case-to-case transmission.
[I don't think this will help anyone. I am posting it because the
information came from a reputable journal. I could not tell from the text
received whether the final comment, about it being "strong circumstantial
evidence of a case-to-case transmission", was from the journal or from the
sender, Denis Green. This is about as circumstantial a diagnosis as I can
imagine. It doesn't convince me a whit; bad science. Admittedly, person-to-
person transmission would be difficult to prove but that's the business we
are in; no one said it would be easy. Until we have some data regarding
person-to-person transmission, we will assume it does not occur and, at
least temporarily, cut this sting. -- Mod]
