About 1 percent of cases of tick-borne encephalitis can be deadly. It is a virus carried by ticks that can cause brain swelling and neurological damage.

The period between March and November is when most people get infected, according to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Ticks become active when the temperature reaches 7 deg C [45 deg F]. May, June and July are peak months.

So far in 2018, 322 cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been reported in Switzerland, about 20 percent more than in all of 2017 and 1.7 times more than in 2008. The worst affected cantons were Zurich (59 cases), Bern (48), St. Gallen (30) and Aargau (27).

Fortunately, there is a vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis. Unfortunately, there is not one for Lyme disease. The FOPH provides maps of encephalitis and Lyme disease hotspots -- Lyme disease is shown everywhere except at high altitudes.

[The number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Switzerland has increased from 230 on 24 Jul 2018 to 272 on 13 Aug 2018 to 333 one month later, as listed above. As noted earlier, the virus is endemic (and expanding) in certain areas of the country, as well as in some areas of Germany and Austria. In a comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr. Ivo M. Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. Comparing the period from 1985 through 2000 (average reported number of TBE per year, 66) with the period from 2001 through 2016 (average reported number of TBE per year, 138), the trend is even more obvious.

The WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
