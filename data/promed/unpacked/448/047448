Crop killer pushing deeper into region
--------------------------------------
A soybean crop infection is more prevalent in west-central Illinois fields this year [2014] compared to other years. The soil-based fusarium organism, which causes sudden death syndrome, can be seen in soybean fields throughout the region, said Aaron Dufelmeier, University of Illinois. "Early planting dates and wet and cool conditions at planting, coupled with rain in July and August, have led to a fairly significant presence of sudden death syndrome in fields across this region." It could potentially affect crop yields.

Sudden death syndrome can be a major problem for soybean farmers [and] controlling [it] is difficult. There are no highly resistant varieties of soybeans. Fungicides applied in furrow during planting or as seed treatments have limited effects, and fungicides applied to foliage have no effect on the disease, according to Purdue [University] Extension [see link below].

Purdue recommends that soybean farmers keep good field records of when and where sudden death syndrome has occurred. Documenting diseased fields will allow farmers to determine if management practices are reducing problems or failing.

Diseased fields should be marked for later planting and increased tillage or tile drainage. In addition, soybean varieties with some level of resistance to sudden death syndrome should be planted in fields that have been affected by the disease.

[Sudden death syndrome (SDS) was first discovered in the USA (Arkansas) in 1972 and has now become widespread in soybean-growing regions in the US, Argentina and Brazil. Plants turn yellow and die quickly after pod set, and symptoms often appear in patches in a field. Yield losses may be more than 80 percent, depending on variety and timing of infection. Appearance of SDS at early pod fill is reportedly more damaging than its appearance at a later stage of plant development. Yield reduction is the result of reduced photosynthetic area, defoliation, flower and pod abortion and reduced seed size.

The fungus _Fusarium virguliforme_ has been described as the causal pathogen of SDS in North America and _F. tucumaniae_ in South America. Foliar symptoms are thought to be the result of a fungus-produced toxin. External stress factors are reported to exacerbate symptoms and cause SDS-affected plants to deteriorate earlier. In particular, soybean cyst nematode (SCN; _Heterodera glycines_), although not required for severe SDS to occur, is reported to exacerbate foliar symptoms and lead to early and severe SDS, if present at sufficient levels. Other soybean pathogens are still being studied for a potential role in SDS.
