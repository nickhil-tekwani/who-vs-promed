2 poultry farms with a total of 3600 birds at Denu and Keta in the Volta Region have been destroyed due to infection of the farms with avian flu.
The poultry farm at Keta started with 1800, but before it came to the notice of veterinary officers, 1100 had died, and 700 had also died at Denu within 3 days.

The Volta Regional Veterinary Officer, Dr Mark Kofi Tettey, who disclosed this to Tim Dzamboe, Graphic Online's Volta Regional correspondent, said the 2 farms had 1800 birds each. He said all the birds have been destroyed together with eggs. The drinking and feeding troughs have accordingly been disinfected. He said an intensive screening exercise had begun in the area and the entire Volta region to ensure that the disease was detected early enough to avoid further spread.

Dr Tettey said movement of livestock across markets has been banned as part of bio-security measures to hold the disease in check.

[The above 2 outbreaks in the Volta region, bordering the "Region Maritime" province of Togo, were included among the 5 new outbreaks reported by Ghana on 17 Jun 2015 to the OIE. The outbreak in Denu had, reportedly, started on 1 Jun 2015 and the one in Keta on 8 Jun 2015.

Since the start of the HPAI H5N1 event in Ghana on 13 Apr 2015, 9 outbreaks have been recorded in this West African country and notified. The reports and a summarising map presenting the 9 accumulated outbreaks as of 16 Jun 2015 are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17828.

The Ghana policy in relation to HPAI is "stamping out."

The disease is currently circulating also in 4 other West African countries: Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and Niger. It would be surprising if neighbouring countries such as Togo and Benin remain uninfected. - Mod.AS
