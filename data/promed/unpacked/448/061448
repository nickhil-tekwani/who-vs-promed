Health officials are warning people to avoid recreational contact with
Waikato River after tests showed high levels of a potentially toxic algal
bloom.
At a meeting yesterday, Waikato Regional Council (Environment Waikato) said
algae levels were above recommended guidelines for "recreational
contact." Water quality scientists said levels at several sites were more
than double the acceptable limit for recreational use.
Waikato's Medical Officer of Health, Felicity Dumble, put a health warning
in place between Orakei-Korako and Port Waikato, where tests showed the
potentially toxic algae, _Anabena planktonia_, is present.
"We will know whether or not toxins are present in the river by early next
week. At this stage, all we can be certain of is that blue-green algae
levels are high," Dr Dumble said in a statement.
Toxins can lead to health problems, including skin rashes, asthma, and hay
fever, when water is swallowed or comes into contact with skin. People
should not drink untreated water from the river, even if boiled, Dr Dumble
said.
Treated water supplies were still "considered safe." City officials
planned to start dosing the water early next week with powdered activated
carbon, which kills toxins and will also improve the taste.
Staff were being recalled from leave and testing of the city's water had
been increased from weekly to twice daily.
Samples from Lakes Ohakuri, Maraetai, and Karapiro on Wednesday showed high
counts of blue-green algae. Dr Dumble said there had been no reports of
illness as a result of consumption or contact with the river
water. Waikato River was previously affected by blue-green algae 5 years ago.

[Many species of cyanobacteria produce populations that are toxic to humans
and animals. Blue-green pond scums have been linked to the poisoning of
cattle and dogs, and occasionally people. Some species of cyanobacteria
appear to be nontoxic and are harvested as a food source. It is therefore
not recommended that wild algae populations be gathered and eaten without
some knowledge of the organisms involved. Cyanobacteria may cause other
problems as well; a species of _Lyngbya_ is responsible for one of the skin
irritations commonly known as "swimmer's itch." _Anabaena_ is a blue-green
algae. - Mod.TG]
