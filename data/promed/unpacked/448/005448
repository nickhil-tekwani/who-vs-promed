This year [2017] Bolivia is experiencing an unusual outbreak of mumps. According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.

"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017]," pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.

Yesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.

The most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.

In La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since "there is an explosive and persistent outbreak".

Mumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.

Mr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.

He also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.

Mr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.

The disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.

Grant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45. The mumps outbreak was contained to the Columbia Basin Job Corps and the Ephrata School District. Grant County Health District's Theresa Atkinson says that was a fraction of the 888 cases reported statewide.

"The mumps outbreak was incredibly large for our area," said Adkinson Fortunately, no one currently has mumps in Grant County.

The same cannot be said about whooping cough with 78 current cases in the county. This year [2017], Moses Lake had 54 cases of pertussis, Ephrata had 22, Soap Lake 2 and both Royal City and Warden had 1.

"It's the largest pertussis outbreak we've ever experienced," said Adkinson.

Mumps, an infectious disease carried on a sneeze or a cup, appears to be spreading among DC [USA, District of Columbia] universities, with cases reported at 3 schools.

The Catholic University of America recently identified a cluster of illness, with 4 confirmed mumps cases and 3 more suspected cases under investigation, a school spokeswoman said [Mon 6 Nov 2017].

On [Fri 3 Nov 2017], a message sent to the Georgetown University community said 2 undergraduates had been diagnosed with the disease.

The cases at Georgetown have been confirmed, according to a letter from the DC Department of Health.

And American University has 2 confirmed mumps cases, as well as 4 suspected cases, school spokesman Mark Story said [Mon 6 Nov 2017].

The mumps cases at DC universities appear to be connected, though officials are still investigating, DC Department of Health spokeswoman Jasmine Gossett said.

"We are monitoring them and are working with the universities and their student health centers, just to inform them and then educate those who may be at risk," Gossett said.

At Catholic, the school has adjusted Communion distribution during Mass to help combat the illness, university spokeswoman Elise Italiano said. "Normally, we offer Communion through the host and what we call the chalice, or the cup with wine," Italiano said. "And we suspended the 2nd practice . . . because of the possible spread through saliva. So, we've just taken that extra precaution."

Mumps spreads through saliva or mucus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, headaches, and swollen and tender glands under the ears, the CDC's website notes.

Georgetown officials asked infected students to cloister themselves for 5 days after the appearance of initial symptoms, a note to the campus from Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, said.

"We will continue to monitor and support these students," WinklerPrins said.

In an email sent to its campus community, Catholic said residential students who had reported mumps symptoms have been moved to an unoccupied space, in an attempt to limit exposure.

"Students are able to return to rooms and classes after a 5-day period," the email stated.

Catholic's students were also briefed on how someone infected with mumps can spread the virus: by coughing or sharing a drink, for example. They were advised to keep their hands clean and to not share their utensils.

The University of Virginia [U-Va] has also recently urged students to take precautions after 2 suspected cases were identified. A U-Va spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking an update [Mon 6 Nov 2017].

ProMED thanks Ann Zhang for alerting us to these cases.

[Because of the rise in mumps outbreaks observed at US universities since 2006, a federal expert US panel has endorsed a 3rd vaccine dose in such outbreak situations. See http://wapo.st/2yoWDc1 for a report on this decision, as well as ProMED mail Mumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada 20171027.5407525.

Public health service medical officer, Dr Josephine Herman, says NZ has a vulnerable population who have not been fully immunised.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service has been notified of 740 cases of mumps since 1 Jan [2017]. Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. "This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain," Herman said.

She said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.

She said there have also been "massive" outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.

"In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.

"We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well."

Herman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.

But she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.

Herman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.

[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage. More often, mumps outbreaks are the consequence of waning immunity in young adults. But the Auckland outbreak is a reminder that even with elimination of mumps (and measles) from a country, high immunization levels must be maintained.
