Hampshire was today [23 Sep 2007] at the centre of a new foot and
mouth alert. Government farming officials have set up a 3 km
temporary control zone round a farm in the county.
The alert was raised by the owners of the farm at Petersfield after
they became concerned about animals on the farm. They called a local
vet who then raised the alarm with the Department for Environment
Food and Rural Affairs. They immediately took samples and have sent
them away for analysis.
A Defra spokesman said it remains essential for animal keepers to
practice the highest standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for
disease and report any suspicions immediately. Cattle owners should
examine their livestock twice a day.
Tests are being conducted on the Hampshire animal as farmers also
wait to see whether a new livestock virus, bluetongue, found in a
highland cow in Suffolk yesterday [22 Sep 2007] has spread.

[Hopefully, this is another false FMD alarm; in case excluded,
bluetongue should be considered as well.
If FMD is confirmed, it will be the 1st outbreak outside Surrey,
requiring the establishment of a separate protection/surveillance
zone. - Mod.AS]

[3] National Trust estate, Surrey

The farmer hit by the latest case of FMD has said that he and his
wife had been devastated to find the disease in their prized
herd. David Sheldrake lost 34 pure-bred West Sussex cows, which were
slaughtered after testing positive for the virus.
The cattle were grazing on a riverside meadow in the National Trust's
Runnymede estate, near Egham, Surrey, just yards from a monument
marking the signing of the Magna Carta, when his wife, Coral, spotted
telltale lesions in the animals' mouths.
The couple's Beaumont College Farm is one of the suppliers to the
Windsor Farm shop, which sells produce from the Queen's estates,
increasing fears the disease is creeping closer to royal land.
There were also concerns that measures to close off footpaths on the
estate were ineffective following reports of dog walkers ignoring
cordons set up to protect the area from the virus. Police said they
have stepped up patrols after people were seen walking through the barriers.
Mr Sheldrake said he had "fought like hell" to avoid being hit by the
virus and inspected his cows regularly. Only one was found to be
infected, but the rest were slaughtered as a precaution.
He said he believed that the virus had been spread by deer or
migrating geese, adding: "I've been seeing it on the television and
seeing the way other people are suffering. Now I'm feeling it myself,
and it's not very nice. My wife is absolutely devastated." Their
farm is the 4th to be infected in the area around Egham. Another 2
were infected around Pirbright 10 miles away last month [August
2007]. The latest farm is in an affluent stretch of countryside that
has no other agricultural premises nearby.
Residents spoke of fears that the virus had been spread from the
other farms in Egham by dog walkers. Reg Jones, a fisherman, said: "2
women walking their dogs just walked through the tape, so we told the
National Trust, and they put up chains across the gate."
Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, chaired a meeting of the
Government's Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall before heading
off to the Labour Party conference in Bournemouth. Later, Dr Reynolds
said it was essential that farmers remained vigilant.
The investigation into the latest cases and how the virus spread is
expected to be published next week. The strain infecting the latest
herd to be culled is to be confirmed, but is expected to be the same
as the previous 5 cases.
The report is expected to say the most likely route for the spread of
the disease was on the wheels of vehicles that were not disinfected
as they left the Pirbright site. A source close to the investigation
said: "There was quite a bit of confusion over the vehicle log
entries not being there. It is clear that some vehicles did go north
from Pirbright towards the area where the 2nd round of infections
have occurred."
It comes as lawyers for about 40 farmers, livestock markets and
retailers are preparing to start legal action in the high court
against the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for
losses they have suffered because of the animal movement ban. They
are also planning to sue the pharmaceutical company Merial UK, which
was blamed for the initial release of the virus from its vaccine
laboratories in Pirbright, which it shares with the [government]
Institute for Animal Health. If the cases are successful, other
businesses could win the right to seek compensation, with the final
bill running to more than BP 100 million [USD 201 million].
Defra refused to comment on the legal action, while Merial insisted
it was not responsible for the outbreak.

[The Beaumont College farm is in Priest Hill, Old Windsor; the
protection zone around it includes the Windsor Great Park, locally
referred to as "the Great Park," which is a large deer park and a
Crown Estate of 5000 acres (20.23 sq.km). The parkland is a popular
recreation area for residents of the western London suburbs. Deer
