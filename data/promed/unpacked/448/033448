SEA TURTLE, DIE-OFF - USA (FLORIDA) (03)

I write in response to "Sea turtle, die-off - USA (Florida) (02)", in which
the correspondent (Debora MacKenzie) was reminded "of something about
turtle farms in the Caymans in the 1970s that might help the people
grappling with the sick Florida turtles now". Ms MacKenzie wondered if the
turtle farms still exist.
The turtle farms are still in operation in the Caymans. I visited Grand
Cayman in November 2001, and the farm had just suffered a tremendous loss
when a storm destroyed the beachfront operation, releasing hundreds of
juveniles into the Caribbean. Scientific papers are posted on their website
