Travel-Associated Dengue --- United States, 2005
----------------
Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted, acute viral disease caused by any of 4
dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, or DEN-4). Dengue is endemic
in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world and has occurred among
U.S. residents returning from travel to such areas (1,2). In collaboration
with state health departments, CDC maintains a passive surveillance system
for travel-associated dengue among U.S. residents. Suspected dengue in
travelers is reported to state health departments, which forward specimens
to CDC for diagnostic testing.* A case of travel-associated dengue is
defined as laboratory-diagnosed dengue in a resident of one of the 50
states or the District of Columbia (DC) who traveled to a dengue-endemic
area outside the United States or DC any time during the 14 days before
symptom onset. This report summarizes information regarding 96
travel-associated dengue cases, including one fatality, among U.S.
residents during 2005. Travelers to tropical areas can reduce their risk
for dengue by using mosquito repellent and avoiding exposure to mosquitoes.
Health-care providers should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis
of febrile illness in patients who have returned recently from
dengue-endemic areas.
Serum samples from 199 travelers with suspected dengue on the basis of
clinical symptoms (3) during 2005 were submitted to CDC from 30 states. Of
these 199 patients, 78 (39 percent) received a laboratory diagnosis of
dengue, 51 (26 percent) were classified as indeterminate because a
convalescent-phase sample for serologic testing was unavailable, and 70 (35
percent) did not have dengue. Of the 78 patients with dengue, 70 (90
percent) had elevated anti-dengue IgM antibodies, and 8 (10 percent) had a
dengue virus identified in serum by either polymerase chain reaction or
viral isolation. Eighteen additional patients (12 from Florida, 5 from
Texas, and one from New Mexico) had elevated anti-dengue IgM antibodies
identified by commercial laboratories and also received a diagnosis of
dengue [See original URL above for a table showing numbers of imported
dengue cases per state in 2005].
Of the 96 total patients with a dengue diagnosis, 53 (55 percent) were
female. The median age of the 83 patients for whom age was reported was 43
years (range: <1-84 years). Travel destinations of 73 (76 percent) patients
were identified. Thirty-two (44 percent) reported travel to Mexico during
the 2 weeks before illness onset, 19 (26 percent) to Central America, 16
(22 percent) to the Caribbean, and 6 (8 percent) to Asia.
Clinical symptoms were reported for 24 (25 percent) patients. Six had at
least one hemorrhagic symptom (e.g., epistaxis, hematemesis, hematuria,
hemoptysis, petechia, or purpura). Of the 96 patients, 17 (18 percent) were
reported to have been hospitalized, including one who died. This rare
travel-associated dengue fatality occurred in a woman aged 28 years in
otherwise good health who had recently returned from a week in Mexico.

Editorial Note:
Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by certain species of _Aedes_
mosquitoes. The majority of U.S. residents who contract dengue become
infected during travel to tropical and subtropical areas outside of the 50
states and DC, although autochthonous transmission has been documented in
Texas (4,5) and Hawaii (6). Nearly as many cases of travel-associated
dengue were identified in 2005 (96 cases) as were identified during the
preceding 5 years combined (98 cases) (1,2). The incidences of dengue and
dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are increasing in the tropical areas of the
world, including in the Western hemisphere (7). Waning support for
mosquito-control programs (i.e., less funding for vector control),
urbanization in the tropics, increasing human populations, and increased
use of nonbiodegradable products (i.e., which can hold fresh rain water and
provide places for mosquitoes to lay eggs) have all contributed to the
recent resurgence of dengue (7). In 2005, outbreaks of dengue and DHF were
reported from several areas in the Americas, including Mexico, Puerto Rico,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Belize, El Salvador, Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil.Y
The incubation period for dengue ranges from 3 to 14 days. Dengue virus
infection can be asymptomatic or cause illness ranging from mild,
undifferentiated fever to severe disease that includes hemorrhage and shock
(8). DHF is characterized by fever, minor or major bleeding manifestations,
thrombocytopenia (<100 000 platelets/microL), and evidence of increased
vascular permeability (e.g., hemoconcentration [hematocrit >20 percent
higher than baseline], pleural or abdominal effusions, or hypoproteinemia)
(6). Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) also can occur; DSS is DHF with signs of
circulatory failure, including narrow pulse pressure (<20 mm Hg),
hypotension, or shock and has a case-fatality rate of approximately 10
percent (9). However, with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the
case-fatality rate can be reduced to less than 1 percent (10). Aspirin and
other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are contraindicated for patients
with dengue because of their anticoagulant properties.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First,
these data are likely subject to underreporting because the surveillance
system is passive (i.e., relies on health-care providers to report
infections), and dengue is not a nationally notifiable disease in the
United States. Second, travel histories and clinical information were not
available for all cases, and the available data might not be representative
of all persons with travel-associated dengue.
Persons traveling to areas where dengue is endemic should avoid exposure to
mosquitoes by using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and remaining
in well-screened or air-conditioned areas. Preventing travel-associated
dengue not only benefits the traveler but also helps prevent introduction
of dengue virus into areas of the United States (primarily the southeastern
states) where vector mosquitoes might transmit the virus indigenously. No
vaccine is available for preventing dengue infection. Health-care providers
should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of patients who have
fever and a history of travel to tropical areas any time during the 2 weeks
before symptom onset.
To diagnose dengue, health-care providers should obtain from the patient
both an acute-phase (0-5 days after symptom onset) serum sample for
directly detecting dengue virus and a convalescent-phase serum sample for
detecting anti-dengue antibody, preferably obtained 1-2 weeks after the
first sample.� Serum samples obtained for viral identification and
serologic diagnosis can be sent through state or territorial health
departments to CDC's Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, 1324 Calle Canada, San
Juan, Puerto Rico 00920-3860; telephone, 787-706-2399; fax, 787-706-2496.
Serum samples should be accompanied by a summary of clinical and
epidemiologic information, including date of disease onset, date of sample
collection, and detailed recent travel history. Additional information
regarding dengue case reporting and instructions for specimen shipping are
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/dengue/dengue-hcp!

for 2-3 months in some cases), the optimum timing for a convalescent-phase
sample is 1-2 weeks after the first sample.

[ProMED readers are urged to access the table at the above URL showing
suspected and laboratory-diagnosed cases of laboratory-associated dengue by
state in the United States in 2005. There were 217 suspected dengue cases
in 30 states, and an additional 96 cases were laboratory-confirmed. Of
these confirmed cases, 36 were from Texas, 23 from New York, and 12 from
Florida. It seems likely that some dengue cases acquired abroad and
imported into the United States go undetected and unreported because
infected individuals do not seek medical attention, or they are seen by
medical personnel unfamiliar with dengue or are unaware that the patient
has been to areas where dengue is endemic. Prospective travelers need to be
made aware of the risks of acquiring dengue infection and measures they can
take to avoid mosquito bites when they travel to areas of the world where
these viruses are circulating. - Mod.TY]
