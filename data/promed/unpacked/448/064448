A sudden spur in the cases of those infected with either of the Ross
River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) in South Australia
created panic among the general public and the government. The
alarming rise in the infected cases is credited to the ascended levels
of water in the River Murray. The stagnated water has given rise to
many water-borne diseases, thereby promoting the breeding of
mosquitoes. Stephen Christley, the chief public health officer of
South Australia, confirmed for 350 cases of Ross River virus (RRV) and
Barmah Forest virus (BFV). The figure was just 16 in this season of
last year [2010].

Following this, Dr Christley, in a media briefing said: "While most
people will recover completely in a few weeks, some can have quite
severe symptoms for many months. Anyone suffering from symptoms should
contact their doctor for advice immediately." He publically appealed
people to take care of themselves and to look out for symptoms, which
include joint pain, rash, fever, fatigue, or muscular pain.

He also advised everyone to make sure that there is no standing water
nearby, as it becomes a breeding haven for mosquitoes. He asked to
discard the containers like pots, bottles, cans, and tyres that are
holding water.

[As mentioned in the 13 Jan 2011 ProMED posting (archive no.
0110113.0149) continued wet weather has created additional breeding
sites for mosquitoes that are vectors of Ross River and Barmah Forest
viruses, with an increased number of cases of infection by these
viruses.
