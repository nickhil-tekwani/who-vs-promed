On [Mon 6 Feb 2017], FMD was suspected in a dairy cattle operation in the Western Negev Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, located approximately 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] from the Gaza strip border]. FMD has been confirmed by the laboratory; the causative agent has not yet been serotyped.

We are also informed about clinical signs of FMD in a sheep flock within the Gaza strip. Plausibly, the Nir Yitzhak outbreak originated in the Gaza strip. Since the possibility that an exotic virus strain may be involved has been raised, extreme precaution is prescribed to avoid unnecessary contacts with animals. A 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi] outbreak zone around the affected farm has been implemented [the note includes a table specifying 24 settlements within the 10 km zone. - Mod.AS].

[The described FMD event is exceptional in Israel for the following 2 aspects:

1. Contrary to the disease in small ruminants and beef cattle, FMD has been for decades very rare in Israel's dairy cattle. This is mainly due to their robust immunity maintained throughout the years by a compulsory, methodically, State-applied periodical vaccination regime with polyvalent inactivated vaccines that include regionally circulating virus strains.

2. All reported FMD outbreaks, since the establishment of the State of Israel, are considered to have been introduced from the north (Lebanon, Syria) and (less often) east (Jordan). The current outbreak seems to be the 1st one originating in the south-west. FMD was reported from the Gaza strip in 2012 (serotype SAT2) and 2013 (serotype A); in both cases suspected to have been introduced from Egypt. In both events, the virus did not enter Israel's territory.

For the location of Nir Yitzhak, which is situated in Israel's "Hadarom" (The South) district, see map at http://tinyurl.com/jd8mmq9.

The (inactivated, oil emulsion) FMD vaccines applied in Israel for the compulsory vaccination of cattle were composed, in 2015, of the following vaccine strains:

1. Serotype O: O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625, O Israel 2007 (4 strains)
2. Serotype A: A- 4165, A Iran 05 (2 strains)
3. Serotype Asia 1: Asia1 Shamir (1 vaccine strain).

It would be interesting to note if the same composition was applied in 2016.

Information on the serotype and genotype of the causative virus strain involved, the number and age distribution of the affected cattle and the vaccination history of the Nir-Yitzhak dairy operation, is awaited. - Mod.AS
