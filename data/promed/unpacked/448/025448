From: George A. Robertson <grobertson@erols.com>
Assuming all the actions taken by the authorities in Hong Kong have been
effective in halting the spread of this virus, I would like to solicit the
opinions of the readers (and, especially the Moderators, who have done a
SPECTACULAR [Capitalization not mine but I thought I'd leave it in. -
Mod.CHC job in sorting through the information) on "What next?"
Some thoughts, "What do we do with a vaccine (if produced)?" "Who would
get it?" and, "What are the 'lessons learned' for the inevitable 'next time'?"

[We welcome answers to these questions from Rob Webster, Brian Mahy, Nancy
Cox, or other experts who might be willing to comment. I can already tell
you about "the inevitable 'next time'": There won't be a next time because
no two epidemics ever are exactly the same. However, a bit of crystal
balling might provide a refreshing change from all this non-case counting.
