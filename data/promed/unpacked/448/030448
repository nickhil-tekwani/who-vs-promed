Since 14 Jul 2014, clinical cases of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF, "3 day sickness"), showing the typical signs (mainly elevated temperatures, acute drop of milk yield, salivation, recumbency) have been reported from dairy and beef cattle farms and in various parts of Israel. During the last week, outbreaks with mild clinical signs have still been seen, including in locations 500 m [0.3 mi] above sea level and higher.

[Israel's State Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture) have published an animated interactive map, showing 90 recorded BEF outbreaks between weeks 28 and 42 of 2014 [14 Jul-20 Oct 2014]. The map is available at http://moag.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=b8c021a2d85b4937a5fa99aa8f93951e. For the locations of the outbreaks on a weekly basis, click/activate the timeline at the map's bottom. The animation can be stopped to see each week's outbreaks.

BEF -- a vectorborne viral disease -- is, most likely, not exclusive to Israel; it is regarded to affect also other Middle-Eastern countries, sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem. Information on the 2014 BEF situation from other countries (such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq) is pending. Regional cooperation, when established, may eventually enable the prevention and control of pestilences in animal and man.

BEF is not zoonotic and is not listed by the OIE. It is characterised by high morbidity and low mortality rates, causing considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries. In Israel, vaccination has been applied. Information on its results, as recorded in field conditions, would be useful to all. - Mod.AS
