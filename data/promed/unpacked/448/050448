Scientists discover yet another new bluetongue strain
-----------------------------------------------------
Scientists have discovered another new strain of bluetongue, this
time in goats in Switzerland. The discovery means there are now 4
serotypes of the virus in Northern Europe - BTV1, 6, 8 and the new
previously undiscovered serotype. It is the 1st time scientists have
discovered the latest strain -- 'Toggenburg Orbivirus' (TOV) -- which
was discovered in 2 goat herds in Switzerland.

"To discover a new BTV is interesting, but to discover it in central
Europe is most surprising," said Professor Peter Mertens of the
Institute of Animal Health, which carried out the research along with
scientists at the Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI),
the national bluetongue reference laboratory in Switzerland. "This
new BTV is so different from other ones that we cannot even guess
where it came from. Although the virus did not cause overt disease in
goats, if it started to spread and behave like other BTV strains,
then it could become a more serious threat to ruminants, especially
as there would be no vaccine against it."

The discovery follows the arrival of BTV6 in Holland last week [20-24
Oct 2008] -- the 1st time the disease has been seen in Northern
Europe.

This abstract is derived from the following "ahead of print" paper,
available at the above URL:

Hofmann MA, Renzullo S, Mader M, Chaignat V, Worwa G, Thuer B.
Genetic characterization of Toggenburg orbivirus, a new bluetongue
virus, from goats, Switzerland. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008 Dec; [Epub
ahead of print].

Abstract
--------
A novel bluetongue virus (BTV) termed Toggenburg Orbivirus (TOV) was
detected in goats from Switzerland by using real-time reverse
transcriptionPCR. cDNA corresponding to the complete sequence of 7 of
10 double-stranded RNA segments of the viral genome was amplified by
PCR and cloned into a plasmid vector. Five clones for each genome
segment were sequenced to determine a consensus sequence. BLAST
analysis and dendrogram construction showed that TOV is closely
related to BTV, although some genome segments are distinct from the
24 known BTV serotypes. Maximal sequence identity to any BTV ranged
from 63 percent (segment 2) to 79 percent (segments 7 and 10).
Because the gene encoding outer capsid protein 2 (VP2), which
determines the serotype of BTV, is placed within the BTV serogroup,
we propose that TOV represents an unknown 25th serotype of BTV.

[Toggenburg is the name given to the upper valley of the river Thur,
in the Swiss Canton of St. Gallen, north-east Switzerland. The same
name was given in the past to a famous goat breed, the Toggenburg
(dairy) goat (background and pictures at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toggenburg_goat>).

The official web-site of Switzerland's Federal Veterinary Office
(FVO) includes some Q&A re TOV; see at
<http://bvet.kaywa.ch/p60.html>. Herewith is a summary of its
(translated from German) text:

1. Should animal owners worry - does this virus represent a threat?
No, clearly not! The TOV (acronym for "Toggenburg Orbivirus"), has
produced only mild disease in goats and virtually none in sheep. No
diseases seen in experimentally infected goats. Its discovery has
scientific significance but no impact upon agriculture.

2. What is the impact of TOV upon sheep and cattle?
It is suggested that, possibly, a significant proportion of the goats
in different regions of Switzerland have had contact with the virus.
Our clinical studies have also shown that sheep may respond
serologically but without clinical manifestation of disease. As far
as the cattle are concerned, we have examined several hundred animals
without discovering a trace of TOV, indicating that cattle are not
susceptible to TOV infection (The absence of seropositive cattle
could, theoretically, be explained also by vectors' affinity. Have
experimental infection trials in cattle been considered? - Mod.AS)

3. Is the Swiss case exclusive? Why has TOV not been discovered elsewhere?
One must know that the BTV surveillance system in Switzerland is
unique in Europe. We have modified, at Instituts fur Viruskrankheiten
und Immunprophylaxe (IVI), a diagnostic procedure developed by the
Italian research group. The modified technique has enabled the
demonstration of TOV, and explains why we are the only country in
which this virus was been noticed. But it is likely that the virus is
present elsewhere in Europe.

4. What next?
We must push forward the diagnosis and improve our methods. We also
want to carry out epidemiological studies into the prevalence and
distribution of TOV in Switzerland. At the same time, our neighbors
are also studying the TOV situation within their territories.

It will be interesting to see how widespread the TOV is in Europe. - Mod.AS]

[The Swiss virus is clearly a novel bluetongue virus (BTV), not a
mutant/recombinant/reassortant of previously characterised viruses.
It is quite distinct from the 24 characterised BTVs.

The paper includes a thorough piece of molecular virology. TOV can be
considered as a 25th BTV on the basis of the molecular virology, but
this remains to be confirmed by serology -- difficult at present
because it does not propagate well in cultured cells (or in animals).
