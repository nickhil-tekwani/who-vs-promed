An outbreak of food poisoning has sickened thousands of Egyptian schoolchildren in March 2017, figures showed [Thu 23 Mar 2017], sending parents rushing to hospitals and leading the Education Ministry to temporarily suspend its school lunch program.

Egypt saw 4650 suspected food poisoning cases in schools nationwide in March 2017 alone, the Cabinet said in a statement carried by state-run news agency MENA, compared to some 300 cases previously reported since the beginning of the academic year in September 2016.

In a single incident last week [13 to 19 Mar 2017] in the southern city of Sohag, at least 3353 students were affected. Similar outbreaks have taken place this week [20 to 26 Mar 2017] in other governorates, though on a much smaller scale, including in the canal city of Suez, Menoufiya in the Nile Delta and the southern city of Aswan.

The Education Ministry suspended the distribution of school meals nationwide as of [Thu 23 Mar 2017], saying that a committee will be formed to "find out the reasons behind these occurrences ... and conduct required investigations." School meals are provided to around 9 million students in Egypt daily.

Sobhi Abdelrahman, the nutrition director at the Education Ministry, told The Associated Press that "the suspension decision covers all the meals that might have caused the problem." "We are waiting on the findings of the public prosecution, who is investigating the case," he added, affirming that meals undergo "thorough examination" by authorities prior to distribution.

Health Minister Tarek Shawki described the suspension as a "precautionary" measure in a televised interview with a local TV station. In a press conference [Thu 23 Mar 2017], Health Ministry official Amr Kandil said an investigation of school meals had detected no microbes linked to food poisoning.

Minister of Education Tarek Shawky has indefinitely suspended the distribution of school meals nationwide, starting [Thu 23 Mar 2017] until further notice. Shawky ordered the formation of committees to inspect the storage measures of school meals. The minister's decision came against the backdrop of hundreds of food poisoning cases among students in schools throughout several governorates over the past week [13 to 19 Mar 2017].

The recurrence of poisoning cases from school meals is "abnormal", and might be part of a larger conspiracy, according to Amr Qandil, Head of the Preventive Medicine department with the Health Ministry. The recent poisonings occurred in schools in Sohag, Monufiya, Aswan, Beni Suef, Suez and Greater Cairo.

Meanwhile, Member of Parliament Abdel Hamid Kamal filed a request with Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel Aal to summon the education minister over the incidents.
