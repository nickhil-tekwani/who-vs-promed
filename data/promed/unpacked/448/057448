Epidemic kills more than 100 in India.
Guwahati - At least 105 people have died in recent days from
gastroenteritis in the state of Assam, in the north of India. All the
victims worked on tea plantations in the districts of Jorhat & Sibsagar.
Local residents blame the outbreak on lack of potable water & basic
sanitary facilities. The disease is characterized by inflammation of the
stomach & intestines.
