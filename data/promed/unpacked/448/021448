Mexico, influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 10 Oct 2022
Confirmed: 20 Oct 2022
Reported: 26 Oct 2022
Reason for notification: new strain in a zone or a compartment
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Tepatitlan de Morelos, Jalisco
Started: 10 Oct 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Blue winged teal (wild) / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: a blue-winged teal, a migratory bird native to the Americas, in a wetland in the area of Pequeros, in the municipality of Morelos, Jalisco; it did not show clinical signs.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: the detection follows SENASICA's [National Service of Health, Food Safety and Quality] active epidemiological surveillance of avian influenza in wild birds. Poultry organizations in the country are urged to take extreme biosecurity measures and to immediately notify the health authority of any suspicion of the disease. The wildlife agency was informed to urge park rangers, hunters, and falconers to notify any dead or sick wild bird found.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / First result date / Last result date / Result
[United States-Mexico Commission for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases] (CPA) / blue winged teal / 1 / gene sequencing / 20 Oct 2022 / 20 Oct 2022 / positive
[United States-Mexico Commission for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases] (CPA) / blue winged teal / 1 / virus isolation / 18 Oct 2022 / 18 Oct 2022 / positive
[United States-Mexico Commission for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases] (CPA) / Blue winged teal / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 13 Oct 2022 / 18 Oct 2022 / positive

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America, spread rapidly across the continent and has recently been found in Mexico. The occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in Mexico coincides with the seasonal migration from North to South of some species that winter in that country. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB
