Brazil: delayed confirmation of a case of yellow fever
------------------------------------------------------
[Yellow fever has been] detected by disease surveillance in Parana state,
after rejection of diagnoses of malaria and hepatitis. The patient had gone
fishing in Tangara da Serra, Mato Grosso, in the last week of December
2003. He was unvaccinated, but recovered.
Laboratory confirmation was by the Adolfo Lutz Institute, Sao Paulo, by Mab
ELISA and HI (hemagglutination inhibition) tests on paired serum samples.
This is the 3rd yellow fever case in Brazil to be confirmed in 2004. The
other 2, in Amazonas and Para states, were fatal.
