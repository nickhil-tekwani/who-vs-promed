----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background information on HTLV infection in Australia is abstracted from Gideon and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2]

The 1st report of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma related to HTLV-1 infection in an Australian Aborigine was published in 1991. 3 such cases had been reported in non-Aboriginal Australians as of 1993. The 1st report of tropical spastic paraparesis related to HTLV-1 infection in an Australian Aborigine was published in 1993; and the 1st report of HTLV-II infection in Australia was published in 1994.

The risk of a transfused patient developing HTLV-I infection from un-screened blood was estimated at 1 in 370 000, and the risk of developing HTLV-I disease at 1 in 9-to-15 million (1993 to 1995). The screenshot at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/04/30/htlv-infection-in-australia/ summarizes published seroprevalence surveys of HTLV infection in Australia (primary references available from the authors).
