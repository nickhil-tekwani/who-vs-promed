A 12/16 press release from US Geological Survey says a mysterious disease
that killed bald eagles and American coots in southwest Arkansas may now be
in Georgia and North Carolina. The disease, which affects the brain and
nervous system by creating holes in the myelin layers insulating nerves,
killed 55 bald eagles and an unknown number of coots in 1994 and 1996. There
is no known cause or cure for the disease.
The USGS release urges the public to alert the National Wildlife Health
Center (608)270-2448 to report sick or dead eagles or coots.
