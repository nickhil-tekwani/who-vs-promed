[There is a graph of the cumulative number of monkeypox cases as of 1 Jul 2022. (https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/monkeypox?yScale=log&facet=none&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Frequency=Cumulative&Shown+by=Date+of+report&count)

On 28 Jun 2022, ECDC issued a technical bulletin on considerations for contact tracing during the monkeypox outbreak in Europe, 2022. (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Considerations-for-Contact-Tracing-MPX_June%202022.pdf)

A 1 Jul 2022 report indicated that the World Health Organization warned that urgent action is needed to contain the spread of monkeypox in Europe, as cases have tripled over the past 2 weeks. Europe is the center of a global outbreak of the virus with 90% of confirmed monkeypox cases reported there, according to the WHO. New infections have tripled since 15 Jun 2022 with 4500 confirmed cases across 31 European nations. Henri Kluge, the head of WHO Europe, called on governments to ramp up efforts to prevent monkeypox from establishing itself on the continent, warning that time is of the essence.

[A 1 Jul 2022 report indicated that officials say that monkeypox spread at 2 large parties. Los Angeles County officials have reported limited local transmission of monkeypox, with some recent cases involving people who attended large events here and infected people who haven't traveled out of state. "There's been some what we call 'community transmission.' That is, it's not from travelers or people who went elsewhere and contracted monkeypox somewhere else. It's actually they got monkeypox here in L.A. County, because it was transmitted from someone else here in L.A. County who had monkeypox," Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said at this week's Board of Supervisors meeting. (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-01/monkeypox-spread-at-two-large-parties-in-l-a-county)

A 1 Jul 2022 announcement indicated that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has ordered an additional 2.5 million doses of Bavarian Nordic's JYNNEOS, an FDA-licensed vaccine indicated for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox, for use in responding to current or future monkeypox outbreaks and as part of U.S. smallpox preparedness. Deliveries from this latest order will begin arriving at the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) later this year [2022] and will continue through early 2023.

The national Ministry of Health confirmed the 6th case of monkeypox in Argentina corresponding to a resident of the province of Córdoba who had traveled to Mexico, where he was in contact with a person who had the infection.

The health agency reported that the patient's health is evolving favorably under home control and isolation.

This is the 6th case of monkeypox in the country based on confirmatory diagnosis by means of a PCR test carried out by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INEI), which is under Dr Carlos Malbran's National Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes (ANLIS).

The person began with symptoms such as fever, severe headache and general malaise on [19 Jun 2022], arrived in Argentina on [20 Jun 2022] and had a medical consultation by telephone on [25 June 2022].

After evaluation in a hospital, the necessary samples were sent to INEI where the PCR test was positive for monkeypox.

According to information provided by the province, the person remains in isolation from the day he arrived in the country and is progressing favorably with home control.

From [27 May 2022] to date [30 Jun 2022], 6 cases of this disease have been confirmed in the country, 5 of which have a history of travel [outside the country].

Last night the 5th case was confirmed in a 32-year-old man with a history of travel to Europe, who began to present symptoms compatible with the disease on [23 Jun 2022]. Four days later he went for medical consultation in the city of Buenos Aires, where he was treated on an outpatient basis.

Of the people infected in Argentina to date [30 Jun 2022], there have been no secondary cases registered, that is infection of 3rd parties.

https://playcrazygame.com/2022/07/02/second-suspected-case-of-monkeypox-in-ms-is-a-2-year-old-child-who-came-from-london/


A 2nd case of a patient suspected of being infected with monkeypox in Mato Grosso do Sul is a 2 year old child who came from London, United Kingdom, to Campo Grande. The child was traveling to the state when she presented with the symptoms; she is in home isolation in the capital.

The SES-MS (State Department of Health) reported that the child was seen in a health unit in Campo Grande on Monday [27 Jun 2022] accompanied by the mother. The main symptom that classified the child as a suspected case is the presence of multiple rashes all over the body.

After the notification to the Ministry of Health, the child had test samples collected and everything was sent to the laboratory. The SES states that it is seeking to identify whether the child has other diseases, including: chickenpox, herpes zoster, measles, Zika, dengue, chikungunya, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, disseminated gonococcal infection, primary or secondary syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinal, molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus), allergic reaction (such as to plants).

The child is in good health and is in isolation at home. According to SES, she has a history of traveling to an endemic country, in Europe.

The new suspected case in the state adds to 22 other suspects throughout Brazil. Since the beginning of the monitoring of the disease 37 days ago in Brazil until now [1 Jul 2022], there have been 21 confirmed cases in the country.

Also, according to information from the situation room of the Ministry of Health, there have been 99 notifications of the disease throughout Brazil. Mato Grosso do Sul has 3 reported cases of the disease, of which 2 became suspects, one of which was discarded on [10 Jun 2022].

The 1st suspected case of monkeypox in Mato Grosso do Sul was a Bolivian teenager who sought medical attention at Santa Casa de Corumbá. He had skin lesions that were typical of the disease. On [10 Jun 2022], Corumbá Health reported that the tests for the disease were negative and that the teenager's diagnosis was an allergic reaction to a drug that was prescribed in Bolivia. He remained hospitalized in the city hospital to treat the skin lesions.

In early June [2022], the MPMS (State Public Ministry) announced the drafting of a contingency plan against monkeypox in Mato Grosso do Sul and an implementation group was set up.

The group has the SES-MS (State Health Department), Sesau (Municipal Health Department) of Campo Grande, Municipal Health Council, Regional Nursing Council, Health Commission of the City Council, Health Commission of the Legislative Assembly and OAB-MS Health Commission as its members. The group's work must follow guidelines issued by Anvisa (National Health Surveillance Agency) in a published technical note last month [June 2022] which details what is known so far about the disease and procedures for reporting cases.

In response to the MP's recommendation, SES-MS reported, on [21 Jun 2022], that it was awaiting a national contingency plan to establish the guidelines of the state plan. In the document, the secretariat also reported that it has taken measures against the disease, such as guidelines for professionals in the State and monitoring of the Cievs (Center for Strategic Information on Health Surveillance).

So far, there are no new practical measures resulting from the creation of the state contingency plan.

Biological material from the patient was collected for further examinations, with no conclusive result yet and the case is under investigation. This is the 1st suspected case in Amazonas state.

The young patient, without comorbidities, was treated and notified by the epidemiological surveillance system and the Center for Strategic Information on Health Surveillance (CIEVS) and is still undergoing clinical follow-up and epidemiological surveillance, in home isolation, with a scheduled return for care and new exams. People who had contact with the patient are also being investigated. (https://playcrazygame.com/2022/07/02/first-suspected-case-of-monkeypox-is-recorded-in-amazonas/) - Mod.TY]

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10975461/Monkeypox-cases-UK-rise-1-235-health-officials-issue-warning-ahead-Pride-parade.html


Monkeypox cases in the UK continue to rise ahead of the London Pride parade later today [2 Jul 2022], now reaching 1235 confirmed cases.

Officials have now released a warning urging anyone who thinks they might have monkeypox to stay away from the parade to avoid further spread.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the number of cases jumped by a further 159 by [30 Jun 2022], up from 1076 on [28 Jun 2022].

'Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.

'This weekend, let's enjoy Pride safely -- before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes.

'Please don't attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell. If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested.

'Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks -- especially if you are having sex with someone new.

To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners, to help us limit further transmission where cases occur.'

Meanwhile top public-health doctor Professor Kevin Fenton has also urged anyone with suspected symptoms to stay at home and contact the NHS for advice.

It was time for clear messages, Prof Fenton told BBC News. "If you think you may have monkeypox -- blisters, fevers, swollen glands -- please do not go out over the weekend," he said. "Stay at home and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service for advice."

Professor Fenton expects a further rise in cases in coming weeks as it can take time for symptoms to appear.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan echoed calls for anyone with possible symptoms to stay at home. But he added it was essential the parade goes ahead as planned after the recent shooting at Oslo's pride event in June [2022].

The UKHSA says it has been advising and working with organisers of mass events throughout the outbreak, which has emerged in the last couple of months.

Gay and bisexual men have been 'disproportionately affected' health officials have said.

Although there is no clear evidence as to why the majority of cases have been identified in members of the LGBT+ community, it is thought this may be to do with the fact gay and bisexual men tend to have more awareness of, and get checked more regularly for, sexually transmitted diseases. This means they are more likely to notice changes such as rashes and blisters.

Until this year [2022] monkeypox had not seen a widespread global outbreak, instead being limited mainly to parts of Africa. But anyone can get monkeypox if they have had close contact with an infected person.

Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. [see the virus in semen report below]

It can also be spread through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash.

According to the UKHSA, monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people and the overall risk to the UK population remains low.

The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash then tends to blister and scab over before eventually drying and falling off.

Of the 1235 cases, the UKHSA has confirmed that 77% of those affected who have a registered address are residents of London.

Of the 1185 cases where gender data is available, 1180 cases appeared in men with just 5 in women.

The median age of infection in the UK so far is 37.

London alone now has had 692 confirmed cases, with a further 287 cases where the location has not yet been determined.

There are fears that the London Pride parade, which takes place today [2 Jul 2022], could lead to further spread due to the close proximity of people. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to descend on the capital to celebrate.

The event will mark the 50th anniversary of the 1st ever Pride parade in the UK, which saw just a couple of thousand attendees.

Pride in London's 2022 parade will start at Hyde Park Corner at midday [2 Jul 2022], before making its way through Piccadilly and Piccadilly Circus and then turning south on Haymarket. From there it will travel towards Trafalgar Square before finishing in Whitehall at around 6pm.

But gay rights activist and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who helped to organise the 1st ever Pride event in 1972, yesterday said the parade had become 'too corporate and commercial.'

Speaking about the main event, Mr Tatchell said: 'A lot of us are very concerned that the main official Pride event has become too corporate and commercial. It often looks like a huge PR, marketing and branding exercise by big companies. The human rights dimension has been lost. The original Pride was both a celebration and a protest. That's the way it should be this year [2022] as well.'

'We need to remember that there are still issues to fight for, particularly globally where 69 countries continue to criminalise same sex relations -- 12 Muslim majority countries still have the death penalty.'

The UKHSA advises Britons to contact their sexual health clinic if they have a rash with blisters and have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed monkeypox case or have been in West or Central Africa in the last 3 weeks.

As part of efforts to thwart the ever-growing outbreak, both confirmed cases and close contacts are offered the Imvanex jab, which is 85% effective against the virus. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in the past and is proven to work.

But despite these efforts, there are fears that the monkeypox outbreak, combined with a resurgence of coronavirus and an expected early wave of flu, could cause massively increased pressures on the NHS. ...

[A 1 Jul 2022 report stated that patients with monkeypox in the UK have noticeably different symptoms from those seen in previous outbreaks, according to researchers in London, raising concerns cases are being missed. Patients reported less fever and tiredness and more skin lesions in their genital and anal areas than typically seen in monkeypox, the study of 54 patients at London sexual health clinics in May 2022 found.

The research from London, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal, follows suggestions from public health bodies like the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the outbreak -- which is spreading chiefly among men who have sex with men -- is presenting unusually. The authors, from a number of institutions including Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said case definitions should be reviewed to avoid cases being overlooked, particularly as monkeypox can "mimic" other common sexually transmitted infections (STI) like herpes and syphilis. The study also found that 1/4 of the monkeypox patients were HIV positive, and 1/4 had another STI.

[6] UK: vaccination recommendations
Date: Fri 1 Jul 2022
Source: UK Government Health Security Agency [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination-resources/protecting-you-from-monkeypox-information-on-the-smallpox-vaccination


The smallpox (MVA) vaccination
------------------------------
You are being offered a smallpox vaccination to help protect you against monkeypox.

The vaccine is manufactured in Europe by Bavarian Nordic[1]. When you are given the vaccine, your immune system (the body's natural defence system) produces antibodies against the smallpox virus. These antibodies should also protect you against the monkeypox virus.

The vaccine contains a virus which has been modified so that it cannot grow in the human body. This Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine was developed as a much safer form of the smallpox vaccine used widely in the UK and abroad into the 1970s. The MVA vaccine does not contain smallpox virus and cannot spread or cause smallpox.

What MVA is used for
--------------------
As monkeypox is caused by a virus similar to smallpox, vaccines against smallpox are expected to prevent or reduce the severity of the monkeypox infection.

Imvanex vaccine has been authorised by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to protect against smallpox.

Although the same MVA vaccine is licensed for use against monkeypox in the US, the vaccine is not yet licensed for use against monkeypox in the UK. Because of this and because you may be receiving vaccine which has been packed and labelled for use in the US, the vaccine you have is considered 'unlicensed' or 'off-license' in the UK. This should not make any difference to you, as your health care professional is recommending the vaccine in line with national advice.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommends the use of MVA vaccine as part of the response to cases of monkeypox.

Who is MVA recommended for?
---------------------------
UKHSA currently recommends that MVA is offered to:
• healthcare workers who are caring for and who are due to start caring for a patient with confirmed monkeypox (2 doses are normally required)
• gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Your clinician will advise vaccination for you if you have multiple partners, participate in group sex or attend 'sex on premises' venues (one dose now - a second dose may be advised later at your sexual health clinic)
• people who have already had close contact with a patient with confirmed monkeypox. Vaccination with a single dose of vaccine should be offered as soon as possible (ideally within 4 days but sometimes up to 14 days)

Does the vaccine work?
----------------------
After 2 doses of vaccine, most people develop antibodies and should therefore have a good level of protection against monkeypox. It is less clear what level of protection you get from a single dose given after contact with a case.

One dose of MVA vaccine is offered to help modify or reduce the symptoms of disease and should also help to kick-start your protection for the future. If you are at on-going risk, a 2nd dose may be advised.

Can MVA be used in children
---------------------------
Monkeypox is known to be more serious in young children than in older children and adults. Therefore the vaccine is still recommended in children, even in babies.

Although there is very little data on the use of the smallpox vaccine in children, the same MVA virus has been widely used for children as part of other vaccines. Several hundred small babies have been given MVA based vaccines against tuberculosis and malaria. The vaccines seem to work very well and have an acceptable safety record, causing very similar side effects to other vaccines. The vaccine has also been given safely to a few children in the UK after contact with a case.

Those who cannot receive MVA vaccine
------------------------------------
The only people who cannot receive the vaccine are those who suffered a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine, or any ingredient of vaccine before. The vaccine contains trace amounts of chicken protein, benzonase and gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (antibiotics).

Who may be better to delay vaccination?
---------------------------------------
If you are ill with a high temperature you may need to be assessed to determine if you are displaying early signs of monkeypox. If your illness is not related to monkeypox, you may still be offered the vaccine. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first.

Who else needs to take special care?
------------------------------------
You should tell the doctor or nurse if you have received smallpox vaccination in the past or if you have atopic dermatitis, as the risk of side effects from the MVA vaccine may be higher.

If you are HIV positive or have any other condition or treatment leading to a weakened immune system, the vaccine may not protect you as well. Let your doctor or nurse know.

If you are pregnant
-------------------
If you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. The virus in the vaccine does not grow and multiply in the human body and so cannot spread to an unborn child.

Monkeypox may be more severe in pregnancy and you also need to consider the risk of passing infection to your baby. The doctor should help you to understand the benefits and how this balances against any theoretical risk from the vaccine.

If you are breast-feeding, should you still have the vaccine?
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are breast feeding, you will still be offered the vaccine. The virus in the vaccine does not grow well in the human body and so cannot spread to the breastfed child.

If you catch monkeypox, however, you could pass infection to your baby, and monkeypox may be more severe in small babies. The doctor can help to explain the benefits.

If you are taking other medicines
---------------------------------
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or if you have recently received any other vaccine. In most cases, you should be fine to have the vaccine.

How MVA is given
----------------
The vaccine will be injected into the skin, preferably into the upper arm, by your doctor or a nurse.

Driving and using machines
--------------------------
There is no reason to believe that the vaccine would affect your ability to drive or use machines.

Fainting after vaccination is quite common, so you should wait for 15 minutes after the jab before you drive.

Side effects of MVA vaccine
---------------------------
The vaccine has a very good safety profile. Like all vaccines it can cause side effects, but most of these are mild and short-lived and not everyone gets them.

Side effects may be more common in people who have previously received a dose of live smallpox vaccine. These people only need a single dose of MVA to boost their existing protection.

Common side effects
-------------------
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Common side effects include pain and itching at the injection site and headache, muscle ache, sickness and tiredness. About 1 in 10 people will have chills and fever, but these should not last more than a few days.

If you experience any of the side effects listed above, you should rest and you can take the correct dose of paracetamol to help relieve the symptoms.

If you already have atopic dermatitis (a form of eczema), you may experience more intense local skin reactions (such as redness, swelling and itching) and other general symptoms (such as headache, muscle pain, feeling sick or tired), as well as a flare-up or worsening of your skin condition.

Serious side effects
--------------------
Some other conditions have been more rarely reported in people who received the vaccine. In the spirit of openness, the vaccine product insert mentions all these conditions -- even those reported from single cases -- but this does not mean that the vaccine was responsible. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this guide.

If you have the following symptoms shortly after vaccination, ring 999 (or ask someone to do this for you):
• difficult or noisy breathing or wheezing
• swollen tongue
• prolonged fainting or unconsciousness
• confusion

These symptoms may be a sign of a rare but serious allergic reaction and typically happen within 15 minutes of vaccination. Simple faints are much more common after vaccination. If you do faint, stay flat on your back with your legs raised. If this doesn't make you feel better, then call for help.

For other symptoms, contact 111 or your health professional.

Reporting side effects
----------------------
Please report any suspected side effects directly via the Yellow Card Scheme website, by downloading the Yellow Card app or by calling the Yellow Card scheme on 0800 731 6789 9am to 5pm.

By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this vaccine.

Further information
-------------------
You will get more information on this medicine from the package insert that the doctor or nurse should give you. The insert is also available on the European Medicines Agency website.

1. The vaccine you are being given is called Imvanex in the UK and Europe, Jynneos in the US and Imvamune in Canada. These all contain the same MVA vaccine and are made by the same company.

[On 1 Jul 2022 the UK Government Health Security Agency issued a checklist for monkeypox vaccination (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smallpox-mva-vaccination-against-monkeypox-checklist-and-consent-form/smallpox-vaccination-against-monkeypox-checklist). The above vaccine recommendations and checklist are relevant for any country vaccinating against monkeypox, not just the UK.

In a 1 Jul 2022 plea, health authorities in Africa say they are treating the expanding monkeypox outbreak there as an emergency and are calling on rich countries to share the world's limited supply of vaccines in an effort to avoid the glaring equity problems seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A middle-aged man is the 4th person to be diagnosed with monkeypox in Iceland, according to the Directorate of Health.

Unlike the 3 men previously diagnosed with monkeypox, he does not have a recent history of travel, meaning he likely contracted the disease from an unknown carrier. He is currently in good health and is isolating at home.

Vaccines against monkeypox have not yet arrived in Iceland, though news from the European Union suggests a shipment should arrive within a few weeks, according to the Directorate of Health.

https://www.bfmtv.com/sante/variole-du-singe-premier-cas-confirme-chez-un-enfant-d-ile-de-france_AN-202206250296.html


In a press release published this Saturday [25 Jun 2022], the Agenré Régionale de Santé (ARS) of Île-de-France announced the 1st confirmed case of monkeypox in a child attending primary school in the region. He was taken in care and shows no serious signs.

In this same press release, the ARS claims to have "begun the investigations in order to trace the child's chain of contacts as quickly as possible."

According to initial findings, a probable case has been identified in the same child's siblings, and measures have been taken in collaboration with National Education, including the dissemination of a message to the parents of children who are contacts at risk of the disease at the school attended by the child.

They are advised to monitor the appearance of symptoms and to contact 15 [The French medical emergency number that can be dialed from any phone in France] if necessary or to be offered a consultation in order to have the child benefit from a vaccination, if it is deemed necessary by a doctor. It is also notified that "no measure is therefore necessary for the child (neither isolation, nor adaptation of activities) nor for the other members of the family" in the absence of symptoms.

Previously in Île-de-France, the virus had only affected adults (330 cases confirmed by Public Health France on [23 Jun 2022] at 2 p.m. including 227 in Île-de-France). The cases reported in France and Europe have so far occurred mainly in young adults, and are benign.

Turkey has detected its 1st case of monkeypox in a 37-year-old patient who is in isolation, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Thursday [30 Jun 2022].

"Monkeypox has been detected in one of our patients. The patient is 37 years old and has an immune system deficiency," Koca wrote on Twitter.

He said the patient was in isolation and contact follow-up had been conducted, with no other case found.

Citation: Nicolo Girometti, Ruth Byrne, Margherita Bracchi, Alan McOwan, Victoria Tittle et al. Demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed human monkeypox virus cases in individuals attending a sexual health centre in London, UK: an observational analysis.

Summary
-------
Background: Historically, human monkeypox virus cases in the UK have been limited to imported infections from west Africa. Currently, the UK and several other countries are reporting a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics, with no apparent epidemiological links to endemic areas. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with human monkeypox virus attending a sexual health centre.

Methods: In this observational analysis, we considered patients with confirmed monkeypox virus infection via PCR detection attending open-access sexual health clinics in London, UK, between 14 and 25 May 2022. We report hospital admissions and concurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) proportions, and describe our local response within the first 2 weeks of the outbreak.

Findings: Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed in 54 individuals, all identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM), with a median age of 41 years (IQR 34-45). 38 (70%) of 54 individuals were White, 26 (48%) were born in the UK, and 13 (24%) were living with HIV. 36 (67%) of 54 individuals reported fatigue or lethargy, 31 (57%) reported fever, and 10 (18%) had no prodromal symptoms. All patients presented with skin lesions, of which 51 (94%) were anogenital. 37 (89%) of 54 individuals had skin lesions affecting more than one anatomical site and 4 (7%) had oropharyngeal lesions. 30 (55%) of 54 individuals had lymphadenopathy. One in 4 patients had a concurrent STI. There were 5 (9%) of 54 individuals who required admission to hospital, mainly due to pain or localised bacterial cellulitis requiring antibiotic intervention or analgesia. We recorded no fatal outcomes.

Interpretation: Autochthonous community monkeypox virus transmission is currently observed among MSM in the UK. We found a high proportion of concomitant STIs and frequent anogenital symptoms, suggesting transmissibility through local inoculation during close skin-to-skin or mucosal contact, during sexual activity. Additional resources are required to support sexual health and other specialist services in managing this condition. A review of the case definition and better understanding of viral transmission routes are needed to shape infection control policies, education and prevention strategies, and contact tracing.

[11] Virus in semen
Date: Thu 30 Jun 2022

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-06-italian-experts-semen-vehicle-monkeypox.html


Researchers in Italy who were 1st to identify the presence of monkeypox in semen are broadening their testing, saying early results suggest sperm can be a vehicle for infection.

A team at Rome's Spallanzani Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases, revealed in a study published on [2 Jun 2022] that the virus DNA was detected in semen of 3 out of 4 men diagnosed with monkeypox.

They have since expanded their work, according to director Francesco Vaia, who said researchers have found the presence of monkeypox in the sperm of 14 infected men out of 16 studied.

"This finding tells us that the presence of the virus in sperm is not a rare or random occurrence," Vaia told AFP in an interview. He added: "The infection can be transmitted during sexual intercourse by direct contact with skin lesions, but our study shows that semen can also be a vehicle for infection."

Researchers at Spallanzani identified Italy's 1st cases of monkeypox, found in 2 men who had recently returned from the Canary Islands. The latest results reported by Vaia have not yet been published or subject to peer review.

The vast majority of cases so far have been observed in men who have sex with men, of young age, chiefly in urban areas, in "clustered social and sexual networks", according to the WHO.

It is investigating cases of semen testing positive for monkeypox, but has maintained the virus is primarily spread through close contact.

Meg Doherty, director of the WHO's global HIV, hepatitis and sexually-transmitted infection programs, said last week: "We are not calling this a sexually-transmitted infection."

Spallanzani researchers are now trying to ascertain how long the virus is present in sperm after the onset of symptoms.

In one patient, virus DNA was detected 3 weeks after symptoms first appeared, even after lesions had disappeared -- a phenomenon Vaia said had been seen in the past in viral infections such as Zika.

That could indicate that the risk of transmission of monkeypox could be lowered by the use of condoms in the weeks after recovery, he said.

The Spallanzani team is also looking at vaginal secretions to study the presence of the virus.

A significant finding from the 1st study was that when the virus was cultured in the lab, it was "present in semen as a live, infectious virus, efficient in reproducing itself", Vaia told AFP.

Vaia cautioned that there remained many unanswered questions on monkeypox, including whether antiviral therapies could shorten the time in which people with the virus could infect others.

Another is whether the smallpox vaccine could protect people from the monkeypox virus.

"To study this we will analyze people who were vaccinated 40 years ago before human smallpox was declared to have disappeared," Vaia said.

[An important finding is that live, infectious virus has been found in semen and not just virus DNA fragments detected by PCR. If the virus load in semen and sperm cells is adequate for transmission to occur, this route of transmission must be taken into account epidemiologically and preventively. - Mod.TY]

[12] Hospital surface contamination

Citation: Nörz Dominik, Pfefferle Susanne, Brehm Thomas T., Franke Gefion, Grewe Ilka, Knobling Birte, Aepfelbacher Martin et al. Evidence of surface contamination in hospital rooms occupied by patients infected with monkeypox, Germany, June 2022.

Abstract
--------
The extent of monkeypox virus environmental contamination of surfaces is unclear. We examined surfaces in rooms occupied by 2 monkeypox patients on their 4th hospitalisation day. Contamination with up to 10 ^5 viral copies/cm ^2 on inanimate surfaces was estimated by PCR and the virus was successfully isolated from surfaces with more than 10 ^6 copies. These data highlight the importance of strict adherence of hospital staff to recommended protective measures. If appropriate, pre-exposure or early post-exposure vaccination should be considered for individuals at risk.

Discussion
----------
Overall, these data underscore the importance to remind hospital personnel of the need to follow recommended protection measures for monkeypox. Sufficient time and attention must be given to the careful doffing of PPE and personnel must be properly trained in these procedures. Regular disinfection of frequent hand and skin contact points during the care processes additional to regular room cleaning and surface disinfection using products with at least virucidal activity against enveloped viruses can reduce infectious virus on surfaces and thereby risk of nosocomial transmission. Suitable strategies for preventing the spread of the virus outside the patient's room must be individually adapted to the situation of the respective medical facility. The application of the double-gloving method with discarding of the outer glove layer or disinfection of the gloved hand before entering an anteroom can contribute to this. After the final doffing of the PPE, proper hand hygiene must be performed immediately. Pre-exposure vaccination for healthcare workers as well as early post-exposure vaccination in the case of probable or confirmed contamination in the absence of or incorrectly applied protective equipment may be considered.

Those living in the same households as affected individuals should be advised that, in addition to avoiding close physical contact, disinfection of shared skin- and hand-contact surfaces might be useful to prevent transmission. At the present time, the viral load on inanimate surfaces required for disease transmission is unknown. Therefore, future studies should also investigate the dose-dependent infectivity of such surfaces.

[Interestingly, there is additional evidence of environmental contamination of surfaces by monkeypox virus (MPXV) infected individuals. In December 2019, a traveler returning from Nigeria after a 4-week trip to the UK became MPXV-positive. The study results indicated that MPXV DNA was detected in several surface sites throughout the 2 adjoining single-room residences inhabited by the MPXV-infected person and their sibling. All 21 surface samples from the patient's apartment were MPXV RT-qPCR-positive, with most exhibiting cycle threshold (Ct) values that indicated substantial contamination. Additionally, multiple MPXV-positive samples were found in the sibling's residence, communal areas, and the connecting platform. Infectious MPXV was extracted from 6 samples 3 days after the last visit to these areas. These findings verified that contaminated environments might present a risk of onward MPXV transmission.
