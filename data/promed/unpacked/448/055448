Hundreds of jumbo squid washing up on California shores
-----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of giant squid are washing up on Orange County beaches, creating a
scene more akin to "20 000 Leagues Under the Sea" than the "O.C." [Orange
County].
The bug-eyed sea creatures, believed to be Humboldt squid, normally reside
in deep water and only come to the surface at night. Why approximately 500
of them began washing up on the sands of Laguna Beach and Newport Beach on
Tuesday [18 Jan 2005] isn't clear.
Authorities said the squid -- the largest weighing 17 pounds -- might have
been pursuing bait fish and gotten too close to shore, or the tides might
simply have carried them in. "I have heard of this happening before, but
it's not a common occurrence," lifeguard Capt. Eric Bauer of the Newport
Beach Fire Department said on Wednesday [19 Jan 2005].
Authorities plan to remove the squid in the next couple of days and will
give at least a couple to the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History for
research.
In the meantime, beachgoers were advised not to eat or even touch them.
"They probably have bacteria on them at this point," Bauer said.

[In 2002, domoic acid was believed to be the cause of the beaching of
another squid species. Several searches and inquires have resulted in no
further information. If there is some authoritative update on the cause,
please share it with us. - Mod.TG]
