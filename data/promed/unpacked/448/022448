Seeka, New Zealand's biggest kiwifruit grower, says it may have found PSA [bacterial canker] in an orchard it is developing in Australia. It has notified Agriculture Victoria of unusual bacterial symptoms and is removing suspicious plant material pending further test results. The symptoms are consistent with PSA. The affected plants are in a non-producing part of the orchard on 2 year old vines.

PSA in New Zealand is estimated to have infected 80 per cent of the country's kiwifruit orchards and cost the industry up to NZD 1 billion [about USD 650 million]. The company is planning significant expansion in Australia [where it currently] has about 154 hectares of kiwifruit, of which 93 hectares are the green Hayward variety and in production, 47 hectares [371 acres] [are] root stock and 14 hectares [35 acres] grafted 2 years ago.

[Bacterial canker of kiwi fruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) is caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa). Symptoms may include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, followed by death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Psa infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means, and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected (ProMED-mail post 20180221.5643210). Spread with infected fruit can so far not be excluded. Alternative hosts (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160225.4050698) are likely pathogen reservoirs. A number of different biovars (populations) of Psa exist that vary, for example, in geographical origin and/or aggressiveness. A very virulent strain, Psa-V (biovar 3) was detected in central Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207).

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen), and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a streptomycin resistant strain is emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

In Australia, Psa haplotype 2, corresponding to the Asian group of strains which is considered to be mild, has been reported earlier (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206). In New Zealand, at least 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified, one of them an aggressive strain related to the Italian lineage. It remains to be seen which strain is causing the infection reported above and if an additional strain has been introduced into Australia.
