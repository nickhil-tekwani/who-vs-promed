Europe increases checks on melons after outbreak
------------------------------------------------
The European Commission has tightened the rules around imports of Galia melons from Honduras because of a recent salmonella outbreak. Emergence of a risk to human health because of possible _Salmonella_ Braenderup contamination means official controls are to be increased with identity and physical checks on 10% of consignments entering the European Union beginning [6 Jan 2022].

The multi-country outbreak of _Salmonella_ Braenderup that affected more than 350 people was traced to Galia melons from Honduras. Four people were sick in the USA and 2 in Canada. The UK was the most affected but ill people were also from Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and Norway.

A sample of _Salmonella_ Braenderup that matched the outbreak strain was found on the surface of a washing tank in one of the Honduran facilities where Galia melons were packed. The harvest season started again this month [December 2021]. However, authorities in Honduras said the cause cannot be confirmed to be Galia melons from the country because a case was reported in July 2021 in Denmark, and no melons from Honduras were exported at that time.

The updated regulation temporarily changes the rate of official controls and puts emergency measures on entry into the EU of certain goods from some non-EU countries. Rules are modified every 6 months to account for new information on risks to health and non-compliance with EU legislation.

[Melons grow on the ground and can be contaminated through tainted irrigation water. The flesh is then contaminated when the rind is cut into. All the cases are from Europe except for 6 cases in North America, which lack a clear epidemiological link to the European cases.

The Galia melon, also known as sarda in South East Asia, is a type of F1 hybrid melon originating from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka'. Developed in Israel at the Neve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organization and released in 1973, the Galia melon was named after the developer's daughter, whose name means 'God's wave' in Hebrew.

Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galia_melon). - Mod.LL]
