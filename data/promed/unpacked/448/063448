Sad news on ProMED-mail about that apparent turtle disease off Palm Beach
County (as distinct from the nets and boats). It reminded me of something
about turtle farms in the Caymans in the 1970s that might help the people
grappling with the sick Florida turtles now.
In 1975 when I was in graduate school in Physiology at U Miami Med, a lab I
was temporarily working in that did neuromuscular electrophysiology was
sent a turtle with what had been dubbed "floppy flipper disease". The
turtle had basically lost muscle tone and, like the turtles now being
observed off Florida, went all floppy. It came from what were then the
fairly new marine turtle farms in the Cayman Islands -- I forget what
species. The farm owners had no idea what was wrong. As I recall we mostly
floundered about trying to figure out how to handle turtles. (Why it did
not go to a veterinary pathology department, I do not know; maybe other
samples did). We decided there was a block of some sort on neuromuscular
transmission, possibly due to a toxin. We guessed bacteria. I doubt we
contributed much to the problem, albeit not for lack of trying. But it
sounds like much the same syndrome that is afflicting the wild population
now. Perhaps the people who were running turtle farms in the Cayman Islands
then (whether these still exist I do not know) got some more useful help
then from other sources that would be of use to the Florida wildlife people
now.
