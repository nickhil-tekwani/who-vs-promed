Namibian scientists have found dangerous levels of bacteria in the
backwaters of the Zambezi River, where a mysterious and seemingly
fatal disease outbreak among fish was recently detected.
Fishermen in Katima Mulilo, Namibia, [map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=-17.5&lon=24.26&scale=2000000&icon=x>]
began reporting serious sores on fish in early October [2006], which
is thought to affect up to 4 out of every 5 fish caught.
Baffled scientists have sampled fish and water from areas where the
infection was reported, and tested them for pathogenic bacteria. The
results showed dangerously high levels of coliforms -- a group of
bacteria that indicate the presence of disease-causing microbes -- as
well as _E. coli_, which can be toxic and cause severe illness, at all sites.
They also found salmonella -- a deadly bacterium that causes food
poisoning and diarrhoea -- at one site.
The scientists suggest that sewage leaking into the river from the
Caprivi region in Namibia could have caused the high levels of
bacteria in the Zambezi. The river is Africa's 4th largest and runs
from Namibia into the Indian Ocean, supporting some 40 million people.
To protect people's health, Namibia has declared a raft of measures,
including a ban on fishing in the Zambezi from midnight today (21 Dec
2006) until 31 Jan 2007, pending the outcome of further laboratory tests.
The fisheries ministry will deploy 2 patrol boats to enforce the ban.
In Zambia, the main country through which the Zambezi runs, a ban was
not necessary as the fishing season does not start until 28 Feb 2007.
Zambia has also conducted tests but is yet to announce results.
In Botswana, a team of experts conducting tests in the Chobe
tributary, where fishing is not allowed as it is part of a national park.
The infection causes blisters and sores, and eats away at the fins
and tails of multiple fish species -- notably breams, minnows and
catfish -- eventually killing them, although the fatality rate is unknown.
"The fish samples from each site were analysed for bacteria and for
overall coliform," Abraham Iyambo, Namibia's fisheries minister said
at a briefing.
Safe levels of coliforms should not exceed 10 per 100 millilitres of
water, but the scientists detected coliform levels above 2419 per 100
millilitres in water at 4 backwater sites in Namibia: the Kasaya
Channel, Chobe River, Chisambilo Lake and the area between Mpukano
Channel and Nankuntwe.
Similarly, coliform levels in fish samples from the same areas were
exceedingly high.
Salmonella was also detected at Mpukano, while _E. coli_ was detected
at all the sites sampled, with particularly high levels at Mpukano
Channel and Nankuntwe.
Iyambo attributed the presence of the bacteria to leakage of sewage
systems, and suggested that the wounds seen on some infected fish
could be due to worms, such as roundworms and tape worms, that thrive
in sewage systems.
He said people were in danger of suffering from diarrhoea, typhoid,
amoebiasis, and schistosomiasis.
"We recommend to the community that water used for drinking purposes
should be boiled for at least 5 minutes or more," said lyambo,
advising people to cook food thoroughly and to only use deep latrines
to avoid further pollution.
He said other countries that share the Zambezi River would be
contacted over the matter.

[Coliforms, _E. coli_ or salmonellae are not known to this moderator
(who will gladly accept corrections from fish pathologists) as agents
of clinical disease in fish. The above microorganisms are, however,
notorious potential contaminants of fish and other seafood derived
from contaminated waters, challenging consumer health -- and public
health at large.
The etiology of the described pathological condition of fish remains
undiagnosed; further information, particularly results -- if
available -- from a specialised fish disease laboratory, are requested.
The above report includes a picture titled "An infected fish caught
in the Zambezi River has holes probably caused by worms." A previous
reportage on the same issue was published on 13 Dec 2006 by the same
source, titled "Deadly infection hits Zambezi fish", dealing with "as
yet unidentified infection among fish in backwaters of the Zambezi
River ... sparking fears that the disease could be transmitted to humans".
The report included another picture, "Infected fish caught in the
Zambezi river". See
<http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readnews&itemid=3281&language=1>.
Contributions from fish pathologists -- who are invited to take a
look at both pictures -- suggesting possible etiologies of the
described syndrome, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
