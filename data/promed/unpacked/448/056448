The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) has recorded an anthrax outbreak at its Mutare Farm Prison which officials said can manage to contain [sic]. The disease is said to have killed pigs at the farm prison.

ZPCS Manicaland spokesperson Mr Liberty Mhlanga said they discovered the outbreak at their farm some time 2 weeks ago. He said they took the affected pigs into quarantine in a bid to contain the outbreak. "We have recorded an anthrax case on [6 Feb 2019]," said Mhlanga. "The pig died but we have managed to contain the disease and issued a 30-day quarantine order to make sure the diseases will not be transmitted to other pigs."

Mr Mhlanga said they have not recorded any similar case or experience suspected cases relating to the disease. He said they have issued biosecurity measures and vaccinated all of their pigs. "We have managed to vaccinate all of our pigs and review our biosecurity measures of foot baths and spraying of all farm motor vehicles," he said.

[Pigs are moderately resistant to anthrax and reading between the lines of this report I suspect that they had a prior index case which was improperly handled -- maybe it was butchered and the pigs were fed the intestines -- at which point the prison authorities recognised the risks and took proper action. So far so good. Further spread was limited to just one quarantined pig.

The affected area of Mutare, Vumba, and Leopard Rock is on the eastern border of Manicaland with Mozambique; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_physio-2002.jpg and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/01/Mutare.html. It is south east of Harare. HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Manicaland province, Zimbabwe: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6341783,13882. - Mod.MHJ]
