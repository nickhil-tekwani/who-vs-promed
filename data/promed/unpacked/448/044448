Another 2 cases of COVID-19 reinfection have been reported after Hong Kong officials said a man had contracted the virus for a 2nd time.

Marc Van Ranst, a Belgium virologist who is director of the country's national coronavirus and rotavirus laboratories, told broadcaster NOS "it is not good news". The Belgium case involved a woman who became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 3 months after her initial diagnosis.

Whether people can be reinfected with the virus has been debated since the pandemic began at the end of last year [2019]. A number of people are thought to have had the virus twice, but in order to officially confirm this, laboratory tests need to show the person was infected with a slightly altered version of it. Without doing this, it is unclear whether a person's secondary infection was the result of reinfection, or whether it was the initial virus re-emerging.

Van Ranst said there was enough genetic evidence to show the woman had been infected for a 2nd time. "There are indeed enough differences to be able to speak of a different strain, a 2nd infection," he told the program Terzake. He said the patient only had mild complications, adding there are 2 more cases of possible reinfection now being investigated. "It is not good news," he said. "You hope you are out of harm's way. Hopefully, that is the case in most cases. The antibodies from the 1st time do not help enough to prevent the 2nd infection."

The case comes as Van Ranst said Brussels is experiencing a surge in new COVID-19 cases. He said it is one of the top 10 regions in Europe with the fastest-growing number of new cases. "The politicians of the Brussels-Capital Region should consider how they can either better enforce or tighten up the corona measures," he tweeted.

In the Netherlands, Marion Koopmans, a virologist who is Head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience, said an elderly patient had also been reinfected with the virus. "SARS-CoV-2 infections all have a different fingerprint, a genetic code," she told NOS. Koopmans said the case does not make her "nervous", but said "we need to see if it [reinfection] occurs more often". She said patients becoming reinfected was in line with expectations. "Respiratory infections can strike twice, or more often. We know that you are not protected for life if you have had the infection and that is what we expect with COVID-19. Just because you've built up antibodies doesn't mean you're immune."

The reinfection cases follow a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that said people can test positive for COVID-19 for 3 months after diagnosis. The agency's announcement followed news reports that suggested CDC had said people were immune from the disease for 3 months after infection. "The latest data simply suggest that retesting someone in the 3 months following initial infection is not necessary unless that person is exhibiting the symptoms of COVID-19 and the symptoms cannot be associated with another illness."

The 1st official reinfection case in Hong Kong was a man in his 30s who tested positive for the virus after visiting Spain, 4 .5 months after first getting COVID-19.

A re-infection with the coronavirus [SARS-C0V-2] has also been observed in the Netherlands, according to virologist Marion Koopmans in a response to news about this from Hong Kong yesterday [24 Aug 2020], where a man appears to have been infected twice with the coronavirus.

In the Netherlands, the case concerns an elderly patient with an impaired immune system, reports Koopmans, one of the most important advisers to the World Health Organization and the cabinet. "SARS-CoV-2 infections all have a different fingerprint, a genetic code," says Koopmans. "People can carry something with them for a long time after an infection and occasionally secrete a little RNA." That is the genetic material of these types of viruses. For an official recontamination, she says, researchers must be able to demonstrate that the codes of that RNA differ. This appears to be the case with patients in Hong Kong and the Netherlands.

In Belgium, a reinfection with the coronavirus also came to light today [25 Aug 2020]. This concerns a woman in Leuven, who 3 months after the 1st time, became infected again with SARS-CoV-2. The virus has also been genetically identified here at both times, says Belgian virologist Marc Van Ranst in the current affairs program Terzake. "There are indeed enough differences to be able to speak of a different strain, a 2nd infection."

Danger zone
"It is not good news," says the virologist. "You hope that you are out of harm's way. Hopefully, that is the case in most cases." It is still unclear, according to him, whether the reinfections are exceptions. "There are already 2, there may be more now." The Belgian patient would have had mild complaints. "Then your body produces fewer antibodies. The antibodies from the 1st time do not help enough to prevent the 2nd infection," says Van Ranst.

Koopmans does not want to comment on the complaints of the Dutch patient. According to Koopmans, it was in line with expectations that patients would turn up with reinfections. This is more common with respiratory infections. It has also been discussed before at WHO. "But there was no evidence for it so far."

Victims of a reinfection may simply be more susceptible to the virus, says Van Ranst. "But maybe there are many more people who can go through reinfection after 6 or 7 months."

Strike 2, 3 times
"Respiratory infections can strike twice, or more often. We know that you are not protected for life if you have had the infection and that is what we expect with COVID-19," says Koopmans. The big question now is: how long does the average immunity last. Koopmans also sees that there are large differences in the amount of antibodies that people have built up after infection. This is evident from blood from donors. People who had more severe complaints often have more antibodies than people with mild complaints. "Just because you've built up antibodies doesn't mean you're immune."

Clear immune response
She says she does see that people have a clear immune response after an infection. "We expect that this will provide protection against a subsequent infection. So the only question is how long that protection will last. I don't get nervous that someone [shows up] with a [re-infection]," says Koopmans. Certainly not if, as in the Dutch case, it concerns someone with reduced resistance. "We have to investigate these cases carefully and see if it occurs more often." This can be done by following a larger group of patients for a longer period of time and examining whether they have re-infections. "Then we have to see what genetic code those viruses have."

A Wisconsin [USA] patient has been reinfected with the coronavirus, according to health officials. The La Crosse County Health Department made the announcement Tuesday [4 Aug 2020]. Health officials said the patient tested positive more than 3 months after 1st contracting the virus.

Scientists studying the virus have yet to report a case that was confirmed to be a reinfection and not a flare-up of a previous infection. CDC last month [July 2020] said there had been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 reinfection, but scientists continue to investigate the possibility. Health experts said people were likely suffering from the same illness or the tests detected remnants of the original infection. There's also the chance tests could have been false positives.

Health officials in La Crosse County said the patient's symptoms were not the same the 2nd time around. Health officials have not released any additional details on the patient who tested positive for a 2nd time. So far, in Milwaukee County, there haven't been any reported COVID-19 reinfection cases but a doctor at Froedtert Hospital said that might just show how little is known about it.

"In 3 months, I'm sure we're going to have a much better idea about what this means," said Dr Mary Beth Graham of Froedtert Hospital & Medical College of Wisconsin. Froedtert's medical director of infection prevention said a COVID-19 reinfection would be an especially troubling omen for efforts to develop an effective vaccine. "It does cause a lot of angst for all of us thinking about, 'Well, what does that mean for a vaccine?' Because if you give a vaccine, how long-lived is the immunity from a vaccine going to be?" Graham said.

[I suspect in the coming days there will be more reports of suspected 2nd infections now that there have been these announcements. The case in the Netherlands is in an immunocompromised individual so it is not surprising nor is it worrisome. The case in Hong Kong, and perhaps the case in Belgium signal the importance of addressing these possible 2nd infections in a rigorous manner, sequencing the 2 viruses, and ruling out mutations from prolonged infection. Many questions need addressing, especially duration of viral secretion in 2nd infection to assess contribution to continuing chains of transmission. - Mod.MPP

See PRO/AH/EDR> COVID-19 update (373): Hong Kong 2nd infection, plasma therapy, WHO, global 20200825.7712987, which raises important questions about these 2nd infections. The patient from the Netherlands is an elderly person with a weakened immune system, which would allow for a 2nd infection more easily than if s/he were someone capable of a strong immune response. The patient from Belgium had a very mild infection the 1st time, then was re-exposed after 3 months when the immunity she built up might have been waning. It has been observed that coronavirus antibodies peak at about 20-30 days after symptom onset, and then decline. Furthermore, they tend to decline more rapidly in individuals who were asymptomatic or had mild forms of the disease. These findings have serious implications for vaccine development and how often a booster may be needed if the 2nd infections can be severe. But these 2nd infections are likely not to be severe since T cell and B cell immunity would still be present even if antibody levels are low. A healthy immune system should be able to control viral replication to prevent serious symptoms from recurring. - Mod.LK]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111 070 confirmed cases and 8433 deaths as of August 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied 2 superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same 2 events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into Massachusetts early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.

[This study was able to identify superspreading event (a large international conference at the end of February 2020) which involved cases in Massachusetts, elsewhere in the USA (Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas), internationally (Australia, Sweden, and Slovakia) and in widespread communities in Virginia, Australia, and Michigan. A previously mentioned outbreak in homeless shelters is discussed as well as an outbreak in a skilled nursing facility.

The authors concluded: "Through dense sampling of the early phase of the epidemic we show the frequency of importation events -- over 80 independent introductions -- and the impact of early superspreading events in driving amplification and community transmission, likely accelerating the transition from containment to mitigation strategies.

"Besides a better understanding of outbreak dynamics, viral sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis can also provide immediately actionable insights. In the current study, we were able to rule out linked nosocomial spread in 2 episodes, reassuring hospital management that a failure of infection control practice in these wards had not led to a nosocomial cluster, and showed that despite multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into a SNF [skilled nursing facility], one introduction was responsible for 90% of cases. Real-time genomic epidemiology may be increasingly valuable as schools and workplaces navigate the challenges of reopening, as it can help distinguish between local outbreaks within institutions and introductions from outside." - Mod.MPP

This large study illustrates the importance of sequencing virus stains in order to understand the epidemiology of COVID and how SARS-CoV-2 spreads. Without this information, it is difficult to develop accurate models and determine the most efficacious approach to control.]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug25_1598403577.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 47.0% of daily case numbers and 54.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.5 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate with Peru, Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico very active as well.

- The European region reported 9.9% of daily case numbers and 8.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.0 million. Russia still dominates followed by France, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, UK, Israel, and Italy. Spain, Kazakhstan, and Belgium did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.1% of daily case numbers and 10.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Oman, and Libya. Lebanon continues to have increased cases as does the Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 3.0% of daily case numbers and 4.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than 1.0 million cases. Ethiopia has taken over the dominant role followed by South Africa, Algeria, Nigeria, Botswana, Rwanda, Cameroon, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.8% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.46 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 31.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 22.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.6 million cases. India continues to dominate, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal. Indonesia did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 25 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (66873), followed by Brazil (46 959), and the USA (40 098) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.5%). There were 6230 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Iraq, France, and Philippines. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 2912 to 66 873. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Spain, Iran, Israel, Ukraine, Venezuela, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Turkey, and their range of reported new cases is 1502 to 2545. A total of 27 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 2.7%), while daily reported deaths have remained virtually the same (an increase of 0.55%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
