There are 3 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne illness eastern equine encephalitis in Michigan residents, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS].

The suspected cases are in residents from Kalamazoo and Berrien counties.

As of [26 Aug 2019], 6 cases of EEE have been confirmed in horses in Barry, Kalamazoo, and St Joseph counties. None of the horses were vaccinated against EEE and all animals died. An EEE vaccine is available to horses but not people. Additionally, 2 deer in Barry and Cass counties were diagnosed with EEE.

"Mosquito-borne diseases can cause long-term health effects in people and even death," said Dr Mary Grace Stobierski, MDHHS state public health veterinarian and manager of the Zoonotic and Emerging Infectious Diseases Section. "These cases, along with confirmed cases in horses and deer in the state, stress the importance of taking precautions against mosquito bites."

Signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, body, and joint aches.

EEE disease can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma and death may also occur in some cases.

Residents can follow these steps to avoid mosquito bites:
- apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved products to exposed skin and clothing;
- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites;
- maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside;
- empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home like buckets, unused kiddie pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs;
- use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development recommends that residents protect their horses by:
- talking to their veterinarian about vaccinating horses against the disease;
- using fans in barns and bringing horses indoors from early evening until after sunrise when mosquitoes are most prevalent;
- using an approved insect repellent on the animals;
- contacting a veterinarian if your animal shows signs of illness.

[An additional 26 Aug 2019 report indicated that there is one confirmed human case as well as the 3 suspected cases mentioned above (https://www.wndu.com/content/news/People-horses-deer-infected-with-mosquito-borne-disease-in-SW-Michigan-558344901.html).

This summer [2019], EEE virus transmission season has been an active one in the USA, now with one confirmed and 3 suspected human cases in Michigan. Prior to these 3 human cases this year (2019), all of the EEE cases in Michigan posted on ProMED-mail have been in horses with 2 cases of EEE confirmed in horses in Kalamazoo and St Joseph counties. Neither horse was vaccinated against EEE, and both animals have died. There is an EEE vaccine available for horses, but not for people. The southwestern region of the state has experienced outbreaks of this mosquito-borne disease in horses and people in the past, with the most recent outbreaks occurring in the early 1980s, mid-1990s, and 2010. The chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health urges Michigan residents to take precautions and protect themselves from mosquito bites.
