Hello Skip,
I am not aware of any "list of experts" but I can give you a few
names.
The prion experts in USA that you refer to are at University of
California, San Fransico, and the key figure there is Stanley B
Prusiner, of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics.
The leading independent (i.e. non-governmental) experts in the UK are
those who serve on the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
(SEAC).
I can give you names and locations but not detailed addresses.
The chairman is John Pattinson, professor of clinical microbiology and
dean of the medical school and faculty of clinical sciences at
University College Hospital, London. Other members are
Jeffrey Almond, professor of microbiology, University of Reading
Ray Bradley, animal pathologist, and chairman of the EU Scientific
Veterinary Committee (his location is not known by me)[ try the CVL,
New Haw, Weybridge, Surrey, England. MH-J]
John Collinge, professor and head of the prion diseases group, St
May's Hospital, London
Robert Will, professor and consultant neurologist, Western General
Hospital, Edinburgh (he is vice-chaiman of SEAC, and director of the
CGD Surveillance Unit at Edinburgh).
Fred Brown, head of virology research at the Wellcome Foundation
Ingrid Allen, professor of neuropathology, Queens University, Belfast
William Watson, former director of the Central Veterinary Laboratory
(CVL) of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food.
Many of the Government experts and researchers are at CVL, (New Haw,
Weybridge, Surrey)
A great deal of BSE-related research in the UK is carried out at the
Institute of Animal Health (one of the research institutes under the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council).

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a chronic degenerative
disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle. The disease was
first diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain. The British sometimes call BSE
"mad cow disease," a term that could be confused with rabies in cattle if
used in the United States.
BSE has had a substantial impact on the British livestock industry.
The disease also has been confirmed in domestic cattle in Ireland, France,
Portugal, and Switzerland and in cattle exported from England to Oman, the
Falkland Islands, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
is enforcing import restrictions and is conducting surveillance for BSE to
ensure that this serious disease does not become established in the United
States.
Clinical Signs
Cattle affected by BSE experience a progressive degeneration of the
nervous system. Affected animals may display changes in temperament, such as
nervousness or aggression; abnormal posture; incoordination and difficulty
in rising; decreased milk production; or loss of body weight despite continued
appetite. Affected cattle die. The causative agent of the disease is not
completely characterized, and there is no treatment.
The incubation period (the time from when an animal becomes infected
until it first shows disease signs) is from 2 to 8 years. Following the onset
of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until it either dies or
is destroyed. This usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months. Most cases in
England have occurred in dairy cows between 3 and 5 years of age.
Currently, there is no test to detect the disease in a live animal;
veterinary pathologists confirm BSE by postmortem microscopic examination of
brain tissue. BSE is so named because of the spongy appearance of the brain
tissue of infected cattle when sections are examined under a microscope.

Related Diseases
BSE is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).
TSE's are caused by similiar uncharacterized agents that produce spongiform
changes in the brain. Specific types of TSE's include: scrapie, which affects
sheep and goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy; feline spongiform
encephalopathy; chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk; and kuru,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, three
rare diseases in humans. Other cases of spongiform encephalopathies have been
reported in Great Britain in kudus, an eland, a nyala, and a gemsbok.
Although there is no direct evidence of a link between BSE and CJD, a
recent evaluation of 10 CJD cases in Great Britain identified a new variant of
this disease. The most likely explanation is that these cases may be linked to
exposure to BSE before the introduction of a specified bovine offal (SBO) ban
at slaughter in 1989. The SBO ban excluded brain, spinal cord, and other organs
with potential BSE from human consumption. Because of growing concern about
BSE, USDA epidemiologists are carefully monitoring all new scientific data
about TXE's from around the world.
Epidemiology
There are different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of BSE.
The epidemiologic data suggests that BSE in England may have been caused by
feeding cattle rendered protein produced from the carcasses of scrapie-
infected sheep [Now known to be unlikely]. An alternate theory is that BSE
had existed in undetectable levels in the British cattle population prior to
1986. The practice of using products such as meat and bonemeal in cattle
rations as a source of protein has been common for several decades. Scrapie
has a long incubation period--up to 60 months--and has been endemic in Great
Britain for centuries. Changes in rendering operations in the early 1980's--
particularly the removal of a solvent-extraction process that included a
steam-heat treatment--may have played a part in the appearance of the disease
and the large number of cases that developed.
There is no evidence that BSE spreads from unrelated cattle to cattle or
from cattle to other species by contact. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that
maternal transmission is rare if it occurs at all.
The extremely small infectious agent responsible for BSE and scrapie,
although not completely characterized, has been theoretically classified as a
"slow virus," a "prion," or a "virino." This agent is extremely resistant to
heat and to normal sterilization processes. It also does not evoke a detectable
immune response or inflammatory reaction in host animals.
The BSE agent has been found only in brain tissue and the spinal cords of
cattle naturally affected with BSE. In an experimental study of the disease's
biological route of development in cattle, traces of the BSE agent were detected
in the small intestines and retina of calves that had been fed large doses of
material from BSE-infected animals. Evaluation of the presence of the BSE agent
in tissues is complicated by the lack of a definitive laboratory test. Failure
to identify the agent in tissues may indicate either a true absence of the
agent or simply a decreased sensitivity of current diagnostic methods.
History
During the period from November 1986 (when BSE was first identified as a
separate disease entity) until December 1995, an estimated 155,600 head of
cattle in almost 33,000 herds were diagnosed with BSE in Great Britain. The
epidemic peaked in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week.
Agricultural officials in Great Britain have taken a series of actions to
eradicate BSE, including making BSE a notifiable disease, prohibiting the
inclusion of ruminant-derived proteins in ruminant feed, and destroying all
animals showing signs of BSE.
As a result of these actions, the rate of newly reported cases of BSE is
decreasing. Currently, fewer than 300 cases are occurring per week.
USDA Actions in Response to BSE
To prevent BSE from entering the United States, APHIS has restricted the
importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from countries where BSE
is known to exist. Other products derived from ruminants, such as fetal bovine
serum, bonemeal, meat and bonemeal, bloodmeal, offal, fats, and glands, also
cannot be imported into the United States from these countries, except under a
special permit for scientific research purposes.
As part of increased surveillance for BSE, APHIS veterinarians are
tracing 499 head of cattle imported from Great Britain between 1981 and 1989
(before the ban on imports went into effect) to check their health status. As
of January 1995, 464 of the animals had been accounted for, and no signs of BSE
had been found. Efforts continue to trace the 35 remaining cattle.
In addition to international importation restrictions, APHIS has
increased surveillance efforts to detect BSE if it is accidentally introduced
into the United States. More than 250 APHIS and State veterinarians specially
trained to diagnose foreign animal diseases regularly conduct field
investigations of suspicious disease conditions.
APHIS veterinary pathologists and field investigators also have received
training from their British counterparts for diagnosing BSE. These
pathologists examine brain tissue from cattle over 2 years of age that show
signs of neurological disease.
APHIS leads an interagency effort to coordinate surveillance for BSE.
Officials of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service notify APHIS of cattle
exhibiting neurological signs at slaughter. State diagnostic laboratories and
public health officials also submit the brains of rabies-negative cattle
to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA, for
testing. More than 60 veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United
States are participating in the BSE Surveillance Program along with NVSL. As
of December 1995, nearly 2,660 specimens from 43 States had been received, and
no evidence of BSE had been seen.

Welcome to BSE-L, Michael.

The ruminant feed hypothesis is not limited to sheep remains but includes
recycled cattle remains.
It is almost certainly multi-factorial, and you may well be right that
cattle remains is an important factor. However, the important point is
that the banning of ruminant feed seems to be working, and it is not merely
"an end to amplification of the epidemic", but a dramatic reduction in new
cases (30 percent drop from 1993 to 1994, 40 percent drop from 1994 to 1995,
and 27.5 percent drop in 1996 so far compared with the same period in 1995).

Injection may well produce different results from the oral route, and, in
view of the difference between scrapie infective agent and the BSE
infective agent, the results from a single oral passage of scrapie through
cattle would be unlikely to be definitive.

Incidentally, there are some who speculate that the oral route may not have
been the route (or not the only route), and that infected ruminant dust may
have been absorbed through the eye and direct to the brain. I am not aware
of any research to establish whether that was the case.
