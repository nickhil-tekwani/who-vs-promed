Los Angeles County health officials said Tuesday [15 Feb 2011] that
the number of people who have fallen ill after a 4-day conference that
culminated in a fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion has reached 200, and
that investigators have focused on the Playboy event as they look for
the cause of the sickness.

The possible outbreak of legionellosis, or Pontiac fever, affected
people connected with the DOMAINfest Global Conference, "with symptoms
mostly consisting of fever, chills, general discomfort (malaise) and
some cough," according to a statement by the county Department of
Public Health.

More than 700 people from 30 countries attended the conference held
at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel and Bungalows in Santa Monica 1-3 Feb
2011.

"The department is currently focusing its investigation on the social
event that occurred at the Playboy Mansion, Holmby Hills, on 3 Feb
2011," the statement said, noting that, "Public Health has not yet
determined that exposure is limited to a specific source from that
event. There is no information suggesting that there is a risk of
ongoing infection or that this outbreak extends beyond those
individuals associated with this conference."

Many of those sickened after the conference have fully recovered,
according to the statement, and they may not have suffered the same
illness. "We are considering several possible causes of illness for
this suspected outbreak," said Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, the county's
public health director.

"Not everyone with reported symptoms is likely to have the same
illness, because a number of respiratory infections with similar
symptoms are circulating," Fielding said. "We are working diligently
to identify the causes, which may include viruses, bacteria or
irritants." Teri Thomerson, a Playboy spokeswoman, released a
statement Tuesday saying, "The Playboy Mansion continues to fully
cooperate with the Department of Public Health in their
investigation." She did not respond to further e-mails or phone
calls.

The department was notified last Friday [11 Feb 2011] of a "suspected
respiratory infection outbreak" among those associated with the
conference for technology professionals in the domain name industry.
The state Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and surrounding county health departments have
been providing assistance to county health officials.

Pontiac fever is not contagious, and most symptoms disappear in 2 to
5 days, according to the CDC. Legionnaires' disease is a type of
pneumonia that usually responds to antibiotics, although 5 percent to
30 percent of cases prove fatal, according to the CDC. A statement the
department sent to conference attendees Friday noted that some at the
conference had developed pneumonia.

Mason Cole, a spokesman for DOMAINfest organizer Oversee.net,
encouraged conference attendees to get tested. "If you haven't been in
touch with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and you
were a guest at one of these events, you should get in touch, even if
you're healthy," said Cole. "At this stage, we're just trying to help
the doctors figure out what this is. "There's so much speculation
about what caused this, but we don't have any facts."

Los Angeles County public health officials have identified
_Legionella_ bacteria, which cause Legionnaires' disease, at a water
source at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in its investigation of
the source of illness that sickened people after a fundraiser earlier
this month [February 2011].

Public health officials have suspected Legionnaires' disease in the
outbreak, a disease spread by bacteria that causes respiratory
illness, such as a cough, and malaise, chills and fever.

Officials, however, have not ruled out other bacteria or viruses,
because _Legionella_ bacteria are commonly found in moist
environments, Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of the county Department
of Public Health, said in a statement.

Health officials have said that the people fell ill after they
attended DomainFest's 1-3 Feb 2011 conference, which culminated with a
fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion in the Holmby Hills area of Los
Angeles. DomainFest released a statement Tuesday [1 Mar 2011] that
urged those who attended the 3 Feb 2011 fundraising event at the
Playboy Mansion to fill out a confidential survey to assist health
officials with their investigation.

The name of Legionnaires' disease stems from its discovery in 1976
when attendees of an American Legion convention in Philadelphia became
sick with the bacteria and developed pneumonia. About 8000 to 18 000
people are hospitalized with the disease every year in the United
States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Healthy people usually recover from the bacterial disease, which can
[be] treated with antibiotics, but death can occur in 5 percent to 30
percent of cases, the CDC said.

[The number of persons attending the "Domainfest" conference who
developed an illness consisting of fever, chills, malaise and coughing
has increased from 80 to 200 since the last ProMED post on this
outbreak (see ProMED post Legionellosis - USA: (CA) conference, susp
20110214.0494). The illness was said to have developed within 48 hours
after the conference attendees left an event at the Los Angeles
Playboy Mansion. Legionellosis was initially suspected to be the cause
of the illness. However, because _Legionella_ bacteria, the cause of
legionellosis, can be commonly found in a building's water supplies
without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the mere presence of
this organism in the water supply is not sufficient proof that this is
the source of an outbreak. Additional information is necessary.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease; about 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis
that is much less severe than Legionnaires' disease. The incubation
period for Legionnaires' disease is 2-14 days after exposure and for
Pontiac fever, 24-48 hours after exposure, and the attack rate (per
cent of persons who become ill after exposure to the source of an
outbreak) for Legionnaires' disease is less than 5 per cent and for
Pontiac fever, can be greater than 90 per cent
(<http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/top10.htm>).

From the 1st news release above, apparently some of the conference
attendees who developed pneumonia were suspected as having
Legionnaires' disease, while the others were suspected as having
Pontiac fever. The short incubation period, high attack rate of a
febrile, non-fatal, non-pneumonic illness is consistent with an
outbreak of Pontiac fever among persons exposed to a common source
(<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/229.full>). While
_Legionella_ can be isolated from respiratory secretions inpatients
with Legionnaires' disease, _Legionella_ are virtually never isolated
from patients with Pontiac fever
(<http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/top10.htm>), and tests for urinary
_Legionella_ antigen, which are usually positive in patients with
Legionnaires' disease, may be negative in patients with Pontiac fever.


The diagnosis of Pontiac fever is usually confirmed by development of
antibodies to the _Legionella_ isolated from an environmental source
in a significant fraction of affected people exposed to the suspected
source. Similarly, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease can also be
confirmed by the development of antibodies to the _Legionella_
isolated from an environmental source. We await the results of
diagnostic testing of conference attendees.

Also, because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without
linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be
demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates
with that of any clinical isolates to assure frequently costly
corrective measures are carried out on the actual source
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/>; and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

The "Domainfest" conference was held at the Fairmont Hotel in Santa
Monica California, 31 Jan - 4 Feb 2011; over 700 Internet
professionals attended from 30 countries
(<http://www.domainfest.com/>). On the evening of 3 Feb 2011, a
"fundraising" dinner party was held at the Playboy Mansion West for
Jenny McCarthy's Generation Rescue Autism Foundation for attendees of
"Domainfest"
(<http://www.domainfest.com/agenda>). The Playboy Mansion is located
in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, California, west of Santa
Monica (for a map, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmby_Hills,_Los_Angeles>). Buses
transported conferees between the Playboy Mansion and the Santa Monica
Fairmont Hotel
