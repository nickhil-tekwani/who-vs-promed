A report in mid-October from Irian Jaya said that the Jayawijaya authority
had confirmed that the disease that took 31 lives and infected tens of
others was cerebral malaria, not meningitis as previously suspected.
Also: "A missionary ... reported that since August tens of residents of the 3
villages (Lolat, Weawen and Kabianggama) were suffering [from a] mysterious
disease. Five people have been evacuated by air to Wamena hospital."
[It is quite common for outbreaks of sudden death in the tropics to turn
out to have been due to cerebral malaria.
The outbreak affected Papuans on the border between Papua New Guinea and
Irian Jaya. Can any of our readers in Irian Jaya confirm that the
villages mentioned here are near the border? - Mod.JW]

A major news wire reported that 6 medical officers had arrived in Yapsie,
West Sepik province, PNG, to investigate the outbreak of the unknown
disease. According to Gerry Poivi, the provincial administrator, there was
concern that the disease may have come across the border from Irian Jaya.
In addition to the 19 deaths reported earlier, there were 32 other cases,
some seriously ill.
The medical investigative team will return to Yapsie on Friday [today]. In
the meantime, communication between the provincial office and the remote
villages was not expected
