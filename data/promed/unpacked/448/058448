ANTHRAX - AUSTRALIA (03): (NEW SOUTH WALES) PRIOR OUTBREAKS IN 2012

The most recent previous bovine cases in NSW were on single properties in each of the Condobolin (1 death) and Molong (3 deaths) districts in December 2012. These have been reported in the Animal Health Surveillance Quarterly; 17(4) -- in press). The previous bovine case (1 death) before that was in 2009 as reported in ProMED-mail.

The occurrence of anthrax in cattle as compared to sheep is of no particular significance in the Australian context. The species affected is simply determined by the stock being run on the affected property.

The properties affected in the current incident are within the so-called historical 'anthrax belt' where the disease is not unexpected. In Australia, there is no epidemiological evidence to suggest a role for horse flies in transmission of anthrax.

[The Australian anthrax cases for the latter half of 2013 have yet to be posted on the OIE WAHID website (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail). Condobolin can be found at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/02/Condobolin.html and Molong at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/02/Molong.html. These 2 farms are within the eastern border of the NSW 'anthrax belt' and to the west of Sidney. OIE lists in WAHID a prior sheep outbreak in NSW in January 2012 in which 30 sheep died.

I wish the comparative epidemiology of ovine and bovine anthrax were as straightforward as our contributor holds. While there are many problems persuading owners to vaccinate cattle, sheep vaccination is markedly more difficult as the individual value of a sheep is slight compared to that of a cow. Similarly in reporting deaths, early sheep deaths are frequently ignored until there may be more than 30 dead animals whereas cattle deaths get reported in the low single digits, 1-4 or so. Both situations ensure ground recontamination. This is complicated in 3rd world countries by sheep flocks being managed by women, while men manage cattle. Women's valid concerns are not infrequently ignored.

In our review of the ecology of _Bacillus anthracis_, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2009.08.003, we discuss the parts played by blow flies and biting flies. There are many papers in the literature back into the 19th century on the active part played by tabanid biting flies in the epidemiology of this disease. The only time I have seen an absence of activity is when [1] the initial reporting is very rapid and control is quick; or [2] in winter and in times of drought when there is an absence of flies; and [3] when the local wind speed is more than 3.3 m/sec. I think that this topic needs revisiting in NSW. - Mod.MHJ]
