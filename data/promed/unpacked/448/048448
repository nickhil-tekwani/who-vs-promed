Cholera claims 10 in Guinea
----------------------------
An outbreak of cholera has killed at least 10 people out of 30
recorded cases in central Guinea, health officials said on Fri, 17
Sep 2004. The outbreak, which has been contained, affected primarily
children and the elderly, a doctor, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told AFP from the town of Pita, 400 km northeast of the
capital. Medicine was swiftly dispatched to the area, and the most
severe cases were taken to hospital in Conakry in a bid to determine
the origins of the outbreak.
Cholera has made a resurgence this year owing to heavy rains across
the region that have helped to spread the water-borne bacterial
illness. Guinea's southern neighbor Sierra Leone has been battling
its own deadly cholera outbreak, the 1st in the war-ravaged country
in more than 4 years, but health officials there said last week that
it appears to have been brought under control. More than 60 people
have died since early August 2004, mostly in and around the capital
Freetown, where the already decrepit sanitation system was
overwhelmed by more than a month of torrential rain that sent raw
sewage seeping into the streets.
Western Guinea was hit by a cholera outbreak in June of 2003, which
claimed 83 lives from 183 reported cases.

[2] Cholera (Sierra Leone)

Cholera Infects 237 in Freetown
--------------------------------
The outbreak of cholera has created a worrisome situation in
Freetown, the capital of the West African state of Sierra Leone.
Many have died and many have been treated in hospitals. The medical
officer -in-charge of the Government Hospital at Rokupa in the East
of the outskirts of Freetown, Dr. Alhaji Sayni Turay says they have
treated 237 cholera cases and 15 death cases of the pandemic.
He further reveals that at the initial stage of the cholera outbreak,
they were receiving a large number of cholera related cases, but now
the number is fluctuating. The establishment of a health unit at
Turntable in Freetown might be the cause of a decrease in the number
of such cases at their hospital, he observed. Dr. Turay attributes
the cause of infection to contaminated food and water, and suggests
that they should be properly taken care of.

[3] Dysentery - Sudan (Darfur)

Up to 10 000 people, many of them children, are dying each month from
disease and violence in Darfur camps, despite an international aid
effort, the World Health Organization said. The study was carried out
by the WHO and the Sudanese government.
Dysentery was the leading cause of death, but violence was also
significant, although the survey did not go into detail on the nature
of the violence. The United States has accused the Sudanese
government of condoning genocide in Darfur by not halting Arab
militia attacks against African tribes.

Alert out against cholera
-------------------------
The Baguio City Health Office has advised residents to watch out
against cholera due to the alarming rise in cases.
Cholera is a disease caused by eating food or drinking water
contaminated with human waste. Signs and symptoms of the disease
include the sudden onset of frequent painless watery stool, vomiting,
rapid dehydration as manifested by sunken eyeballs, wrinkled and dry
skin.
"In extreme cases, cholera is a rapidly fatal disease. A healthy
individual may die within 2-3 days if no treatment is provided,"
health officials warned.
Cholera can be prevented by drinking only potable water, keeping food
away from insects, washing and cooking food properly, proper waste
disposal and proper use of toilet and keeping surroundings clean to
prevent flies and other insects and rodents from breeding.

Dysentery subsides in Russia Sverdlovsk region
----------------------------------------------
A dysentery outbreak in the town of Krasnoturinsk in Russia's
Sverdlovsk region is receding. 9 people have been discharged from
hospital over the past 24 hours, sources from the regional center of
the Russian emergencies ministry told Tass on Thu, 16 Sep 2004. A
total of 109 people, including 60 children, are still hospitalized.
The infection outbreak began in Krasnoturinsk a few days ago and
expanded to the nearby city of Karpinsk, where 15 people were
diagnosed with dysentery and hospitalized.
An official of the regional sanitary and epidemiological inspection
told Itar-Tass that infection originated at Krasnoturinsk's dairy
factory. A dysentery-causing bacillus was found both in raw and
pasteurized milk, the Sverdlovsk region's deputy chief sanitarian
Viktor Romanenko said on Wed, 15 Sep 2004.
He said infected milk, sour cream and cottage cheese had been already
delivered to shops in nearby cities, and a significant part of the
products had been sold before sanitary services interfered. The
incubation period of dysentery varies from 2 to 14 days, and new
cases are bound to be registered in the coming days, medics said.
[The finding of bacteria in pasteurized milk suggests either
post-pasteurization contamination or an inadequate pasteurization
process, although with heavy contamination, this can occur without
these factors. - Mod.LL]
