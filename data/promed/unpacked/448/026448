Rabies (human, fatal) - Russia (Samara oblast)
----------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists in the Samara Oblast [region] have expressed concern about
the number of people who have been bitten by foxes. Since the beginning of
this year 5000 people have sought medical treatment as a result of animal
bites.

The regional deputy of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer
Affairs and Human Welfare] and the chief epidemiologist of the regional
Ministry of Health have advised that recreational trips in forest areas
during this summer [2010] might be dangerous because the province is in a
focus of an epidemic of rabies in foxes. They have drawn attention to a
fatal case of a 27 year old man who contracted rabies as a consequence of
skinning a dead fox. He had not received anti-rabies vaccination.

Out of the 5000 people who this year [2010] have sought medical treatment
as a consequence of animal bites a total of 272 have [unwisely] declined
rabies vaccination.
