Dr De Barro said the [Japanese encephalitis, JE) virus was normally detected across the Northern Territory [NT], Queensland, and the Torres Strait, but recent wet conditions had created a perfect storm for the virus to also spread into New South Wales and Victoria.

JEV is an exotic virus to Australia. JEV is not normally detected in the Northern Territory and is only detected periodically in Queensland, specifically Cape York and the Torres Strait.

JEV genotype 4 was first detected in the NT in January 2021. JEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been previously detected in the Torres Strait and Cape York in 1995 and 2000.

[Dr Weir is thanked for providing this additional information about JE virus in Australia.

Since JE virus genotypes 1, 2, and 4 have been found in Australia at different times, it seems clear that there has been sporadic arrival of these viruses in the past and there are likely to be new arrivals in the future. The means of arrival of the virus into mainland Australia has not been established but is likely via infected migratory birds. It will be interesting to see if the latest introduced JE virus in Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria states has become or will become established in these localities. The vector mosquito is present in all of them. - Mod.TY
