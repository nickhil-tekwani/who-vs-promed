A Comment on the Hepatitis A Childcare Center Outbreak in New
Zealand: Experience in Canada
-----------------------------------------------
In Middlesex-London, Ontario, Canada, we had a outbreak involving
childcare centers in 2004. The outbreak spread from a kindergarten
class to one childcare center to a 2nd childcare center through
infected children who were in more than one aggregate childcare
setting and were asymptomatic. The outbreak spanned a 6-month period,
with 15 laboratory-confirmed cases and at least 3 or 4 unconfirmed
cases. Despite vaccinating the other children in the group setting
and their household contacts, the outbreak continued to propagate. It
finally stopped after we took the following approach in relation to
the last childcare center to be affected:
All children in the affected childcare center were considered cases
(whether they were symptomatic or not, and whether they were tested
or not). The contacts of these children and family members of some of
these contacts were offered hepatitis A vaccination. This included
all household contacts of children who attended the childcare center;
all childcare providers for the children, both in the childcare
center and in other settings; children and staff members at other
childcare centers that these children attended, and family members of
these children; and classmates and teachers in the school that these
children attended, and family members of these children.
It took a lot of vaccination, but finally the outbreak was stopped.

[A nice demonstration of the efficacy of hepatitis A vaccine during
an outbreak. Our thanks to Dr. Warshawshky for sharing this with us.
