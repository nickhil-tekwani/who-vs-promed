[1] Case update
- Sat 16 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation 15 Jun 2018, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=1c551f89c3

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 15 Jun 2018:
- A total of 57 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable and 5 suspected.
- 5 new suspected cases in Bikoro.
- 6 samples were negative.
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola Virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic.
- No deaths reported 15 Jun 2018 [28 deaths reported to date].
- No new cases confirmed.

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.

The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 2920 people have been vaccinated, including 822 in Mbandaka, 726 in Bikoro, 1290 in Iboko, 77 in Ingende and 5 in Kinshasa.

In the field
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, is back in the field. This time, he decided to travel between Mbandaka, Bikoro and Itipo by car and not by helicopter. Traveling by car will allow the minister to see how the people and teams of the Ministry of Health live daily and move from one village to another as part of the response. He will return to Mbandaka this Mon 18 Jun 2018.

[Certainly, travel by helicopter is rapid and useful to transport one to a particular location, but it does not permit interaction with people in communities bypassed while in the air. Travel by car or motorbike, in contrast, allows one to check out rural communities along the route. But the conditions of the roads have been described as either barely passable or very primitive at best, likely making it difficult to cover much ground during a limited period of time, if a car can even get through at all. Nonetheless, it is admirable that the Minister of Health is reaching out to make contact with people in these remote communities, getting there one way or another.

Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola outbreak: The Red Cross and Red Crescent Response Plan infographic
--------
The current Ebola outbreak is happening in 3 health zones in Democratic Republic of the Congo's Equateur Province: Wangata, Bikoro, and Iboko. This revised Emergency Appeal will support 400 000 of the most vulnerable people in these areas for 6 months and will also undertake preparedness and prevention work in Equateur's 4 neighbouring provinces.

Snapshot
The outbreak was confirmed on 8 May 2018. By 14 Jun 2018, 66 cases -- 38 confirmed as Ebola Virus disease -- had been reported, and 28 people had died.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are working to support the DRC Red Cross response to the outbreak.

Our Red Cross and Red Crescent Response Plan focuses on epidemic control: community-based surveillance and contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, risk communication and community engagement, infection prevention and control support to health facilities and communities, and psychosocial support.

-15 Jun 2018. WHO chief on progress on Ebola and picks of the week
[Financial Times [edited]]
https://www.ft.com/content/fbc33f30-707b-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa

The guest curator of this week's FT [Financial Times] Health is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, who writes: "Earlier this week I made my 2nd visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo to review the response to that country's latest Ebola outbreak. I met survivors, health workers, the minister of health and many others. The progress since my 1st trip a month ago is encouraging. Despite the remote location and the many logistical challenges, the DRC government, the World Health Organization and our many partners have responded rapidly and effectively. As a result, the outbreak has stabilised. This time, we also have a weapon we did not have during the west African epidemic in 2014: a vaccine. More than 2600 people in the DRC have now been vaccinated against Ebola. It's not a silver bullet, but it is a vital tool.

Shortly after our vaccination campaign began, our field coordinator, Dr Mike Ryan, wrote: 'For the 1st time in my experience, I saw hope in the face of Ebola and not terror. Even better than responding rapidly to outbreaks, is preventing them. The best way to do that is to invest in stronger health systems that are oriented towards achieving universal health coverage. More than half the world's population lacks access to essential health services such as vaccination, treatment for HIV and tuberculosis, basic sanitation or cancer screening. Even when health services are available, using them can cause deep financial difficulty for many people. Almost 100 [million] people are pushed into extreme poverty every year because of out-of-pocket health spending. WHO was founded 70 years ago on the conviction that health is a human right for all, not a privilege for some. Universal health coverage is the best investment in preventing emergencies of all kinds, from the personal crisis of a heart attack to a pandemic.'"

[This is a very insightful and important message. The information gained from prior Ebola outbreaks has educated us on preventive measures that must be followed to control spread. That knowledge, in addition to the rapid coordinated response, implementation of the vaccine, and rapid testing to diagnose patients, has made a big difference in stabilizing this outbreak quickly. But Ebola and other pathogens, both familiar and new, will continue to emerge, and the only way to be able to respond efficiently is through establishment and maintenance of a strong health infrastructure. When an outbreak ends, it is not the time to become complacent but rather to assess what could be improved and address those needs. One significant need is universal health coverage so everyone who is ill can be seen by a health care practitioner before they contribute to further spread of infectious agents. - Mod.LK
