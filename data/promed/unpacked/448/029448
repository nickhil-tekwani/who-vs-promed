Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Slovakia: suspicion
Emergency report: Information received on 28 Sep 2001 from Prof. Dr. Dusan
Magic, Chief Veterinary Officer, State Veterinary Administration, Bratislava:
Report date: 28 Sep 2001
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 27 Sep 2001
Outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
Ziar nad Hronom district / 1
Description of affected population: a 6-year-old cow.
Diagnosis:
On 27 September 2001, the State Veterinary Institute in Zvolen notified
positive results for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in one cow, on
tests (western blot [Prionics Check and Platelia-BSE Bio-Rad tests)
carried out under the BSE National Monitoring Plan involving regular sample
testing for surveillance for BSE in slaughtered cows on a slaughter line in
Ziar nad Hronom district.
The sample was sent on the same day to the Central BSE Reference Laboratory
in Bratislava for confirmation. Western blot (Prionics Check) and Enfer
test were used. Both assays showed that the cow was BSE-positive. A sample
is being sent to the Research Laboratory for Viral Diseases of Animals,
Tuebingen, Germany.
Epidemiology:
Using the tracing-back method, it was determined that the positive cow was
transported to the slaughterhouse on 24 Sep 2001 and originated from a farm
located in Horna Zdana in the Ziar nad Hronom district, which has 189 cows
and 12 calves. The identified cohort consists of 29 cows and the offspring
of one heifer born on 16 Apr 1998.
Control measures:
The district veterinary authorities immediately on 27 Sep 2001 isolated the
farm. Any movement of animals to and from the farm was banned.
