Officials in Mauritania released the following statement this week (translated):

Given the early rainy season this year [2022], which often comes with significant health risks, the Ministry of Health, within the "One Health" committee, took the initiative to strengthen monitoring at the national level. As part of the results of this monitoring, 2 samples of suspected cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were confirmed in Hodh el Gharbi [see item 2 below] and Brakna regions, respectively.

Since the 2 mentioned cases were reported, the relevant ministerial sectors and members of the "One Health" committee [decided] to activate monitoring devices, take measures to respond, assess the situation, and check on their capabilities and readiness to face any possible development of the situation.

"The inhabitants of risk areas (where mosquitoes are infected) are required to observe the following measures: avoid contact with blood and biological fluids of animals; be sure to sleep under a mosquito net; separation of animals from dwellings; wash your hands regularly with soap before and after touching animals or their products; cook meat thoroughly and heat milk before consumption; contact the nearest health facility immediately in case of fever or hemorrhage; inform the veterinary services of any case of abortion in livestock; wear personal protective equipment (gloves, masks, and goggles) in slaughterhouses and during direct contact with the animal; burn and bury dead animals."

Finally, the "One Health" technical committee calls on all farmers to limit the movement of their herds, to report the occurrence of any disease and cooperate with the veterinary services for the correct implementation of the measures taken and the prevention of the diseases mentioned.

[Timb√©dra is a commune and town in the Hodh ech Chargui (Eastern basin) region of southeastern Mauritania (maps at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timb%C3%A9dra and <tinyurl.com/vkupd2dh>). It will be helpful to obtain, from knowledgeable sources, quantitative and qualitative data on the reported cases, particularly clinical observations and lab test results.

The term "haemorrhagic fever" is likely referring to Rift valley fever [RVF]. According to a recent report (ProMED post 20220829.8705285), RVF was lab-confirmed in camels located west/north-west of Timbedra, namely in the district of El-Ayoun, within the neighboring region Hodh el Gharbi (Western basin). The distance between Timbedra and El-Ayoun districts is about 156 km (97 mi); a map presenting both is available at https://tinyurl.com/3ynbwae5. - Mod.AS
