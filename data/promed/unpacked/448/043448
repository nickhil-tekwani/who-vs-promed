Rates of brucellosis in Argentina have been decreasing for over 2
decades but continue to parallel those reported in the USA during the
1950s (1,2), as can be seen on the graph (3):

[ProMED once again thanks Dr. Berger for his continuing
contributions.

The following is the introduction to Lucero NE, Corazza R, Almuzara
MN, et al: Human _Brucella canis_ outbreak linked to infection in
dogs. Epidemiol Infect 2010; 138: 280-285, with the citations
removed:

"_Brucella canis_ is a Gram-negative, aerobic, intracellular
coccobacillus 1st recognized in 1966, isolated from tissue and vaginal
discharges of infected dogs. Cultures are always in the rough or
mucoid phase on primary isolation. The Brucella Subcommittee meeting
in Munich in 1978 recommended that it be given full species status.

"Outbreaks of canine abortions caused by _B. canis_ have been widely
reported describing clinical signs ranging from asymptomatic to
abortion and testicular atrophy. The zoonotic risk is relatively high
in persons who handle breeding dogs in kennels and are exposed to
reproductive tissues and fluids of infected dogs. Transmission to
humans in other circumstances has been considered rare, with only 30
cases reported worldwide since the 1st isolation in the late 1960s.
Other authors consider _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ more virulent for
humans than _B. abortus_ and _B. canis_.

"In this paper, we present results from an uncommon outbreak of human
brucellosis, which to the best of our knowledge is the 1st reported in
the literature to be caused by _B. canis_." - Mod.LL
