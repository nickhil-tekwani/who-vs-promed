Some 8500 chickens have been culled in Bangladesh following the
spread of bird flu in the country, an official said Wednesday [2 May 2007].
"We have culled 8500 chickens in a one-sq-km area. It (the virus) was
1st identified at a government-run farm and then in 3 nearby farms,"
a government livestock official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP.
Samples from other farms in the southwestern district of Jessore,
where the outbreak occurred, had also been taken for analysis, he said.
The cull took the total number of birds killed so far in Bangladesh
to more than 70 000.
Officials said last month [April 2007] that around 66 000 birds at 22
farms had been destroyed after the disease spread in other parts of
the country, including to the north.
The disease was 1st identified in Bangladesh in late March 2007,
after samples from a farm near the capital, Dhaka, tested positive
for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
So far, there has been no report of any human infection in the
impoverished south Asian nation.
Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of poultry farms
employing more than a million people. It had already banned imports
of live birds from more than 50 countries, including neighboring
India and Myanmar, after outbreaks were detected there.

[Since the start of the current epizootic in Bangladesh on 5 Feb
2007, the authorities have reported to the OIE about 12 outbreaks in
poultry: initially (30 Mar 2007) about 3, and -- in a follow-up
report dated 30 Apr 2007 -- about 9 additional outbreaks. This
follow-up report, including map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5319>.
The current newswire mentions "disease spread in other parts of the
country, including to the north;" it is not clear whether this refers
to published or to new outbreaks. Clarification will help. - Mod.AS]
