Malaria cases on the rise in city of Hyderabad
----------------------------------------------
Malaria is fast spreading its tentacles in Greater Hyderabad. To
date, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has recorded
as many as 145 malaria cases in the twin cities. The health department
is ironically observing Anti-Malaria month currently and has planned a
slew of activities throughout June [2011], but has no manpower to
implement them.

Sources say that out of the 107 posts of health assistants, only 22
are on the job for the entire Greater Hyderabad region. The district
health department has identified high risk areas prone to malaria
outbreaks. The list included Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, parts of
Indira Park, Sanathnagar, Saidabad, Bholakpur, Amberpet, Uppuguda,
Puranapul, Kurmaguda, Jiyaguda. The highest number of cases, the
officials said. are being reported from Banjara Hills and Bholakpur in
Musheerabad.

Apart from government facilities, even private hospitals are
recording 10-15 cases of malaria every week from the city as well as
the neighbouring districts over the last fortnight, a specialist at a
private hospital in the city said.

Doctors said that potholed roads, stinking streets, and stagnant
water in the city offer many breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause
the spread of the vectorborne disease. While GHMC claims that fogging
and anti-larval operations were being undertaken to curb the mosquito
menace, year after year, there seems to be no respite for denizens.

Sources said that the civic body is concentrating on VIP areas for
the fogging operations. We are unable to cover most of the areas. With
the available manpower, it is highly impossible to cover every area,
said an official. He added that the malaria labs in the 12 districts,
area and teaching hospitals diagnosing the disease are also
understaffed. Out of 17 posts of lab technicians, only 12 are working.


We are unable to identify the cases. Because of the load, the quality
also suffers, said a senior official. He added that patients are
instead going to private hospitals and do not complete the 14-day
treatment, said another official.

[According to the World Malaria Report 2010, Andrah Pradesh is a low
endemic area
(http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html),
with an annual malaria incidence of 0 to 1 or 1 to 10 cases per 1000
population per year. Hyderabad has around 4 million inhabitants and
even a low incidence of 1 per 1000 population per year could explain
up to 400 cases annually. ProMED-mail would be happy to post data
showing trends over the past years.
