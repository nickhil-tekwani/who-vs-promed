Ebola case definition quandary; Public health worker Ebola unease
---------------
Ebola study notes afebrile patients calls into question WHO criteria. Researchers found that the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola case definition has a specificity of only 31.5 per cent, and they noted that 9 per cent of Ebola patients reported neither a fever nor any Ebola risk exposure, calling into question WHO norms, according to a large study yesterday in _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_ [see comment].

Researchers from Britain and Sierra Leone analyzed data on 850 suspected and 724 lab-confirmed Ebola patients who presented to the holding unit of Connaught Hospital in Freetown from 29 May to 8 Dec 8 2014. Fever or history of fever (n=599, 83 per cent), intense fatigue or weakness (495, 68 per cent), vomiting or nausea (365, 50 per cent), and diarrhea (294, 41 per cent) were the most common presenting symptoms in suspected cases.

Based on data from these patients, the investigators found the sensitivity of the WHO case definition to be 79.7 per cent, which means about 20 per cent of true Ebola cases would be missed (false-negatives). They found the specificity of the case definition to be 31.5 per cent, which means 68.5 per cent of patients who would be selected for admission would not actually have Ebola virus disease (false-positives).

In a subgroup analysis, 15 (9 per cent) of 161 lab-confirmed Ebola patients reported neither a history of fever nor a risk factor for Ebola exposure. The team also found that including these conditions increased the accuracy of the case definition: intense fatigue, confusion, conjunctivitis, hiccups, diarrhea, or vomiting. A combination of 3 or more of any these symptoms tripled the odds of a confirmed Ebola diagnosis by yielding a sensitivity of 58 per cent and specificity of 71 per cent.

The authors conclude, "The finding that 9 per cent of Ebola virus disease cases had no fever or history of fever and no risk factor for exposure to the virus shows that existing case definitions that typically include these features as criteria (e.g., the existing WHO case definition) have insufficient sensitivity to identify all cases of Ebola virus disease." They add that existing clinical criteria cannot discriminate Ebola from other diseases like malaria and typhoid fever.

They write, "A highly specific Ebola virus disease screening algorithm could reduce the risk of patient-to-patient transmission within holding units, which is a major clinical concern." A related commentary says previous studies have also found the WHO case definition to lack sensitivity and warns that overreliance on it can lead to increased healthcare spread.

Discrimination of Ebola virus disease cases from patients without the disease is a major challenge in an outbreak and needs rapid diagnostic testing. Suspected Ebola virus disease case definitions that rely on history of fever and risk factors for Ebola virus disease exposure do not have sufficient sensitivity to identify all cases of the disease. The 9 per cent reporting neither fever nor Ebola risk exposure might of course have had reasons for not telling the truth. - Mod.LK/JW]

[Professor Philip Baba Adongo of the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Ghana (UG), speaking at a meeting for informing Ghanians about Ebola virus disease (EVD), states that, because of the many misconceptions about EVD there is a need to change the focus of the educational campaign on Ebola.

The UN [United Nations] agency says it has delivered 46 metric tons of food -- rice, pulses [dried beans from the legume family], vegetable oil, salt and a nutritious corn soya blend -- enough to meet families' food needs for 1 month. The WFP said the food item will help to contain any possible spread of the Ebola virus by ensuring that people do not have to leave their homes to find food....more]

23 Jul 2015 Liberia: Campaign group accuses Liberia palm oil firm of exploiting Ebola crisis
http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/23/uk-liberia-palmoil-golden-agri-idUKKCN0PX0A420150723
[Anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness on Thu (23 Jul 2015) accused palm oil company Golden Veroleum of taking advantage of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia to double the size of its plantation. The Global Witness report published on Thurs [23 Jul 2015] alleged that Golden Veroleum exploited the crisis caused by the West Africa Ebola epidemic -- which has so far killed more than 4800 Liberians -- to press poorly informed communities into signing away land at a time when local non-governmental organizations were not present on the ground to advise them.
According to the report, Golden Veroleum held meetings with hundreds of people to encourage communities to hand over their land even after Liberia banned public gatherings to stem the spread of the Ebola virus. It said the company used the Ebola crisis to accelerate development of the plantation, clearing 5358 hectares between April 2015 and December 2015 -- double the amount of land it had cleared over the previous 3 years.

[The 1st donations of plasma from survivors of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone have been administered to 3 Ebola-positive patients currently admitted at the 34 Military Hospital Treatment Center in the west of Freetown, where a study is being conducted. All participants are volunteers. According to Dr. Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Child Health, the study is designed to find out whether Ebola survivors' plasma contains protective antibodies, as well as if their plasma can be used safely to reduce the number of deaths in this and future outbreaks, adding that the initiative is local which is why large drugs companies cannot make profit from it. Dr. Semple also expressed fervent hope that plasma transfusion will bring hope to Sierra Leone by encouraging those who were afraid to visit the treatment centers to go for treatment...- more]

[Specialist staff have been taken out of Manchester and Birmingham airports, as well as the Eurostar terminal at Kings Cross St Pancras, after the global threat level of the deadly virus was lowered. But the move has been questioned as major hubs Heathrow and Gatwick are keeping the tough screening measures in place, raising concerns the move is down to merely money-saving measures. Ukip health spokeswoman Louise Bours said: "It's good news that the checks will continue at Heathrow and Gatwick, but I don't think Ebola has a particular preference for a point of entry into a country...This is clearly a cost cutting exercise and surely public health should not be placed at risk by the whim of an accountant's spreadsheet."...more]

http://m.gbcghana.com/1.5429151
[Findings from the School of Public Health at the University of Ghana show that though Ghanaians generally have knowledge about Ebola, misconceptions and high-risk socio-cultural practices cloud the real picture of the disease. According to the findings, the surprising aspect is that urban dwellers were found to be more vulnerable with regards to information, attitude, and beliefs concerning Ebola. At a meeting to present the findings to stakeholders in Accra, the Dean of the School of Public Health at University of Ghana, Legon, Professor Richard Adanu said the findings clearly show that tracking and preventing Ebola in Ghana has moved beyond the establishment of a Ministerial Committee to a more rigid approach to effectively disseminate information on Ebola to the people...more]

The system can be installed in C-17 and C-130 aircraft, which are much larger than the jets the State Department-contracted Phoenix Air has used in transporting single Ebola patients from overseas to the US. The unit, called a TIS (Transport Isolation System) is a self-contained, pressurized chamber that allows caregivers to move about and provide necessary treatment should a patient(s) need critical care en route to the hospital....more]

[Abstract. Based upon past experience with other vaccines, the proposed administration of Ebola vaccines (once testing has been completed) will inevitably result in at least some adverse events that will give rise to legal liabilities of only crudely [estimatable] magnitude at this time. Manufacturers, beneficiary governments (e.g., Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone), supporting governments (e.g. U.S., U.K.), individuals suffering adverse events, and populations benefiting from widespread vaccination against the Ebola virus all have a shared interest in recognizing, understanding, and managing potential liability as effectively as possible within the framework of a global public health response. ...- more]
