[This week's report has several noteworthy events. One noteworthy report has 2 cVDPV2 associated AFP cases in Mozambique. The last cVDPV2 associated AFP case reported in Mozambique had onset of illness in 2018, and the last WPV associated case reported from Mozambique was in 1993 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5222a3.htm#tab1). Another noteworty occurrence is the report of additional environment samples that isolated cVDPV2 in Djibouti (with the 1st isolates noted in a weekly report on 2 Feb 2022 - see Poliomyelitis update (03): WPV1 (AFP Afghanistan), cVDPV2 (AFP; ES Djibouti) 20220212.8701429). These isolates were from samples obtained on 10 Dec 2021 (https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/weekly-polio-analyses-cVDPV-20220215.pdf). And last, although not least, the 1st cVDPV2 associated AFP case with onset of illness in 2022 was reported in Somalia. Transmission with resultant AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 infection continues to occur in Nigeria. It is discouraging that every week or 2 there are new countries identifying and reporting cVDPVs, consistent with lower vaccine coverages leaving increasingly bigger pockets of susceptibles.

A map showing the location of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

Malawi declares polio outbreak
------------------------------
The health authorities in Malawi have declared an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 after a case was detected in a young child in the capital Lilongwe. This is the 1st case of wild poliovirus in Africa in more than 5 years.

Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020 after eliminating all forms of wild polio from the region. Laboratory analysis shows that the strain detected in Malawi is linked to the one that has been circulating in Sindh Province in Pakistan. Polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. As an imported case from Pakistan, this detection does not affect the African region's wild poliovirus-free certification status.

"As long as wild polio exists anywhere in the world all countries remain at risk of importation of the virus," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. "Following the detection of wild polio in Malawi, we're taking urgent measures to forestall its potential spread. Thanks to a high level of polio surveillance in the continent and the capacity to quickly detect the virus, we can swiftly launch a rapid response and protect children from the debilitating impact of this disease."

WHO is supporting the Malawi health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and outbreak response, including supplemental immunization. Surveillance of the disease is also being ramped up in neighbouring countries. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Rapid Response Team which is based at the WHO Regional Office in Africa is deploying a team to Malawi to support coordination, surveillance, data management, communications, and operations. Partner organizations will also send teams to support emergency operations and innovative vaccination campaign solutions.

"The last case of wild polio virus in Africa was identified in northern Nigeria in 2016 and globally there were only 5 cases in 2021. Any case of wild polio virus is a significant event and we will mobilize all resources to support the country's response," said Dr Modjirom Ndoutabe, Polio Coordinator in the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis within hours. The virus is transmitted from person-to-person mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food, and multiplies in the intestine. While there is no cure for polio, the disease can be prevented through administration of a simple and effective vaccine.

[B] Malawi ex Pakistan

https://www.science.org/content/article/new-setback-eradication-campaign-poliovirus-pakistan-shows-africa


A wild poliovirus has made a leap from Pakistan to the African continent, where it has paralyzed a 3-year-old girl in Malawi -- the 1st wild polio case in the country since 1992. The case, announced on [17 Feb 2022] by the Malawi government, is the latest setback for the global campaign to end polio once and for all. But the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) hopes it can limit the damage by stopping the outbreak quickly.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the last 2 countries that are endemic for the wild virus, which means circulation there has never stopped. Occasionally, the virus spills over from these entrenched reservoirs. The last "exportation" from the region was in 2013, when a virus from Pakistan sparked an outbreak in Syria.

Africa is battling big outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio, which occur in areas of low immunization when the live but attenuated virus in the oral polio vaccine reverts and regains its ability to paralyze and spread. But the last known case of wild polio on the continent occurred in 2016 in Borno state in Nigeria, and Africa was officially certified free of wild poliovirus in August 2021.

Because polio spreads quickly and "silently" -- just about 1 in 200 infected children becomes paralyzed -- even a single detection of the virus is considered an outbreak. But GPEI has a history of quashing these imported outbreaks quickly with rapid vaccination campaigns; the goal is to stop them within 6 months, before the virus becomes entrenched.

The girl, who lives in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe, was paralyzed on 19 Nov 2021. Through sequence analysis of her poliovirus, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the regional reference lab in South Africa have just confirmed she was struck by a relative of wild type 1 poliovirus that circulated in Sindh province in Pakistan in October 2019. The new case means the virus has been lurking undetected since then.

GPEI analysts don't know yet when the virus arrived in Malawi and how far it may have spread. The quality of polio surveillance in Malawi has slipped during the COVID-19 pandemic. GPEI is also assessing the risk of spread to other countries, because there is a lot of population movement from Malawi to Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania. And it is figuring out the vaccination strategy -- which vaccine to use, and how broadly.

Although Malawi is now considered a "wild-polio-affected country," the African continent will still be considered free of wild poliovirus unless it circulates for 12 months or more.

The case shows, again, that "polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere," says John Vertefeuille, a CDC polio specialist. "1 child paralyzed is 1 too many and it is a tragedy for the girl and her family," adds Aidan O'Leary, director of GPEI, which is based at the World Health Organization's headquarters in Geneva. "It simply underscores the importance of prioritizing immunization activities everywhere while focusing on permanently interrupting polio transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan."

As a result of ongoing disease surveillance, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) has confirmed the presence of type 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) in a child suffering from paralysis in Tsabango, Lilongwe, Malawi. Analysis shows that the virus is genetically linked to WPV1 that was detected in Pakistan's Sindh province in October 2019.

The 3-year-old girl in Malawi experienced onset of paralysis on 19 Nov 2021, and stool specimens were collected for testing on [26 and 27 Nov 2021]. Sequencing of the virus conducted in February [2022] by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed this case as WPV1.

Detection of WPV1 outside the world's 2 remaining endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, is a serious concern and underscores the importance of prioritizing polio immunization activities. Until polio is fully eradicated, all countries remain at risk of importation and must maintain high vaccination coverage to protect all children from polio.

The GPEI is supporting health authorities in Malawi to conduct a thorough assessment of the situation and begin urgent immunization activities in the subregion to mitigate any risk of spread. Surveillance measures are also being expanded in Malawi and neighboring countries to detect any other potential undetected transmission.

As an imported case from Pakistan, this detection does not affect the WHO African Region's wild poliovirus-free certification status officially marked in August 2020. Malawi last recorded a case of wild poliovirus in 1992. The polio eradication programme has seen importations from endemic countries to regions that have been certified wild poliovirus-free in the past, and has moved quickly to successfully stop transmission of the virus in these areas.

Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere. Now is the time for all parties to recommit to ending all forms of polio for good.

[Results of additional epidemiologic investigations including active surveillance for WPV1 in Malawi are eagerly awaited. The challenge will be to determine where this virus is (in addition to the isolate from the 3-year-old girl in Malawi) and determine how long this virus has been circulating in Malawi. While the case is being classified as an imported case, if there was no direct contact with individuals from Pakistan, the concern is the prolonged circulation of this virus "under the radarscope" as this virus was last identified approximately 25 months preceding the onset of this case's paralytic disease. As mentioned in the above reports, the most recent WPV associated AFP case in Malawi occurred in 1992.

For a map of Malawi, see https://www.worldmap1.com/map/malawi-map. Malawi has a major border on its east with Lake Nyasa, and in its southern region is surrounded by Mozambique (where 2 cVDPV2 cases were confirmed - see above Item 1), and borders with Zambia to its west and Tanzania to its north. - Mod.MPP
