[The return of rabies to wildlife in Greece after 25 years of absence is concerning. It reflects the rabies situation in Greece's 2 northern neighbours, Albania and (Former Yugoslavian Republic of) Macedonia, where rabies is present in wildlife (red foxes). In Macedonia, its incidence in wildlife is, reportedly, on the increase. In both countries, cases in domestic animals, following their exposure to wildlife, have been recently reported.

For updated data on the rabies situation in Europe, see http://rbe.fli.bund.de/Default.aspx.

The location of the current case in northern Greece is indicated in the interactive map at the source URL. - Mod.AS
