U.K. Deputy Agriculture Minister Jeff Rooker was cited as saying in a reply
in the Commons that between 1993 and 1998, payments to farmers, abattoir
owners, renderers and the hide industry totalled BP 1.638 billion. In a
separate Commons reply, he revealed the number of cattle over 30 months old
slaughtered to contain the crisis has topped two million. Of the 2.2 million
animals destroyed, 128,000 have been incinerated. The rest have been turned
into tallow and meat and bone meal (MBM).
A total of 314,000 tonnes of MBM is in store pending destruction. Outlining
the cost of BSE compensation, Mr Rooker said that between mid-1993 and
mid-1996 payments - all to meat producers - totalled BP 57 million. But
during 1996-97 that figure rose sharply to BP 1.077 billion. Meat producers
received BP 904 million, the "slaughter sector" BP 82 million, renderers BP
87 million and the hide industry BP 4 million.
In 1997-98, producers were expected to get 439 million and renderers 65 - a
total of 504 million.
