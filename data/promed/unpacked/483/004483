[This was the 3rd newly confirmed case reported by the Saudi MoH in as many days, bringing the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia during the month of December 2018 to 3. Two of the 3 cases had a history of contact with camels; the 3rd was classified as community acquired but no history of camel contact. Outcomes on all 3 cases are still pending.

MERS situation update, November 2018
------------------------------------
At the end of November 2018, a total of 2274 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 806 associated deaths (case fatality rate 35.4%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1896 cases, including 732 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 38.6%).

During the month of November [2018], a total of 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally (all from Saudi Arabia), including 2 associated deaths. Two of the cases were a secondary infection through household contact. The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2018, do not show any significant difference or change. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.

The age group 50-59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[The EMRO monthly situation report has charts and graphics showing the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infections in the region since the identification of the virus in 2012. The full report can be found at: http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EMROPub_2018_EN_20768.pdf. While the report mentions 8 newly confirmed during the month of November 2018, I have been able to identify only 7 cases reported during the month. As mentioned in a previous moderator comment, there were 4 cases reported from Riyadh region and 3 cases reported from Qasim region. As the EMRO report mentions 2 deaths, I suspect that a case reported on 31 Oct 2018 that was reported as a fatality on 1 Nov 2018 is the 8th case referred to in this update report.

In the absence of significant nosocomial transmission, there seems to be a steady "trickle" of reported mostly primary community acquired cases endemically in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP]
