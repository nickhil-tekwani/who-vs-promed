[This is a review of the recent and current history of hantavirus infection cases and related studies in Peru. - Mod.TY]

The 1st evidence of presence of [a] hantavirus in Peru was in the Amazonian city, Iquitos, in Loreto department. IgG reactivity to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) antigen was found in sera of 30 of 1537 students, in 21 of 257 febrile patients, and in 4 of 112 rodents. Of these students and febrile patients, 8 and 5 [respectively] were seropositive for hantavirus [HTNV] [antigen]. In another study in an urban overgrown area in Iquitos city, of the 60 rodents trapped 56 were _Oligoryzomys microtus_ (small-eared colilargo or small-eared pygmy rice rat) and 12 were seropositive against Sin Nombre virus (SNV) [antigens]. Partial genetic characterization of the only [virus] isolate obtained had a high degree of similarity to the Rio Mamore virus (RMV).

In a relatively recent study of hantavirus seroprevalence in a [human] urban and a rural population in Iquitos, no significant difference was found between them (26 positive of 1186 and 10 positive of 877, respectively). In the Madre de Dios department in 2009-2010, 6 of 362 rodents were IgG positive (2 [common bristly mice] _Neacomys spinosus_, 2 [Paraguayan bolo mouse] _Necromys lenguarum_, 1 [Amazonian oryzomys or Yungas rice rat] _Hylaeamys yunganus_, 1 [elegant rice rat] _Euryoryzomys nitidus_). Of these 6, 2 were confirmed by PCR. One of these 2 had a [virus] sequence similar to Andes virus [ANDV]. Another study done in 2010 in the Alto Mayo Valley in San Martin department found that 1 of 250 rice farmers who were asymptomatic had IgM antibodies [to hantavirus antigens].

The 1st 2 human [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; HPS] cases in Peru were 29 and 33 year old women [with infections] occurring between June and August 2011. Both died after exposure in a rural area, although they lived in Iquitos city. The M segment sequence was 97 percent homologous with Seoul virus [SEOV]. In November 2011, another 2 cases from neighboring areas (5 km/3 mi distant) were attributed to a virus similar to RMV (96 percent homologous). In 2012, another case in a 40 year old woman was confirmed; both of these cases progressed favorably. To date, 6 cases [of HPS] have occurred in the country.

In coming years, the increasing trend in Peru following the presentation of the 1st cases may be the same as has occurred in neighboring countries. The factors determining the emergence of hantavirus [infection cases] in Peru, although unknown, may be related to displacement of rodent populations to areas without previous transmission [to humans], perhaps because of expansion of agricultural areas as [the rodents] seek food, or due to deforestation in woodland areas, human entry for extractive economic activities such as agriculture, petroleum extraction, lumbering, mining, or recreation (tourism).

Given what has gone before and facing the risk of more cases of hantavirus [infection] in forested areas of the country, the system of syndromic surveillance is considered the sensible approach to detect the disease, by means of differential diagnosis of respiratory syndromes, identifying with certainty the infecting virus in cases that present themselves in the future. Also, given the existence of carrier rodents, surveillance of these reservoirs is doubly important in the prevention of this disease. Facing this reality, established syndromic surveillance could be updated, considering the experience of neighboring countries.

[One wonders if there have been sporadic, perhaps isolated cases of HPS due to RMV infection long before the 1st cases were recognized. However, it is true that there have been significant ecological changes in the Peruvian Amazon area due to human activity, and these changes may have favored increase in the rodent reservoir populations with greater contact with humans. The earlier serological reaction with SNV, HTNV, and ANDV virus antigens represents cross-reactivity, not presence of those viruses. It is likely that the antibodies were to RMV, which is endemic in the Amazon basin of Peru, or possibly to Araraquara virus that is found in southwestern and Central Brazil with its rodent host the bolo mouse (_Necromys (Bolomys) benefactus_). The serological reaction of SEOV, may have been due to exposure to that virus since its reservoir rodent is the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), which has carried this virus around the world. The plan to increase surveillance of human disease and RMV in rodents is prudent. Future attempts to isolate and type the viruses involved is essential to know which viruses are present.
