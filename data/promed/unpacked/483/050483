Bluetongue tests prove negative
-------------------------------
Tests for the bluetongue virus at 2 farms in previously unaffected areas
have proved negative, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) has said. Government vets had been investigating suspected
outbreaks in north Shropshire and Greater Manchester. Positive tests would
have meant new restrictions for livestock farmers across most of Wales,
north west England, and around the Bristol Channel.
Bluetongue is a non-contagious virus spread by a midge species, affecting
ruminants including sheep and cattle.
The 1st case of bluetongue in the UK was detected last September [2007] at
a farm near Ipswich, and spread to other parts of south-east England where
protection and surveillance zones remain in place.
Scotland's 1st and only case to date was discovered at a farm near
Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, on 28 Dec 2008 [This case was not a
local infection but an animal introduced from an affected area in Germany.
- Mod.AS]
All ruminants, such as cattle, goats, deer and sheep, are susceptible,
although symptoms are generally most severe in sheep. Signs of the disease
in species vary, but key indicators include a high fever, excessive
salivation, swelling of the head and neck, lameness, and sometimes
discolouration of the tongue.

[According to yesterday's (27 Jan 2008) newswire from Farmers Weekly
Interactive, cited in our last posting 20080127.0344, the suspected cases
in Shropshire and Cheshire (species not specified) were about to be
confirmed. Such confirmation would have meant the extension of the
protection zone into Wales and further towards the south west of England,
possibly as far south as Bristol.
Fortunately, this has now become a false alarm; the currently prevailing
Declaration of a Protection zone and Surveillance zone, with map, is
available at
