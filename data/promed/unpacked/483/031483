There have been several reports (I am afraid many of them are actually only
abstracts at European "TBE"-meetings), showing the protective effect of the
inactivated CEE virus vaccine for prevention of infection with the very
closely related RSSE virus. As for [using the same vaccine for [protection
against Omsk hemorrhagic fever, I do not know, and I never heard of such,
but it seems plausible. Given the disturbing fact that multiple
etiologies (same disease, more than one etiologic agent) may be suspected
here, one tempting alternative could be hantaviruses; was there also a
renal involvement in the cases here?
During a 1986-1990 small mammal capture study in Belgium, the Netherlands
and Germany, a total of 5,038 animals of 28 different species were
captured; 201 were muskrats (_Ondatra zibethica_). Of these, 2/174 _Ondatra
zibethica_ (1.1 %) had [indirect fluorescent antibody to Hantaan virus
(strain 76-118) and/or Puumala virus (strain Cg18-20). However, we found
0/194 (0 %) antigen-positive with an ELISA antigen-capture technique, using
convalescent serum of a Russian NE-patient (CG18-20). Nevertheless,
_Ondatra zibethica_ was the third most seropositive rodent species in our
study, after the red bank vole (13.3 %) and the wild rat (2.1 %).
Reference: Clement J, et al. Hantavirus infections in rodents. In :
(Horzinek, ed) Virus infections of Rodents and Lagomorphs. Elsevier Science
BV. Amsterdam 1994 pp 295-316. (ISBN 0-444-81909-6).
It is not impossible that heavy exposure to hantavirus-infected muskrats
through intense manipulation (skinning, etc.) may constitute an exceptional
form of hantavirus transmission to humans, instead of the usual inhalation
of aerosolised urine, feces and/or saliva of infected "classical" rodent
reservoirs. After all, we described two cases of _Nephropathia epidemica_
(mild HFRS) in Belgium, each time a few days after [the patients
strenuously manipulated a water shrew (_Neomys fodiens_) and a mole (_
Talpa europeae_), respectively (Ref.: ibidem). Neither of the latter
mammals be considered as "classical" rodent reservoirs for hantavirus
transmission to humans, since both are insectivores.
