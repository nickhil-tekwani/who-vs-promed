When horses suddenly started dying in Thailand as the nation locked down to stem the spread of COVID-19, researchers feared the cause was another deadly bat-borne virus that could kill humans.

"We had no idea what was causing it," said Nopadol Saropala, owner of a horse farm about 100 miles [161 km] from the Thai capital, who lost 18 horses in 9 days. "We found out later that it came from zebras that were apparently in transit to China."

More than 500 horses have died since the outbreak appeared in late February [2020]. Blood samples analyzed in England in March confirmed it was African horse sickness (AHS), a viral disease not known to harm humans but which is widespread among equines, including zebras, in Africa. The illness, spread by biting midges, hadn't broken out in Asia in more than 50 years.

The disease has devastated horse owners in Thailand and sent another signal to the global health community about the potential dangers of the wildlife trade. About 70% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic -- transmitted from animals to people.

The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, thought to have originated in bats, has prompted governments from the USA to Australia to increase funding for studies of relationships between animals, humans and the environment to detect potential contagions before they jump species.

"Global biosecurity is pivotal," said Mark Schipp, Australia's chief veterinarian and president of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). "Once established, diseases can be very costly, difficult to eradicate and can spread to other countries."

While a Thai government investigation continues into the origins of the horse disease, evidence points to zebras -- asymptomatic carriers -- that were legally imported without needing blood samples or quarantine. That biosecurity gap was closed last month [April 2020].

One locally registered firm involved in importing the animals since September 2018 had also been exporting them, especially to China, according to a 7 Apr 2020 statement by Thailand's Department of National Parks.

"No one was thinking of a disease from Africa," said Siraya Chunekamrai, a Bangkok-based veterinarian involved in efforts to contain the outbreak. "The first thought is to expect something local."

Fruit bats present in Thailand are known to carry Nipah virus that can infect and kill humans. Hendra, a related virus, is also known to kill horses. Unlike COVID-19, there are vaccines to protect horses against both AHS and Hendra.

A mass vaccination program of horses has begun in Thailand, while neighboring Cambodia is installing finely woven nets to protect stables from the tiny blood-sucking midges that spread the virus in a similar way that mosquitoes transmit diseases such as dengue and malaria.

"We're collaborating with medical specialists in dengue who have an understanding of insect movement," said Siraya, who is also president-elect of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.

For many, the death of their equines means the loss of livelihoods. The disease has killed everything from Thoroughbred stallions and racehorses to pets and ponies used in tourism.

A 2012 study predicted a hypothetical introduction of AHS in the Netherlands would result in as much as 232 million euros (USD 254 million) in direct costs and consequential losses of up to 284 million euros (USD 310 million). Stables keeping horses for racing and other sports would be worst affected. In Thailand, one Thoroughbred breeder is reported to have lost more than 60 horses worth about 100 million baht (USD 3.1 million).

It's also crucial to owners that Thailand identifies the source of the sickness and stops the spread as quickly as possible. Horses cannot be imported or exported from the country for at least 2 years from the date of the last infection or vaccination.

While the zebras were imported legally because of a loophole in the rules, many countries face an increased risk of outbreaks because of the growing black market for illegal wildlife products, which Interpol estimates is worth as much as USD 20 billion annually.

Identifying how the deadly horse disease leaped from Africa to Thailand is key to ensuring "lessons are learned," said Schipp at the OIE. Without a profound change in wildlife trading, "a future pandemic would be probable."

[This is the 1st time that AHS has been reported in South-East Asia and the 1st detection of AHS serotype 1 outside the African continent. Previous outbreaks outside Africa involved serotypes 9 and 4.

Following the immediate notification received from the OIE Delegate of Thailand on the outbreak in Pak Chong, Nakhon Ratchasima district, the "AHS free country" status of Thailand, as recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution No. 19 in May 2014, was suspended with effect from 27 Mar 2020.

The "loophole" through which untested zebras have been introduced -- legally -- into Thailand ("apparently in transit to China"?) is of concern.

AHS, similar to other orbiviruses (e.g., bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease, equine encephalosis), may spread internationally by live animals, their semen or embryos, or by infected _Culicoides_, but not by animal products (e.g., meat, milk).

Thailand was included in OIE's list of AHS-free countries, liable to complying with the provisions spelled out in chapter 12.1 ("Infection with African Horse Sickness Virus") of OIE's International Animal Health Code. This included a detailed questionnaire and a declaration indicating, among others, that any equids imported (which include zebras) have been done so in accordance with the Code's Chapter 12.1.

OIE's web-page "African Horse Sickness", addressing the official AHS-freedom recognition, is available at https://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/. The page includes the following (linked) issues:
- Map of AHS official status
- List of AHS free Member Countries
- Suspension/reinstatement
- Disease cards
- Questionnaire for AHS free status
- Form for annual reconfirmation

It would be interesting to note from which (African) country the zebras were imported, where they eventually landed and which procedures have been undertaken there to prevent further spread of the AHS _Orbivirus_ involved (reportedly, AHSV strain 1).

China published an exhaustive announcement on the news website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, dated 26 Apr 2020. The document informs about the outbreak in Thailand and underlines the risk of AHS introduction as "high". - Mod.AS
