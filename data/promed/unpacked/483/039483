[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 4 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, 1 new case was reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau. A total of 1780 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 2 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, both were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4 and 6 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 38 cases and no new deaths compared with 57 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (6 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 63 consecutive days. Today's (7 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 33 cases were locally transmitted, and 5 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (22), Gyeonggi (7), and Incheon (4). Imported cases were in Daegu (1), Gyeonggi (1), and Quarantine (3). Note that 13 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page, notice 361 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030), provides graphic and tabular epidemiologic variable for the outbreak in South Korea through 7 Jun 2020.

Impression: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 234 998 cases, including 33 899 deaths, up by 197 cases and 53 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (6 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 270 cases and 72 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. The major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 125 newly confirmed cases. A caution should be mention that there may be weekend reporting artifact here.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4869_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Liguria. These 4 provinces combined today (7 Jun 2020) account for 82.2% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (125) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), with another 4 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission, but again - caution this may be influenced by a weekend reporting artifact..

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (125), followed by Emilia-Romagna (14), Liguria (13), Lazio (11), and Piedmont (10).

Italy is now 34 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 18 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 171 789 total cases, 8291 deaths

Iran on Sunday [7 Jun 2020] confirmed 72 more fatalities from the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 8291.

A further 2364 people tested positive for COVID-19, raising the overall count to 171 789, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.

According to the spokesman, 134 349 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals so far, while 2596 patients remain in critical condition.

Iran's daily number of COVID-19 cases dropped to around 800 in early May [2020], but daily figures show an upward trend in recent days after authorities took measures to ease restrictions. Despite the rising number of infections, government employees have resumed work, and mosques reopened across the Middle Eastern country. Shopping malls are now open also after 6 pm.

[As of 7 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 171 789, including 8291 deaths, an increase of 2364 new cases and deaths since 6 Jun 2020, a slight increase in daily newly confirmed cases from 2269 newly confirmed cases and slight decrease in deaths from the 74 reported in the preceding 24-hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.
