Cholera hits Kabarole
---------------------
A cholera epidemic has hit Kabarole district, leaving 4 people dead in
Mitandi, Buhesi sub-county. The [doctor] in charge at Bunyangabu health
center, Dr Akasiima, said that the affected had gone to Hima, Kasese for
the burial of their relatives. This is where they contracted the disease,
which has spread to different parts of Kasese and Kabarole districts.
They are all residents of Mitandi, Buhesi sub-county. Akasiima said the
situation was under control, and health workers were working hard to get
information to the residents about how to live in a clean environment by
washing their hands before and after eating food.
The director of health services, Dr Kabagambe Rugamba, earlier told
reporters that a van from the Ministry of Health had been in Kabarole
educating people about their hygiene. The LC 3 chairperson of Buhesi
sub-county, Mr Moses Ikagobya, reminded residents to maintain good sanitary
conditions in order to survive the epidemic.

Gastroenteritis in Pangasinan still unchecked; action plan set
----------------------------------------------
Health and provincial officials held an emergency meeting on Thu 17 Jun
2004 to prepare an immediate action plan in response to the growing number
of patients suffering from gastroenteritis -- specifically cholera and
amoebic dysentery -- in several towns of Pangasinan.
The meeting was called by provincial administrator Virgilio Solis at a time
when these waterborne diseases have already affected some 230 people in
Malasiqui, 141 people in San Carlos City, 22 people in Basista, and a still
undetermined number in Mangaldan and San Fabian. Solis mobilized all
concerned government agencies in Pangasinan, national and local, to help
control the spread of the disease in whatever way they can in order to ease
the suffering of the patients.
Up until noon of Thu 17 Jun 2004, the disease appeared not to be unchecked
in San Carlos City, as 24 more patients were brought in for confinement at
the Pangasinan Provincial Hospital (PPH). Luckily, the patients were
recovering, after 2 days of treatment.
Dr Policarpio Manuel, chief of the clinic of the PPH, said that, because of
the large numbers of patients coming in, even the aisles of both floors of
the hospital were being used as temporary wards for patients. For lack of
beds, patients had to be laid on benches pulled out from the chapel.
Manuel ruled out the possibility that the disease is now of epidemic
proportions, because it has not yet affected the whole of Pangasinan,
adding that it remains at an endemic stage. Alarmed by the discovery that 6
of the patients from Malasiqui were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ El Tor,
provincial officials rallied all public hospitals, and medical personnel,
to admit all patients and to control the spread of the diseases.

4 more kids die of cholera outbreak in SBARC
--------------------------------------------
The death toll in the cholera outbreak in Spin Boldak Afghan refugee camp
(SBARC) reached 25 on Fri 25 Jun 2004. 4 more children have died. The
epidemic disease has, so far, affected older people and children, but there
is fear of a larger outbreak due to severe weather conditions, water
shortage, and lack of proper medicine.
Afghan refugees, talking to reporters who visited the camp, said that the
scorching heat, the shortage of water, and the scarcity of medicines are
augmenting the death toll. The government of Pakistan must address the
situation by providing clean drinking water and proper medicines in the
refugee camps to prevent further loss of life, they declared.

[4] Cholera - Belgium ex India

An imported case of cholera in Brussels
---------------------------------------
A confirmed case of cholera was reported to the Brussels health inspection
on 6 Jun 2004. The patient, a 43 year old woman, left India on 2 Jun 2004
for a tour of Europe. She was struck with profuse diarrhea on 3 Jun 2004,
during her trip between London and Brussels, and was admitted, upon her
arrival at a Brussels hospital, for hypovolemic shock. She has been treated
in an intensive care unit under isolation and stabilized with IV
rehydration and doxycycline. Her prognosis is favorable.
_Vibrio cholerae_ was isolated from her urine, on 6 Jun 2004, and in stool
culture the following day. Further testing has been performed at the _V.
cholerae_ Reference Laboratory at the Liege University Hospital, which
identified the organism as a _V. cholerae_ O1 serotype Inaba.
Control measures have been carried out in collaboration with the hospital
staff, the Brussels health inspection, the Scientific Institute of Public
Health (IPH), and the Federal Warning Unit. Close contacts (2 family
members) have been monitored and given prophylaxis. Hospital staff have
been informed, and hygiene control measures have been applied at the
hospital. The ambulance company has been warned to apply adequate
disinfection, as have the airline and the London-Brussels train companies.
Since other people traveling in the same group have continued their trip
through Europe, European health authorities were informed through the Early
Alert and Warning System on 7 Jun 2004.
Cholera is transmitted by drinking water, or eating food, contaminated by
large numbers of _V. cholerae_. The disease is unlikely to spread from one
person to another, and casual contact with an infected person is not a risk
factor for becoming ill. In Europe, the risk of disease is extremely low,
even in travelers. However, all travelers to areas where cholera has
occurred should observe the usual hygiene recommendations: drink safe
water, eat cooked food, avoid raw vegetables, etc.

[5] Shigellosis - USA (Texas)

The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District has noticed a big spike in
cases of shigellosis over the past 6 months, especially among children.
Experts said that people catch shigellosis by not washing their hands, and
doctors said that the best way to avoid getting sick is basic hygiene.
"The best way to prevent the infection is going to be frequent handwashing,
especially when someone in the household is ill or when someone is caring
for a small child, whether it is in a day care setting or home. Handwashing
after every diaper change, and before meal preparation, is essential,"
Cantu said.
Records show that in May 2004, there were 100 cases of shigellosis in the
county; most were in day care centers. In June 2004, only 33 cases have
been reported so far.
