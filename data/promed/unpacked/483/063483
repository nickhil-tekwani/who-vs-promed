Parks Canada officials are alerting the public after a Saskatchewan
prairie dog was found dead of plague. The carcass of the black-tailed
prairie dog was found on the edge of the Larson prairie dog colony in
Grasslands National Park in the southern part of the province.

Tests confirmed the rodent had been infected with the _Yersinia
pestis_ bacterium, the same type of organism that causes bubonic and
pneumonic plague in humans. With rodents, the disease is called
sylvatic plague. Park officials said it's a rare but naturally
occurring disease that affects squirrels and mice throughout the
southern Prairies.

Transmission to humans occurs through infected flea bites, but it's
extremely rare for people to contract the disease, Parks Canada said
in a news release.

Grasslands National Park will remain open, but Parks Canada is
recommending that visitors not walk through prairie dog colonies.
Pets are now banned from the park's prairie dog colonies. Officials
are also advising visitors to the park to use insect repellent on
their pants and shoes.

Health agencies, including the Public Health Agency of Canada and the
Cypress Health Region, have been notified, Parks Canada said.

[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabites and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under
the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front
leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please
take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in
your pet. Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves
when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the
veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one
palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire
this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians
through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the
respiratory infection as well.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home
via a pet vehicle and can also transmit disease to you, the owner or
caretaker of the pet.

The park seems to be operating out of caution to contain the disease
and protect human and pet health. - Mod.TG]
