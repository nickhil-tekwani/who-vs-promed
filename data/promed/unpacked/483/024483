A new case of bluetongue serotype 8 [BTV-8] has been discovered in France in the district Meuse, less than 85 km [53 miles] from the Belgian border.

The French safety zone thus is basically a part of Belgium; the Belgian food service AFSCA wants to set as yet no restriction zone.

During the past year, several hundred BTV-8 infections have been recorded in France. The disease has recently resumed its spread, currently northwards.

The cow in the Meuse is so far the only known case of infection within a zone short of 200 km [125 miles] from the Belgian border, says the Farmers Association in a statement: "restriction zone will be implemented in Belgium itself only if, during the coming weeks, new cases appear and their number is indicative of virus circulation on our border".

Measures in restricted zone
---------------------------
In case a restriction zone is declared, then ruminants will be allowed to exit the zone only if vaccinated and tests confirm that they are immune and not infected. Pregnant animals must be tested or vaccinated prior to being covered or inseminated. For slaughter animals, more flexible conditions are applicable.

[Meuse is a French department within the region Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine, bordering Belgium.

The EU bluetongue map, presenting the various BTV restriction zones in Europe, updated 2 Sep 2016, is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg. The map shows the BTV serotypes circulating in each restricted zone which permits, for the purposes of EC regulation 1266/2007, the identification of the restricted zones demarcated in different Member States where the same BTV serotypes are circulating. Trade between similar zones is allowed. As can be seen in the map, most of France is coloured pink which stands for BTV-8. The only other zones in Europe in which BTV-8 is currently considered circulating are Sardinia and South-West Italy. Most of France, excluding the north, has been considered, so far, a restriction zone in relation to BTV-8.

Belgium was the 1st country in Europe to announce the discovery of bluetongue disease in 2006 (see ProMED-mail posting 20060819.2316). The Netherlands and Germany followed. The virus was later serotyped 8 and caused considerable losses, spreading to France and to several other European countries. The origin and route of its initial introduction still remain to be clarified. The disease was eventually controlled by compulsory mass vaccinations and other control measures, but remained circulating in France.

According to their self-declarations, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany regained free status of bluetongue, with effect from 15 Feb 2012. - Mod.AS
