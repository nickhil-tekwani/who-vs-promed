Mauritania: Authorities Move to Contain Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
------------------------------------------------------------
30 people have been reported dead in Mauritania, following an outbreak of a
viral fever known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).
This is according to figures released by the Health Ministry here on 8 Mar
2003. Confirming the outbreak, reports from Mauritanian authorities and the
Institut Pasteur (a World Health Organisation (WHO) Research Centre in
Dakar, Senegal) indicate that the most affected regions are Trarza, Brakna,
and Hodh Gharbi, to the east of Nouakchott.
CCHF is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in a number of African, European,
and Asian countries. In 2001, cases were revealed in Kosovo, Albania, Iran,
Pakistan, and South Africa. The infection was first reported in 1944 in
Crimea (in Ukraine). The virus is transmitted by ticks.

[This report is out-of-date -- figures as of 8 Mar 2003 -- & incorrect. As
of Fri 21 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health of Mauritania has reported a
total of 35 cases (18 laboratory confirmed) of CCHF, including only 6 deaths
(see: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Mauritania (04) 20030324.0732). It
is reproduced here because it contains the additional information that the
most affected regions are Trarza, Brakna, and Hodh Gharbi, to the east of
Nouakchott. -
