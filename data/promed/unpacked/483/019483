Residents of a Forest Hills apartment complex were concerned after a Legionnaires' disease outbreak left one person dead, and made another ill.

[A resident who] lives in the Madison building at the Parker Towers complex [expressed concern]. Residents there received a letter from the city health department about 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease that were found in the Queens Boulevard building.

City officials said one person got sick, and another with existing health problems died. The health department has told residents that the water is safe to drink, but warned the elderly to take extra precautions. Those at highest risk are people age 50 or older who smoke cigarettes, have lung disease, or weakened immune systems.

Legionnaires' [disease] does not spread from person to person. It's caused by the bacteria _Legionella_; according to the New York City Health Department, most cases can be traced to plumbing systems like cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, and large air conditioning systems.

The city started regular, mandatory inspections of cooling systems after a deadly Legionnaires' [disease] outbreak in the South Bronx 2-years-ago. In that case 12 people died.

Symptoms include fever, cough, chills, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion and diarrhea, officials said. Symptoms typically appear 2-10 days after exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria.

[The Parker Towers is a complex of apartment buildings (The Madison, The Bryant and The Gramercy) in the Forest Hills neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. Parker Towers is located on the south side of Queens Boulevard (104-20 Queens Blvd) near the intersection with Yellowstone Boulevard - see map of Forest Hills at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Forest+Hills,+Queens,+NY+11375.

ProMED-mail recently reported in late August 2017 an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in residents of an apartment complex on Queens Boulevard (93-10 Queens Blvd) in the Rego Park neighborhood (Legionellosis - USA (14): (NY) apartment complex 20170831.5287267). Parker Towers is only 1.2 miles southeast of the Rego Park apartment complex (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/9310+Queens+Blvd,+Rego+Park,+NY+11374/Parker+Towers,+104-20+Queens+Blvd,+Forest+Hills,+NY+11375). Perhaps there is a common source for the Rego Park and Forest Hills outbreaks. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
