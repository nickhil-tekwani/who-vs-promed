[Thierry Work's response to Ernie Gould's inquiries in "West Nile virus,
avian - USA (HI)(05): not 20041014.2799" about the avian fauna of the
Hawaiian islands was inadvertently not posted before the thread was cut.
Below is Dr. Work's comment. - Mod.CP]

To provide more information regarding Dr. Gould's question, I offer the
following information that may be of interest to a wider audience. Hawaii
has the highest per capita number of endangered birds in any of the 50
United States, including one species of endemic corvid (the Hawaiian crow,
of which there are less than 50 individuals, all captive), 2 species of
endangered raptors (the Hawaiian hawk and owl), and several species of
endangered honeycreepers (passerines) and waterfowl (coots, ducks, stilts,
and gallinules). Most of these animals are presumably vulnerable to West
Nile virus (WNV), and we do have the vector here (_Cx. quiquefasciatus_)
along with other potential vectors (_Ae. albopictus_).
Other diseases introduced into Hawaii, such as avian malaria, avian pox,
and toxoplasmosis, have had significant demographic impacts on native
passerines. In contrast, similar diseases in the lower 48 states do not
have nearly the impact they have here, because native avifauna in Hawaii
have evolved in relative isolation and free from pathogens, until these
were introduced by humans approximately 200-300 years ago.
Although SLEV (St. Louis encephalitis virus) has a very similar ecology to
WNV, and has been in the western US for a few decades, it has not made it
to Hawaii. Thus, it would seem that a similar scenario would play out with
WNV. Unfortunately, WNV in the US has managed to rewrite the textbooks and
confound expectations at every turn. It was initially thought only to
affect crows but now has been found to kill raptors, alligators, seals, and
squirrels. It is behaving like a typical pathogen introduced into a naive
ecosystem. Given this record, and its ability to spread rapidly across
borders, the outlook is not good if it gets to Hawaii. Hawaii is unique
among the other US states in that it has approximately 5000 km of ocean
separating it from the mainland. Thus, unlike other states, we don't just
have to sit here and wait for it to arrive. We can take aggressive measures
to ensure early detection, and, if it gets here, eradicate it. But, this
will necessitate political will.
