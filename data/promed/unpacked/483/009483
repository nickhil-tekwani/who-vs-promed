- India (Mumbai, Maharashtra state). 17 Jun 2011. In what is being
labelled as the 1st dengue death of the [2011] season, a 46 year old
woman resident of Mumbai died of complications arising out of the
mosquitoborne disease [virus] at Jaslok Hospital on Wednesday [15 Jun
2011]. She was in hospital for less than 24 hours before she died. As
it was DHF, she has had clots in her brain.

- India (Kerala state). 18 Jun 2011. Dengue fever has yet again begun
to take a grip on Thiruvananthapuram city with the increase in
rainfall. Fever cases had been going up in many parts of the city in
the past few days since the onset of the monsoon. While only 2-4 cases
of dengue were reported in the district on a daily basis, on Fri 17
Jun 2011], the district health administration's dengue toll for the
day stood at 22. Only laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease end up
as statistics with the health department. Fever cases clinically
suspected as dengue could be much more and these do not figure in
official reports. Case-reporting from private hospitals also has not
been done properly, with the result that the actual number of cases of
dengue is anybody's guess.

- Australia (Queensland). 14 Jun 2011. Queensland Health has declared
dengue fever outbreaks in Innisfail, Cairns, and Townsville to be
officially over. During the outbreaks, 69 people were diagnosed with
the mosquitoborne disease [virus infection]. The worst was in
Innisfail where 47 people were reported as being infected with the
potentially life-threatening illness. About half of those required
admission to hospital. Tropical Regional Services public health
medical officer Steven Donohue said 3 months had elapsed since the
last new dengue fever case was recorded on 14 Mar [2011], allowing
authorities to declare the outbreaks over.

[It would be of interest to know if there are residual populations of
_Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector mosquitoes remaining in the area
that could spark transmission the next time a viremic traveler arrives
in north Queensland.

- Brazil (Sorocaba, Sao Paulo state). 13 Jun 2011. The number of
dengue cases registered during last week [week of 5 Jun 2011] by
Sorocaba Epidemiological Surveillance was less than the week before.
According to the bulletin issued on Monday [13 Jun 2011] by the
Sorocaba Secretariat of Health, 38 people had a confirmed diagnosis of
the disease. In the previous week there were 58 new cases. Since the
beginning of the year [January 2011] up to 10 Jun [2011], there were

locally acquired and 27 were imported from other places. The
expectation is that the outbreak will diminish even more due to low
temperatures.
