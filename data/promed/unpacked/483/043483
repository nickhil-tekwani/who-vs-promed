State of emergency declared in east Slovakia due to hepatitis
-------------------------------------------------------------
A state of emergency was declared in the Stara Lubovna area in east
Slovakia [Presov region] due to a hepatitis epidemic, Stefania
Kolcunova, from the regional public health office in Stara Lubovna
said on Wednesday [15 Oct 2008]. More than 200 Romany children have
contracted hepatitis, according to a report reaching [Prague] from Slovakia.

A temporary medical center was established in the area and hospitals
in Poprad and Presov have had to increase the number of beds in their
infectious diseases wards, the report said. "20 new patients were
registered today [16 Oct 2008] but we do not know whether the
epidemic has reached its peak," Kolcunova said.

In the Lomnicka village, where 2100 Romanies live, 170 children fell
ill, Kolcunova said, adding that the bad hygienic habits of the
population was the main cause of the epidemic. Most children in the
area have been vaccinated against hepatitis after the 1st cases of
the disease were registered. The epidemic still broke out because the
children were probably infected before vaccination, Kolcunova said.

It is presumed that this is an outbreak of hepatitis A virus
infection (although this is not specifically stated in the text) in
view of the association with poor sanitation, the particular
vulnerability of children, and the attempt to control the outbreak by
vaccination. An effective hepatitis A virus vaccine exists but is not
routinely administered in many countries.

Hepatitis A outbreaks are currently affecting the Czech Republic and
Latvia (see references below). Although the Stara Lubovna district is
not close to Central Bohemia (the site of the epidemic in the Czech
Republic), the mobility of the Romany population in Central Europe
suggests a possible connection. Further information would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
