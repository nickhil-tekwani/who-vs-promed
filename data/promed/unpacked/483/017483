Follow-up report No. 2
Translation of an e-mail received on 31 Aug 2000 from Dr Hamilton Ricardo
Farias, Director, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and
Supply, Brasilia:
End of previous report period: 23 Aug 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[33, 138, dated 25 Aug 2000).
New outbreaks:
Location /No. of outbreaks
Joia municipality, State of Rio Grande do Sul / 9
Eugenio de Castro municipality, State of Rio Grande do Sul / 1
Description of affected population in the new outbreaks: animals on
small-holdings (5 to 10 hectares) used for dairy production or subsistence
farming neighboring the 4 previously affected properties.
Epidemiology: the origin of the outbreaks has not yet been established.
Investigations are still underway. There are indications that the disease
is not spreading because lesions that are in the process of healing are now
being found. A serological survey is also being implemented throughout the
area.
Control measures during reporting period:
- A general state of alert has been declared throughout the country and all
movements of susceptible animals out of the State of Rio Grande do Sul are
being traced. As of this date there have been no reports of suspected
vesicular disease in the State of Rio Grande do Sul or elsewhere in the
country.
- In addition to the municipality of Joia, emergency and surveillance zones
have also been implemented in all the surrounding municipalities (i.e
Augusto Pestana, Boa Vista do Cadeado, Eugenio de Castro, Entre Ijuis,
Jari, Sao Miguel das Missoes and Tupancireta). The limit of the zone is
more than 30 kilometres from any outbreak.
- All livestock movement into and out of the emergency and surveillance
zones has been prohibited and shipments from the State of Rio Grande do Sul
to the rest of the country are being restricted.
- Animals were slaughtered and their carcasses rendered on 20 properties,
including the 14 where outbreaks are considered to have taken place and
others where stamping out was considered appropriate. To date, 465 bovines,
101 pigs, 44 sheep and 2 goats have been destroyed.
- All the properties under official control are being cleaned and
disinfected and a period of depopulation is being implemented.
