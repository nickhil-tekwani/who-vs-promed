[ProMED-mail does not routinely post the WHO Weekly Updates, but this
final weekly update of the year 2009 provides an easily assimilated
statement of the current state of the 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza
situation worldwide. - Mod.CP]

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 -- WHO Update 81
----------------------------------------------
As of 27 Dec 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 12 220 deaths.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member
states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.

Situation update
--------------
The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently
are in central and eastern Europe. Focal increases in rates of
ILI/ARI [influenza-like illness/acute respiratory tract infection]
during recent weeks were reported in at least 3 eastern European
countries, Georgia, Montenegro, and Ukraine.

A high intensity of respiratory diseases activity with concurrent
circulation of pandemic influenza persists in parts of southern and
eastern Europe, particularly in Greece, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia,
Ukraine, and the Urals Region of the Russian Federation.

In Western Europe, influenza transmission remains active and
widespread, but overall disease activity has peaked. At least 13 of
21 countries (testing more than 20 sentinel samples) reported that 30
percent or more of sentinel specimens were positive for influenza,
down from a peak of over 70 percent. All influenza viruses detected
in Western Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, very small
numbers of seasonal influenza viruses, making up less than one
percent of all influenza viruses detected, were reported in Russia.

In addition, limited available data indicates that active, high
intensity transmission is occurring in Northern African countries
along the Mediterranean coast (Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt).

In Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus
circulation remains active, but transmission may have recently peaked
in some places.

In West Asia, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Oman, and Afghanistan also appear
to have passed their peak period of transmission within the past
month, though both areas [Central and West Asia] continue to have
some active transmission, and levels of respiratory disease activity
have not yet returned to baseline levels.

In East Asia, influenza transmission remains active but appears to be
declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in
Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong
SAR (China). Slight increases in ILI were reported in Mongolia after
weeks of declining activity following a large peak of activity over
one month ago.

In Southern Asia, influenza activity continues to be intense,
particularly in northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka. Seasonal
influenza A (H3N2) viruses are still being detected in very small
numbers in China making up about 2.5 percent of the influenza A
viruses detected there.

In North America, influenza transmission remains widespread but has
declined substantially in all countries. In the US, sentinel
outpatient ILI activity has returned to the seasonal baseline, and
indicators of severity, including hospitalizations, paediatric
mortality, and P&I mortality have declined substantially since
peaking during late October 2009. Rates of hospitalization among
cases aged 5-17 years and 18-49 years far exceeded rates observed
during recent influenza seasons, while rates of hospitalizations
among cases aged over 65 years were far lower than those observed
during recent influenza seasons.

In the tropical regions of Central and South America and the
Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread,
but overall disease activity has been declining or remains unchanged
in most parts, except for focal increases in respiratory disease
activity in a few countries.

In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases
of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of
sustained community transmission.

Global picture
-------------
The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential
to infect, humans, including seasonal influenza. For more information
on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance, please see
weekly Virology Update (Virological surveillance) at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/laboratory30_12_2009/en/index.html>.

[N.B. Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of
the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while
countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2
latitudes.]

Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 51: 13 Jul-20 Dec 2009)
-------------------------------------------
The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health-care services. Human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillance. A
description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives
and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the
surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus. [see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/interim_guidance/en/index.html>.

Geographic spread of influenza activity
--------------------------------------
The maps accessible at the URLs below display information on the
qualitative indicators reported. Information is available for
approximately 60 countries each week. Implementation of this
monitoring system is ongoing, and completeness of reporting is
expected to increase over time.

List of definitions of qualitative indicators:

Region / Deaths*

WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 130
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / At least 6670
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Med. (EMRO) / 693
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / At least 2422

(*The reported number of fatal cases is an under-representation of
the actual numbers, as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza related).
