The following comment is in response to the ProMED-mail post entitled: Hepatitis A - Uzbekistan: (FA) 20131214.2116240.

Reported rates of hepatitis A for Uzbekistan and bordering countries are strikingly similar and somewhat higher than those for the Russian Federation [1,2]. See graph [3]: http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/HepAUzbek.png.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for making this information available.

The progressive decline in the incidence of hepatitis A in these countries is striking and follows closely the pattern observed in the Russian Federation during the period 1999 to 2009. These figures probably reflect a general improvement in living standards and education during this period as well as the increasing availability of effective hepatitis A virus vaccines. - Mod.CP
