A cluster of 20 recent cases of _E. coli_ sickness in Hamilton, Butler and
Clermont counties has triggered an investigation by state and federal
health officials.
All 20 victims were infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7, a powerful, sometimes
deadly food-borne bacterium that strikes about 65,000 people a year
nationwide. _E. coli_ from contaminated beef killed four people and
sickened hundreds of others after they ate at Jack-in-the-Box restaurants
in Washington state in 1993.
TRISTATE CASES
State and federal health officials are searching for what caused a
"cluster" of 20 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ sickness in Greater Cincinnati
in June and July. Key test results are expected by week's end.
- Hamilton County: 8 confirmed cases including 2 in Loveland, 2 in Indian
Hill, 2 in Anderson township, one each in Blue Ash and Symmes Township.
- Butler county: 6 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases; includes 4 in
Fairfield, 2 in Liberty Township, one each in Union and Madison townships.
- Clermont County: 6 confirmed cases, mostly in Union and Miami Townships
near the Hamilton County line.
The Ohio Department of Health and county departments of health [have
indicated that:
no deaths have occurred in the local cluster, but several victims were sick
enough to require hospital care.
Although the investigation is in its early stages, officials do not think
all 20 people got sick from a single source of contamination, such as a
group picnic or restaurant.
"It is really very unlikely that it's a single source," said Janet
Rickabaugh, Clermont County health commissioner. "[The investigation could
take several weeks. And we may never find out much more information on the
source."
Tracking the source of a foodborne illness can be complicated, health
officials say. People don't always accurately remember what they eat and
finding samples of contaminated food can be elusive.
The 20 cases include eight in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and
six in Butler County. All were diagnosed in June or July.
That's an unusually high number, even though health officials say summer is
the peak season for _E. coli_ infections. Those three counties reported a
total of 11 cases in 1998, [according to Ohio Department of Health
spokeswoman Jane Beathard.
Statewide, 87 cases of _E. coli_ illnesses were reported this year through
July 28, compared with 54 cases in the same period a year ago.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of _E. coli_ bacteria, many
of which pose no threat to human health. The dangerous strain is commonly
passed by eating undercooked beef. However, _E. coli_ outbreaks also have
been linked to unpasteurized milk and apple juice, and raw alfalfa sprouts.
The [infection can be spread by failing to wash hands after using the
restroom or changing diapers, or by drinking or swimming in contaminated
water.
To find the source or sources of the local cluster, county health
departments have been interviewing victims about what they ate and where.
Bacterial samples collected from the victims have been sent to the state
health department for closer analysis.
Three experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, brought
in at the request of the state health department, arrived Wednesday. They
will be working from the Clermont County Health Department.
Based on interviews with the people who became sick, food samples have been
collected from at least two restaurants, but no test results were available
Wednesday.
The state health department expects to have results by week's end from a
type of bacteria DNA testing called pulsed field gel electrophoresis.
Even _E. coli_ O157:H7 can vary in subtle ways. The DNA test can tell much
like a fingerprint whether any of the 20 people caught the same variation
of the strain.
The lack of common circumstances among the cases makes it likely that more
than one source of contamination was involved.
In Clermont County, none of the six victims were from the same family. In
Butler County, ages of victims ranged from 4 to 82. In Hamilton County,
victims lived in five different cities or townships, with ages ranging from
4 to 63.
"We've been trying to find a common food source, but so far we haven't
found one," said Patricia Burg, director of the Butler County Health
Department.
No new cases have been reported for several days, but it is too soon to
tell whether the cluster is likely to grow beyond the 20 cases, Ms.
Beathard said. The potential risk to the public depends on the cause or
causes of the illness.
Franklin County has reported four recent _E. coli_ cases near Columbus but
state officials do not believe those cases are linked to the Greater
Cincinnati cases. Officials also are investigating three cases reported in
Kentucky and one in Indiana to see if they might be linked to the local
cluster.

[This article suggests this outbreak may be bigger than just the southern
portion of Ohio. There is a greater than 50% increase in reported cases as
of 28 July this year from the same period in 1998 (87 vs 54 cases) of
which only 61% are attributed to this cluster (20 of 33). In addition,
there is mention that 3 cases in Kentucky and one in Indiana are under
investigation as possibly related to this cluster. One obvious question is
whether this is related to a commercial product distributed in the region
vs. a common source event which this article seems to rule out. - MPP
