Botulism caused wild ducks' death
---------------------------------
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has confirmed
botulism was the cause of death of 51 wild ducks found in Lok Ma
Chau. Carcasses of 8 northern shovelers [_Anas clypeata_] and 43
Eurasian wigeons [_Anas penelope_] were collected at the wetland
compensation area of the Mass Transit Railway Lok Ma Chau Spur Line
on 25 Mar 2008. These wild ducks are common winter migratory birds
found in Hong Kong.

They had all tested negative for the H5 virus. Botulism is a disease
caused by toxins produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.
The bacteria can be found in soil and lake sediment. Sporadic
outbreaks of avian botulism, usually involving migrating waterfowl,
are well documented globally and are usually seasonal in nature.

The department will continue its wild-bird monitoring and
surveillance. To report dead or sick birds, call 1823.

[Botulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types.
Type E toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes
intoxication in those feeding on them. It may also cause intoxication
in humans.

Type C toxin, on the other hand, is not related to fish. It occurs in
carcasses of dead invertebrates, in the flesh of birds dying of
botulism, and in maggots feeding on toxic carcasses. Type C, which is
regarded as responsible for most outbreaks in waterfowl worldwide,
does not pose a risk to humans.

Identification of the causative toxin in the outbreak in Hong Kong
will be helpful. - Mod.AS
