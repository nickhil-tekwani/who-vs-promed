[CCHF is caused by a tick-borne virus, _Orthonairovirus_, of the family Nairoviridae that causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever. The virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases occur in individuals involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Hospital-acquired infections have been reported due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies. Nosocomial transmission of CCHF through contact with body fluids of infected patients has been reported from different endemic countries including Pakistan.

In absence of an effective vaccine, and in view of the upcoming Eid ul Azha, which entails large scale movement and sale of cattle and livestock, taking measures to prevent exposure to the virus is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. Educating the general public about handling sacrificial animals and raw meat/blood, etc. can be helpful in minimising exposure and potential transmission.

WHO recommendations to prevent CCHF are available at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/. - Mod.UBA
