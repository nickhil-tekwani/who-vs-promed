Measles once again endemic in the United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------
A total of 14 years after the local transmission
of measles was halted in the United Kingdom (UK),
the disease has once again become endemic,
according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA),
the public health body of England and Wales. In
an update on measles cases in its weekly bulletin
last week, the agency stated that, as a result of
almost a decade of low mumps-measles-rubella
(MMR) vaccination coverage across the UK, 'the
number of children susceptible to measles is now
sufficient to support the continuous spread of measles' [1].

In an earlier update, the HPA reported that all recent
indigenously-acquired cases with a genotype in England and Wales had
been found to have the same D4 sequence (MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07), a
genotype 1st identified in April 2007 and which is now endemic in the
UK [2].

In May [2008], a 17-year-old with underlying congenital
immunodeficiency died of acute measles infection, the first such
fatality in the UK since 2006. The strain was also
MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07, genotype D4 [more accurately clade D4; see
below].

The total number of confirmed measles cases in England and Wales so
far this year [2008] is 461. In Scotland, there have been 68 cases of
measles reported in 2008, of which 51 have been laboratory-confirmed
[3]. All of the cases in Scotland were either not immunised or of
unknown immunisation status. Only 2 of the cases were imported from
abroad, both from Pakistan.

The HPA has recommended that health services
exploit 'all possible opportunities' to offer MMR
vaccine to children who have not received 2
doses. The agency also stressed the necessity for
all healthcare workers in contact with vulnerable
patients to have documented immunity to measles.

Europe is facing a measles epidemic, with large
ongoing outbreaks for instance in Switzerland, Austria and Italy.

[This report records the unwelcome outcome of the
recent progressive decline in uptake of the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) triple vaccine.

The following information on interpretation of
the genotyping of measles virus is taken from
"The genotypes of measles virus from 1951-2004. A
Review of the temporal and geographical
distribution of measles virus genotypes 1951 - 2004:"
<http://www.vidrl.org.au/labsandunits/measles/meas_genotyping_intro.htm>.

Although measles virus is serologically
monotypic, the genetic characterization of
wild-type viruses has identified 8 clades (A ­
H), which have been divided into 22 genotypes and
one proposed genotype. Clades B, C, D, G and H
each contain multiple genotypes (B1 - 3, C1 - 2,
D1 - 10, G1 - 3, H1 - 2) while clades A, E and F
each contain a single genotype (A, E, F). The
sequences of the vaccine strains indicate that
the wild type viruses from which they were
derived were all members of genotype A.

There are no known biological differences between
viruses of different genotypes. Specific measles
genotypes are not associated with differences in
severity of disease, likelihood of developing
severe sequela such as subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis or inclusion body encephalitis,
or variability in sensitivity of laboratory diagnosis.

Analysis of the variability in the nucleotide
sequences of wild-type measles viruses has
enabled the use of molecular epidemiologic
techniques for measles surveillance. Genetic
characterization of viral isolates or RT-PCR
products is the only laboratory test that can
differentiate between vaccine-associated cases
and wild-type infection. - Mod.CP]
