Following is a translation of the video referred to in the Epidemiological situation report from 22 Jun from ProMED-mail Ebola update (42): Congo DR, cases, vaccine 20180625.5872757

Professor Dr. Gabriel Nsakaka:
"As you know, the Democratic Republic of Congo has since [8 May 2018] the 9th Ebola virus disease outbreak, which affected for the 4th time the province of Equateur. To date, the disease has been confirmed in 38 people, of whom 24 are cured and 14 dead, in addition to the suspect cases that are under investigation.

"In this issue, we will discuss how the ministry coordinates and organizes the response to this epidemic. As soon as the 1st cases were confirmed, a crisis committee met around the Minister of Health. An intervention chain was quickly structured taking into account the expertise available in the Democratic Republic of Congo in this area. The minister immediately appointed a national coordinating committee in Kinshasa and a provincial coordinating committee for field activities in Banaka."

Dr. Oli Lunga Minister of Health gives us the details in this interview element:
"Much more than a matter of national sovereignty, government leadership is above all a question of accountability to the Congolese people who expect us to provide answers to the problems they face. Ebola is first and foremost a public health problem. Ebola is not a humanitarian crisis. Then the danger in this kind of sanitary crisis of international scope is to be on the ground with a chaos related to the excessive number of partners. Here, thanks to the leadership of the government, we have been able to limit the number of partners, by limiting ourselves to those who brought us expertise in terms of logistics, techniques, medical expertise that could be complementary to ours. The result is real success. In the field we found ourselves, in fact with teams from the ministry who worked with the partners in the different commissions: that it, logistic commissions, medical care, psycho-social, communication. In short, in all the pillars of the response we ended up with mixed teams from the ministry and partners' teams."

Prof. Dr. Gabriel Nsakaka:
"You have realized that the response to Ebola is multisectoral and involves several areas of expertise. You have the intervention of epidemiologists, emergency doctors, hygiene and sanitation technicians, socio-anthropologists, psychoanalysts, logisticians who benefit from a large contribution of communication professionals. Of course, this excellent work requires many material and financial resources mobilized first by the government of the Republic and then supplemented with the support of our partners. It is therefore team work under the direction of the Ministry of Health that allows us to control and control the situation of this 9th Ebola outbreak.

"However, we recall the 5 golden rules to be observed to reduce the spread of the Ebola virus disease:
1- stay calm
2- hygiene: wash hands with soap and water; if you do not have soap, use ashes
3- food: especially for hunters, they do not have to bring back to the community dead animals found in the forest without anyone knowing why
4- contact with patients: we must assist them but with great care with gloves and all protective equipment
5- for health professionals working in emergency and counseling services, in the context of Ebola, it takes a lot of caution and vigilance
And finally, there is a free number 47 22 22 which is available to the community to ask all your questions and you will have answers to all your concerns.

[translated from the video by Constentine Diemme, NY]

[The 5 rules of conduct are basic rules for infectious disease outbreaks (except no. 3 which pertains to consumption of wild animals), and clear enough to be able to be followed by the community. It is very true that response to this 9th outbreak of Ebola in the DRC has been a successful integrated team effort with excellent leadership from the DRC MoH. - Mod.LK]

Last DRC Ebola contacts approach end of monitoring period.

No new lab-confirmed Ebola infections were reported from the DRC over the past 3 days, though surveillance workers continue to report more suspected cases from the remote hot spots, while tests rule out earlier suspected cases.

The DRC's health ministry said today [25 Jun 2018] that as of yesterday [24 Jun 2018], 2 new suspected cases were reported, 1 from Bikoro and the other from Iboko. Tests on 4 previously reported suspected cases were negative, bringing the overall outbreak total to 55 cases, 38 of them confirmed, 14 probable, and 3 suspected. The number of deaths remains at 28.

The illness onset from the last confirmed case was [2 Jun 2018], and the monitoring period for the patient's contacts is winding down. In its update today [25 Jun 2018], the health ministry said the 21-day monitoring period for the last patients will end on [27 Jun 2018]. A [22 Jun 2018] situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said as of [20 Jun 2018], 1527 contacts had completed their follow-up periods, and only 179 were still being monitored.

Vaccination continues in the affected outbreak areas, and so far 3280 have been immunized with the experimental Ebola vaccine VSV-EBOV. Most of the people vaccinated are from the 2 hardest hit areas, Bikoro and Iboko, both in a heavily forested area of Equateur Province.

In research developments, the Journal of Infectious Diseases today [25 Jun 2018] published several reports on Ebola. For example, a team that conducted a literature review of epidemiologic research and social and behavioral research published during West Africa's Ebola outbreak developed a roadmap for integrating the 2 areas to improve research efforts in future outbreaks [Ref.1]. They said their findings support an action plan that involves data collection on community attitudes, behavior, and responses in real time.

Meanwhile, another study explored antibody response in nonhuman primates vaccinated with different Ebola vaccine platforms in an effort to understand more about correlates of protection [Ref.2]:

Background. Several vaccine platforms have been successfully evaluated for prevention of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) in nonhuman primates and humans. Despite remarkable efficacy by multiple vaccines, the immunological correlates of protection against EVD are incompletely understood.

Methods. We systematically evaluated the antibody response to various EBOV proteins in 79 nonhuman primates vaccinated with various EBOV vaccine platforms. We evaluated the serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers against EBOV glycoprotein (GP), the ability of the vaccine-induced antibodies to bind GP at acidic pH or to displace ZMapp, and virus neutralization titers. The correlation of these outcomes with survival from EVD was evaluated by appropriate statistical methods.

Results. Irrespective of the vaccine platform, protection from EVD strongly correlated with anti-GP IgG titers. The GP-directed antibody levels required for protection in animals vaccinated with virus-like particles (VLPs) lacking nucleoprotein (NP) was significantly higher than animals immunized with NP-containing VLPs or adenovirus-expressed GP, platforms that induce strong T-cell responses. Furthermore, protective immune responses correlated with anti-GP antibody binding strength at acidic pH, neutralization of GP-expressing pseudovirions, and the ability to displace ZMapp components from GP.

Conclusions. These findings suggest key quantitative and qualitative attributes of antibody response to EVD vaccines as potential correlates of protection.

Another group reported the results of cell-culture screening for 12 possible Ebola treatments [Ref.3], which found multiple synergistic pairs.

Background. A need to develop therapeutics to treat Ebola virus disease patients in remote and resource-challenged settings remains in the wake of the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa. Toward this goal, we screened drugs under consideration as treatment options and other drugs of interest, most being small molecules approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Drugs demonstrating in vitro antiviral activity were advanced for evaluation in combinations because of advantages often provided by drug cocktails.

Methods. Drugs were screened for blockade of Ebola virus infection in cultured cells. A total of 12 drugs were tested in all (78 pair-wise) combinations, and 3 were tested in a subset of combinations.

Results. Multiple synergistic drug pairs emerged, with the majority comprising 2 entry inhibitors. For the pairs of entry inhibitors studied, synergy was demonstrated at the level of virus entry into host cells. Highly synergistic pairs included aripiprazole/piperacetazine, sertraline/toremifene, sertraline/bepridil, and amodiaquine/clomiphene.

Conclusions. Our study shows the feasibility of identifying pairs of approved drugs that synergistically block Ebola virus infection in cell cultures. We discuss our findings in terms of the theoretic ability of these or alternate combinations to reach therapeutic levels. Future research will assess selected combinations in small-animal models of Ebola virus disease.

Event Description. The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the DRC. On [21 June 2018], no new suspected EVD cases were reported in Equateur Province. A total of 9 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. Since [17 May 2018], no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko Health Zone developed symptoms on [2 Jun 2018], was confirmed on [6 Jun 2018] and died on [9 Jun 2018]. Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 52 EVD cases and 28 deaths have been reported, as of [21 Jun 2018]. Of the 52 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed and 14 were probable cases (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing). Of the 52 confirmed and probable cases, 28 died - giving a case fatality rate of 53.9 percent. As many as 27 (52 percent) confirmed and probable cases were from Iboko, followed by 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro and 4 (8 percent) from Wangata health zones. Five healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths. The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing, with a total of 1527 contacts having completed the mandatory 21-day follow-up period. As of [21 Jun 2018], 179 contacts were under follow up and all (100 percent) were reached on the reporting date. If no new cases are reported, the last contacts of the known confirmed or probable cases will complete.

Public Health Actions. See URL above for numerous actions.

Situation interpretation. Over one month into the response, further spread of EVD has largely been contained. The situation in Bikoro and Wangata (Mbandaka city) health zones remains stable, with the last confirmed EVD cases reported in mid-May 2018. The situation in Iboko Health Zone, especially remote communities in Itipo health area, is being closely observed while intense response interventions continue. However, in spite of the progress made, there should be no room for laxity and complacency until the outbreak is controlled. The focus of the response remains on intensive surveillance, including active case finding, investigation of suspected cases and alerts and contact tracing.
