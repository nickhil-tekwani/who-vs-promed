Bird flu fails, for now, to migrate
-------------------------------------
Bird flu appears more likely to wing its away around the globe by
plane than by migrating birds. Scientists have been unable to link
the spread of the virus to migratory patterns, suggesting that the
thousands of wild birds that have died, primarily waterfowl and shore
birds, are not primary transmitters of bird flu.
If that holds true, it would suggest that shipments of domestic
chickens, ducks and other poultry represent a far greater threat than
does the movement of wild birds on the wing.
It also would underscore the need to pursue the virus in poultry
farms and markets rather than in wild populations of birds if a
possible pandemic is to be checked, U.S. and European experts said.
The H5N1 strain has infected millions of poultry throughout Asia and
parts of Europe since 2003. The virus also has killed at least 71
people, many of whom had close contact with poultry.
To date, the virus hasn't been shown to spread from person to person,
but many fear that it could mutate into a strain that could,
potentially killing millions in a global pandemic.
While the prospect that migrating birds could carry the virus
worldwide still worries health authorities, that sort of scenario
doesn't appear to be playing out.
"There is more and more evidence building up that wild migratory
birds do play some role in spreading the virus, but, personally, I
believe -- and others agree -- that it's not a major role," said Ward
Hagemeijer, a wild bird ecologist with Wetlands International, a
conservation group in Wageningen, Netherlands. "If we would assume --
based on this evidence -- that wild birds would be a major carrier of
the disease, we would expect a more dramatic outbreak of the disease
all over the world."
Reports this summer and fall [2005] of the spread of the H5N1 strain
strongly suggested wild birds were carrying the disease outward from
Asia as they followed migration patterns that crisscross the Earth.
The timing and location of outbreaks in western China, Russia,
Romania, Turkey and Croatia seemed to point to wild birds en route to
winter grounds.
That put places like Alaska, where birds from the Old and New Worlds
gather each summer to create what some call an "international viral
transfer center," on alert that the virus could arrive this coming
spring. And from there, species like the buff-breasted sandpiper and
others that split their time between North and South America could in
theory transport the virus further a field.
Since the early fall, however, there have been only scattered reports
of more outbreaks. The disease has been glaringly absent, for
example, from western Europe and the Nile delta, where many presumed
it would crop up, as migrating birds returned to winter roosts.
That suggests the strain has evolved to specifically exploit domestic
poultry, whose short lives spent in tight flocks mean a virus has to
skip quickly from bird to bird if it is to survive, said Hon Ip, a
virologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health
Center in Madison, Wisconsin.
That also means that while the virus can pass from domestic to wild
birds, the latter may not be suited as transmitters of the strain, at
least so far. "By the timing of the spread and the pattern of
outbreaks within a country and between countries, it does not make
sense relative to a role for migratory birds as a means of spreading
the virus," Ip said.
For example, the virus killed thousands of bar-headed geese in May
and June 2005 at Lake Qinghai in western China. The deaths raised
immediate fears that the virus was on the move, jumping among hosts
in the wild. In the 19 Aug 2005 issue of the journal Science,
scientists wrote that the virus "has the potential to be a global
threat."
But Ip and others suggest the lake is not as remote and pristine as
initially portrayed, and that poultry raised in the area could have
been the source of the flu strain that killed the geese.
"It is still patchy -- the pattern of outbreaks -- to really make a
very definitive link between migratory birds and the disease," said
Marco Barbieri, the scientific and technical officer for the United
Nations Environmental Program's convention on migratory species in
Bonn, Germany.
Experts caution that wild birds cannot be ruled out as future
transmitters of the H5N1 strain, which has yet to be detected in
North America. Migratory birds, for example, have been clearly
implicated in the spread of West Nile virus, which has killed at
least 762 people in the U.S. since 2002.
The H5N1 flu strain already is known to be lethal to nearly 60
species of birds; further mutations of the strain could allow it to
infect many more. One of the latest victims is the Asian tree
sparrow, according to a study published in the December 2005 issue of
the Journal of Virology.
"The dogma right now is it is the waterfowl -- ducks, sandpipers,
gulls, plovers -- essentially any bird that is water-associated,"
said A. Townsend Peterson, a University of Kansas professor and
curator of the school's Natural History Museum and Biodiversity
Research Center. "I will predict that that dogma will eventually fall
by the wayside. I will guess that what we will eventually see is that
avian influenza is much more widely distributed among birds and that
land birds also play a significant role in the picture."
That has made increasing the understanding of the migratory routes
followed by birds more important than ever. It also draws attention
to how little is still known about the routes.
The conventional maps that show flyways as fat arrows that can span
continents and oceans lack the nuance and detail of how birds really
move, including when and in what numbers, experts said. The maps also
can gloss over how migratory patterns can vary among subspecies.
Traditional methods like bird watching and banding are helping flesh
out the maps. And now, tracking by satellite or radio, as well as
genetic and isotopic sampling, are playing an increased role in
pinning down the finer details of where birds travel and when.
In places like Alaska, where millions of individual birds
representing more than 200 species arrive each spring, scientists
readily confess the situation isn't all clear. "Fuzzy would be an
operative word. We are in the process of defining the Alaskan
migration system, and it is remarkably complex," said Kevin Winker,
curator of birds and an associate professor at the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks.
In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Agriculture Department plan next year [2006]
to step up their surveillance of wild flocks of birds.
In the past several weeks, scientists have winnowed down their list
of birds they want to keep tabs on, said Dirk Derksen, a biologist
with the USGS Alaska Science Center in Anchorage. All spend at least
part of the year in Asia. Early detection [of infection in such
birds] would buy time in forestalling the further spread of the
virus, a situation no one wants. "Initially, wild birds are primarily
victims. Someday, they may become vectors. We don't know how that
will play out," Ip said. "What I would like to see is the virus
stopped before it gets to America, so we don't see the last reel of
this film played out in North America."

UN vet dismisses fish farming as bird flu risk
-----------------------------------------------
The widespread use of poultry excrement to fertilize fish farms does
not greatly increase the risk of bird flu, a senior United Nations
expert said on Wednesday [28 Dec 2005]. Joseph Domenech, chief
veterinary officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
dismissed a wildlife group's claim that using animal feces to boost
fish farming was a serious danger.
Global environmental group Birdlife International said wild birds
have been unfairly blamed for the virus. It says human practices like
the trade in poultry and wild birds, and modern agricultural methods,
probably play a major role in spreading the virus.
The FAO, which is monitoring the global spread of bird flu, supports
the practice whereby feces from farm animals are used to boost fish
production. The excrement is used to boost nutrients in water for the
organisms the fish feed on.
Domenech told Reuters there was a theoretical risk of fish farms
becoming a source of infection if excrement from infected poultry
were poured into the ponds. It could create "an infection outbreak in
the environment, in the water, which can be the source of
contamination of other birds which come to drink there." He added,
however, that as long as the correct surveillance was in place,
infection should not happen, or could be dealt with quickly if it
did. "To ban these systems of raising livestock, which are extremely
efficient and irreplaceable to feed the populations in those
countries, would be like banning the raising of ducks because ducks
are considered one of the main sources."
The FAO, which has warned that Europe could be at risk of bird flu
when migratory birds return from the south in spring, is tracking
outbreaks of the flu to determine how it is spread. "Today, it's
impossible to say that wild birds are not playing a role," said
Domenech. "We hope in 3 to 4 months, at the end of this migration
period, we will see better."
