The Department for Public Health (DPH) today, 17 Aug 2012, reported that cantaloupes tested in the state public health laboratory carry the same strain of salmonella associated with a statewide outbreak that health officials say is still ongoing.

The salmonellosis outbreak, which has sickened at least 50 Kentuckians and been associated with 2 deaths, began in early July 2012. Through an epidemiological investigation and confirmatory lab testing, Kentucky public health officials determined that cantaloupes, which evidence indicates were grown in south western Indiana but purchased in Kentucky, carried the same strain determined to be the cause of an ongoing outbreak of infection. Salmonellosis cases caused by the outbreak strain have also been reported in other states. In addition, investigation is also continuing into other clusters of salmonella cases in Kentucky, which may be linked to cantaloupe or watermelon consumption.

"Foodborne illness is a serious threat to public health. Consumers are advised to avoid eating cantaloupes from south western Indiana, especially if they are at heightened risk for complications from salmonella infection," said acting public health commissioner Steve Davis, MD. "In addition, health care providers are encouraged to be mindful of patients who may have symptoms consistent with salmonellosis and report all cases to the local health department."

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in affected states and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate the ongoing outbreak, including tracing the source of the affected melons and shipments of melons that may have been contaminated. A likely source of the outbreak is cantaloupes grown in southwestern Indiana region and distributed to stores in Kentucky. No Kentucky-grown cantaloupes have been associated with this outbreak.

Salmonella can occasionally be found on contaminated produce items, so all produce should be thoroughly washed and scrubbed before eating. In general, the FDA recommends thoroughly washing and scrubbing the rinds of all cantaloupes and melons prior to cutting and slicing, and to keep sliced melons refrigerated prior to eating.

[Growing on the ground, melons such as watermelon and cantaloupe can be externally contaminated with enteric pathogens by being exposed to sewage water. The organisms can be introduced into the part of the melon that is eaten when the rind is cut.

The serotype and extent of the outbreak are not stated. - Mod.LL
