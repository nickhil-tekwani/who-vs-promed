The southwest China province of Guizhou has reported an outbreak of H5N1 [avian influenza infection] in poultry, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced Thursday [2 Jan 2014].

Some chickens at a farm in a village of Libo County in the prefecture of Qiannan in Guizhou showed symptoms of suspected avian flu and 8500 chickens died on 27 Dec 2013.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed the epidemic was H5N1 bird flu after testing samples collected at the farm, according to the MOA.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 23 067 chickens have been culled and safely disposed of to prevent the disease from spreading, according to the MOA.

[China has already reported to the OIE the new HPAI H5N1 outbreak described above and its stamping out; see the immediate notification, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14598.

The immediate notification included the following outbreak data:

Location: Yijue village, Libo, Qiannan, Guizhou province.
Started: 27 Dec 2013
Pre-confirmed: 2 Jan 2014
Submitted to OIE: 3 Jan 2014
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 31 567 / 9300 / 8500 / 23 067 / 0

All the cases (9300) were recorded in chickens; 18 250 chickens, 4569 ducks, and 248 geese were destroyed.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 29.46 percent / 26.93 percent / 91.40 percent / 100 percent.
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

The very high case fatality rate is typical for HPAI outbreaks in susceptible birds (chickens).

The previous HPAI H5N1 outbreak in poultry took place in a small holding in Tibet. Reportedly, it started on 13 May 2013 and was declared resolved on 18 Jun 2013. Out of 376 birds there were 35 cases (died). The 341 remaining chickens and 31 geese were destroyed (see ProMED-mail post 20130513.1710726).
