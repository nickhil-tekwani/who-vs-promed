The Health Bureau issued a press release today [13 Jul 2022] stating that the 1st case of hantavirus syndrome in Taipei this year [2022] is a woman in her 40s, and there are a total of 3 confirmed cases nationwide.

The Health Bureau pointed out that the case had developed symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and mild diarrhea since 4 Jun [2022]. When she went to the hospital for medical treatment on 7 Jun [2022], she was reported as a suspected case and was admitted to the hospital. After recovery and discharge, she was discharged from the hospital. On 7 Jul [2022], she returned to the clinic for another test and confirmed the diagnosis.

Zhang Huimei, head of the disease control section of the Health Bureau, told the Central News Agency that after the case was diagnosed, 3 family members who were also likely to be exposed to rodents have been listed, and all 3 of them have no suspected symptoms at present.

Zhang Huimei said that the case reported that she found rodent excrement when cleaning the house. Although she wore a mask and gloves at the time, it may be because the mask did not completely cover the mouth and nose that the infection was caused by inhalation. She reminded the public to clean up the environment where rodents may be hiding. Wear a mask and gloves, and open doors and windows for air circulation.

The Health Bureau stated that hantavirus syndrome is a category 2 statutory infectious disease caused by a hantavirus. There is no human-to-human transmission.

The Health Bureau pointed out that the incubation period of hantavirus infection can be up to 2 months. Early symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and bleeding. Later, acute renal failure and respiratory distress may occur. If people have related symptoms, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Take the initiative to inform of relevant animal contact history and travel history.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that hantavirus hemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic infectious disease, and implementing the 3 measures of "do not let mice come, do not let mice live, and do not let mice eat" is the most effective way to prevent hantavirus [infections].

[This is the 3rd case of a hantavirus infection in Taiwan this year [2022]. Fortunately, this last case has fully recovered. As noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there were 10 cases last year (2021) and now 3 this year so far.

The hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rodent identified. However, one possibility is Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rat involved in the patient's residence was a brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in Asia. People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur by rat bite.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
