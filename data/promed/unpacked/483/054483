Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) [Doctors Without Borders] is closing most of its cholera treatment centers in Yemen, saying the outbreak there has peaked. More than 884 000 people are reported to have contracted the disease since April 2017, and another 2184 have died. MSF said the outbreak was not over, but that cases had decreased significantly. Only 567 new patients sought treatment at the medical charity's centers during the second week of October 2017, down from 11 139 in the 3rd week of June 2017.

Yemen's health service has been unable to cope with the outbreak, with more than half of all medical facilities closed due to damage sustained during months of conflict between pro-government forces and Houthi rebels. Hospitals and clinics have also faced crippling shortages of staff, medicines, fuel and equipment, while damage to infrastructure has also left 15.7 million people cut off from regular access to clean water and sanitation, increasing the likelihood of cholera spreading.

Since the beginning of the outbreak on 27 Apr 2017, MSF has admitted more than 103 000 patients to 37 cholera treatment centers and oral rehydration points. But the charity said only 9% of the patients admitted at treatment centers last week needed inpatient care, and that only a limited number had symptoms that corresponded with the cholera case definition - acute watery diarrhoea with or without vomiting. As a result, some MSF centres have closed or are in the process of closing.

"The cholera outbreak is not over but it is no longer our medical priority in Yemen," said Ghassan Abou Chaar, the MSF head of mission in Yemen. "However, this should not eclipse the dire health situation of millions of Yemenis who are unable to access basic primary healthcare."

Mr Abou Chaar said it was now essential to implement a proper monitoring system to prevent a resurgence of the cholera outbreak.

On 19 Oct 2017, the WHO said data indicated the number of suspected cases of cholera was declining, having reduced from almost 51 000 cases in a week at the outbreak's peak to 35 000 cases per week in the 1st 3 weeks of this month [October 2017].

Children under the age of 5 represented 26 percent of the cases and almost 17 percent of deaths, but people over the age of 60 accounted for 31 percent of deaths, it added.

[It is encouraging that the number of new cases appears to be decreasing but with "35 000 cases per week in the 1st 3 weeks of this month [October 2017]" is still quite a large number. The underlying conditions in Yemen remain, a war-torn environment with a destroyed infrastructure, so that flares may well occur. As previously noted, the quite low case fatality rate in the epidemic suggest that not all of the cases are indeed related to _Vibrio cholerae_. - Mod.LL
