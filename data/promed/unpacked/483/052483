In the last 2 weeks, 15 people have been treated for dengue fever, spurring
health officials to step up efforts to rid the city of mosquitoes that
spread the disease.
Dengue fever is a viral illness spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, joint and muscle pain,
nausea, vomiting and a skin rash.
"There's never been an outbreak of dengue fever [in Laredo] of this
significance to our knowledge," Jerry Robinson, health department director,
said Friday.
Aross the river from Laredo, in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, 106 cases of dengue
fever have been confirmed, Mr. Robinson said, but the number is thought to
be much higher.
The local health department is waiting for the Texas Department of Health to
confirm its test results. As of Friday, two cases had been verified, said
Texas Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride.
Laredo has fewer cases than its sister city [in Mexico] because of an active
insecticide campaign, fewer containers kept outside and screens that keep
the mosquitoes out of homes.

This morning on the weather forecast, the station took time to air a report
from the national weather service, in which they were reporting that this
year may be the worst in 30 years for hurricanes. While I don't recall the
exact numbers, I think 49 tropical storms are predicted, 11 I think are
suppose to become hurricanes, one is predicted for landfall E. Coast (this I
do recall), and I think 3 were expected to hit the gulf coast.
There is one disturbance sitting on the Yucatan Peninsular that is expected
to create a tropical storm later into the day/week as it moves to the base
of Texas.
Given this information, mosquito populations could expand over wide areas.
I have never known the critters to be in short supply in Lubbock, however
could the winds carry the things this far north, or spread them throughout
the valley, and up in to the big thicket area?

The recent weather in central and South Texas has been dry. Vegetation has
been turning brown and there are few small accumulations of water around.
The milder temperatures and frequent rains that Texas had during June and
early July have given way to hot [95-100Â°F] weather with very little rain
and very high drying potential.
Given these weather conditions, I'll stick my neck out and guess that there
won't be many more cases of dengue in Texas this year.
