The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has reported a new
confirmed human case of avian influenza in a 38-year-old female from
Elfath District, Assiut Governorate. Her symptoms started with fever
and headache on 14 Mar 2009. She was admitted to Assiut Fever Hospital
on 14 Mar 2009, where she was started on oseltamivir the same day and
remains in a stable condition.

Infection with H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed on 18 Mar 2009 by
the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory. Investigations into
the source of her infection indicate a history of close contact with
dead and sick poultry prior to becoming ill.

Of the 59 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 23 have been fatal.
