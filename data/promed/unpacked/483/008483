Countries with imported cases and no local transmission

France ex Maldives. 9 Jan 2020. We report a confirmed case of chikungunya [virus] infection in a 35-year-old patient with onset of symptoms on 15 Dec 2019 upon returning from a 15 day-trip in Sri Lanka and Maldives. He spent 9 days in Maldives, cruising for the purpose of diving. The patient consulted on 20 Dec [2019] at the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Mediterranee Infection, Marseille, France and presented with fever, headaches, pharyngitis, skin rash and arthralgia (wrists, elbows, fingers, ankles). Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR in blood samples and serology (IgM positive, IgG negative). Other possible infections were ruled out by PCR and serology, notably dengue and Zika [virus] infections. Retrospective analysis of his travel pattern strongly suggests that the infection was acquired from Dhangethi Island (Alif Dhaal Atoll). According to the patient, 2 diving partners presented similar symptoms with onset on 12 and 13 Dec [2019], respectively. According to the Maldives Health Protection Agency, in 2019 and as of 5 Dec [2019], there have been 1615 cases reported in the country. This represents an increase of 156 cases since the previous report a month prior. Dhangethy Island is a popular tourist area; additional cases in travelers are likely to occur.

France ex Djibouti. 30 Dec 2019. (Reported) A female traveler coming back from Djibouti on 12 Dec 2019 developed fever, myalgia and arthralgia at her arrival in France. According her clinical features, a blood sample was collected the day after. Viral RNA of chikungunya was detected in serum. This case is the 1st imported case of chikungunya acquired in the Republic of Djibouti, Horn of Africa.

This case reflects an autochthonous circulation of this arbovirus in Djibouti where suspected cases (intense joint aches and fever) have been unofficially mentioned for weeks in Djibouti town. This circulation is not unexpected, as a massive chikungunya outbreak started in July 2019 in Dire Dawa, a neighbouring area in Ethiopia, with more than 50 000 cases as of 10 Nov [2019] according to WHO reports. A coming chikungunya outbreak in Djibouti is feared considering the recent rains and flooding in Djibouti and the current activity of _Aedes aegypti_ in the town at this season.

Russia ex Thailand. 28 Jan 2020. (Conf.)
The boy, 13 years old, was in Thailand (Phuket island) from 10 -20 Jan 2020 with his family (other members are healthy). They lived in a hotel. He hasn't been vaccinated against typhoid fever, Japanese encephalitis, or TBE [tick-borne encephalitis] and didn't take anti-malaria medication. His illness onset was on 20 Jan 2020 with a body temperature of 40 C [104 F] and vomiting 3 times during the 1st day. Duration of fever: 4 days. He had diffuse skin hyperthermia and pain in small joints (hands and feet). In blood tests, there were: leukopenia (3300/mkl), relative lymphocytosis 50.5%, normal level of PLT (183*10^9/l), elevation of ALT 50 EU/l, AST 45 EU/l, CRP 27 mg/l.
Diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR (RNA CHIKV positive in blood and saliva - positive, RNA-DENV, RNA-ZIKV - negative) and MAC-ELISA (IgM-CHIKV - positive, IgM-DENV, IgM-ZIKV, IgM-WNV - negative).
We did not find any eye damage and polylimphadenopathia.
