Abstract
---------
Among the many anthropogenic changes that impact humans and wildlife, one of the most pervasive but least understood is light pollution. Although detrimental physiological and behavioural effects resulting from exposure to light at night are widely appreciated, the impacts of light pollution on infectious disease risk have not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that artificial light at night (ALAN) extends the infectious-to-vector period of the house sparrow (_Passer domesticus_), an urban-dwelling avian reservoir host of West Nile virus (WNV). Sparrows exposed to ALAN maintained transmissible viral titres for 2 days longer than controls but did not experience greater WNV-induced mortality during this window. Transcriptionally, ALAN altered the expression of gene regulatory networks including key hubs (OASL, PLBD1 and TRAP1) and effector genes known to affect WNV dissemination (SOCS). Despite mounting anti-viral immune responses earlier, transcriptomic signatures indicated that ALAN-exposed individuals probably experienced pathogen-induced damage and immunopathology, potentially due to evasion of immune effectors. A simple mathematical modelling exercise indicated that ALAN-induced increases of host infectious-to-vector period could increase WNV outbreak potential by approximately 41%. ALAN probably affects other host and vector traits relevant to transmission, and additional research is needed to advise the management of zoonotic diseases in light-polluted areas.

[West Nile virus has been detected in several species of birds in Europe and the Americas where they have been shown to be important reservoirs and disseminators of this virus. The work reported above illustrates how environmental conditions under which infectious blood meal availability is determined experimentally in birds can affect the results. An increase of 41% in the time that a West Nile virus-infected sparrow can provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes in nature would be significant epidemiologically. It would be of interest to know if the extended light also changed the bird's susceptibility to mosquito bites with increased or decreased behavioral avoidance of mosquito bites or if the light increased to decreased vector mosquito host seeking. - Mod.TY]
