[1] Risk of neurodegenerative disorders

COVID-19-positive outpatients are at a far increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders compared with individuals who tested negative for the virus, a new study presented today at the 8th European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress has shown [see reference below].

The research study, which analyzed the health records of over half of the Danish population, found that those who had tested positive for COVID-19 were at a much higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischaemic stroke.

Out of 919 731 individuals that were tested for COVID-19 within the study, researchers found that the 43 375 people who tested positive had a 3.5 times increased risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, 2.6 times with Parkinson's disease, 2.7 times with ischaemic stroke, and 4.8 times with intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain). While neuroinflammation may contribute to an accelerated development of neurodegenerative disorders, the authors also highlighted the implications of the scientific focus on long-term sequelae after COVID-19 (so-called long COVID).

The study analyzed in- and outpatients in Denmark between February 2020 and November 2021, as well as influenza patients from the corresponding pre-pandemic period. Researchers used statistical techniques to calculate relative risk, and results were stratified for hospitalization status, age, sex, and comorbidities.

Dr. Pardis Zarifkar, lead author from the Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, explained: "More than 2 years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise nature and evolution of the effects of COVID-19 on neurological disorders remained uncharacterized. Previous studies have established an association with neurological syndromes, but until now it is unknown whether COVID-19 also influences the incidence of specific neurological diseases and whether it differs from other respiratory infections."

The increased risk of most neurological diseases was, however, no higher in COVID-19-positive patients than in people who had been diagnosed with influenza or other respiratory illnesses. COVID-19 patients did have a 1.7 times increased risk of ischaemic stroke in comparison to influenza and bacterial pneumonia in patients over 80 years of age.

The frequency of other neurodegenerative illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and narcolepsy did not increase after COVID-19, influenza, or pneumonia.

Dr. Pardis Zarifkar added, "We found support for an increased risk of being diagnosed with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19-positive compared to COVID-negative patients, which must be confirmed or refuted by large registry studies in the near future. Reassuringly, apart from ischemic stroke, most neurological disorders do not appear to be more frequent after COVID-19 than after influenza or community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

"These findings will help to inform our understanding of the long-term effect of COVID-19 on the body and the role that infections play in neurodegenerative diseases and stroke," [Dr. Zarifkar said].

[It is somewhat reassuring that, apart from ischemic stroke, most neurological disorders do not appear to be more frequent after COVID-19 than after influenza or community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. But larger studies need to be conducted to support increased risk of being diagnosed with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19-positive compared to COVID-negative patients. - Mod.LK]

[2] Australia: cognitive decline
Date: Fri 24 Jun 2022

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-25/long-covid-clinic-st-vincents-cognitive-decline/101178450


For the doctors at the St Vincent's long COVID clinic, teasing out where underlying medical conditions end and long COVID begins is a key challenge.

"This is a 2-way street. We're learning a lot about this illness as much as the patients are," [says respiratory specialist Anthony Byrne]. "We've been treating patients for a while, but this is very much a learning experience for us as well to know what works and what doesn't."

St Vincent's long COVID clinic offers comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment. Respiratory and rehabilitation specialists are part of the team, along with a neurologist, a psychologist, and a physiotherapist.

Prospective patients apply to the clinic through their GPs, which can occasionally be a roadblock, says Elli Asgary, the clinical nurse consultant who processes the admissions.

"Some doctors do not believe in long COVID, so [some patients] find it very hard to get the referral from their own GP. So they have to change their GP to get the referral."

The respiratory specialist Dr Byrne is surprised by this scepticism. "Sometimes if you're not the person with the symptom, it can be easy to brush it off as 'Well, you know, just get over it,'" he says. "[But] when you see enough of these patients, you realise that they have these symptoms that they're not making up. They're legitimate symptoms."

He says up to 100 symptoms have been linked with long COVID, but the most commonly reported are fatigue, cognitive difficulties, breathing problems, heart palpitations, and lasting changes to taste and smell.

Dr Byrne says COVID is "not just any virus."

"It's a really inflammatory virus ... It causes systemic inflammation. That inflammation is in blood vessels. They affect the liver, the heart, the kidneys, the brain. They just go around the body everywhere, because the blood obviously goes everywhere within the body."

A recent patient at the clinic was a fit young man in his 30s who contracted a mild case of COVID in January [2022]. He still suffers from fatigue and an inability to concentrate.

A scan, ordered 5 months after his initial infection, revealed he has 2 blood clots on his lungs.

"Which is a life-threatening condition, you know, potentially," says Dr Byrne.

"Ha ha ha -- are you serious?"

That's the response from one of the United States's leading long COVID researchers, Ziyad Al-Aly, to the question of whether it exists. "Long COVID is absolutely real. And long COVID is not even a small problem. It's a serious, serious public health crisis," he says.

Dr Al-Aly is a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, and the chief of research for the St Louis Health Care System. He's also part of a panel tasked by the White House to recommend a national response to long COVID.

"The long-term consequences of long COVID are going to be profound on society just because of the scale of it.

"There are millions of people in the US, millions of people in the UK. You know, quite a number of people in Australia will be affected with long COVID.

"Some of these people will not be able to return to work, will not be able to maintain employment."

Dr Al-Aly was lead researcher on a study of a vast trove of US military veteran medical data that suggests that vaccination provides minimal protection against long COVID.

"Vaccines reduce, but only modestly, by 15%, the risk of long COVID," he says. "They reduce the risk of long COVID, but do not eliminate the risk."

A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States found that around 20% of people who had COVID later had symptoms that could be attributed to long COVID.

Dr Al-Aly says that statistic would also apply to Australia, meaning well over a million Australians could be affected, whether they're aware of it or not.

Back in the clinic, [physiotherapist Irina Grassi gives instruction in tai chi to a patient].

"... there's "a lot of evidence that tai chi is helpful for people both psychologically and physically," [she says]. "There's a big emphasis on coordinating the breath with movement, which can help facilitate a relaxation response."

In a shared journey with their patients, the clinic is throwing everything at long COVID, tackling each symptom as it presents.

"There's a lot of unknowns and that's the scary part of it," [one patient says].

However, neuropsychologist and associate professor Dr Lucette Cysique says their research based on the ADAPT study could offer fresh hope for future treatments.

"There is a potential pathway for treatment, because there are currently clinical trials to modulate the kynurenine pathway, for example." That's the pathway to the brain that's agitated by the coronavirus in a similar way to HIV.

She says drugs may be an option to suppress the body's overactive immune response.

Dr Byrne explains that normally with a syndrome that affects multiple organs, "rheumatologists would put [patients] on immunosuppressive medications to suppress that immune response."

"Whether that could be possible for some people suffering long COVID is, at this point, unclear, but I think it is something that we need to research and look at doing specific clinical trials [for]."

For now, those with long COVID have to deal with what current medicine has to offer, drawing on multiple disciplines and treating each symptom as it arises.

Around the country, most treatment of long COVID is still focused on the condition as a respiratory illness, according to Dr Byrne. However, other states now have dedicated long COVID clinics with some taking a multidisciplinary approach.

He believes that the holistic approach practised by St Vincent's is vital.

"Being sort of both rehab and respiratory, psychology, physio, I think is a little bit unique."

"I'm hopeful that other hospitals, tertiary hospitals, will be able to develop that sort of model."

[3] News roundup
Date: Sun 26 Jun 2022
Source: Daily Sabah via Reuters [edited]
https://www.dailysabah.com/life/health/covid-19-roundup-what-long-covid-paxlovid-rebound-symptoms-tell-us


In this week's roundup, the latest scientific research on the coronavirus suggests that some long COVID-19 cases may indicate the body's response to still existing SARS-CoV-2 virus and rebound symptoms of COVID-19 patients who took Paxlovid for 5 days during treatment may be due to a need for a longer treatment with the pills.

Some long COVID patients still have virus in blood
---------------------------------------------------------
Some cases of long COVID-19 may be the immune system's response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection lurking somewhere in the body, new findings from a small study suggest [see citation below].

Researchers analyzed multiple plasma samples collected over time from 63 patients with COVID-19, including 37 who went on to develop long COVID-19. In the majority of those with long COVID-19, the spike protein from the surface of the virus was detectable for up to 12 months, whereas it was not present in plasma samples from recovered patients without lasting symptoms. Spike protein circulating in the blood could mean "a reservoir of active virus persists in the body," the researchers said in a paper posted on medRxiv last week ahead of peer review.

Exactly where that reservoir might be is not clear from this study. Researchers said they have previously found active virus in the gastrointestinal tract of children weeks after the initial coronavirus infection, and other researchers have found genetic evidence of the virus "in multiple anatomic sites up to 7 months after symptom onset."

If the results can be confirmed in larger studies, the presence of spike protein in the blood long after the initial infection may be one way to diagnose long COVID-19, the researchers said.

[The citation for the paper referenced above follows:
Swank Z, Senussi Y, Alter G, et al. Persistent circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike is associated with post-acute COVID-19 sequelae. medRxiv 2022.06.14.22276401; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276401.]

Paxlovid "rebound" patients may need longer treatment
----------------------------------------------------
The rebound of symptoms reported in some COVID-19 patients who took a 5-day course of Pfizer's antiviral Paxlovid pills may be the result of insufficient treatment, according to researchers who closely evaluated one such patient.

Trial results showed that Paxlovid can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in high-risk patients by 89% if taken within 5 days of symptom onset. In some patients, however, virus levels and symptoms have rebounded after completing a course of Paxlovid, leading to concerns that variants might be developing resistance to the 2-drug treatment or that the pills may somehow be weakening patients' antibody resistance. But when researchers isolated the omicron BA.2 variant from a rebound patient and tested it in lab experiments, they found it was still sensitive to Paxlovid and had no mutations that would reduce the drug's effectiveness. They also found their patient's antibodies could still block the virus from entering and infecting new cells.

The rebound of COVID-19 symptoms after Paxlovid treatment is likely happening because not enough of the drug is reaching infected cells to completely stop the virus from making copies of itself, the researchers said in a paper published on Monday [20 Jun 2022] in Clinical Infectious Diseases [see citation below]. It is also possible that the drug may be metabolized, or processed, at different rates in different people, or that some people need to take it for more than 5 days.

After COVID-19, kids have more symptoms but less anxiety
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Persistent health problems were only slightly more common in children after COVID-19 than in similarly aged kids who avoided the virus, researchers from Denmark reported on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022] in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health [see citation below]. Anxiety levels, however, were higher in children who never had COVID-19, the researchers also found.

They said 40% of infants and toddlers with COVID-19 and 27% of their uninfected peers experienced at least one symptom for more than 2 months. Among kids ages 4-11, persistent symptoms were seen in 38% with COVID-19 and 34% without it. And among 12-14-year-olds, 46% of those with COVID-19 and 41% of those without it had long-lasting symptoms. The results were based on a survey of nearly 11 000 mothers of infected children and nearly 33 000 mothers of uninfected kids.

While symptoms associated with long COVID-19 such as headache, mood swings, abdominal pain, and fatigue are often experienced by otherwise healthy children, infected children had longer-lasting symptoms, and 1/3 had new symptoms that developed after COVID-19. To the researchers' surprise, children who had COVID-19 experienced fewer psychological and social problems than those in the control group. They speculated this may be because the uninfected children had more "fear of the unknown disease and more restricted everyday life due to protecting themselves from catching the virus."
