A _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to Kinder chocolate has sickened more than 450 people, based on the latest figures. Only 10 cases have been reported in the month since the previous European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) update, bringing the total to 455 as of mid-July [2022]. The outbreak has hospitalized a high proportion of people, mostly children younger than 10 years of age, and some had severe clinical symptoms including bloody diarrhea.

The latest monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium case is from the UK with a sampling date of [16 Jun 2022]. Concerns were previously raised by authorities that potentially contaminated chocolate could still be on sale despite a recall in April [2022]. The UK has the most patients with 128 followed by France with 121. Belgium has recorded 66 sick people, 49 are ill in Switzerland, 34 in Germany, 18 in Ireland, and 14 in Austria. There are 4 cases in Canada and 1 in the USA. Sweden, Spain, Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Denmark, and the Czech Republic all have single-figure case numbers. Affected cases have been identified through advanced molecular typing techniques. As this method is not routinely performed in all countries, some may be undetected, said ECDC.

The first patient was reported in the UK on [7 Jan 2022], with a sampling date of [21 Dec 2021].

Operations at Ferrero's Arlon factory were suspended in April 2022, which led to the recall of products made there. Potentially implicated chocolate was distributed to at least 113 countries. In May 2022, Ferrero asked to be allowed to produce again and in June 2022, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) gave conditional approval for the plant in Belgium to restart. This approval lasts for 3 months. Raw materials and each batch of foodstuffs will be analyzed and only released if results are compliant.

About 1000 Ferrero employees and independent specialists worked on the restart. More than 1800 quality tests were completed and 10 000 parts dismantled and cleaned. Investments included replacing multiple pieces of equipment and installing 300 meters of new pipeline.

A total of 2 outbreak strains were identified in 10 of 81 _Salmonella_ positive samples taken in the Arlon plant between December 2021 and January 2022. Sampling of products and the processing environment was increased but batches of chocolate were released to market after negative _Salmonella_ testing.
