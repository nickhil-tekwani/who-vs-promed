Small flock in Comox Valley tests positive for avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed a small poultry flock in the Comox Valley tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) virus, which is the 1st case on Vancouver Island.

The infected premises has been placed under quarantine by the CFIA, and B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture and Food has notified producers within a 12-kilometre [7.46 mi] radius about the positive test results.

Seven small or backyard flocks have contracted the virus in B.C., presumably through contact with infected migrating wild birds. Owners of small or backyard flocks are urged to continue to be vigilant and have appropriate preventative measures in place.

Measures include eliminating or reducing opportunities for poultry to encounter wild birds, reducing human access to the flock and increased cleaning, disinfection and sanitization of all things (including clothing and footwear) when entering areas where flocks are housed.

Since April 2022, small or backyard poultry flocks have tested positive for avian influenza in Kelowna, Richmond, Armstrong and the central Kootenays.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Food continues to work closely with the CFIA and B.C. poultry producers to ensure enhanced prevention and preparedness measures are in place to protect poultry flocks. The 1st confirmation of H5N1 in B.C. poultry was at a commercial producer in the Regional District of North Okanagan in mid-April [2022]. A general order requiring commercial poultry producers with 100 or more birds to keep birds indoors has also been extended until 13 Jun 2022.

Avian influenza is a federally regulated disease and the CFIA leads the investigation and response with provincial support for testing, mapping, surveillance and disposal.

Wild birds have also tested positive for H5N1 strains of avian influenza in or near 100 Mile House, Bowen Island, Chilliwack, Kelowna, Metro Vancouver, Vanderhoof and Williams Lake.

The Wild Bird Mortality Investigation Program toll-free hotline accepts reports of dead wild birds from the public [reports via telephone].

[2] North Dakota (9 counties): commercial turkey flocks

Bird flu has now spread to 14 flocks in 9 North Dakota counties and infected nearly 167 000 birds, mostly in 4 commercial turkey flocks.

There also have been a total of 197 confirmed cases of avian influenza in nearly a dozen different types of wild birds in more than 20 counties, including Burleigh.

The bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has resulted in the slaughter of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in numerous states, according to The Associated Press. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms to try to limit the spread of the virus. This year's [2022] outbreak is the worst since 2015, when about 50 million chickens and turkeys were killed.

North Dakota's 1st case this year [2022] was identified [29 Mar 2022] in a backyard mixed species flock in Kidder County. Since then [29 Mar 2022], there have been confirmed cases in backyard bird flocks in Richland, LaMoure, Barnes, Sheridan, Cass, Dickey, Renville and Stutsman counties, with Stutsman having 2 confirmed cases. There also have been cases in 4 commercial turkey flocks: 2 in LaMoure County and one each in Dickey and Richland counties, according to the state Agriculture Department.

The department is not identifying the owners or specific locations of the infected flocks, citing North Dakota law that allows the State Board of Animal Health to keep such information private.

Data from the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shows a total of 450 birds have been killed in the backyard flocks, along with 166 500 in the commercial flocks.

"No infected birds or meat will enter the food chain," North Dakota Turkey Federation Vice President David Rude said. "Poultry is safe to eat."

There are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing about 1 million birds annually, according to the Agriculture Department. Producers have implemented biosecurity measures on their farms to try to stem the spread of the virus, according to Rude.

"It won't devastate the industry, but for the producers involved it is devastating -- for their loss of production for this year [2022], with no income for these flocks," the Tolna producer said. "We are still on heightened alert to continue to keep our birds safe."

That includes working with wildlife officials to try to keep migratory birds away. Bird flu can spread in various ways, including through wild birds.

"Waterfowl may carry and shed this virus without any signs, while birds like domestic poultry and raptors get severe illness and rapidly die," said Dr. Gerald Stokka, North Dakota State University Extension veterinarian and livestock stewardship specialist. "Currently, little is known about the risk of transmission and illness in songbirds."

Federal data shows confirmed wild bird cases throughout North Dakota. The bulk of the cases have been in snow geese and Ross's geese, but there also have been documented cases in other species including bald eagles, sandhill cranes, turkey vultures, owls, hawks, crows, Canada geese, a duck and a common goldeneye.

"It is expected that the potential for transmission and new cases will decline following migration," said Miranda Meehan, NDSU Extension livestock environmental stewardship specialist. "Unfortunately, the (recent) winter weather we are experiencing is slowing down migration and causing migratory birds to remain in the state longer."

The federal Agriculture Department has confirmed nearly 1000 cases of bird flu in wild birds around the country, including more than 50 bald eagles -- 4 of which were confirmed in North Dakota. The national wild bird death total is nearly 10 times higher than the 99 confirmed cases in wild birds during the last outbreak in 2015, according to AP.

With an increasing number of wild birds testing positive for bird flu, homeowners and landowners should be aware of what steps to take if they see sick or dead wild birds, according to Stokka.

"The primary carriers of avian influenza A are waterfowl, gulls, terns and shorebirds," he said. "People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Wild birds can be infected without showing signs of the infection."

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes the public health risk from the bird flu outbreak is low, but the agency still advises avoiding direct contact with sick or dead birds. They can be reported at https://gf.nd.gov/wildlife/diseases/mortality-report. Questions can be directed to the agency's telephone number.

North Dakota's Board of Animal Health last month [April 2022] canceled all shows, public sales, swaps and exhibitions of poultry and other birds within the state as a prevention measure, at the request of the Turkey Federation. The order applies to events or sales where birds from different locations would be co-mingled. Private sales, catalog sales and retail sales are still allowed, though the use of online marketplaces is encouraged.

The board issued a similar edict in 2015, when the state had 2 cases of bird flu, in Dickey and LaMoure counties, affecting more than 100 000 birds.

[3] Washington (3 counties): back yard flocks, wild birds

With cases of avian influenza piling up in Washington, state veterinarians are asking bird owners to double down on biosecurity measures.

The 2 most recent cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 were discovered in non-commercial backyard flocks in Pierce County and confirmed yesterday [10 May 2022] after the flock owners contacted the Washington State Department of Agriculture's (WSDA) sick bird hotline to report an unusual number of sudden deaths in their flocks.

Between the 2 affected flocks, there are a mixture of turkeys, chickens, peacocks, ducks, and waterfowl. The state veterinarian quarantined the premises and the birds having not already succumbed to the virus will be euthanized.

Washington wildlife officials confirmed 2 cases of HPAI in wild birds -- a bald eagle at Loon Lake in Stevens County and a Canada goose in Whatcom County. In addition to the confirmed cases, there are 8 more wild bird cases being investigated across the state.

"With so many suspicious cases in wild birds pending investigation, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to avoid exposing your flock to wild waterfowl and shorebirds," Dr. Amber Itle, state veterinarian, said. "Call us if you suspect your own birds are sick and report sick wild birds to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife."

Itle says one step flock owners should continue to take is preventing contact between their birds and wild birds by eliminating access to ponds or standing water on your property and keeping different domestic species like ducks and geese penned separately from chickens and turkeys. Flock owners should also limit access to their farms, not lend or share farm tools or equipment, and not share or sell eggs from backyard flocks. While eating cooked eggs does not pose a health risk, transferring eggs off-farm could also transfer the virus.

There is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detected. Always, the meat from both wild game birds and domestic poultry should be properly cooked.

Unusual deaths or illness among domestic birds should be reported to the WSDA Avian Health Program. Report dead or sick wild birds using the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife's online reporting tool.

Since [5 May 2022] when the 1st case of avian influenza was announced in Washington, WSDA has received nearly 2 dozen calls on its sick bird hotline. Now confirmed in 3 counties, several other suspect cases are being investigated now.

"Avian influenza is here," Itle said. "Whether it has been confirmed in your county yet or not, you should be taking steps to protect your birds and prevent the spread of this virus which could wipe out your flock."

Avian influenza can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic birds through direct contact, fecal contamination, transmission through the air, environmental contamination, and shared water sources. The virus can also be spread from farm to farm. Both wild and domestic waterfowl can be infected with the virus and not show signs of disease.

Reducing or eliminating contact between wild birds and domestic flocks and practicing good biosecurity is the best way to protect domestic birds from this disease. Bird owners can bring their flocks inside and undercover to protect them from wild waterfowl.

[4] Michigan (Muskegon County): commercial turkey
Date: Wed 11 May 2022

The state has found avian influenza at a commercial turkey farm in eastern Muskegon County, forcing the farm to kill its stock in an effort to prevent the virus from spreading.

While the state did not release the name of the farm, an employee at Sietsema Farms confirmed to News 8 that one of its facilities is involved.

This is the 1st confirmed case of bird flu at a commercial poultry operation in Michigan, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) said.

To protect other flocks, the state said the premises is under quarantine. Jennifer Holton with MDARD said 35 000 turkeys at the facility were "euthanized" to prevent the spread.

MDARD first detected the strain of bird flu in the state in a backyard flock back in February [2022].

"We've had some instances of some backyard flock owners in Michigan earlier this spring [2022] where their flocks were found to be infected with (highly pathogenic) avian influenza and typically in those instances, as well, it's due to a contact with a wild bird that typically brings this disease in," Ernie Birchmeier with the Michigan Farm Bureau said. "Unfortunately, we are in the northern region of the migratory flyway or pathway and birds migrate from the south to the north this time of year and with it sometimes come diseases."

MDARD noted the public health risk remains low and no birds or bird products infected with bird flu will enter the commercial food chain.

Birchmeier added the loss of the 35 000 birds will likely have little to no impact on turkey supply in the state.

"We do produce about 5.3 million turkeys annually in the state of Michigan. We also have a vibrant egg production here in Michigan and a chicken broiler industry so this should have minimal impact," Birchmeier said.

Bird flu can cause flu-like symptoms in poultry like lack of energy, appetite and coordination. It can also cause swelling, coughing and reduced egg production. It is very contagious among birds and can be spread through contact with infected poultry, equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. Birchmeier said that's why other poultry owners in the area will need to be cautious.

"Our poultry farmers in Michigan do an outstanding job of implementing bio security measures in their operations to keep the disease out because it's so devastating," Birchmeier said. "Certainly, this will increase awareness our farmers have in the West Michigan community. West Michigan is home to a large majority of poultry production in the state of Michigan."

Birchmeier says if you notice an increase of deceased birds or poultry in your area, it could be a sign of an avian influenza outbreak. He says you should contact MDARD immediately.

[Sadly, both wild and domestic birds are afflicted by highly pathogenic avian influenza. We are sad for all the birds, but especially for the individuals involved, whether it be those who lost their flock, or the individuals euthanizing the animals. This situation is hard on every person involved.

Whether you raise a flock as pets, for personal production or as a commercial producer, this disease has had a staggering impact.

It becomes so important to keep your birds inside, limit the number of people who can care for your birds and be extremely vigilant in the biosecurity measures you take.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus continues to sweep across the continent. The number of birds being euthanized or dying from this virus is in the many millions. Clearly, this is impacting the availability of poultry products and resulting in increasing prices on many levels. Wild birds are also being affected.

It is paramount to protect your birds, including our wildlife birds. Biosecurity is a very high priority if you own birds, even as a small operator. Live it, breathe it, practice it. - Mod.TG
