[In the past 2 days since the last update (6 Feb 2019) there have been 13 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. Of the 13 newly confirmed cases, 11 were classified as secondary cases (one in Al Qasim region and the remaining 10 in Wadi Aldawasir in Riyadh region). Notable is that the secondary case in a household contact reported from Al Qasim region most likely had contact with case no. 19-1788, who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on 30 Jan 2019. There was one primary case reported from Al Jawf region, an individual with a history of contact with camels, and one primary case reported from Riyadh City in Riyadh region who did not give a history of contact with camels. Of the 10 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported from Wadi Aldawasir, 6 were listed as under home isolation, suggesting these individuals most likely had asymptomatic infections with the MERS-CoV and were detected through screening of identified contacts. One was in a household contact, and the remaining 5 were classified as hospital-acquired infections, possibly in healthcare personnel.

Since 29 Jan 2019, there have now been 22 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Wadi Aldawasir -- 19 in men and 3 in women. Before this outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir, healthcare facility-associated transmission during the latter part of 2018 involved a few cases, with more transmission in the healthcare environment during the 1st quarter of 2018.

With the addition of these newly confirmed cases, it brings the total number of cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 to 40. - Mod.MPP

[Apologies for the delay in reporting this information. It appears as though there was one additional case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman in the past few days, bringing the total number of cases reported in 2019 to 5, and 2 fatalities were reported among presumably previously reported cases. We have no further information on the demographics or possible risk factors of any of the 5 reported cases. - Mod.MPP
