Officials at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) confirmed on [Fri 31 Aug 2018] a second patient from Quetta, Balochistan, was affected by Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever [CCHF] adding that now 2 patients suffering from the disease are under treatment at the health facility.

"Sixteen-year-old A.S. is from Quetta, and was brought to the JPMC with high-grade fever, headache, bruises on the body and bleeding from nose and mouth. Lab reports confirmed that he was infected with Congo Crimean virus," Executive Director JPMC Dr. Seemin Jamali told the News.

She said that earlier a 65-year old man, who was identified as D.M., was brought to the JPMC from Quetta and also tested positive for CCHF. Both patients are under treatment at an isolation ward in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the JPMC, under symptomatic and anti-viral drugs for recovery Dr. Jamali said.

["The current standard of care for CCHF patients is supportive care with or without nonspecific antiviral treatment in the form of ribavirin. An emphasis must be placed on continued assessment of the most clinically effective supportive treatment options for CCHF and promoting the appropriate health care infrastructure to providing this care. Supportive care is relatively easy to provide, and likely accessible in a basic care setting. Supportive care includes diligent monitoring of patient complete blood counts, clinical chemistry and blood pressure, management of fluid and electrolyte balances, addressing bleeding foci and avoiding taxing the coagulation response. Supportive care may also include frozen plasma or platelets to manage abnormalities associated with impaired hemostasis, crystalloid and colloid infusions for management of hypovolemic shock, and respiratory support" (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus: new outbreaks, new discoveries. Ergonul O, Curr Opin Virol. 2012 Apr; 2(2):215-20).

The above report mentions the use of antiviral therapy for the confirmed CCHF cases. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that the use of antivirals may be beneficial. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, was tested as a potential CCHF treatment and demonstrated efficacy against CCHFV in cell culture and animal studies. However, the clinical efficacy of CCHF remains controversial (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4567545/). Furthermore, the timing of administration appears to be critical, with treatment required early in the course of disease for beneficial effects. Another broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, favipiravir, has promising results both in vitro and in vivo that support continued investigational studies for CCHF use. - Mod.UBA
