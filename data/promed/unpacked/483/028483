Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), Peru
----------------------------------------------------------

Start date: 12 Dec 2011
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 22 Dec 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 10 Feb 2012
Date event resolved: 22 Dec 2011
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Huertos de Oro, Chilca, Canete, Lima
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Dec 2011
Outbreak status: resolved (22 Dec 2011)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species: swine
Susceptible: 14 783
Cases: 11
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered:
Affected population: an industrial pig farm for meat production where vaccination is not applied. Positive serological results were obtained (ELISA) in 11 animals (5-month-old sows). No clinical signs of the disease or ongoing outbreaks have been reported, only animals reactive to ELISA.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals; import of seropositive animals.
Epidemiological comments: infection was detected following permanent active surveillance carried out each year by the SENASA. No clinical cases of the disease were observed. In a population of 14 783 animals of different age groups, only 11 reacted positively to the ELISA test for detection of antibody against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. SENASA maintains a permanent surveillance in all farms in the area. Surveillance activities conducted at national level indicate the absence of the disease.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Diagnostic Center of SENASA (national laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: antibody detection ELISA
Test date: 22 Dec 2011
Result: positive

[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Peru can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1Nmf.

Since 2009, PRRS has been reported regularly in the Americas, both in North and South America. The countries reporting the infection, either with or without clinical signs, include Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, the United States, and now Peru. The disease is also widespread in other areas of the world.

In Peru, so far, this report does not indicate clinical disease, but on swine farms, the disease can be costly and takes some intensive work to control.

In the 1990s, Eric Bush and others at USDA-APHIS-CEAH (US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health) did some nice early investigations after the disease emerged in the late 1980s in USA and Europe.
