[Our thanks to Dan for preparing and forwarding this report. Hebei Province is in northeast China. For a description and map of the province, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei.

In past decades livestock anthrax was common in this region, but lately it is largely unobserved and maybe just very sporadic. A bovine outbreak was reported to OIE in 2008 involving 3 cases, and ovine and caprine outbreaks were reported in 2005 (1 outbreak, 1 case) and in 2008 (1 outbreak, 3 cases).

From the very brief description, it would seem that the veterinary service culled the patient's livestock from an excess of caution, which then makes it very difficult to trace any possible sources for this singular human case. When this disease is truly sporadic, the usual source is an old anthrax cattle grave, but one should first rule out unreported sudden deaths in other farms in the village or in relation to any community grazing once anthrax has been confirmed in the index human case. - Mod.MHJ
