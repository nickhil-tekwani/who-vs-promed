Eradication vs. elimination: defined 20000419223254

From: D.A. Henderson <Dahzero@aol.com>

With all deference to my good friend Phil Brachman, I would refer him and
his colleagues back to the Andrews and Langmuir 1963 definition.
"Unqualified, (eradication) signifies world-wide extermination of the
disease but use of the word is appropriate when applied to specified
geographical areas." We found it practically and politically helpful to be
able to use the term with respect to the status of smallpox in South
America after 1973. Use of the term implied that it was possible to
substantially diminish control efforts below those that were required
during the eradication phase. By the time noted, an International
Commission had certified eradication and both vaccination and surveillance
efforts could be and were substantially reduced.
While I support our proper policing of the proper used of the word
"eradication", let us be mindful as well that we continue to have even more
serious problems with the cavalier use of the terms, "elimination" and
"elimination as a public health problem."

[I assume everyone know Phil and D.A. I ain't getting between these two.
One sold me my first station wagon, the other was my first bridge partner
in Atlanta. How about a joint statement, to be posted on ProMED-mail as
the definitive definitions? -Mod.CHC
