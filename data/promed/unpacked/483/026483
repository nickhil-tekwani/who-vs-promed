3 persons were affected by anthrax in Satasemala village under Nandapur block of the district on Saturday [14 Mar 2015]. The affected tribals are of the same village. One of them was admitted to Koraput hospital in a critical condition.

A local health team detected the disease 2 days back and reported to Nandapur Community Health Centre. A medical team, which was rushed to the affected village, confirmed the disease after blood tests. The team also distributed preventive medicines among 200 villagers. The condition of the affected persons is stable now, said Koraput Additional District Medical Officer (ADMO) Bijoy Mohapatra.

Sources said a large number of cattle had died in the village a few days back. Some of the villagers had consumed meat of the dead animals and were affected by the disease.

It may be noted that 7 tribals were affected by the disease in Nandapur block and 5 in Lamataput block [see: 20150209.3154679] in the past couple of weeks.

Despite an awareness campaign by district authorities against consumption of meat of diseased cattle, there has been little change in the attitude of the tribals.

[For a map of India showing Orissa/Odisha on the NE coast, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg. Koraput district is in the central hilly spine of the state; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Koraput.html, as is Nandapur; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Nandapur.html.

It would be much cheaper and far more effective if the state veterinary service initiated a programme of anthrax control and surveillance which proactively vaccinated tribal herds each year. Readers will note that this is the 2nd outbreak involving tribals and their sick and dead livestock in Nandapur in the "past couple of weeks." Clearly, the previous outbreak in the block did not result in even reactive vaccination of block livestock. Livestock vaccination prevents both animal cases of anthrax and human cases. These people depend on their livestock, and, therefore, any animal deaths carry a very high socio-economic cost to them, a sad and unnecessary situation. - Mod.MHJ
