[An excerpt from PACNEWS. Can our PACNET colleagues from Kiribati, or
anyone informed on the matter, confirm and update the rest of the PACNET
community so that information is shared and, if needed, an appropriate
preventive response is organised where relevant at the level of the other

Kiribati boarding schools report outbreak of hepatitis
------------------------------------------------------
29 MAR 2000 TARAWA (Pacnews) -- The Kiribati Ministry of Health has sent a
medical team to several boarding schools in the outer islands to verify
reports of a hepatitis outbreak among students. The Director of Public
Health, Dr. Airam Meetai said the ministry has received reports from
several schools about an increase in the number of students infected with
hepatitis.
Dr. Airam did not disclose the names of the boarding schools. The
Government has two boarding schools in the outer islands while the others
belong to the Kiribati Protestant and the Roman Catholic Churches. He said
the medical team will try and identify the cause of the hepatitis outbreak,
vaccinate students, and recommend preventive measures to school authorities.
The Health Director said after a preliminary analysis, the Ministry is
satisfied that the schools' drinking water and food did not cause the
spread of the disease. However, he said the ministry is concerned about the
crowded dormitories in some of the boarding schools. The medical team will
complete a detailed report on the cause of the disease when it returns to
Tarawa.
