The 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] this year [2015] has been confirmed in South Carolina in an unvaccinated horse who died from the disease. The horse contracted EEE, which is preventable by vaccination, in Barnwell County, according to state veterinarian Boyd Parr.

"Horse owners should check with their veterinarian to be sure their horses' vaccinations are up to date against both EEE and West Nile Virus," said Parr, who is also director of Clemson University Livestock-Poultry Health. "Vaccination is especially important in our coastal counties."

EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that kills 90 percent of infected horses. Symptoms include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, the inability to stand, and muscle twitching.

There were 49 cases of EEE in 2013, officials said.

State law requires that any livestock with neurological symptoms such as stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension be reported to the state veterinarian within 49 hours. The number to call is 803-788-2260.

[Eastern equine encephalitis can be prevented in horses by a vaccine, which is often combined with West Nile virus vaccine. Therefore, one injection and the animal is protected from at least 2 diseases. The vaccine needs to be given twice, 3 weeks apart, and in areas where EEE is most prevalent, it is recommended to revaccinate every 4-6 months as the immunity to EEE wanes rather rapidly.

There are also mosquito sprays for horses that should be used.

People should be cautious to use mosquito repellant with DEET, wear long sleeves, and remember that dusk and dawn have the highest number of mosquitoes and should be avoided. - Mod.TG
