[1] France ex UAE - WHO GAR report
Date: 8 May 2013

The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in France has informed WHO of one confirmed case with infection of the novel coronavirus (NCoV).

The patient had an underlying medical condition, including an immunocompromised state. The patient became ill on [23 Apr 2013] and later developed respiratory symptoms. Laboratory confirmation with nCoV was confirmed on [7 May 2013] by Institut Pasteur. The laboratory confirmation was obtained from a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen (a medical procedure in which bronchoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs to obtain fluid for examination) after a nasopharyngeal specimen (secretion from the uppermost part of the throat) tested negative. The patient is currently hospitalized. Preliminary investigation reveals that the patient had a history of travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Further investigation into the case is ongoing.

From September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a global total of 31 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 18 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States (MS) to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. The newest case re-emphasizes the need for vigilance in recent travelers returning from areas affected by the virus and the need to use lower respiratory tract specimens for diagnosis when they can be obtained.

All MS are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

Authorities in Saudi Arabia have invited outside experts to help it deal with a large outbreak of the new coronavirus in the eastern Saudi city of al Hofuf, and a Canadian infectious diseases specialist is among them.

Toronto SARS expert Dr. Allison McGeer arrived in the Middle Eastern country on Wednesday [8 May 2013], travelling at the request of the kingdom's government, a source revealed.

The outbreak, which involves at least 13 cases, has ratcheted up worry about the coronavirus, the World Health Organization acknowledged in an update on the virus, which is from the same family as the SARS coronavirus.

"The reappearance of this virus and the pattern of transmission currently being observed in Saudi Arabia increase the level of concern regarding this novel pathogen," the statement said.

"The questions of the exposures that result in human infection, the mode of transmission, the source of the virus and the extent of infection in the community urgently need to be answered and are being actively pursued by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia."

In addition to McGeer, 2 officials of the World Health Organization were in or travelling to the country to meet with senior officials of the ministry of health in the capital, Riyadh.

"It's likely they will also visit al Hofuf," WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl said. He would not reveal the names of the WHO personnel.

The news came on the same day as France reported it had confirmed a case in one of its citizens, a 65-year-old man who got sick in late April [2013] after travelling to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. His infection was confirmed on [7 May 2013].

It was reported that the man was in the Middle Eastern country on a package tour, a fact that suggests his case may help disease investigators in their efforts to track down the source of the virus. That key fact has, to date, evaded detection.

Piecing together possible exposures with this coronavirus has been tough. Of the 31 confirmed cases, 18 have died. Of the others, many remain in hospital in critical condition, often on breathing machines. So questioning cases about what they did in the days before they fell ill can be difficult or impossible.

But the activities of a tour are generally highly regimented. A schedule should be available outlining where the group went, what type of activities or events they took in, what and where they ate, as well as whether they had any animal contacts, and what those animals were. With a tour, there are built-in witnesses and, likely, photos and videos documenting the man's activities.

"I think this could be a very important case," said infectious diseases expert Michael Osterholm. "I would think that it would be probably one of the best opportunities (to help find the source), because it would be so highly scripted," he added. "Animal contacts, etc., they should know that. ... In this case, they should be able to go back day by day and say: 'Exactly what did you do what day?' This is not someone living in the environment. It's not someone who is an animal caretaker. It's not someone who is working in a health-care facility in the area. So it really should give you what we would call more the kind of rare exposure phenomenon."

Saudi Arabia announced last week that it had confirmed a group of 7 new cases in al Hofuf, in the eastern part of the country. Five of those patients were already dead when the announcement was made.

At least some of the cases had received care in a dialysis clinic at Al-Moosa Hospital, and it appears that some person-to-person transmission of the virus occurred there.

In the days that followed, the numbers in al Hofuf climbed to 13 cases and 7 deaths, making it the largest confirmed cluster of infections with the new virus to date.

In April 2012, 13 people in a Jordanian hospital came down with a mysterious illness which was only later recognized as having been caused by the new coronavirus. Stored samples from 2 fatal cases in that cluster later tested positive for the virus; the WHO considers the 11 survivors probable cases. Ten of these people were health-care workers.

Infections in hospitals played a key role in the spread of SARS during the 2003 outbreak, which is why the WHO and others are keeping such a close eye out for infections in health-care workers or among patients in hospitals.

McGeer, who contracted SARS during the early days of Toronto's outbreak, is head of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital and was heavily involved in the city's SARS response. That experience is likely why the Saudi government consulted her on this outbreak. She was not immediately available for comment on the role she might play in the investigation.

The WHO said at least 2 of the infections at al Hofuf involve family members of a dialysis patient, suggesting person-to-person spread may have occurred outside the hospital setting too. This "raises a concern about potential broader transmission in the community," the WHO's statement said.

There has been at least one other situation in which the virus is known to have been transmitted person to person, among 3 members of an extended family in Britain. The 1st case in that cluster got sick while travelling in Saudi Arabia. There have been several other clusters of cases where person-to-person spread is suspected, including the Jordanian hospital outbreak.

The majority of cases -- 23, with 14 deaths -- have been reported by Saudi Arabia. The WHO considers the man who sparked the British cluster a Saudi case because he fell ill while visiting there. The 2 family members he infected are recorded as British cases.

People are known to have contracted the virus in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. Britain, Germany and now France have also seen cases, but they have been in people who were either transferred by air ambulance to European hospitals, contracted the virus while travelling in the Middle East, or, in the case of the British cluster, were infected by someone who contracted the virus in an affected country.

Though the existence of the new virus was 1st discovered late last June [2-13 June 2012], it is still not known how people are becoming infected. The genetic sequence of the virus suggests it probably originated in bats. But the WHO has warned that people looking for the source should not assume that exposure to bats or bat excreta are to blame.

The possibility remains that other species of animals are infected and are serving as a bridge that brings the virus to people. Research into the origin of the SARS outbreak suggested that a bat coronavirus came to infect some small animals -- mainly civet cats -- which were sold in live animal markets in China. These animals were the source of the human outbreak.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is also helping in the response to the coronavirus. Spokesperson Stephane Shank says 2 of the agency's staff are part of an informal working group of technical experts that the WHO has drawn together to advise it on the new coronavirus.

[Additional information contained in the above reports (WHO and the newswire) indicates that the location of travel of this newly diagnosed case was Dubai, and the case is a 65-year-old male with pre-existing immuno-incompetency. According to the press conference held in France (transcript available at the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, see http://www.social-sante.gouv.fr/actualite-presse,42/discours,2333/discours-de-marisol-touraine-sur,15813.html), the patient was 1st hospitalized in Valenciennes on 23 Apr 2013 and later was transferred to the hospital in Douai on 29 Apr 2013. Newswires have reported that the affected individual was part of an organized tour group. The prior case with exposure in the UAE had been hospitalized in Abu Dhabi prior to transfer to a hospital in Germany.

Since the announcement of the cluster in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, ProMED-mail has seen numerous reports where the press has been filled with rumors of additional cases in Saudi Arabia and involvement of more than one health facility. These panicky newswires (in both Arabic and English) are very reminiscent of unfounded rumors that surrounded the early outbreak(s) of SARS in Guangdong. ProMED-mail has been in communication with Dr. Memish, the Deputy Minister of Public Health in Saudi Arabia, who confirmed that these reports were unfounded rumors and felt to be related to the panic of the current situation on the part of the population. We were assured that all confirmed cases are being reported on a timely basis.
