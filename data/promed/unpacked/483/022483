The FDA has released multiple recall press release announcements for a
range of dog food products that are on retail shelves and in pet food
distribution centers.

The dog foods have been recalled due to high levels of aflatoxin being
found in dry dog foods. Aflatoxin occurs naturally in corn products
and is typically a mold by-product. The corn that was used in the dry
food manufacturing was the culprit of this recall.

Arrow brand dog foods was one of the brands mentioned in the aflatoxin
dry dog food recall. Please check your Arrow brand dog food to see
whether it has these product identification codes on it:

ARROWBRAND 21 percent Dog Chunks SKU #807 40 lb. bag
ARROWBRAND Super Proeaux Dog Food SKU #812 40 lb. bag
ARROWBRAND Professional Formula Dog Food SKU #814 50 lb. bag

You need to dispose of the listed dog foods only if the Packaging Date
Code Lot Numbers are in the 4K0341 through 4K0365 & 4K1001 through
4K1325 range. Only the Arrow Brand dog foods listed above are affected
by this recall. These dog foods were distributed in Louisiana (LA) and
Texas (TX).

Another brand that has released a recall on their product is Petrus
Feed and Seed Stores. The brand that is affected for Petrus dog food
is the 21 percent dog food bags that were distributed in 40 lbs bags
that are labeled as Petrus Feed bags. The date codes for these
specific bags are lot numbers 4K1011 through 4K1335. This dog food was
also strictly distributed in Louisiana dog food distribution
channels.

Clinical signs of the aflatoxin will give your dog a sluggish behavior
with lethargy and physical effects to their eyes or gums, adding a
yellowish tint. You might also notice your dog being reluctant to eat
any more of the aflatoxin-contaminated food, and vomiting or diarrhea
can be seen in dogs that have been made ill by the food. Take your dog
to a veterinarian or a pet hospital if you have any of these foods and
see any clinical signs.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - 14 Dec 2011 - Petrus Feed and Seed Stores,
Inc. today [14 Dec 2011] announced a voluntary recall of its dry dog
food "21 percent Protein Dog Food in 40 lb Petrus Feed bags." The
product is being recalled because the product was manufactured with

products were manufactured at Cargill's manufacturing facility located

The recall only applies to 21 percent dog food, packaged in 40 lb

purchase for a full refund. For more information, contact

Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mold by-product. Pets that have
consumed any of the above recalled products and exhibit symptoms of
illness including sluggishness or lethargy combined with a reluctance
to eat, vomiting, yellowish tint to the eyes or gums, or diarrhea
should be seen by a veterinarian.

[In the United States, aflatoxin has a regulatory legal limit of 20
parts per billion (ppb) in dog food. While the presence of aflatoxin
above that level is reason for concern, let us understand what the
situation is.

While dogs are sensitive to aflatoxin, they must consume relatively
low levels (30-100 ppb) for 60-90 days prior to any clinical signs
being evidenced in the animal. High levels of 1000 ppb can produce
clinical signs in 48-72 hours.

Aflatoxins are a group of related compounds produced as secondary
metabolites of various fungi, including _Aspergillus parasiticus_,_ A.
flavus_, _A. nomius_, and some _Penicillium_ spp. Aflatoxins are not
produced by all strains of these fungi. The most common aflatoxins in
grains are named, in part, for their fluorescent color: aflatoxins B1
and B2 fluoresce blue and aflatoxins G1 and G2 fluoresce green.
Aflatoxin B1 is the most common and most potent of the aflatoxins.

The mold may not be visible on the dog food. The mold may have
produced its toxin and then have died. In other words, mold does not
have to be present for the toxic by-product to be present. Likewise,
the toxin is not always present even in the presence of the mold.

The most common clinical signs are weakness, sometimes anorexia,
vomiting, diarrhea, and some pets will develop yellowing of the eyes,
the pinna of ears and even the hairless regions of the abdomen.
Aflatoxin has its primary affect on the liver.

It is wise to keep in mind that there are many other causes for these
same clinical signs. It is best to take the pet to a veterinarian for
a thorough checkup.

Dogs can and do recover when the offending food is removed. If the
animals are severely affected, they may need intravenous fluids.
Aflatoxin leaves the body fairly rapidly when the source of exposure
is removed.

While aflatoxin has been designated as a carcinogen in humans, it is
not a carcinogen in pets. Sadly, our pets, even long lived ones, do
not live long enough for cancer associated with aflatoxin to affect
them.

The drought in many areas has caused the corn crop, the most commonly
affected grain, to be damaged, and conditions have been right for the
production of the toxin.

While dog food companies and other companies such as cereal companies
do test the grains prior to use, it is not possible to test all of the
grain. To test all of the grain would mean there is no grain to make
the product. Furthermore, aflatoxin is located in "hot spots:" It may
be present in a small area of an entire truck load of grain and can be
easily missed in the testing procedure. It is like finding a needle in
a haystack.

The FDA website (above) and the AVMA (http://www.avma.org) usually
list the recalls. - Mod.TG
