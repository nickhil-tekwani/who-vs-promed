25 Jun 2015 China, US: team up on Ebola
http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2015-06/25/content_21101568.htm
[A Memorandum of Understanding for the Collaborative Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases was signed by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland on Wed [24 Jun 2015].
The purpose of the agreement is to promote closer cooperation, scientific discovery, capacity building and exchange of information in the field of infectious diseases.]

24 Jun 2015: Guinea: quarantines villages in reinforced bid to stamp out Ebola
http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/uk-health-ebola-guinea-idUKKBN0P42PM20150624
[Guinea will put 4 villages under a 21-day quarantine as part of a robust strategy to stamp out a lingering Ebola epidemic after new cases of the disease were discovered there.
According to a health ministry document seen by Reuters on Wednesday [24 Jun 2015], the quarantine will apply to Sikhourou Koloteya in the Forecariah prefecture southeast of the capital Conakry along with Tanene and Bamba in Dubreka prefecture. The village of Tamarasy in the Boke mining region will also be subject to the new measures.]

24 Jun 2015: Guinea Bissau: UN envoy on Ebola travels to Guinea Bissau after new cases reported in bordering Guinea
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506250376.html?viewall=1
[The United Nations envoy for Ebola response has begun a visit to take stock of prevention and preparedness efforts in Guinea Bissau, which remains at high risk given its proximity to Guinea where new cases of the virus were reported in an urban area bordering the 2 countries.]

26 Jun 2015: Ebola-hit Sierra Leone quarantines 31
http://www.9news.com.au/health/2015/06/26/02/20/ebola-hit-sierra-leone-quarantines-31
[Three doctors and 28 nurses were quarantined in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, when a mother tested positive for the Ebola virus after giving birth. After doctors were unable to control mother's bleeding, the mother and baby were transferred to the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital emergency ward. There, it was confirmed she was Ebola positive.

The baby and all of the attendant health-care workers were quarantined for 21 days.

According to the NERC (National Ebola Response Centre), the woman was one of 3 new cases registered over the past week from Magazine Warf, a heavily populated and unsanitary slum in Freetown.

According to the Ministry of Health, as the Ebola cases began to appear, Magazine Warf was placed under quarantine. However, the mother escaped the quarantine and presented to the nearby Mabaila Health Center clinic for the delivery of her baby. The 2 previously reported Ebola cases and the mother are still alive. No further details are available.]

28 Jun 2015 Ghana: Ebola screening at ports still ongoing - GHS
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ebola-screening-at-ports-still-ongoing-GHS-365105
[The Ghana health Service has dismissed claims that it has relaxed Ebola preparedness measures at the various ports. The port health authority in 2014 put in place stringent measures at the various entry and exit points to screen foreign nationals due to Ghana's proximity to the countries worst affected by the deadly disease. But recent complaints about apparent laxity on the side of the port health authorities have raised concerns about the nation's state of preparedness in case of an outbreak of the hemorrhagic disease.]

28 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone will jail Ebola law violators
http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/06/sierra-leone-will-jail-ebola-law-violators/
[One of the 3 districts of Sierra Leone where new cases of Ebola have been recorded will jail those who break a new emergency by-law designed to prevent the spread of the disease, an official said Sun [28 Jun 2015]. The District Ebola Response Centre Coordinator, Raymond Kabia, said "a high-level stakeholders meeting" on Fri [26 Jun 2015] decided that "violators of the by-laws would no longer be fined but will go to jail for 6 months instead. People caught in sacred burials and washing bodies, transporting sick people in vehicles, traditional healers treating the sick, and those hiding sick people in homes will be jailed for 6 months without the option of fines," he told local reporters in Port Loko, 74 miles north of the capital.]

28 Jun 2015: Love in the time of Ebola: How sex is keeping the outbreak alive
http://www.globalpost.com/article/6597113/2015/06/28/love-time-ebola-how-sex-keeping-outbreak-alive
[Chief Pa Alimamy Fornah, a local official in Masuba in northern Sierra Leone, said he has levied fines on 2 men who infected their wives in his community. He's also reprimanded 3 men for violating the 90-day rule despite their wives' misgivings. He's never encountered women violating the ban.

Koya Chief Bai Kompa Bomboli has threatened to publicly flog men who force themselves on their wives. So far, no cases of flogging have occurred, however...

Convincing women to report their sexual habits to the authorities is also difficult, said Isha Fofanah Ibrahim, president of Sierra Leone's 50/50 Group of Advocacy, a women's rights group. She's documented a handful of cases of men infecting women.

Women have suffered beatings and loss of their partners, spouses and/or financial supporters when the women refuse sex.]

Research
-------------
25 Jun 2015: TSRI team gets new close-up view of key part of Ebola virus life cycle
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/sri-ttg062315.php
[A new study [published by cell reports] led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) reveals a key part of the Ebola virus life cycle [focusing on a viral protein called VP35] at a higher resolution than ever before. The research sheds light on how Ebola virus assembles and how researchers might stop the often-fatal infection.

The full paper can be accessed at RN Kirchdoerfer, DM Abelson,S Li , et al. Assembly of the Ebola Virus Nucleoprotein from a Chaperoned VP35 Complex. Cell Reports 12, 1-10, 7 Jul 2015 (http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(15)00586-0.pdf). - Mod.LK]

25 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Diagnosing Ebola in minutes
http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/06/diagnosing-ebola-in-minutes/
[A new test, successful in field trial, can accurately diagnose the Ebola virus disease within minutes at the point of care, providing clinicians with crucial, on-the-spot information for treating patients and containing outbreaks... Researchers from Harvard Medical School (HMS), Partners In Health, and Boston Children's Hospital have shown that a new, commercially developed rapid-diagnostic test performed at bedside was as sensitive as the conventional laboratory-based method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone.]

[According to the authors of the study, missed cases of Ebola involving very low levels of the Ebola virus were only detected by using an alternative lab test which is not widely available. Thus, the detection of Ebola virus early in the course of infection when low concentrations of virus are present remains a problem.

Also see 26 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Rapid-detection Ebola test could be game-changer http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rapid-detection-ebola-test-could-be-game-changer/. The company Corgenix has obtained emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use of its new point-of-care Ebola test, the ReEBOV Antigen RapidTest kit.

...Local health-care workers underwent training to perform the test at 2 treatment centers in Sierra Leone; 106 suspected Ebola cases had both the rapid-detection test and conventional RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Findings showed that in point-of-care testing at 2 Sierra Leone clinics all 45 patients who tested positive for Ebola virus disease by RT-PCR were also positive by fingerstick rapid diagnostic test; 71 of 77 patients who tested negative by RT-PCR were also negative by the rapid diagnostic test.

26 Jun 2015: Ebola Crisis: 3 different strains identified in Guinea
http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-crisis-3-different-strains-identified-guinea-1983057
[A team of scientists has sequenced the genome of Ebola virus strains circulating in Guinea to trace the spread of the disease and monitor its progress. Their findings, published on Wed [24 Jun 2015] in the journal Nature, have revealed 3 distinct variants of the virus that are co-circulating in the West African country, especially in its urban regions and neighboring towns.

The 1st is closely related to variants of the viruses found near the start of the epidemic in March 2014 and is found only in Guinea. The 2nd variant is more closely related to the types of virus circulating in Sierra Leone, but it could also represent a parallel evolution in the 2 strains... The final variant was identified in Conakry and its surrounding towns. It bore marked similarities to variants found in Sierra Leone, which, combined with epidemiological information, give evidence of Ebola being reintroduced from Sierra Leone to the Conakry region multiple times.

26 Jun 2015: Study of Ebola Preparedness Resources in U.S. Hospitals: Costs, Benefits and Challenges
http://www.jointcommission.org/study_of_ebola_preparedness_resources_in_us_hospitals_ costs_benefits_and_challenges/
[The Joint Commission, Department of Health Services Research, in collaboration with researchers from Rhode Island Hospital and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), are conducting a study that will provide estimates of the costs and benefits of Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness to hospitals... [The study] will survey a nationally representative sample of hospitals. The expectation is that this national snapshot will inform key stakeholders and better enable all of us to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.]

Funding
----
28 Jun 2015: Africa lost USD one trillion in 28 years
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Africa-lost-1-trillion-in-28-years-365149
[Africa has lost USD one trillion through "Illicit Financial Flows" (IFFs) over a 28-year period. The loss was recorded between 1980 and 2008.

The continent is reported to be losing USD 50 billion annually through the illegal activities of rich individuals and multinational companies in the extractive sector, mostly in oil, gas and mining.

A campaign, "Stop the Bleeding," has been launched to stop the illicit financial flows.]

26 Jun 2015 Liberia: Liberian bikers use Ebola suits as raincoats
http://www.aa.com.tr/en/rss/544819--liberian-bikers-use-ebola-suits-as-raincoats
[To stay dry during the rainy season, dozens of commercial motorcyclists are using personal protective equipment (PPE) as raincoats. The PPE were provided for health-care workers who treated patients with Ebola during Liberia's outbreak. However, for those who cannot afford Liberian dollar 1500 (USD 17.72) for a regular raincoat, a person can opt to pay Liberian Dollar 150 (USD 1.77) in the black market to buy PPE gear. One man said the sellers put this merchandise out late at night or early in the morning. The man also said the sellers bought them from people in the health sector.

Many Liberians are wondering what will happen should a new Ebola case appear in Liberia, and whether the country would ask the world community for more money for PPEs.

This is an egregious misuse of protective gear essential to the safety of health care workers. The government should follow-up on stopping this practice immediately. - Mod.LK]
