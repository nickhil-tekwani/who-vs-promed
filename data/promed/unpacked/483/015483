[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] (CCHF) claimed the 1st life of the year [2018] in Karachi on [Thu 3 May 2018], when a 36-year-old resident of Lyari [Karachi] died at Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) due to complications of the lethal tick-borne disease.

"My brother , who had been diagnosed with Congo virus expired at Liaquat National Hospital on Thursday night [3 May 2018]. Doctors said he was having problems with breathing and could not survive the complications of the disease," an elder brother of the deceased, told The News on Thursday night.

[The man] said his brother, who was married with 4 small children, used to visit a cattle pen in the area with other people, and doctors said he might have contracted the deadly disease from the same cattle pen.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] is a tick-borne viral disease, which is [acquired] when a person comes in contact with an animal infected with the Congo virus due to the presence of the virus on its skin. Mostly butchers, sheep and animal herders, and those who are associated with cattle-farming become victims of CCHF, which has a 40 percent to 50 percent mortality rate.

Health department authorities confirmed that the man, a resident of Gulistan Colony, Madina Masjid Road, UC-8 Rangiwara, Lyari, was taken to Liaquat National Hospital after complaints of bleeding from mouth and nose on Sunday last [29 Apr 2018] and during examinations it was confirmed that the patient was infected with the Congo virus.

"[The man] was undergoing treatment under intensive care at the hospital as his condition was said to be precarious," said Amanullah Abro, town health official (THO) of Lyari.

He said that after taking the history of the patient, they had decided to check other family members of the patient and area people for symptoms of the disease, and they were also planning to visit the cattle pen to examine the conditions so that other people could be protected from the deadly disease.

On the other hand, international health bodies said [the man] was the 2nd victim of the Congo fever in Pakistan this year [2018] as, earlier in April, a middle-aged woman from the Mianwali city of Punjab had died due to complications of CCHF at the Shifa International Hospital in Punjab on [6 Apr 2018].

As many as 6 persons had died at various hospitals in Karachi last year [2017] due to CCHF, but the majority of them had been brought from Quetta city of Balochistan for treatment. One of the patients who perished was a resident of Karachi.

Cases of CCHF usually surface during Eid-ul-Azha [festival of Sacrifice] in Pakistan when tens of thousands of sacrificial animals are brought to the cities for sacrifice and mostly butchers who slaughtered them get infected as they directly dealt with blood and other secretions of the animals.

[It is imperative that the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases such as CCHF be understood at the national and regional/provincial levels, given the large number of livestock in the country, and its importance to the economy and livelihood of rural communities. Furthermore, it is important that hospital staff be educated to consider CCHF as a possible disease agent, since they are at high risk of contracting the disease, especially in hospitals with limited resources. - Mod.UBA
