Public Health England (PHE) has advised the public to ensure they have had 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine after it confirmed outbreaks of measles across England.

Between 1 Jan 2018 and 9 May 2018, there have been 440 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, with London (164), the South East (86), West Midlands (78), South West (42), and West Yorkshire (37) reporting the most cases.

The increase in measles circulation is mainly associated with travel to and from Europe, where there are large ongoing measles outbreaks, PHE said.

EU/EEA countries confirmed 2143 measles cases during March 2018. As of May 2018 EU has reported 28 infant deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The May 2018 report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] regarding the measles outbreak is loaded with 'bad-news'.

For the European region as a whole, there have been more measles cases reported during 2018, than in the previous 5 years combined.

This negative trend is one reason the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued Travel Alert Level 1 for several EU countries.

Measles is among the most contagious viral diseases known, and humans are the only natural host for sustaining measles virus transmission.

This new report says 21 EU/EEA countries have confirmed 2143 cases of measles for March 2018.

Specifically, the countries of France, Greece, and Italy continued to report increasing numbers of measles cases. France reported 753 cases, Greece reported 549 cases and Italy reported 326 cases.

Additionally, Portugal reported 109 new measles cases during March 2018, which is an increase from just 4 cases in February 2018.

Not only is measles continuing to spread in most EU countries, but infants are the most impacted.

As of May 2018, the EU has reported 28 infant deaths related to measles. The proportion of unvaccinated measles cases was highest among children below 1 year of age. ...

Only 5 EU/EEA countries reported at least 95 percent vaccination coverage for both doses of measles-containing vaccine.

Measles outbreak warning: 15 sufferers are confirmed at a secondary school in West Sussex as cases rocket across England due to an epidemic in Europe
----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
- Between 1 Jan and 9 May 2018, 440 cases have been confirmed in England.
- Outbreaks are occurring in Italy, Germany, Greece, France, and Romania.
-To prevent an outbreak, 95 percent of the population should be immunised.
- Only 91.9 percent of children were vaccinated against measles between 2015 and 2016.
- Andrew Wakefield's discredited MMR-autism theory may be to blame.

According to Public Health England (PHE), 15 students from Chichester High School in West Sussex have been diagnosed with measles.

This comes after figures released earlier this month [May 2018] revealed that between 1 Jan and 9 May 2018, 440 cases of measles were confirmed in England, with London being the worst hit.

PHE claims travel between European countries experiencing measles epidemics is behind England's outbreak, as well as people failing to take up the recommended measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, previously said: "The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children."

Romania, Italy, Germany, Greece, and France are all experiencing unprecedented cases of the highly infectious, life-threatening condition.

To prevent a measles outbreak, it is recommended that 95 per cent of the population is immunised against the infection.

Only 91.9 per cent of children were vaccinated against measles between 2015 and 2016 compared to 94.2 per cent in 2014-to-2015 and 94.3 per cent in 2013-to-2014, according to NHS immunisation statistics.

The 'elimination' of measles has been achieved in the UK, global health leaders said in September [2017]. The elimination of measles or rubella can be verified once a country has sustained 'interruption of endemic transmission' for at least 36 months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The European Regional Verification Commission said the UK achieved elimination status for measles as of 2016. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: "We are delighted that the WHO has confirmed that the UK achieved measles elimination in 2016 and that rubella elimination continues to be sustained.

"In addition, national vaccine coverage of the 1st MMR dose in 5-year-olds has hit the WHO's 95 per cent target. ..."

What were the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination rates in 2-year-olds across England in 2015-to-2016? [see source URL above for figure]

"While the cases in Chichester are among children, it is important to remember that measles is not just a childhood illness, as proven by the number of recent cases among adults in other parts of Sussex and Surrey. ..."

Since January 2018, Surrey and Sussex have had 70 confirmed measles cases, compared with 20 in the same time period last year [2017].

Where in England are outbreaks occurring?
London has had the most measles cases, with a confirmed 164 incidences so far this year [2018]. This is followed by the South East where 86 people have suffered since 1 Jan 2018. The West Midlands has had 78 incidences and the South West 42. West Yorkshire is also experiencing a local outbreak with 37 confirmed cases in just over 5 months.

Dr Ramsay said: "The measles outbreaks we are currently seeing in England are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe.

"The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children. ..."

Epidemics in Europe
-------------------
Earlier this year [2018], the WHO warned measles was spreading across Europe in regions where vaccination rates are low, such as Poland, Switzerland, and Ukraine.

Data published in November last year [2017] by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] in the Communicable Disease Threat Report show that from January 2016-November 2017, more than 19 000 measles cases were reported in the EU, including 46 deaths.

The highest number of cases in 2017 were reported in Romania, where 7759 people suffered, followed by Italy with 4775 cases, and Germany with 898 sufferers. Greece also experienced a measles outbreak, with at least 368 cases, and 1 death, since May 2017.

Dr Ramsay said: "Due to ongoing measles outbreaks within Europe, we will continue to see imported measles cases in the UK in unimmunised individuals. ..."

Fears over discredited claims the jab causes autism may be to blame for outbreaks. Are autistic children missing out on vaccinations? Autistic children are missing out on life-saving vaccinations, research suggested in March 2018.

Only 81.6 per cent of those on the autism spectrum have received all the recommended vaccinations for children aged between 4 and 6 years old, a study found.

For those without the developmental disability, 94.1 per cent have had the necessary jabs, including diphtheria, polio, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), the research adds.

Lead author Dr Ousseny Zerbo, from Kaiser Permanente, California, said: "These findings suggest that children with autism and their younger siblings may be at greater risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Vaccine hesitancy or refusal may play a role in children not getting properly vaccinated."

Results further suggest just 89.1 per cent of children with autism have been vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, compared to 96.6 per cent of youngsters without the disorder.

Only 84 per cent of autistic children are protected against MMR versus 95.9 per cent who do not suffer such developmental and behavioural challenges.

The younger siblings of autism sufferers are also missing out, with 6.8 per cent receiving fewer vital jabs than their peers. ...

Over the past week more than 1400 people including 756 children contracted measles in Ukraine. This is reported on the website of the Ministry of Health.

"According to the operative data of the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, for the 19th week of 2018 [week of 7 May 2018], 1407 people became ill with measles: 651 adults and 756 children. The number of new cases in the last week increased, and the largest number of new cases were registered in Vinnitsa, Volyn, Kiev, Lviv, Lugansk, Rivne, Chernigov regions, as well as in the city of Kiev. The share of adults who have become ill with measles is also growing," the report says.

The Ministry of Health noted that since the beginning of the year [2018], 15 261 people have been ill with measles -- 6243 adults and 9018 children. During this time 8 people -- 6 children and 2 adults -- died from complications of the disease. Since the beginning of the year, most people have become ill with measles in Ivano-Frankivsk, Transcarpathia, Lviv, Odessa, and Chernivtsi regions.

Recall that the new 800 000 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), which were previously delivered to Ukraine, have already been distributed among the oblasts. Most of the doses were distributed in such areas as Transcarpathia (72 508), Zaporozhye (52 208), Volyn (51 586).

Measles has spread through the South Island after cases were found in Nelson, Christchurch, and Queenstown.

A person infected with measles visited a Christchurch mall, 2 supermarkets, and a pizza takeaway before realising they were sick.

They are the 15th case in the South Island related to a recent measles outbreak, including a baby and people in Nelson, Queenstown, and Wanaka. The 1st case was confirmed in early April [2018].

Medical officials have warned of the possibility of more cases and urged those with symptoms to call, rather than visit, their doctors.

17 people have tested positive for the viral disease in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan.

The officials said the number of cases could increase due to the spring vacation period in late April and early May [2018], when large numbers of people travel around the country. ...
