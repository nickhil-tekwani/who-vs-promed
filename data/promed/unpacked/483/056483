Contaminated silage is being blamed for a recent case of botulism in which a number dairy cows died in the Shoalhaven.

The South East Local Land Services said the cause of the infection at the commercial dairy had been diagnosed by the NSW Chief Veterinary Officer.

Botulism is a relatively rare condition cropping up from time to time, particularly on dairies and in feedlots, with Local Land Services South Coast manager Paul Lyddiard, saying there was no public health risk from the incident.

Botulism is a paralysing disease caused by a potent nerve toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

_C. botulinum_ and its spores are widely distributed in the environment in soils, sediments, and in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish and animals. They can also be absorbed via contaminated feed.

Once the toxin is absorbed it travels via the bloodstream to the nerve endings and blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles resulting in paralysis. Animals die of respiratory failure from paralysis of the breathing muscles.

Feed contamination can be caused by bodies of small animals such as lizards, snakes, turtles or mice inadvertently trapped in grain, hay or silage during the harvesting or storage stage.

"The land manager involved in this local incident has been in constant contact with their vet, industry contacts, Local Land Services and the NSW Department of Primary Industries throughout the event," Mr. Lyddiard said.

Local Land Services vets and NSW DPI worked with a private vet to collect samples and establish a diagnosis, which has been communicated to the relevant government and industry bodies.

Mr Lyddiard said the deceased cattle were removed and disposed of at an approved waste facility, with the advice and assistance provided by the NSW EPA and Shoalhaven City Council.

"Remediation works on the property have been completed to EPA's standards and satisfaction, with Local Land Services providing support and assistance," he said.

Mr Lyddiard said the suspected contaminated silage was being composted in line with Australian standards.

The land manager has been offered support and counselling from NSW Health.

What is botulism?
Botulism is a paralysing disease caused by a potent nerve toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Most cases are due to contamination of the feed or water by rotting organic matter containing the botulism toxin or bacteria.

Bodies of small animals such as lizards, snakes, turtles or mice that are inadvertently trapped in grain, hay or silage during the harvesting or storage stage are some of the common types of rotting organic matter that contaminate feed.

High moisture feeds such as silage or brewer's grains when allowed to rot rather than ferment can provide an ideal anaerobic environment for botulism growth.

Up to 7 types of toxin have been identified, designated A to G. Vaccination programs are available to minimize risk.

Some of the highest mortalities have occurred where mixing wagons were used in preparing dairy rations and the toxin was evenly distributed throughout the mix.

Once the toxin is absorbed it travels via the bloodstream to the nerve endings and blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles resulting in paralysis.

Botulism causes a progressive paralysis and animals die of respiratory failure from paralysis of the breathing muscles. Animals are usually found sitting down, unable to rise and their breathing becomes progressively more laboured.

Losses can be seen for up to 17 days after ingestion of a contaminated feed.

Botulism can be confused with hypocalcaemia or milk fever.

[It is unfortunate small animals get trapped in the hay or silage and cause such havoc on the diaries or feed lots. Often when this situation occurs there are very large numbers of animals affected. This article does not tell us how many animals were involved, but if the owner is being offered counseling, then there were likely high numbers of affected animals. Furthermore, the land owners get to know these animals and it is a very difficult emotional situation for the owner. This is costly even both financially and emotionally.

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):

"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.

"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution

"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.

"Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog."

The preliminary suspicion of botulism in cattle may be based upon the very typical signs and symptomatology. However, laboratory confirmation is required to exclude other possible etiologies, such as ionophores [polyether compounds] intoxication.

Botulism is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases.
