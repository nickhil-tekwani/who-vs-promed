Dear ProMED-mail subscriber:
Some of our readers have received e-mails that appear to originate from
ProMED-mail and contain portions of old ProMED-mail reports. Some of them
also have attachments that may contain malicious code (such as viruses or
Trojan horse programs) that may damage your computer software.
These e-mails do not originate from ProMED-mail; instead, they have a
forged ProMED-mail return address or a portion of it. These may be sent
from computers belonging to some of our subscribers that have been infected
with a computer virus.
ProMED-mail reports NEVER CONTAIN ATTACHMENTS. You should never open an
e-mail attachment that you are not expecting, even if it appears to come
from a trusted source. Also, please be assured that ProMED-mail's server
is secure and that we do not share your e-mail address or any other
information with others, in accordance with our strict privacy policies.
We appreciate your readership and support.
