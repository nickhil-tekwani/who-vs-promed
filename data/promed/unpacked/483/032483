Disease threatens Ghana 2010 cocoa goal
---------------------------------------
A serious outbreak of swollen shoot disease in western Ghana
threatens to prevent the world's No. 2 cocoa grower from achieving
its goal of a 1 million tonne harvest by 2010, a senior industry
official said on Wednesday [22 Oct 2008].

"It is a serious situation ... we're having to deal with an
unprecedented outbreak," Francis Nsiah, executive director of the
Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) control unit of industry
regulator Cocobod, told Reuters. He added Ghana would spend [GHS] 15
million (new cedis) [USD 13.2 million] this year [2008] to tackle the
outbreak.

Nsiah said that at least 20 000 hectares (49 421 acres) of cocoa in
the top-yielding western region alone had been infected by the
disease. The western region produced nearly 30 percent of Ghana's
2007/08 main crop. "It's a big problem, but again, we don't want to
create a panic situation because we now have a strategy to confront
the disease and we hope to do so in good time," he added. His CSSVD
control unit had declared the Esam district, a high yielding western
region zone, a "mass infection area." The Enchi area, also in the
western region, had also been badly hit, he added.

Nsiah said that unlike previous outbreaks, where the signs of the
disease could be clearly seen on the leaves, it was proving difficult
to detect in the current western outbreak. "We suspect it could be a
new strain this time around and efforts have been initiated to study
it thoroughly," he said.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSVD) is caused by _Cacao swollen
shoot virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and has been reported in West
Africa, Sri Lanka, and parts of the Caribbean. It affects cocoa
(_Theobroma cacao_, _Sterculiaceae_), and also some species in
related families. Symptoms vary with different viral strains and may
include interveinal chlorosis, swollen stems and roots, root swelling
only, or no symptoms at all. CSSV is spread by several species of
mealybugs (soft bodied sucking insects of family _Pseudococcidae_)
and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation.
Recent studies have recorded a high frequency of CSSV in seedlings
suggesting seed transmission of the virus. This has serious
implications for cocoa germplasm conservation and distribution.

CSSV is indigenous to West African forest trees and appears to have
transferred to cocoa following the introduction of the crop causing
severe crop losses. Most affected countries have adopted a "zero
tolerance," which requires the removal of all infected trees and
their neighbours. It is estimated that over 160 million cocoa trees
have either died from CSSV or have been eradicated in the whole of
West Africa. The mealybug vectors are difficult to control, and
native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management
relies on phytosanitation and clean plant material. Breeding
programmes for virus or vector resistant crop varieties have been
initiated.

A westward spread of CSSVD was reported last year (2007) in Ghana,
which now seems to have led to a serious outbreak. It will be
important to know whether a new viral strain is the cause of the
current problem.
