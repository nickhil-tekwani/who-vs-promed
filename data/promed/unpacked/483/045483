The Vermont State Health Department on Tuesday recommended people not eat
cheese made with milk from 3 flocks of sheep officials fear could be
infected with the sheep version of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE).
Health Commissioner Dr. Jan Carney said she made the recommendation after
discussing the matter with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta (CDC). "This is in the tone of a recommendation," Carney said.
"There is no national or state recall. CDC considers the risk theoretical."
Carney said there were no known cases of people contracting the
always-fatal BSE from milk or milk products like cheese. But the disease,
which causes the brain to waste away, has a long incubation period and it
is best to err on the side of protecting the public health, she said.
The cheese was from 2 plants whose products are distributed to specialty
stores throughout the United States. The farmers who produce the cheese are
contesting the federal government's efforts to have their sheep destroyed.
The plants manufacturing the cheese are Three Shepherds of the Mad River
Valley, plant number 50-50, and Northeast Kingdom Sheep Milk Cheese, plant,
50-45.
The furor over the sheep flocks arose after tests done several weeks ago on
the carcasses of 4 sheep found evidence of disease in their brains.
Officials fear the animals were infected with a sheep version of BSE.
The results don't mean the animals had the same disease that killed about
50 people in Great Britain and devastated that country's beef industry, but
they could have. [This would be the first case of sheep acquiring this
disease other than experimentally. - Mod.TG
[An East Warren farmer, who produces the Three Shepherds cheese, said his
cheese was safe. He and his wife are contesting the federal government's
efforts to have their sheep destroyed; he says there is no evidence his
sheep are sick.
Meanwhile, the owner of a Craftsbury flock of 230 sheep scheduled to be
destroyed on Friday, said he planned to go to federal court to ask a judge
for an injunction to block the slaughter of his sheep. [His lawyer said
Tuesday he expected to file the papers Wednesday.
The East Friesian sheep, which produce 10 times as much milk as sheep
available in North America, were imported from Belgium in 1996 to start a
sheep cheese business.
But the sheep came from an area of Europe where BSE is known to have
occurred [in cattle and federal officials fear they [the sheep could have
eaten contaminated feed. [This is not clear if they fear the possibly
contaminated feed was fed to these animals while in the US, or if it was
fed prior to importation into the US - Mod.TG Last week Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman ordered the sheep destroyed as a precautionary
measure to ensure BSE doesn't make it into the United States.
[The Craftsbury farmer said appraisers visited his farm Tuesday to
determine the fair market value to pay him for the sheep slated to be taken
away and destroyed Friday. [The other farmer said the appraisers were due
at his farm Wednesday.

Clarification please. Isn't BSE now a problem for the whole EU - at least
France and Belgium in addition to England? Isn't it true that BSE has the
potential to effect any mammal and can be transmitted from consumption of
any body part, not just brain? Are there tests available that can
differentiate between BSE and scrapie? Are they proven to be different
diseases or just assumed to be?
Why were these sheep permitted into the country in the first place? If
this was an importation allowed before it was known Belgium had a BSE
problem, why were they allowed to continue to sell cheese made from their
milk? The European experience should have dictated more caution.

[Eleanor, BSE is a problem for the EU. Remember BSE is Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy. It has not been identified in sheep, only in cattle. It has
been experimentally produced in sheep, but there are no documented cases of
naturally occurring cases. BSE is generally transmitted from neurological
tissue. However, because of the method of killing cattle there is the risk
of spreading microscopic particles of neurological tissue through the blood
stream, thus infecting muscle tissue, which is most often consumed by human
beings.
There are tests capable of differentiating BSE and Scrapie. One of those
tests, I think, is the monoclonal antibody tests use on the third eyelid of
the sheep. It is my understanding the USDA did not use this test. The most
reliable test is injecting brain tissue into mice, then waiting several
months for results. This test was not used by USDA. Hence, there is room
to question the validity of tests. I think there are some other tests, but
I am not positive.
Scrapie and BSE are different diseases. BSE may have originated from
feeding scrapie infected sheep to cattle. But the rendering process and
subsequent feed processes of temperatures and pressures resulted in a
change in the prion organism. They are different diseases.
The sheep were imported in 1996. I don't believe Belgium had BSE then.
Since BSE has not been identified in sheep, and Belgium had not had BSE,
there appeared to be no risk with regard to importing the sheep. There have
been no cases of the human form of BSE, new variant Cruezfeld-Jakob's
Disease (nvCJD) being transmitted from milk. There are no cases of scrapie
being transmitted from milk. They were permitted to sell the milk and
cheeses because there is no risk of transmitting the disease through milk
or milk products. - Mod.TG

Claims that abnormal prion proteins have been found in American sheep are
setting alarm bells ringing in the US. But [some BSE experts are unimpressed.
The US government ordered the incineration of 376 sheep from Vermont, after
suggestions 4 of the flock were infected with BSE-the brain disease in cows
causing deadly new variant CJD (vCJD) in people. If the 4 cases are
confirmed as BSE, they will be the first sheep known to be infected by farm
feed, and would raise the specter of more human infection.
[A Vermont farmer imported Belgian and Dutch milking sheep to his farm in
1996. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA), fearing the imported sheep
could have eaten Belgian feed contaminated with BSE, tested animals culled
from [the flock for prion disease. This month it announced test results
indicating 7 of the sheep had brain damage of the type associated with
prion disease. The animals had not shown symptoms of brain disease.
Sheep brains can be damaged in this way by both BSE and scrapie-a prion
disease affecting sheep but is not thought to harm humans. Antibodies used
to test the sheep for scrapie did not bind to the brains of these sheep,
however. Yet 4 came up positive for prions in 2 other tests: a new assay
developed by Mary Jo Schmerr of the USDA laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and a
Western blot analysis by Richard Rubenstein of the Institute for Basic
Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island.
On 14 Jul 2000, this led US agriculture secretary Dan Glickman to order the
animals to be destroyed because they had prion disease "of foreign origin",
which might be BSE.
Sheep deliberately fed BSE-contaminated feed will develop prion disease.
While no one has ever shown this happens on farms, some scientists say it's
possible BSE has appeared in sheep only to be mistaken for scrapie.
However, many experts doubt whether the Vermont sheep have BSE. "The
connection to BSE is far-fetched speculation," says Tom Pringle of the
Sperling Foundation in Oregon, which monitors prion research. The 2 tests
used gave inconsistent results, and the imported animals were supposed to
have been strictly grass-fed.
Scrapie and BSE can only be reliably distinguished by injecting brain
tissue into mice, then waiting months for the result. Ian McConnell of
Cambridge University, an adviser to the British government on vCJD/BSE,
told New Scientist: "I have no idea how they would make this distinction.
It's a shambles."
