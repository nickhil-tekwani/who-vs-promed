ENCEPHALITIS, UNDIAGNOSED - AUSTRALIA (WESTERN AUST.)

There have been five deaths in the past three years in Western Australia
from a "mystery" virus that causes an encephalitis-like disease.
Head of the infectious diseases department of Fremantle Hospital in Perth,
Dr. Miles Beaman, said all known causes had been ruled out and that
assistance has been sought from the US CDC. The patients, all of whom died
within 10 weeks after seeking medical help, suffered headaches, cognitive
distortion and fever before lapsing into a coma. None of the patients had
traveled abroad just prior to becoming sick, and three of the cases came
from an area south of Perth.
After three of the cases were presented to an infectious disease
conference, two other unexplained fatalities of an identical pattern were
brought to the attention of the medical community.
Said Dr. Beaman: "If we can have two new viruses emerge over the last three
years on the east coast (an equine morbillivirus and a lyssavirus), then
it's possible we have one in Western Australia that we haven't known about."
Dr. Shirley Bowen, of Canberra Hospital, said in an article in Australian
Doctor Magazine, "The illness fits most with one of the arboviral
encephaltides that has been described in South America."
Western Australia's health department has been quick to point out that the
cases do not represent an outbreak of a new disease.

[Given that this report is not from a scientific journal or authoritative
scientific source, it cannot be with any degree of certainty that the
information is definitive. Identification of a virus related to a
recognized virus should be easily accomplished using
hemagglutination-inhibition, IgG ELISA or other broadly-reactive antibody
assays of patient sera. Virus isolation is required before it can be
definitively said that the etiologic agent is "a virus". I have posted
this with the word "encephalitis", rather than "encephalitis-like" in the
title because I am certain the good doctors in Perth know encephalitis when
they see it. Otherwise, these cases may be of aseptic meningitis but not
encephalitis. Ten weeks seems a long time for an encephalitic illness to
take the life of a patient. Whereas this certainly could be a newly
recognized illness, more likely it is one that has been recognized
previously but not yet diagnosed in patients in this cluster. It is late
fall in Australia, not the time one would expect a mosquito-borne viral
disease. Nonetheless, on the balmy left coast of Oz, anything can happen.
We await more definitive information and would appreciate it if someone at
Queen Elizabeth II hospital, the UWA, or otherwise in Western Australia
would let our readers know what's going on with this fascinating situation.
