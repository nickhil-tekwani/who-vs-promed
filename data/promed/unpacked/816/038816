High disease levels in winter barley
------------------------------------
Winter barley growers are being advised to watch out for high disease
levels appearing in crops. According to Syngenta Seeds cereal product
development manager Simon Phillips, high levels of net blotch are
present in early-drilled winter barley crops around the country, with
some also succumbing to patches of mildew. "The problem has probably
been exacerbated by wet weather in November and December [2008],"
says Mr Phillips.

Syngenta Crop Protection technical manager, Iain Hamilton says that
growers should be prepared to spray with an early fungicide if
necessary. "Keeping disease out before it escalates is especially
important in barley because lower leaves can contribute even more to
yield than they do in wheat, and because diseases such as net blotch
and rhynchosporium can be difficult to eradicate once established."

[Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). Losses of up
to 20 percent to have been reported. The pathogen survives between
seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley, some grasses, and seed.
For more information on net blotch see ProMED-mail post no. 20080707.2057.

Two types of mildew on barley are known, and it is not specified
above which one has been observed. Powdery mildew is caused by
_Blumeria_ (syn. _Erysiphe_) _graminis_ f.sp. _hordei_ and can affect
all aerial parts of the plant. Losses of up to 40 percent have been
recorded and are greatest when the plants are infected in the
seedling stage. Downy mildew is caused by _Sclerophthora_ species and
is considered a minor disease of the crop.

Scald caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of the most
destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet seasons. It can
decrease yield by up to 40 percent and reduces grain quality. The
pathogen can cause symptomless seed infection, which leads to a high
risk of spread.

Management strategies for these pathogens generally include cultural
practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, use of clean seed, and
resistant cultivars. For more information on the diseases please see
