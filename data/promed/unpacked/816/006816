An outbreak of the parasitic infection, Chagas disease, has sickened a dozen people of the same family in the La Macarena municipality Febres Cordero, Merida state, in the Andean region of Venezuela.

Denis Gomez, director of the Health Corporation (Corposalud) in Merida, said that they have been treated by medical teams in the state. Three deaths (2 infants and one adult) were reported as the doctor noted: "The patient came to hospital in a critical phase [late], and despite the efforts of the doctors, died."

A team led by Corposalud supported by the Sanitary Control, Bureau of Environmental Health, and the regional epidemiology services moved to the town located some 60 km northeast of Merida capital to establish an epidemiological fence and evaluate potential causes of the outbreak.

The Corposalud regent said preliminary case reports indicate poor hygiene conditions for family food handling and disposal among other possible causes.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (_T. cruzi_). It is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 Latin American countries.

About 7 million to 8 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the parasite.

_T. cruzi_ parasites are mainly transmitted by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine bugs. In addition, the parasite can be transmitted via food contaminated with _T. cruzi_ through, for example, the contact with triatomine bug feces, blood transfusions using blood from infected donors, passage from an infected mother to her newborn during pregnancy or childbirth, organ transplants using organs from infected donors, and laboratory accidents.

[Since the outbreak in 2005 in Santa Catharina (Brazil), it is now generally accepted that oral transmission is a common way of acquiring infection with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (Chagas disease). The largest outbreak reported so far was in Caracas in 2007, when approximately 130 schoolchildren were infected, most probably from contaminated guava juice. - Mod.EP
