AIDS-Related Illnesses Leading Cause of Death in South Africa in 2000
--------------------------------------------------
AIDS-related illnesses were the leading cause of death in South Africa in
2000, accounting for about 30 percent of all deaths nationwide, according
to a Medical Research Council of South Africa report released on Tue 17 May
2005, South Africa's Star reports. The report, compiled by MRC's Burden of
Disease Research Unit, shows that mortality rates and causes of death
differ in the country's 9 provinces but that HIV/AIDS was the leading cause
of death overall. HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death in every province
except the Western Cape.
Debbie Bradshaw, co-author of the report and director of the disease unit,
said the study employed several data-collection methods, including death
notification forms and census and household surveys.
The report says that the country is dealing with a "quadruple burden of
disease," with communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries
and HIV/AIDS playing large roles in mortality, according to the Star newspaper.
According to official statistics, South Africa has the highest number of
HIV-positive residents of any country worldwide. UN AIDS figures released
in July 2004 showed that about 5.3 million HIV-positive people live in
South Africa, with a possible range of between 4.5 million and 6.2 million.
Recommendations
---------------
"The high death rate due to HIV/AIDS highlights the urgency to accelerate
the implementation of a comprehensive plan for the treatment and prevention
of HIV and AIDS," the report says. The authors recommend that provinces
improve access to health care services; promote active, healthy lifestyles;
and ensure "basic needs" such as access to clean water and sanitation are
met, according to the Star. The report, which is the first to provide
specific causes of death for each province, also says the mortality
information can help individual provinces respond to their particular
health needs. Bradshaw said the report could serve as "an important
benchmark" against which to monitor progress and encouraged local officials
to identify issues that need to be addressed in their areas.
Reaction
--------
South Africa's National Association of People Living with HIV/AIDS said it
"was not surprised at the high HIV/AIDS mortality rate," according to the
Star newspaper. HIV/AIDS is a "multifaceted problem" that requires
assistance from the government and business community to fight poverty and
provide antiretroviral drugs, according to NAPWA spokesperson Thanduxolo Doro.
Mark Heywood, a spokesperson for the South African HIV/AIDS treatment
advocacy group Treatment Action Campaign, said, "These figures are just
going to get worse and worse," adding, "The deaths in 2000 were at the
beginning of a period of rapid HIV infection. More people have been
infected since then, and more people are going to be dying."
However, Letitia Rispel, director of the health department in Gauteng
province, said programs implemented since 2000 might have improved the
situation. "These include the prevention of mother-to-child treatment,
wellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program," she said,
adding, "Only once we have taken these into account will we get a clear
picture." South Africa's Department of Health said it would comment once it
had reviewed the report.

South Africa: Government Declines to Comment On New AIDS Report
-------------------------------------------------
The South African health department has declined to comment on a startling
new HIV/AIDS report, arguing that the document has not yet been
"officially" released.
According to the Medical Research Council report on cause-specific death
rates for each of the country's 9 provinces, AIDS was the number-one cause
of death, except in the Western Cape, which has the lowest HIV prevalence
figures. Health department spokesman Solly Mabotha was quoted by the South
African Press Association as saying: "The report has not been released
officially, which means the minister and the director-general haven't seen
it yet. We therefore cannot comment."
The findings in the report, which is already available to news agencies on
request, showed that almost 30 percent of deaths in 2000 were caused by
HIV/AIDS.

Up to 1/3 of South African Miners are HIV-positive
----------------------------------------------
Up to 30 percent of South African miners suffer from HIV/AIDS, posing one
of the greatest challenges to the sector, Mineral and Energy Minister
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said on Thu 19 May 2005.
"Individual mines have done prevalence studies and the results are not
readily available - estimation is 20 percent to 30 percent of miners are
affected," Mlambo-Ngcuka told parliament. "HIV/AIDS remains one of the
biggest challenges in the mining industry," said Mlambo-Ngcuka, adding that
there was a general commitment from the industry to deal with the pandemic.
Mines in South Africa employ more than 500 000 workers, or 4.3 percent of
the country's total workforce, and the sector accounts for about 1/3 of all
exports.
A new report by the Medical Research Council showed that AIDS was the
number-one killer in South Africa, with one in 3 people dying from the
disease. On Thursday, Mlambo-Ngcuka said mining companies had made
commitments to introduce measures on preventing and monitoring HIV/AIDS as
well as treatment programmes. The plans were expected to be introduced in
the 2nd quarter of 2005, she said.
South Africa has the world's highest AIDS caseload, with 5.3 million
people, or an estimated one out of 5 adults living with HIV and AIDS,
according to United Nations figures. President Thabo Mbeki's government
began rolling out free antiretrovirals in November 2003, under pressure
from AIDS activists who went to court to win an order against the
government. At least 42 000 South Africans are receiving free
antiretrovirals under the government's rollout program, but the key AIDS
lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign, is urging the government to
speed up the ARV rollout to make them available to 200 000 people by 2006.

AIDS Becomes Leading Killer in South Africa
-------------------------------------------
South Africa's biggest killer is HIV/AIDS, which causes 1 in 3 deaths, the
Medical Research Council (MRC) said in a report on cause-specific death
rates for each of the 9 provinces issued here on Tue 17 May 2005. Estimates
of HIV/AIDS mortality in Gauteng province, the economic center in the
country, accounted for 33 percent of all deaths in 2000 -- one in 3 --
compared with 30 percent of all deaths nationwide, according to the report.
Compiled by the MRC's Burden of Disease Research Unit, the report shows
that overall mortality rates and causes of death differ in the provinces,
but that HIV/AIDS is the leading killer across the board. "These figures
are just going to get worse and worse," Mark Heywood, spokesperson for the
Treatment Action Campaign, said on Mon 16 May 2005.
The findings relating to HIV/AIDS deaths were consistent with other
available reports. The deaths in 2000 were at the beginning of a period of
rapid HIV infection. More people have been infected since then and more
people are going to be dying.
But Dr. Letitia Rispel, head of department for the Gauteng Health
Department, said it would be difficult to say what the situation would be
now without taking programs implemented since 2000 into account. "These
include the prevention of mother-to-child treatment [transmission?],
wellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program. Only once we have
taken these into account will we get a clear picture, " he added.
The MRC report, which also looks at other causes of deaths in the various
provinces, shows that these varied from province to province. For women in
Gauteng, the main causes of death, excluding HIV/AIDS, are stroke, lower
respiratory tract infections, homicide, ischaemic heart disease, road
accidents, TB, hypertensive heart disease, diarrhoeal diseases, septicemia
and diabetes mellitus. For men, the 10 leading causes of death, excluding
HIV/AIDS, are homicide and road traffic accidents, ischaemic heart disease,
TB, lower respiratory infections, stroke, suicide, diarrhoeal diseases,
diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
This differs from the 10 leading causes of death for Western Cape men. For
those, the 10 leading causes of death are homicide, HIV/AIDS, traffic
accidents, TB, heart disease and stroke, cancer of the upper respiratory
tract or lungs, suicide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower
respiratory infections. For women in the Western Cape the main causes of
death are HIV/ AIDS, TB, heart disease, stroke, traffic accidents,
homicide, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, breast cancer and lower
respiratory infections. And according to the report, Western Cape residents
have the highest life expectancy in the country, probably due to a
relatively low HIV infection rate.

[The MRC Report discussed in the preceding reports is contained in the
document referred to below. Mod.CP]

Statistics South Africa - Causes of death in South Africa 1997-2001 -
Advance release of recorded causes of death
--------------------------------------------------
On 21 Nov 2002, Statistics South Africa released a report of the recorded
deaths in South Africa (pdf format 602 kb) (<http://www.statssa.gov.za/>
and <http://www.mrc.ac.za/researchreports/causesofdeath.pdf>) based on a 12
percent sample of death certificates for the period 1997-2001. The results
show a rapidly changing cause of death profile with increasing proportions
of TB, HIV and influenza and pneumonia deaths and decreasing proportions of
unnatural causes during this period. A Task Team including the Departments
of Health, Social Development, Home Affairs and the Medical Research
Council provided technical support in the planning and implementation of
the study.
In 2004 the MRC released a report in which it was estimated that about 25
percent of all deaths were due to HIV/AIDS. The Statistics South Africa
study finds a lower percentage (9 percent) of deaths recorded as being due
to HIV. A major reason for this difference is that these studies measure
different things.
The Statistics South Africa data reflect the information recorded on the
death certificates. In the absence of HIV status of all deceased, death
certificates will tend to reflect immediate cause of deaths or, in the case
of AIDS, the indicator conditions. The MRC approach, however, was to assess
the impact of HIV/AIDS as an underlying cause of death, based on the
observed excess mortality among young adults.
The MRC research team considers that the number of deaths attributable to
HIV is the leading cause of death and plans to undertake further analysis
of these valuable data as well as other data to refine the estimates of the
actual impact.

[ProMED-mail does not normally post reports on HIV/AIDS, but the magnitude
of the problem in South Africa and the continuing reticence of the South
African Government require that the South African Medical Research Council
Report be given wider exposure. The MRC report is based on figures obtained
in the period 1999-2001, and there has been no subsequent MRC report. - Mod.CP]
