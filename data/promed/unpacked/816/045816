The Department of Animal Husbandry has intensified anti-anthrax immunisation measures at Thiriyalam and other villages in the Jolarpet block [Vellore district, Tamil Nadu] after a person died in the Christian Medical College Hospital [in Puducherry] on Wednesday [4 Jun 2014], a week after admission for grave sickness brought on by the consumption of the meat of a sick goat slaughtered by its owner.

While the hospital diagnosed his disease as human anthrax, the Department did not find evidence of the goat or any other animal in the area having been infected with anthrax, said T Manoharan, Regional Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry. Dr Manoharan told The Hindu that the goat belonging to a farmer of Thiriyalam, was treated at the veterinary dispensary in the village for indigestion. When its condition turned critical, the owner slaughtered the animal. Many persons consumed the meat.

[The patient], aged between 25 and 30, fell sick after he consumed the brain part of the animal in a raw condition. He was admitted to the local primary health centre, from where he was referred to the CMC Hospital on [28 May 2014].

The Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry said personnel of the Animal Disease Intelligence Unit and the Public Health Department conducted a spot survey in the village, but they could not find any evidence of anthrax. The Vellore Collector was informed. All heads of cattle at Thiriyalam and surrounding villages were immunised against anthrax in a drive which commenced on Monday [2 Jun 2014]. "The Department has increased the number of teams and decided to immunise the cattle, goats and sheep not only at Thiriyalam but in all villages within a 10-km [6.2 mi] radius.

[Anthrax is regularly reported from Puducherry (a.k.a. Pondicherry) in cattle, virtually every year, and involving only 1-2 cattle. For some reason it has not been reported in their sheep or goats. The risk of gastroenteric human anthrax is a function of the culinary arts. The more the meat, or in this case the animal's brain, is cooked, the less the risk. For some reason this young man had to eat the brain raw. May he rest in peace.

As the goat would have been slaughtered and butchered around 23 May 2014 and the parts given to relatives, neighbours, if not sold in a local market, there would have been nothing for the veterinary authorities to use for diagnosis when the medical diagnosis was made. Thus the lack of any veterinary evidence of anthrax. From their vaccination response they clearly took the medical diagnosis seriously.
