A disease that poses a "very serious threat" to the European Union's olive industry has been recorded on the Spanish island of Mallorca for the first time. A movement ban covering 15 000 hectares has been imposed and measures have been taken to "contain and eradicate its spread".

Experts describe _Xylella fastidiosa_ as one of the "most dangerous pathogens worldwide". It was first recorded in the EU in 2013 [ProMED-mail post 20131101.2033095], and has since spread westwards.

Officials from the Balearics' Department of Environment, Agriculture and Fisheries said the pathogen had been detected in 3 cherry trees at a garden centre. The subspecies found has only been recorded infecting cherry and oleander plants.

Globally, the EU is the largest producer and consumer of olive oil. Reports suggested that the _X. fastidiosa_ outbreak led to a 20 per cent increase in olive oil prices during 2015.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants, causing wilting, necrosis and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; phony disease of peach; leaf scald of plum; variegated chlorosis of citrus; lucerne dwarf; as well as leaf scorch of elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander and other woody ornamentals. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these may serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. Several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine host range and risks to crops of the spectrum of Xf strains.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors. It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern. The pathogen has been added to the EPPO quarantine lists.

Xf has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was also detected on grapevine in Taiwan in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). In Europe, it seems likely that the outbreak on olives in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in that region. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unproven, suggestions that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material appear likely. In 2015, Xf was also reported from France, including from Corsica, a neighbour island to the Balearics (ProMED-mail posts 20150422.3313661 & 20150727.3538734).

Xf subsp. _fastidiosa_ is the cause of Pierce's disease of grapevine which was reported for the 1st time in Europe recently (ProMED-mail post 20160802.4387487). Leaf scorch of oleander has been reported to be due to ssp. _sandyi_ and possibly also _pauca_, but subsp. _fastidiosa_ has never been reported to affect this host. Ssp. _pauca_ has been reported to cause diseases on coffee and citrus. Olives in Italy are also thought to be infected by a somewhat atypical form of ssp. _pauca_ (see link below), but this host has also been reported to be susceptible to ssp. _fastidiosa_ and _multiplex_ elsewhere. It appears that further research is needed for clear characterisation and host range delineation of Xf subspecies.

For Mallorca, it is not clear from the report above if the positive cherry seedlings were tested because they showed leaf scorch symptoms, or if they were asymptomatic plants detected by routine random sampling. Similarly, description of possible hosts of the isolates is not a clear statement on which strain or ssp. of Xf has been detected there and how similar it is to other European isolates.
