Rains bring disease threat to Punjab cotton, rice crops
-------------------------------------------------------
Unseasonably heavy rains in northwestern India have damaged the
cotton crop in some areas and exposed paddy to plant diseases,
farmers and scientists said.

Bacterial blight, a disease that dries up a plant's leaves, has been
reported in parts of Punjab and the problem could worsen if water is
not quickly drained, they said. Punjab accounts for 11 percent of
India's rice output.

A farm scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in
Ludhiana, Chander Mohan, said blight can reduce yields but added the
disease was not so far widespread. "Depending on the severity of
disease, yield losses could be around 10 percent in paddy and 5-30
percent in basmati and other superior varieties."

Light rains are forecast in Punjab in the next 3 days. "High
temperature and humidity may hasten the spread of blight. However, if
the weather clears up in next 3-4 days, the incidence of disease will
go down," KK Gill, from PAU's Department of Agricultural Meteorology, said.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern
Australia, Africa, and the USA. The pathogen causes yellowing and
drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and reduces yield. In Asia,
millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year
with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. The bacterium is
short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed-borne, and is spread
mainly by windblown rain and mechanical means. Disease management
includes phytosanitation, cultural measures (removal of weedy
reservoirs), and use of resistant crop varieties. For more
information on BLB please see previous ProMED-mail post no.
