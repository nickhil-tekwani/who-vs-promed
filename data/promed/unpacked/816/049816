Leaving 5 children dead in Mingli and one in Afti village, Marwah
Tehsil, in the mountainous Kishtwar district, has been hit by a
deadly measles epidemic, affecting dozens of others.

Measles, which also goes by the name of rubella [rubeola], is a
highly contagious, though rare, respiratory infection caused by a
virus. Causing skin rash all over the body and flu-like symptoms that
include fever, cough, and runny nose, it is not always [not often]
fatal if treated in time.

Confirming the spread of measles in the Warwan area amidst reports of
measles cases reported in the Kishtwar district, the district
administration and health department have sent a team of doctors [to
treat] children affected by the epidemic.

Jasbir Singh, Director of Health Services, states that a team of
doctors headed by a [regional] Medical Officer equipped with
400-doses of measles medicine has been dispatched to the Afti and
Warwan areas, located in the far-flung and remote corners of Kishtwar.

[Jammu & Kasmir is the northernmost state of India. A map of the
districts of Jammu & Kasmir is available at:
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/jammuandkashmir/jammuandkashmir-district.htm>.
The location and a description of Kishtwar can be found at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishtwar>.

Measles is a vaccine-preventable infection, but it is likely that the
mountainous and remote terrain of the Kishtwar district has impeded
efforts to provide a sufficient level of protection to interrupt the
transmission of disease. It is not clear how the level of protection
will be increased, nor the precise nature of the 400 does of measles
medicine being sent to the area. - Mod.CP]
