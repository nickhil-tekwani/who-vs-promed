New FMD strain found in Kyrgyzstan
----------------------------------
An unknown type of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which destroys even vaccinated livestock populations, has been discovered in the republic of Kyrgyzstan. The country's veterinary services are warning that the spread of the new strain of FMD could lead to disastrous consequences.

At a recent meeting of the parliament of Kyrgyzstan, ministers Ravshan Jeenbekov and Talantbek Uzakbaev warned that the disease had already led to significant losses of livestock.

"I have heard from farmers who do not know how to deal with this new form of FMD or how to treat their animals. The government needs to turn its attention to this issue and purchase a new vaccine," said Jeenbekov.

"This type of FMD could be very harmful for the livestock sector and, if nothing is done, our farmers may find themselves in a very difficult situation this autumn," added Uzakbaev.

According to preliminary data, 3000-4000 head of cattle have died so far this year in Kyrgyzstan, due to outbreaks of FMD. Samples of the new FMD strain have been already sent to Russia for study.

The discovery of the unknown form of FMD has disturbed veterinary services in neighbouring countries, especially Kazakhstan, where another large outbreak of FMD was discovered last week. According to the Kazakhstan's veterinary services, an outbreak revealed on 6 Jun 2012 resulted in the culling of 144 head of cattle and 576 small ruminants.

Vaccination was performed on 2977 head of cattle and 4971 head of small ruminants, and veterinary services plan to vaccinate a further 14 237 head of cattle and 11 976 head of small ruminants.

[The identification of the causative FMD strain currently circulating in Kyrgyzstan (and N. China/Kazakhstan?), its serotyping and genotyping, is anticipated with interest. Such diagnosis is particularly urgent whenever the disease affects vaccinated animals. Hopefully, the results obtained by the Russian laboratory (FGI All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health, 60091 Yu'evets, Vladimir, Russian Federation) become available and published the earliest, to enable appropriate steps to be applied in Kyrgyzstan and the entire region.

The last report of Kyrgyzstan to the OIE on an outbreak of FMD as an Exceptional epidemiological event" was submitted in 2007.

Kazakhstan has reported 10 outbreaks of FMD serotype O on its eastern and south-eastern parts, including its border with Kyrgyzstan, since August 2011 (reports and interactive map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10940. On 11 Mar 2012, Kazakhstan reported 2 outbreaks of a "New strain", serotype A, on its south-eastern territory, adjacent to the border with Kyrgyzstan; the reports and interactive map are available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11746. - Mod.AS]
