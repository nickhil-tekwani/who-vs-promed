From North Texas back to Northern Europe: A measles outbreak that began at the end of May 2013 in the Netherlands continues, having hit 1266 people and resulting in 90 cases of pneumonia, one case of encephalitis, and 82 hospital admissions. That's a 6.5 percent hospitalization rate in a developed country with good medical care and clean water and quite similar to the rates in the recent outbreak in Wales. And it's not over, as authorities expect it to continue for some time, just as it did in Wales.

This latest Netherlands measles episode began in what officials are calling an "orthodox Protestant school," where most people affected ranged in age from 4 to 12. Of the over 1200 people infected, 96.5 percent were unvaccinated, and another 3.2 percent were partially vaccinated. Ten of the cases occurred in healthcare workers, 9 of whom were not vaccinated.

Five cases of measles have been reported during the 1st 2 weeks of September 2013 according to the Chelyabinsk Oblast Public Health and Welfare Organisation. Previously, the most recent cases of measles infection in the Chelyabinsk oblast (5 cases in Chelyabinsk city) were recorded in 2006. At that time, the infection had been introduced from Ukraine and Thailand. Currently in the South Urals, more than 2400 children have not been vaccinated against measles (mainly due to the negligence of parents) as well as 6500 adults aged up to 35 years of age. During the 1st 2 weeks of September 2013, 5 cases of measles have been diagnosed in Troitsk. All the patients belong to the Roma population according to the Chelyabinsk Epidemiology Department.

The staff members of medical institutions in Troitsk have begun surveillance of contacts, vaccination of unvaccinated people and initiating environmental disinfection measures. As of 10 Sep 2013, a total of 118 people in the Roma community, including 75 children, have been vaccinated against measles. During this undertaking, a further 2 children were identified with suspected measles virus infection. In order to prevent further spread of measles in the region, routine vaccination according to the national schedule has been accelerated, and other groups such as nomadic communities, foreign citizens and stateless persons have been included in the national vaccination programme. The National Immunization Calendar of the Russian Federation provides for 2 immunizations against measles in children at 12 months and 6 years, as well as measles immunization for adolescents and adults up to 35 years of age, either without a history of measles, not previously vaccinated, or vaccinated against the virus on one occasion only.

Measles cases are continuing to drop, with just 73 confirmed cases in July 2013. This is the 3rd consecutive drop, bringing the total number of cases to 1365 since the start of the year [2013]. Public Health England (PHE) launched a nationwide MMR catch-up programme in April 2013, which aimed to vaccinate as many 10-16 year olds as possible before the new school year, which started this week.

The figures show that at least 65 000 previously unvaccinated children received one dose of MMR vaccine since last year [2012]. Also, 2 percent more children aged between 10-16 were given 2 doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE head of immunisation, said: "We are still making good progress towards the 95 percent uptake target. We have seen a persistent month-on-month drop in cases, however, it is still too soon to tell if this is of consequence to the campaign. As children return to school this week, it is important to remember that measles is highly infectious and spreads easily in the classroom. Children who are fully vaccinated with MMR help to stop the spread and, therefore, to protect their friends and families."

Professor David Salisbury, Director of Immunisation at the Department of Health, said: "These figures, which show that more children have been immunised and cases are presently going down, are really encouraging." Vaccine supply figures show that around 200 000 extra doses of MMR have been used. The government is now drawing up plans to further increase vaccine uptake in school age children.

Two children died of measles among 60 recorded cases in the space of 40 days in Kasumbalesa, about 90 km from Lubumbashi (Katanga). These figures were delivered to the press on Tue 10 Sep 2013 by a doctor at the Health Centre in Kasumbalesa, Stella Muyano. Dr. Muyano said the ages of the children ranged from 0 to 59 months. He said measles affected only children who were not vaccinated.

"The causes of the outbreak are numerous, including non-compliance with the immunization schedule against measles by parents and also by overcrowding in some neighborhoods of this city," said Dr. Muyano. The head of the city of Kasumbalesa, Andre Kapamp, is concerned by the resurgence of measles cases in the area. He said that children died in this city due to lack of proper treatment and announced a campaign on compliance with the immunization schedule and treatment of measles in all areas of Kasumbalesa. Children affected by measles are being admitted to the Health Centre and other private centres in Kasumbalesa.

Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that can lead to complications and death. Although measles elimination (i.e., interruption of continuous transmission lasting 12 months or more) was declared in the United States in 2000, importation of measles cases continues to occur.

During 2001-2012, the median annual number of measles cases reported in the United States was 60 (range: 37-220), including 26 imported cases (range: 18-80). The median annual number of outbreaks reported to CDC was 4 (range: 2-16). Since elimination, the highest numbers of U.S. cases were reported in 2008 (140 cases) and 2011 (220). To update measles data, CDC evaluated cases reported by 16 states during 1 Jan-24 Aug 2013. A total of 159 cases of measles were reported during this period. Most cases were in persons who were unvaccinated (131 [82 percent]) or had unknown vaccination status (15 [9 percent]). 42 importations were reported, and 21(50 percent) were importations from the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. Eight outbreaks accounted for 77 percent of the cases reported in 2013, including the largest outbreak reported in the United States since 1996 (58 cases). These outbreaks demonstrate that unvaccinated persons place themselves and their communities at risk for measles and that high vaccination coverage is important to prevent the spread of measles after importation.

Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition. A measles case is confirmed in a person with febrile rash illness and laboratory confirmation or a direct epidemiologic link to a confirmed case. Laboratory confirmation involves serologic detection of measles-specific immunoglobulin M, a significant increase in measles immunoglobulin G level, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus by nucleic acid amplification in a clinical specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, nasal aspirate, throat wash, or urine). Cases are considered imported if exposure to measles virus occurred outside the United States 7-21 days before rash onset and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that period. Import-associated cases include 1) imported cases, 2) cases that are linked epidemiologically to imported cases, and 3) cases for which an epidemiologic link has not been identified but the viral genotype detected suggests recent importation. An outbreak of measles is defined as a chain of transmission with 3 or more confirmed cases.

During 1 Jan-24 Aug 2013, a total of 159 cases were reported to CDC from 16 states and New York City. Patients ranged in age from 0 days to 61 years; 18 (11 percent) were aged under 12 months, 40 (25 percent) were aged 1-4 years, 58 (36 percent) were aged 5-19 years, and 43 (27 percent) were aged 20 years or older. Among the 159 cases, 17 (11 percent) persons required hospitalization, including 4 patients diagnosed with pneumonia. No deaths were reported.

Among the 159 cases, 157 (99 percent) were import-associated, and 2 had an unknown source. 42 (26 percent) importations (23 returning U.S. residents and 19 visitors to the United States) from 18 countries were reported, and 21 (50 percent) of the importations were from the WHO European Region. Genotypes identified to date are D8 (47 cases), B3 (6), H1 (4), D9 (3), and D4 (2).

Most cases were in persons who were unvaccinated (131 [82 percent]) or had unknown vaccination status (15 [9 percent]). 13 (8 percent) of the patients had been vaccinated, of whom 3 had received 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Among 140 U.S. residents who acquired measles, 117 (84 percent) were unvaccinated, and 11(8 percent) had unknown vaccination status. Of those who were unvaccinated, 92 (79 percent) had philosophical objections to vaccination, 6 (5 percent) had missed opportunities for vaccination, 15 (13 percent) occurred among infants aged under 12 months who were not eligible for vaccination, and for 4 (3 percent), the reason for no vaccination was unknown. Among the 21 U.S. resident patients who traveled abroad and were aged 6 months or older, 14 (67 percent) were unvaccinated, 5 (24 percent) had unknown vaccination status, and 2 had received one dose of MMR vaccine.

To date in 2013, 8 outbreaks have accounted for 77 percent of the cases, and outbreaks have ranged from 3 to 58 cases. The largest outbreak occurred in New York City. None of these patients had documentation of vaccination at the time of exposure, including 12 (21 percent) who were aged under 12 months. Of those who were eligible for vaccination, 31 (67 percent) had objected or had parental objection to vaccination because of religious or philosophical beliefs. The 2nd largest outbreak, in North Carolina (23 cases, including a California resident), occurred mainly among persons not vaccinated because of personal belief exemptions. In an ongoing outbreak in Texas, 20 confirmed cases have been reported as of 24 Aug 2013 among members of a church community. 19 (95 percent) cases were in patients aged under 12 months, and 17 (85 percent) of the patients were unvaccinated. The index patient was an adult with unknown measles vaccination history who traveled to Indonesia.

MMWR Editorial Note

Measles elimination has been maintained in the United States since it was declared in 2000. However, an estimated 20 million cases of measles occur each year worldwide, and cases continue to be imported into the United States. The increase in measles cases in the United States in 2013 serves as a reminder that imported measles cases can result in large outbreaks, particularly if introduced into areas with pockets of unvaccinated persons.

During 2013, nearly 2/3rds of the cases came from 3 outbreaks. In these outbreaks, transmission occurred after introduction of measles into communities with pockets of persons unvaccinated because of philosophical or religious beliefs. This allowed for spread to occur, mainly in households and community gatherings, before public health interventions could be implemented. Despite progress in global measles control and elimination, measles importations are likely to continue posing risks of measles outbreaks in unvaccinated communities. Maintaining high MMR vaccination coverage is essential to prevent measles outbreaks and sustain measles elimination in the United States.

To date in 2013, 23 measles importations have been reported by U.S. residents, most of whom were aged 6 months or older and unvaccinated. The source of imported cases continues to be most often the WHO European Region, a popular destination for U.S. travelers and an area where measles continues to circulate. All persons aged 6 months or older without evidence of measles immunity who travel outside the United States should be vaccinated before travel with one dose of MMR vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months and 2 doses for persons aged 12 months or older, at least 28 days apart. Routine MMR vaccination is recommended for all children at age 12-15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine are also recommended for health-care personnel and students attending post-high school educational institutions, unless they have other evidence of immunity. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive one dose of MMR vaccine. Health-care providers should encourage timely vaccination of all eligible patients and should remind parents who plan to travel internationally with children of the increased risk for measles and the importance of vaccination.

High MMR vaccine coverage in the United States (91 percent among children aged 19-35 months) limits the size of measles outbreaks; however, some states have coverage levels under 90 percent. Additionally, unvaccinated children tend to cluster geographically and socially, increasing the risk for outbreaks. Increases in the proportion of persons declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large-scale and sustained outbreaks, threatening the elimination of measles in the United States. Maintenance of high, 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage, early detection of cases, and rapid public health response to a case are the key factors that will lead to sustained elimination, despite the continued importation of cases into the United States.

On 14 Apr 2013, public health officials in North Carolina were notified of suspected measles infections in 2 unvaccinated members of the same family. Measles was confirmed by laboratory testing at the State Laboratory of Public Health on 16 Apr 2013. Investigators learned that a 3rd unvaccinated member of the household had developed fever and rash 11 days earlier after returning to the United States from a 3-month visit to India, but measles had not been suspected until household contacts sought evaluation for similar symptoms.

During April and May 2013, direct and indirect transmission from the returning traveler resulted in 22 identified cases of measles (including the 2 cases 1st reported), for a total of 23 cases overall. Most cases were among residents of a largely unvaccinated religious community in rural North Carolina. 18 (78 percent) of the 23 patients were unvaccinated; 3 (13 percent) had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine, and 2 (9 percent) had unknown vaccination status. The 23 patients ranged in age from 1-59 years. Measles was confirmed by laboratory testing of specimens from 16 patients (70 percent). Specimens collected from 8 cases were sent to the Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Center at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for molecular characterization. Genotype D8, the most commonly identified measles genotype in India, was identified in the specimens from all 8 cases.

This outbreak required extensive resources from both state and local public health agencies. Estimates provided by local health departments indicated that approximately 2200 hours were spent on control efforts. Isolation orders were issued to 30 persons with suspected or confirmed measles infection. Investigation of the contacts of these persons led to the identification of approximately 1000 exposed persons from various settings, including health-care facilities, schools, and community events. Contacts without evidence of measles immunity were offered post exposure prophylaxis with measles vaccine or immune globulin as indicated. Written quarantine orders were issued to 72 (81 percent) of 89 susceptible contacts who did not receive measles vaccine within 72 hours of exposure, and oral quarantine orders were issued to the remaining 17 (19 percent).

Although measles is no longer endemic in the United States, importation of measles virus continues to occur. This outbreak consumed resources from state and local public health agencies for many weeks and resulted in restrictions on the movement, through isolation or quarantine measures, of approximately 115 persons in the community. Preventing future travel-associated outbreaks in North Carolina and the United States will require maintaining high rates of immunization (particularly among travelers to areas where measles is endemic), rapid identification of cases, and swift public health response.

The Eagle Mountain International Church near Ft. Worth, Texas was the scene of a measles outbreak during the month of August 2013. A visitor who had traveled overseas visited the church and unknowingly spread the disease when hugging parishioners and handling babies in the church daycare. 16 cases of the measles originated at the church, including 7 adults and 9 children. The youngest is just 4 months old. Health officials say that 11 of the infected persons have never been vaccinated.

According to CNN, church officials had preached against vaccinations in the past, part of a trend involving religious exemptions that has alarmed pediatricians. There have been measles outbreaks in New York, California, North Carolina and Indiana, where vaccinations have been shunned. Televangalist Kenneth Copeland has spoken out against children getting immunized, CNN alleges, by showing a video clip where Copeland linked vaccinations with autism, a link that medical officials have not found. When Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann sought the presidency during the 2012 Republican primaries, Bachmann reiterated the claim that vaccines were linked to autism.

Terri Pearsons, Copeland's eldest daughter and pastor at the Eagle Mountain International Church, released a statement. "Some people think I am against immunizations, but that is not true," it read. "If you read the Old Testament, you'll find that it is full of precautionary measures," Pearsons claims in a clip aired by CNN to document the church's belief in faith healing. "Go in faith. Don't do anything you don't do in faith. If you're somebody, and you know that you know that you know that you've got this covered in your household by faith, and it crosses your heart of faith, well then don't go do it." CNN reports that the church website urges people to 1st seek the wisdom of God and then appropriate medical attention.

Local public health officials have confirmed a measles infection in a child who was in several locations in King County during the contagious period. The child is a King County resident who was incompletely vaccinated -- had one of the recommended 2 doses of vaccine and at an age earlier than recommended -- and exposed to a sibling who had the measles. The sibling was unvaccinated and had become infected while traveling in Europe; the sibling's case was previously announced by public health officials.

Because most people in our area have immunity to the measles through vaccination, the risk to the general public is low. In addition, outdoor exposure locations carry lower risk. However, all people who were in the following locations around the same time as the individual with measles should:
- Find out whether they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously, and
- Call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or unexplained rash between 4 and 20 Sep 3013. To avoid possibly spreading measles to other patients, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling 1st to tell them you want to be evaluated for measles.

Before receiving the measles diagnosis, the child was in several King County locations where other people might have been exposed. Anyone who was at one of the following sites during the following times was possibly exposed to measles. Locations included are the following:

28 Aug 2013:
Central Park Tennis Club - 5820 125th Ln NE, Kirkland, 4-8 p.m.
29 Aug 2013:
Central Park Tennis Club - 5820 125th Ln NE, Kirkland, 4-8 p.m.
30 Aug 2013:
AV Performance Tennis Club - 13203 NE 16th St, Bellevue, 9 a.m.-1 p.m.,
Eastside Tennis Center - 10822 117th Pl NE, Kirkland, 2:30-4:45 p.m., and Central Park Tennis Club - 5820 125th Ln NE, Kirkland, WA, 4-7:30 p.m.

If you were in these areas at the times above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between 4-20 Sep 2013.

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, and red, watery eyes. It is mainly spread through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes. Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from approximately 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age, and those with weakened immune systems.

The North Coast Public Health Unit is advising people in the Tweed area to be alert for measles. One person who visited Tweed Heads last week has since been diagnosed with measles. Six measles cases have also been reported in Queensland over the past month.

"Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes, which usually last for several days before a red blotchy rash appears. Complications range from an ear infection and diarrhoea to pneumonia and swelling of the brain (encephalitis)," Mr Corben said. "Vaccination with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the only way to prevent infection."
