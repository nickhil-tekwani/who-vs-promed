According to a local media report picked up by Xinhua, there have been 17
deaths from cholera in Kalokol, which borders Lake Turkana in northern
Kenya within the last month.
The Kenyan government is now taking measures to curb the outbreak of the
epidemic in the region, according to the media report quoting Rift Valley
provincial medical officer Dr. Kenneth Chebet. [Chebet had just ended a
tour of the cholera-hit areas in the north to check the situation and
spread cholera prevention knowledge.
"Medical personnel and health workers had been sent to the area to contain
the outbreak," he said, adding that adequate medical supplies had also been
taken to the cholera-hit areas. He called on the residents there to boil
drinking water, use pit latrines and make proper waste disposal to prevent
spread of the disease. The medical official also advised that only
transportation of dried and smoked fish, instead of fresh fish produce, be
allowed out of Kalokol and other cholera-spreading areas around Lake
Turkana until the killing disease is under control.
