Privacy Issues Raised in Syphilis Cases Linked to San Francisco Chat Room
--------------------------------------------------------
In what health officials believe is the first time a disease cluster has
been traced to cyberspace, the department of public health here has tracked
an outbreak of syphilis cases to an America Online chat room.
Officials from the San Francisco Department of Public Health said 6 men who
had contracted syphilis in the last 3 months have traced their last sexual
encounters to partners they met through a chat room created by an America
Online member, San Francisco Men 4 Men (SFM4M).
The case is a new development for public health officials who traditionally
define an affected group by the members' physical proximity or relation and
poses a question for the electronic age: when does the right to online
privacy yield to public health issues?
Some of the men who were infected with syphilis know their multiple partners
only by their computer nicknames, or "handles." While such anonymity could
be an obstacle to public health officials in other cases, say among people
who met in a bar, in this case, America Online knows the participants' real
names but would not divulge them.
So the only way to contact the scores of sex partners the syphilis-infected
men met online has been through e-mail and postings in the chat room itself.
Although the number of men known to be infected so far is small and their
infections were identified early and are fully treatable, they represent a
sizable number of the 17 syphilis cases reported in San Francisco this year,
and the cluster has provided a frightening glimpse of a potentially larger
public health risk, as more and more people use computers to find sex
partners, officials said.
Besides the 6 men who met partners through the America Online chat room,
which is open only to its subscribers, a seventh local man who contracted
syphilis since June said he met his sex partners through an Internet relay
chat room, known as an I.R.C. Together, the seven men have identified 99 sex
partners in the last 3 months -- one man had 47 partners -- and 5 of the 7
men have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, health
officials said.
At a time when both syphilis and AIDS cases are at an all-time low in San
Francisco, as in the rest of the country, officials are now worried that
these 7 syphilis cases may indicate a new venue has been created for unsafe
sex. The core group of individuals using cyberspace to meet multiple,
anonymous sex partners is the same as that which would use bathhouses or
highway rest stops or other pick-up venues to engage in
unsafe, potentially dangerous sex, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, the director
of the sexually transmitted disease unit at the public health department.
Not only did 5 of the infected men expose numerous partners to HIV, but
because syphilis causes open sores that increase the vulnerability to HIV,
their partners are at greater risk of contracting the virus, Dr. Klausner
said.
Once the health department traced the cluster of syphilis cases to the chat
room, Dr. Klausner said he called America Online to find out how the
department could contact all the exposed sex partners, as well as those men
who might have contact with the exposed men.
America Online does not give out the names of subscribers as a matter of
policy, unless presented with a court order or in the event of special cases
like a physical threat, said Rich Damato, a spokesman. Asked whether the
syphilis cluster constituted a physical threat, he said, "I would not want
in this case to speculate what would constitute a physical threat."
Dr. Klausner said that the health department considered trying to subpoena
the names of the chat room subscribers, but "there wasn't a large enough
public health risk to warrant that."
Instead, in a move applauded by Internet privacy advocates, America Online
put the health department in touch with Planet Out, a worldwide online
service in San Francisco for homosexuals.
Tom Rielly, chairman of Planet Out said that the service used e-mails,
volunteers and its own Web site ( www.planetout.com) to get the word out in
the last 2 weeks to the chat room users who would be more likely to read
mail from the service than from other sources.
"What we did first was send a letter out to the chat room names the health
department obtained from the men who were infected," Rielly said. Then, he
said, Planet Out posted instant messages to people who were in the chat
rooms. It also trained 60 volunteers to visit the chat rooms and talk to
people there, and posted information on its Web site.
Of the 99 men who were directly exposed to syphilis, 33 have been tested.
Dr. Klausner estimated that perhaps another third had contacted their own
doctors, while the remaining still do not know that they were exposed.
Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology,
a policy organization in Washington that advocates protecting privacy rights
in the cyber age, commended the health department and Planet Out for how
they handled the situation. By contacting people online, the agency has a
chance to reach not just infected participants, but also those who may be at
risk, she said. "They're saying, 'Look, be careful,' " Ms. Mulligan said.
"They're potentially reaching a much broader audience."
Tim Westmoreland, a senior policy fellow and public health expert at
Georgetown University Law School, also applauded the effort. "I've never
heard of a case like this -- ever," he said. One sticking point, he said, is
that the health department cannot be certain that infected participants will
return to the chat rooms. But on the whole, he said, warning people in chat
rooms is an easier way of contacting people and more efficient than
traditional door-to-door methods. "This is a new way of defining the
community," he said. "It's not defined by physical geography, but by the use
of cyberspace."
(A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
said that she had never heard of another cluster traced to cyberspace, but
could not be certain that one exists but was not reported.)
Dr. Klausner of the health department said that since Planet Out began its
outreach, the numbers of men seeking testing at the department's sex clinics
has nearly doubled. [By Evelyn Nieves]

AAP- In the late 1970s and early 1980s, San Francisco had the highest rate
of syphilis infection in the United States. But cases of the disease, which
is easily treated with antibiotics if detected early, are at an all-time
national low and the disease is one targeted for elimination by the U.S.
Federal government.
