With the cooler, wet weather we experienced, things did slow down,
but the tally continues to rise. As of today [10 Jul 2010], we have a
total of 30 carcasses; 23 have been disposed of through fire, and the
remaining 7 have been chemically treated with formaldehyde. Just to
reiterate the importance of chemically treating carcasses, we visited
3 carcasses today that are now a week old, and even though many bears
have been spotted, these carcasses remain intact and have not been
scavenged [even by foxes - Mod.MHJ].

The weather here is supposed to heat up for the remainder of the week
(25-28 C), so we will remain diligent and continue our surveillance
and disposal operations. If logistics permit, the next couple of days
will see us using our Department's hand held infrared scanner to
survey the wooded area in and around the most active prairies. To
date, most of the carcasses have been found in open type habitat.

[If anyone doubted the value of spraying carcasses with formaldehyde,
here you have your answer. Plus, it degrades pretty quickly and makes
a good fertiliser.

The infra-red scanners are most useful. These came in with the Hot
Shot teams of forest firefighters. As fevered bison will go in under
the aspen trees to get some shade, their carcasses can be soon lost
to sight. But with i/r scanners, you can find them for 6 days;
initially, it is just the residual body heat, but then the stomach
contents and intestinal contents start fermenting, and latterly, the
muscles decomposing, so the long viewing possible from planes and helicopters.
