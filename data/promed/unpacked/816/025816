The outbreak of cholera in Mbuji-Mayi in the province of Kasai-Oriental in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) "remains alarming", and the disease
continues to spread, according to the International Federation of the Red
Cross.
An Federation update issued on Wed, 12 Feb 2003 said 202 deaths had been
reported since the disease broke out in September 2002. Several hundred
people in Mbuji-Mayi town and the villages of Bakamba, Bakamaleka,
Kambanga, and Tshilunde are affected.
The population of Kasai-Oriental Province is about 4.2 million. The
Federation said most of those affected by the epidemic were residents of
the densely populated (over one million) mining city of Mbuji-Mayi.
The update quoted official sources as saying that some 3139 people had been
hospitalised between September 2002 and January 2003. According to
Federation, the highest numbers of cases were reported from the cholera
treatment centres of Dibindi (938 cases), Miabi (530 cases), Kansele (456
cases), Tshilengue (433 cases), and Bipemba (425 cases).
"The total number of cases and deaths may still be unknown because of lack
of access, nonexistent communications, and cultural norms; the epidemic may
therefore be affecting a greater number of people than formally recorded,"
the Federation said.
The Federation launched an appeal in November 2002 for support in combating
the disease, "but has received slow response, with about a third of the
required amount confirmed so far, thanks to contributions from the Swedish
and Finnish Red Cross. The outstanding needs remain high and is affecting
the implementation of planned activities such as construction of latrines,
sensitization activities in sanitation, disaster risk mapping, water
collection activities, and the refurbishment of the Red Cross office and 2
local branches of Kasai-Oriental are not yet able to be carried out."

district registered a marked upsurge of dysentery from 28 cases last week

113 last week to 13 this week. Other districts that have continued to
report high numbers of dysentery cases are Arua (81 cases), Moyo (59),
Kotido (51 cases), and Yumbe (50 cases). Districts need to step up
community health education on proper hygiene practices as a control measure
to dysentery.
3rd Week of 2003 (Week ending 19 Jan 2003)
Cholera cases were reported in 6 districts this week. There was a general
decrease in the number of reported cases. Kasese reported a reduction from

further dropped from 13 to 7 cases this week. Other districts with cholera
cases were Arua (7 cases this week compared to 12 last week), Bundibugyo (7

Cholera Death Toll Stands At 33
--------------------------------
Cholera has claimed 33 lives in Mozambique since the first case of the
present outbreak was diagnosed in the northern province of Niassa in
September 2002, reports Monday 17 Feb 2003 issue of the Maputo daily
"Noticias".
The outbreak is now affecting 5 provinces, namely Niassa, Cabo Delgado,and
Nampula in the northern region, and Sofala and Manica in the center. Of
these, Sofala is the worst hit, with 715 cases diagnosed. 10 of the
patients died, all in the districts of Maringue and Chemba.
The health authorities in Beira, the provincial capital, are now
complaining of shortage of staff for civic education campaigns in most of
the city's suburbs, where the situation is causing serious concern because
of the continuous degradation of the sanitation conditions.
Caia district is another part of Sofala that has been seriously affected by
the disease, with a total of 197 cases reported.
In Niassa, where the health authorities have reported so far 539 cases with
16 deaths, the most affected areas are Lichinga, the provincial capital,
the town of Cuamba, and Lago district.
In Cuamba, health authorities told reporters that the number of cases is
gradually dropping, following regularization of the water supply.
As for Nampula, the disease has spread to the district of Erati, with 30
patients admitted to the local rural hospital during the first 3 days.
Previously, cholera cases had been notified in the districts of
Nacala-Porto, Nacala-a-Velha, and Memba, all blamed on the heavy rainfall
in the northern region of the country.
Health authorities are also paying special attention to the situation in
Zambezia and Maputo provinces, where there has been a growing number of
cases of acute diarrhea, raising fears of a cholera outbreak at any time.
The chief doctor for Maputo city, Nidia Remane, urged local communities to
get involved in awareness campaigns and civic education to prevent the disease.
"We have our attention on the situation, and we have reopened the Cholera
Treatment Center in Mavalane General Hospital where we are sending all
cases of acute diarrheas. But we still think that cooperation from the
communities will be very necessary, because it is there where basic care
should be enforced", said Remane.

Cholera Cases Increase in Nampula
----------------------------------
The number of cholera cases reported in the northern Mozambican province of
Nampula has now reached 65, since the first case was diagnosed about 2
weeks ago, reports Wed 5 Feb 2003 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".
The outbreak is blamed on deteriorating sanitation conditions, particularly
in the port of Nacala and in the districts of Memba and Nacala-a-Velha, all
as a result of heavy rainfall.
The provincial health authorities have responded by increasing the stocks
of chlorine for treating contaminated water sources, and of serum to
rehydrate cholera victims.
The scale of the problem was hidden for a time by a wrong diagnosis in
Nacala port, where victims were treated as if they were simply suffering
from diarrhea. The head of the Nampula provincial community health
department, Antonio Salimo, blamed the mistake on the Nacala hospital
director, Cassamo Valgi.
"This is a problem of the hospital director because we sent the results of
tests on samples collected in that region, which confirmed that these are,
indeed, cases of cholera", Salimo said. But, for his part, Valgi complained
last week that he had not yet received the requested results from the
Provincial Health Directorate, and so he was thus treating all cases as
simple diarrheas.
10 deaths out of 580 diagnosed cases of cholera have been reported from the
central province of Sofala, since the outbreak began there in mid-December
2002. All the deaths occurred in Maringue district.
The head of the Sofala Community Health Department, Virginia Saldanha,
specified that of the 580 cases, 147 were in Beira, 189 were in the
district of Caia, and the remaining 246 were reported from Maringue.
However, deputy national health director Avertino Barreto described the
situation in Sofala as under control, saying that all the necessary
measures have been taken to deal with it, including provision with
medicines. Cabo Delgado province in the far north has reported 300 cases of
cholera with 5 deaths. One of the deaths was reported in Pemba, the
provincial capital, whereas the other 4 were in the district of Montepuez.
In central Zambezia province 3 000 cases of acute diarrhoeas were attended
to in various health units, but no deaths were reported.

Cholera scare hit the residents of a hostel at the IIT [Indian Insitute of
Technology - Mod.LL], Chennai, when students fell ill due to suspected
contamination of drinking water.
On Sat 1 Feb 2003, more than 15 students who had been complaining of
dysentery and nausea since the previous evening were referred to the
hospital on the campus. Of them, 3, who developed complications, were
rushed to the Corporation-run Institute for Communicable Diseases, Tondiarpet.
According to ICD sources, the medical laboratory test report of one of the
IIT students confirmed cholera, while the reports of the other 2 patients
are awaited.
A few residents said the problem started on Fri, 31 Jan 2003 after they
consumed regular supply water as the water treatment plant at the institute
was under repair. A professor said apparently the private caterers in
charge of the hostel mess had ignored the cautionary note on serving boiled
water whenever the treatment plant stopped functioning.
More than 300 irate students refused to take lunch at the mess. However,
the Dean (students) Gokhale intervened and pacified them. The catering
staff have reportedly been told to wash all utensils with hot water for the
next few days and students are now being supplied purified bottled water.
The arrangement would continue till the leakage in the treatment plant is
rectified. The Dean said all students are out of danger now and that a
local monitoring committee would be set up with student representatives.
