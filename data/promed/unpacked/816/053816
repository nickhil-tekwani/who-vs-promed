A SARS-like virus has been found in a broad range of animals, stretching from
snakes and birds to mammals, a medical group said Thursday after returning
from the epicenter of the virus in south China.
The 14 United Nations and Chinese experts visited farms and markets in
Guangdong province in search of a possible animal carrier of the virus, and
were astounded to see how many different species were infected. "What is
surprising is we got positive results from mammals, from birds and from
reptiles," said Francois Moutou, a French expert on epidemic disease. "This
is very strange, because usually we don't find viruses ... affecting so many
[different] animals," he told a briefing in Beijing.
After a week-long trip to Guangdong, where the atypical pneumonia erupted
late in 2002, the search for an animal carrier remains a "work in progress,"
according to health officials.
One of the main findings by the expert group was the realization that finding
the origin and nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) may be a
much more complex task than initially hoped.
"There may be many animals that are capable of being infected, but they
might not be capable of transmitting the virus to people," Hume E. Field,
an expert from Australia's Animal Research Institute, told the briefing. The
researchers warned that detecting the source of the disease might take years,
which means measures to curb further transmission must be undertaken before
it is fully understood. "Obviously we can't wait until we've got the whole
jigsaw together before action is taken," said Field. "So really we have to
look at the best information we've got at the time in terms of risk and
respond according to that."
Curbing further threats from SARS could result in restrictions on consumption
of certain types of wildlife known to be infected, despite inconclusive data
on whether the species is capable of transmitting the sometimes-fatal illness
to humans, he said.
After SARS emerged in Guangdong province in 2002, it quickly spread to become
a global menace, leaving more than 800 dead from 8000 infections in 32
countries. Some 349 of the fatalities and 5327 of the infections were
recorded in China. Although China has formally declared victory over SARS
and the last patients have been discharged from hospital, many in the world's
most populous country remain wary that the epidemic could bounce back. And
even if the world has not seen the reemergence of SARS by New Year 2004, it
does not mean the danger is entirely over, experts warned. "We need to
recognize that if it doesn't return this year, that doesn't mean it will
never return," Field told the briefing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday it would train thousands
of medical workers in China, as fears linger that SARS could strike again
this year once cold weather sets in. The training program is meant to
better equip health workers to prevent infectious diseases from spreading
in hospitals, said Alan Schnur, a WHO communicable diseases expert. The
training program will begin in Beijing, where 193 people died from the
epidemic earlier in 2003, and will gradually be expanded to other parts of
China.
At the height of the SARS outbreak, many people in China were scared of
going to hospitals because of fears -- in some cases well-founded -- that
sub-standard facilities made them breeding-grounds for the virus.
The WHO could not conclusively rule out a SARS reappearance in late autumn
as temperatures start plunging, and stressed steps should be taken to
prevent any potential outbreak. "Whether or not SARS returns, China must have
a strong surveillance network already in place," said Henk Bekedam, the WHO's
China representative.

WHO Representative Office in China 21 Aug 2003
Joint mission on SARS animal reservoir and necessary next steps
--------------------------------------
A joint team of specialists from the Chinese government, the World Health
Organization, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), in China to investigate the animal reservoir of the SARS
coronavirus, has issued a series of recommendations and actions necessary
not only to identify the disease's animal reservoir, but to contain any
future outbreaks.
"We did not set out this time to find the animal reservoir for SARS, but to
methodically piece together the jigsaw puzzle of this disease," says WHO's
Dr Pierre Formenty, a zoonotic disease specialist and joint leader of the
mission. "The fight against SARS is not over. Finding its origin will most
likely take years," says Dr Formenty, "Right now, the need for information
is of such urgency that even limited information will be helpful in taking
the right control measures. Because SARS is a global threat, international
collaboration is essential if we are to detect and rapidly contain any new
outbreaks."
Among the measures recommended by the joint team of specialists include the
strengthening of regulations in the farming, trading, and consumption of
wildlife. More serological monitoring of the SARS coronavirus are needed
both in animals and humans, as well as continued in-depth human studies of
SARS index cases. Determining how SARS first breached the species barrier
is crucial to controlling it.
While it is still unknown whether SARS will return, WHO is continuing to
work closely with the Chinese government to design and implement a strategy
using hospitals as early detection centers of SARS. WHO is also
collaborating with the Chinese Ministry of Health to strengthen infection
control in health care settings. A series of training seminars on SARS
infection control procedures for health care workers is scheduled for
September 2003 in Beijing and Changsha.
Following a meeting today with senior officials from the Ministry of
Science and Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, and
the Ministry of Forestry, in which the Chinese government recognized the
need for increased research co-ordination, WHO is optimistic about future
prospects for collaboration.
"Whether or not SARS returns, China must have a strong surveillance network
already in place," says Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO's China Representative. "China
has a unique opportunity to contribute to the international understanding
of this disease. Investing now in this safety net may be the key to
successfully combating SARS."
