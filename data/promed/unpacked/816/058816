Parreira R, Centeno-Lima S, Lopes A, Portugal-Calisto D, Constantino A, Nina J. Dengue virus serotype 4 and chikungunya virus coinfection in a traveller returning from Luanda, Angola, January 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(10):pii=20730
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
A concurrent dengue virus [DENV] serotype 4 and chikungunya virus [CHIKV] infection was detected in a woman in her early 50s returning to Portugal from Luanda, Angola, in January 2014. The clinical, laboratory and molecular findings, involving phylogenetic analyses of partial viral genomic sequences amplified by RT-PCR, are described. Although the circulation of both dengue and chikungunya viruses in Angola has been previously reported, to our knowledge this is the 1st time coinfection with both viruses has been detected there.

Background [summarized]:
Although CHIKV/DENV coinfections were 1st reported in India in 1967 [13] and later confirmed in Sri Lanka (2008), Malaysia (2010) and Gabon (2007) [14-16], these coinfections are rarely notified.

Discussion:
Serological reports from the 1960s, the detection of DENV in travellers returning from Angola in the 1980s, and the detection of DENV1 and DENV2 in travellers in the 1980s and in 1999-2002 suggest endemic DENV activity in Angola. As far as CHIKV is concerned, the situation is a lot less clear. However, serological studies from the 1960s not only identified the presence of anti-CHIKV neutralising antibodies in the north of the country, but also allowed the isolation of 2 strains from a viraemic individual and wild-caught mosquitoes during an outbreak of Katolu Tolu (Kimbundu dialect for 'break-bone disease'), a dengue-like disease caused by the CHIKV, which occurred in Luanda in 1970.

The detection of DENV4 in the recent traveller is of interest, given that on 1 Apr 2013, the Angolan health authorities reported a dengue outbreak in the country, which was later shown to have been caused by DENV1, and the current description of DENV4 in Luanda may indicate the circulation of multiple DENV subtypes in the country.

[The occurrence of dual DENV and CHIKV infections in an individual is clearly a rare event. With the infected woman's return to Portugal in January, a time of no vector activity, there was little chance of her being a virus source for ongoing transmission. Had either or both infections occurred during the warm season, the consequences might have been different had the infected individual landed in a locality where _Aedes_ mosquitoes were abundant and active, as happened with the introduction of dengue virus into Madeira Island in 2013 (see ProMED-mail archives cited below).
