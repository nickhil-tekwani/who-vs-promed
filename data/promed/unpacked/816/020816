From: Alexandre Moura <amoura@joinnet.com.br>

I'd like to update the numbers about the Dengue Fever epidemic in Belo
Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais State.
The epidemic has got out of control and now there are 37,871 cases: 25,833
confirmed and 12,038 suspected cases. Most cases are from Dengue 1 virus.
There are also some suspected cases of DHF and one suspected death.
By the way, we're dealing with a doubt about the criteria for DHF
diagnosis. Do we really have to fulfill all the WHO criteria? The patient
has to have (1) platelet [count less than 100,000, (2) fever, (3) bleeding
AND (4) signs of liquid sequestration like elevation of Ht [hematocrit?
[Your next paragraph answers that question; the patient did not have
criterion (4) and turned out to not have dengue - Mod.JW
We had a patient with the first three but who has not the elevation of Ht
or any sign of liquid sequestration. He had platelets of 5,000/mm3 and oral
bleeding besides petechiae. It cause a great rush from the local press to
register the first case of DHF but after a few days, his IgG came negative.
His virus was not typed. He recovered well.
We're also dealing with some patients being managed like febrile
neutropenics. Some have neutrophils of 400/mm3.
