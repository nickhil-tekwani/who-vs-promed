Possible Source of the Human Avian Influenza Infections in Jakarta
------------------------------------------------------------------
[In the comment in ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (115):
Indonesia 20050810.2332," the Moderator stated that "Pet birds maintained in
an adjacent house and more than 300 human contacts have all tested negative
for avian influenza virus", whereas in fact a potential bird link was
identified in this incident. The original WHO and Indonesia Ministry of
Agriculture report (reproduced in Avian influenza, human - East Asia (107):
Indonesia 20050729.2204) stated that: "Laboratory results detected H5-infected
bird faeces in a bird cage on the side of the road opposite the family's
house; cloacal and throat swabs of the pet bird inside the cage were negative
for H5." The following comment has been received from Dr. Dudley. - Mod.CP]
It seems quite possible to me that an infected bird -- or a bird that had
recently recovered from infection -- could have been removed from the cage
only hours or perhaps even minutes before inspectors arrived at the house.
Given human nature and the fear of official retribution common to ordinary
people in most countries of world, the bird could have been clandestinely
removed or released in response to news that government inspectors were in the
neighborhood checking birds for signs of possible illness. (That is my
personal opinion, based on 8 years of experience living and working in African
countries, coupled with subsequent short-term experience in various southeast
Asian countries including India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the
Philippines.)
How likely is it that a false positive (as opposed to a false negative) would
be obtained from bird feces -- even if old? Also, if this is in fact the
case, why wouldn't WHO have cited reservations regarding the diagnosis in
their update? No indication of the estimated age of the feces was given; it
seems possible that the infected bird could have been removed only hours or
even minutes before inspectors arrived at the house.

[My assumption was that, since the Indonesian authorities had decided not to
pursue their investigations into the source of the avian influenza infections
in Jakarta, they did not place much reliance on the veracity of the H5-
positive reaction obtained with faeces from the bird cage. Dr. Dudley has a
fair point; it does depend on the reliability of detecting avian influenza
virus antigen/genome in bird faeces. Perhaps another correspondent can
enlighten us? - Mod.CP]
