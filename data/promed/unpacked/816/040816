Human botulism, Denmark. Garlic in a chili-oil dressing produced in
Germany.
-----------
A healthy 38-year-old male was [taken ill with] botulism after
ingestion of approximately 4 buds of ready-to-eat garlic in a chili-oil
dressing. The product was manufactured by Konservenfabrik
Zachow in Germany for Dansk Supermarked, a major Danish
supermarket chain, and was sold in Denmark only.
The specific lot of 18 118 glass jars of 280 g each was produced on
19 Feb 2002 and labeled "Hvidlog i chiliolie, Bon Appetit" and "Best
before 19 Feb 2004". The product was sold as shelf staple at room
temperature, to be refrigerated after opening. The specific lot has
been withdrawn from the market.
Microscopy of the product revealed no typical clostridia. A pH of 4.7
was measured. Analysis of extract by mouse assay showed
_Clostridium botulinum_ type B toxin and culturing yielded growth of
_Cl. botulinum_. Later one unopened jar from the incriminated lot
and jars from 2 other lots tested negative for toxin.
German and Danish authorities are working to determine conditions
for safe production and marketing of the product. German
authorities have reported that upon production of the lot, 134 jars
were rejected due to bulges [presumably in the metal lids. -
Mod.JW]. The manufacturer did not take any action to determine
the exact cause of this. The lot was subject to heat treatment
reaching center temperatures of 83-85 degrees C for some minutes.
[Inadequate -- see comment at end].
Human botulism is rare in Denmark. The typical patient presents
with nausea, dryness of mouth, dilated pupils, and symmetric
pareses, initially involving the face, later progressing to the
respiratory muscles, in severe cases requiring mechanical
ventilation. There is no fever or sensory deficit.
This patient had a mild course of the disease, with an atypical
presentation of unilateral paresis and rapid recovery. The first
symptom was nausea and abdominal cramps. The next day he
developed double vision, photophobia, dryness of mouth, dysarthria,
and unilateral paresis of the 7th and 12th cranial nerves. He was
treated with antitoxin and showed clinical improvement already one
week later.
This case of botulism illustrates the need to be alert and not to rule
out botulism even in widely distributed convenience foods in
developed countries. It is, furthermore, a reminder to manufacturers
and authorities to be [careful], even today, that the conditions of
production safeguard against growth of _Clostridium botulinum_.

[Botulism results from intoxication, not infection. The toxin is
inactivated by heating to 100 degrees C for 10 minutes. Handling
uncooked food can result in absorption of toxin through broken skin.
