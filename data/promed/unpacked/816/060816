Australia has reported to the Office International des Epizooties an
outbreak of avian influenza, serotype 7, detected on 15 November.

Location No. of outbreaks
31o 1' S - 150o 50' E,
near Tamworth,
New South Wales
(ca 400 km north of Sydney) 1

Description of affected population: the disease has occurred on a farm
complex that produces fertilized eggs of meat-producing birds under
contract to a hatchery near Sydney.

Total number of birds in the outbreak:

susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
128,000 - 40,000 [see * below 0

Diagnosis: diagnosis has been based on typical clinical signs and
postmortem findings and confirmatory laboratory tests.
A. Diagnostic tests used:
Serological tests on paired sera.
Fluorescent antibody testing of impression smears of pancreas
Isolation of the virus in inoculated embryonated eggs.
B. Causal agent: preliminary typing has shown it to be a virus of H7 type.
Neuraminidase sub typing is being carried out. Pathogenicity studies in
experimental chickens are also under way. These tests should confirm
whether this is a highly virulent strain.
Epidemiology: clinical illness commenced on the farm as early as 15
November 1997, but was originally diagnosed by a private veterinary
consultant as bacterial peritonitis, which appeared to respond to
antibiotic medication. High mortality only commenced on 22-23 November,
and reached 95% in some sheds.
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the farm is located close to a
watercourse frequented by wild water birds, which could be the source of
infection through inadequate chlorination of the water supply.
B. Other epidemiological details: The hatchery is not believed to be
infected as eggs are formalin fumigated as a routine both before leaving
the Tamworth farm and before incubation at the Sydney hatchery, and no eggs
from the Tamworth farm have hatched during the epidemiologically critical
period. The nearest major poultry production farm is more than 3 km distant.
Control measures implemented by Government veterinary authorities in New
South Wales:

The farm was placed in quarantine on 25 November 1997. Declaration of a
restricted zone of approximately 3 km around the farm. Determination of the
size and scope of the restricted zone has been based on the isolated nature
of the affected poultry farm and the small number of other poultry
enterprises in the area. Epidemiological factors also support the inclusion
of the watercourse and adjacent agriculture enterprises within 3 km of the
affected farm. A surveillance zone has been imposed for 10 km
around the infected zone. A comprehensive surveillance programme has been
instituted.
* All birds on the infected farm will have been slaughtered by 2 December;
disinfection procedures have also commenced. As a precautionary measure,
hatching eggs from the Tamworth farm at the hatchery near Sydney have also
been destroyed.
The disease has been regionalised according to the principles established
by the OIE. Therefore, no restrictions have been placed on the movement of
poultry or poultry products within Australia, except from the 10-km
surveillance zone around the infected farm, i.e. the rest of Australia
should be recognised as an avian influenza free zone.
