Three recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses traced to bagged spinach or
lettuce from California have led some scientists and food safety advocates
to suggest that packaging greens might contribute to the spread of lethal
strains of _Escherichia coli_ bacteria.
In particular, the centralized processing of fresh greens can increase the
risk of more widespread contamination, just as tainted beef from one steer
can find its way into hundreds of packages of ground meat, said Dr David W
K Acheson, chief medical officer at the Food and Drug Administration's
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "If you have a single head of
[tainted] lettuce that winds up in someone's home, makes the family sick,
chances are it'll never get on the radar screen," Acheson said. "If you
take the same lettuce, process it; one head may contaminate multiple bags.
Then you've got an outbreak."
The way some greens are harvested also has raised concerns, said Michael
Doyle, director of the University of Georgia's Center for Food Safety, who
was recently hired by Taco Bell to review its safety guidelines. "I quit
eating bagged lettuce years ago," Doyle said. "After seeing how bagged
lettuce was harvested and prepared, my impression was that it's not very
sanitary." Doyle referred specifically to bagged iceberg lettuce, which has
been investigated in the simultaneous but separate Taco John's and Taco
Bell outbreaks of _E. coli_ O157:H7 that sickened more than 150 customers
in the Midwest and on the East Coast in November and December 2006.
Officials have linked those outbreaks to California farms in the Central
Valley and possibly on the coast south of Salinas.
The illnesses occurred only months after another leafy green, spinach, was
blamed in an outbreak that killed 3 people and sickened more than 200 in
late August and early September 2006. That outbreak was traced to bagged
spinach from the Greater Salinas Valley, which was sold in stores nationwide.
The upshot is that pre-washed and packaged produce, a USD 3-billion
industry created to improve both safety and convenience, is under a cloud.
Though the individual consumer's risk of illness remains small, experts
said, the only practical way to ensure that greens are free of _E. coli_ is
to thoroughly cook them, not a desirable option for lettuce.
Iceberg lettuce intended for packaging is vulnerable to contamination in
part because it is often cut and initially processed in the field, Doyle
said. The core is cut out of the head and discarded, as are the protective
outer leaves. "When you've chopped that product, you've created a lot more
avenues for bacteria to enter, especially if you're doing it in the
fields," said Bob Martin, general manager of Rio Farms in King City. Once
the bacterium "is locked into that cut edge of lettuce, then it's really
difficult for your chlorine bath to kill it."
Processing plants wash leafy greens 3 times in chlorinated water before
bagging them. They also employ other safety measures, including guidelines
for field-cored lettuce, said Jim Gorny, senior vice president for food
safety and technology at United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group.
He said the harvested heads are put on a conveyor belt, sprayed with
cooled, chlorinated water, placed in a bin with a plastic liner and shipped
to the processing plant. By discarding the core and outer leaves in the
field, Gorny said, "you're actually bringing in a microbiologically cleaner
product into your sterilized plant."
Spinach is harvested by machines like lawn mowers. Contamination in the
field is possible but less likely than with iceberg lettuce, Doyle said.
But both lettuce and spinach destined for packaging generally are trucked
to centralized processing plants, where tainted and untainted leaves can be
mixed during chopping, washing and bagging. By contrast, greens that are
not bagged are not chopped up and mingled.
Although washing in chlorinated water should kill _E. coli_ O157 bacteria,
it takes only a small amount to make someone sick, about 10 organisms, or 2
per cent of the space on the head of a pin.
The bagged greens industry has consolidated so much that a single
contamination problem can threaten the entire industry, said Timothy York,
chief executive officer of Markon Cooperative Inc, a Salinas-based produce
purchaser for food service distributors. According to the Produce Marketing
Assn, nearly 90 per cent of the retail market for packaged salads is
controlled by only 2 companies: Dole Fresh Vegetables and Fresh Express.
The wide reach of the processor that bagged the tainted spinach, sold under
more than 30 brand names, caused the FDA to temporarily issue a warning
against eating the fresh greens nationwide. That warning was later lifted
after probable contamination sources were identified. Similarly, iceberg
lettuce is mixed during processing and sent nationwide. "Bagged lettuce is
facing the same problem that meat grinders faced with _E. coli_ O157," said
Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in
the Public Interest in Washington, DC. She was referring to the outbreak in
the 1990s that involved tainted hamburger served at Jack-in-the-Box
restaurants. "They're this linchpin in the safety system because they're
taking produce in from a wide variety of sources and mixing it and
redistributing it," she said. "The bagged salads are increasing the
likelihood that outbreaks will be larger and widespread."
Not everyone agrees that packaged greens are a problem. Christine Bruhn,
director of the Center for Consumer Research at UC Davis, said she believes
that buying bagged, pre-washed greens is safer than buying head or loose
lettuce and washing it yourself. "Most of us don't do triple washing in
chlorinated water," she said, adding that research confirms that neither
home nor restaurant cooks diligently follow all sanitary practices.
Prepackaged produce was seen as a safety innovation when it was introduced
in fast-food restaurants in the 1980s, Gorny said. "It took production of
fresh fruit and vegetables out of chaotic kitchens in restaurants where you
have frequently changing employees," Gorny said. Restaurant chains worked
with food processors to develop stringent standards, including the triple wash.
As sales to fast-food restaurants mounted, processors tried selling
packaged products in retail stores. Growth took off in the 1990s. Fresh-cut
salad sales tripled from 1997 to 2005. The industry's very success could be
one of the reasons behind recent outbreaks. People are eating more fresh
produce, including the bagged variety, than ever before, and in doing so,
they are increasing their risk of exposure to bacteria.
Moreover, outbreaks are being detected earlier and traced more precisely.
Bagged greens may have been implicated in the last 3 outbreaks because,
with a brand name and a lot number, they are easier to trace than a single
head of lettuce.
