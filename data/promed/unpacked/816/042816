In the North Kazakhstan region, the Akzhar [Akzharskiy] district, where anthrax was found in cows, the region was divided into 4 zones, Kazinform correspondent reports. The document says that for the effective implementation of special veterinary measures to eliminate and prevent the further spread of anthrax, the territory of the region was divided into 4 zones:

Unfavorable (index/infected zone - MO): An area within a radius of 6 km 3.7 mi] from the borders of the epizootic focus. It includes the territory of the epizootic focus and one distant pasture belonging to the agricultural formation, where the death of livestock occurred.

The 2nd zone is a buffer zone. Within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] from the boundaries of the disadvantaged zone.

The observation (surveillance zone - MO) area is within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] from the boundaries of the buffer zone. It includes the village of Gorkovskoye and a distant pasture.

The safe area: Outside the boundaries of the surveillance area. Includes the villages of Voskhod, Uyaly, and Mayskoye.

"The focus of infection is located at a considerable distance from settlements and other epizootic units of animal husbandry. The isolation of the distant pasture [and] the low level of morbidity makes it possible to control the situation of the spread of the disease, provided that special veterinary measures are carried out on time and [to completion]. The low density of settlements in the rural district provides insignificant epizootic and inter-farm ties between them, which reduces the scale of widespread anthrax," the explanatory note says.

We will remind, on 27 Aug [2021] in the region, the infection of a resident of the village of Gorkovskoye with anthrax was reported. The infection occurred while cutting the carcass of a cow. The villager was hospitalized. More than 50 people are under the supervision of doctors. Experts are finding out the source of infection in cattle.

[his is an admirable response control and surveillance strategy protocol when dealing with livestock anthrax outbreaks, especially in poorly populated areas with minimal communication. It is also something to very much keep in mind when dealing with enzootic and sporadic livestock and wildlife anthrax. Vaccination is necessary in the "unfavorable" and "buffer" zones. Ranchers in the 3rd zone, "surveillance," must be made aware of the risk and encouraged to quickly report any untoward events.

This ecological approach reflects an earlier account [as reported by ProMED 16 Apr 2020 in Anthrax, rabies - Kazakhstan: spatial ecological review 20200416.7233488], citation and abstract below:

"Abstract
---------
Rabies and anthrax, being natural focal diseases, are characterized by the ability to persist in areas with a certain combination of environmental factors without human intervention. These infections annually cause sporadic outbreaks in domestic [animals], livestock, and wild animals in the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK), receiving close attention of the veterinary service. In particular, targeted mass vaccination and surveillance are conducted, which requires zoning of the country according to the exposure to the diseases.

"This 2020 paper presents a zoning approach based on the estimation of suitability to the study diseases using the Environmental Niche Modelling method. Retrospective data on animal rabies outbreaks in the RK for 2003-2014 as well as data on anthrax burial sites for 1933-2014 were used. The following environmental factors were treated as potential explanatory variables: 1) a set of climate data-derived variables BIOCLIM; 2) altitude above the sea level; 3) land cover type; 4) the maximum green vegetation fraction; and 5) soil type.

"The modeling outcomes for both diseases indicate elevated risks along the northern and southeastern borders of the RK that not only follows the distribution of historic disease cases, but also accounts for potentially suitable environmental conditions. To comply with the requirements of the veterinary service, gridded risk maps were converted into categorical maps by averaging risk values within municipal districts and ranking according to 4 categories: low, medium, high, and very high."

This is an outstanding 2020 paper defining the ecological distribution of rabies virus and _Bacillus anthracis_ in Kazakhstan, and it's an easy read. And I should point out that it reflects the hard work that Jason Blackburn, UFL, one of my grad students, has done off and on over some 15 years in that country training their people in niche modeling. When one has such reliable maps, it allows you to concentrate your control and surveillance activities in those areas, thereby significantly increasing the cost effectiveness of the program, and it achieves success -- eradication -- at an earlier date.

There are 3 relevant publications worth reading in regard to such mapping:
(1) Aikembayev AM, Lukhnova L, Temiraliyeva G, et al. Historical Distribution and Molecular Diversity of _Bacillus anthracis_, Kazakhstan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2010; 16(5): 789-96; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953997/.

Which gave rise to a valuable insight of the functions of the typing genes:

Akzhar (Kazakh: Aqjar aydany) is a district of North Kazakhstan Region in northern Kazakhstan, bordering Russia. The administrative center of the district is the selo of Talshik (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akzhar_District). It fulfills the Australian criteria for being beyond the "black stump."
