With the help of Earth-watching satellites, scientists can identify
high-risk "hot spots" for deadly diseases before outbreaks strike.
Last year more than a million people died of malaria, mostly in Sub-saharan
Africa. Outbreaks of Dengue Fever, hantavirus, West Nile Fever, Rift Valley
Fever, and even Plague still occasionally strike villages, towns, and whole
regions.
Yet these diseases are not without rhyme or reason. When an outbreak
occurs, often it is because environmental conditions such as rainfall,
temperatures, and vegetation set the stage for a population surge in
disease-carrying pests. Mosquitoes or mice or ticks thrive, and the
diseases they carry spread rapidly.
So why not watch these environmental factors and warn when conditions are
ripe for an outbreak? Scientists have been tantalized by this possibility
ever since the idea was first expressed by the Russian epidemiologist E. N.
Pavlovsky in the 1960s. Now technology and scientific know-how are catching
up with the idea, and a region-wide early warning system for disease
outbreaks appears to be within reach.
Ronald Welch of NASA's Global Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville,
Alabama, is one of the scientists working to develop such an early warning
system. "I have been to malarious areas in both Guatemala and India," he
says. "Usually I am struck by the poverty in these areas, at a level rarely
seen in the United States. The people are warm and friendly, and they are
appreciative, knowing that we are there to help. It feels very good to know
that you are contributing to the relief of sickness and preventing death,
especially the children."
The approach employed by Welch and others combines data from high-tech
environmental satellites with old-fashioned, "khaki shorts and dusty boots"
fieldwork. Scientists actually seek out and visit places with disease
outbreaks. Then they scrutinize satellite images to learn how
disease-friendly conditions look from space. The satellites can then watch
for those conditions over an entire region, country, or even continent as
they silently slide across the sky once a day, every day.
In India, for example, where Welch is doing research, health officials are
talking about setting up a satellite-based malaria early warning system for
the whole country. In coordination with mathematician Jia Li of the
University of Alabama at Huntsville and India's Malaria Research Center,
Welch is hoping to do a pilot study in Mewat, a predominantly rural area of
India south of New Delhi. The area is home to more than 700,000 people
living in 491 villages and 5 towns, yet is only about two-thirds the size
of Rhode Island.
"We expect to be able to give warnings of high disease risk for a given
village or area up to a month in advance," Welch says. "These 'red flags'
will let health officials focus their vaccination programs, mosquito
spraying, and other disease-fighting efforts in the areas that need them
most, perhaps preventing an outbreak before it happens."
Outbreaks are caused by a bewildering variety of factors.
For the mosquito species that carries malaria in Welch's study area, for
example, an outbreak hotspot would have pools of stagnant water where adult
mosquitoes can deposit their eggs to mature into new adults. These could be
lingering puddles on dense, clay-like soil after heavy rains, swamplands
located nearby, or even rain-filled buckets habitually left outside by
villagers. A malaria hotspot would be warmer than 18Â°C, because in colder
weather, the single-celled "plasmodium" parasite that actually causes
malaria operates too slowly to go through its infection cycle before the
host mosquito dies. But the weather mustn't be too hot, or the mosquitoes
would have to hide in the shade. The humidity must hover in the 55% to 75%
range that these mosquitoes require for survival. Preferably there would be
cattle or other livestock within the mosquitoes' 1 km flight range, because
these pests actually prefer to feed on the blood of animals.
If all of these conditions coincide, watch out!
Documenting some of these factors, such as soil type and local
bucket-leaving habits, requires initial groundwork by researchers in the
field, Welch notes. This information is plugged into a computerized mapping
system called a Geographical Information Systems database (GIS). Fieldwork
is also required to characterize how the local species of mosquito behaves.
Does it bite people indoors or outdoors or both? Other factors, like the
locations of cattle pastures and human dwellings, are inputted into the GIS
map based on ultra-high resolution satellite images from commercial
satellites like Ikonos and QuickBird, which can spot objects on the ground
as small as 80 cm across. Then region-wide variables like temperature,
rainfall, vegetation types, and soil moisture are derived from
medium-resolution satellite data, such as from Landsat 7 or the MODIS
sensor on NASA's Terra satellite. (MODIS stands for MODerate-resolution
Imaging Spectrometer.)
Scientists feed all of this information into a computer simulation that
runs on top of a digital map of the landscape. Sophisticated mathematical
algorithms chew on all these factors and spit out an estimate of outbreak risk.
The basic soundness of this approach for estimating disease risk has been
borne out by previous studies. A group from the University of Nevada and
the Desert Research Institute were able to "predict" historical rates of
deer-mouse infection by the Sin Nombre virus with up to 80% accuracy, based
only on vegetation type and density, elevation and slope of the land, and
hydrologic features, all derived from satellite data and GIS maps. A joint
NASA Ames / University of California at Davis study achieved a 90% success
rate in identifying which rice fields in central California would breed
large numbers of mosquitoes and which would breed fewer, based on Landsat
data. Another Ames project predicted 79% of the high-mosquito villages in
the Chiapas region of Mexico based on landscape features seen in satellite
images.
Perfect predictions will likely never be possible. Like weather, the
phenomenon of human disease is too complicated. But these encouraging
results suggest that reasonably accurate risk estimates can be achieved by
combining old-fashioned fieldwork with the newest in satellite technologies.
"All of the necessary pieces of the puzzle are there," Welch says, offering
the hope that soon disease outbreaks that seem to come "from out of
nowhere" will catch people off guard much less often.

[Prior ProMED-mail postings on disease surveillance have focused on early
recognition of new disease introductions as part of both bioterrorism
preparedness as well as monitoring for new emerging infectious
diseases. The above project is an interesting approach to predicting known
diseases such as vector borne diseases using GIS technology and known "risk
factors". We look forward to hearing information from the practical
application of this technology. - Mod.MPP]
