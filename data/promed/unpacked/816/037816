Re: the moderator's remark "Further information on the current dynamics of
this important zoonotic disease in central America will be welcome" in
posting 20030226.0483: No doubt, but I would like to know which VEE virus
this is, i.e., VEE I-AB, VEE I-C, VEE I-D, or other. The epidemiology of
these viruses is fascinating. Please ask those involved whether they have a
virus isolate for sequence and biological analyses.

[Dr. Calisher's request for information (RFI) is important. VEE viruses are
divided into 6 antigenic subtypes (I-VI). Within subtype I, there are 5
antigenic variants (variants AB-F). Antigenic variants I-AB and I-C are
associated with epizootic activity in equids. The other 3 variants of
subtype I (I-D, I-E, I-F) and the other 5 subtypes of VEE have been
associated with natural enzootic cycles. - Mod.AS]
