EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS - USA (MASSACHUSETTS)

A ProMED-mail post

From: George Robertson <grobertson@mail.ncifcrf.gov>
The first [human] illness due to eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus this
year in Massachusetts was reported by state health officials over the
weekend. According to the Associated Press, a 69-year-old man from
Plainville, Massachusetts is critically ill after infection with the virus.
The case was reported approximately three weeks after the virus was detected
in eastern and southeastern Massachusetts, prompting a warning at that time
from the Massachusetts of Public Health that persons living in those areas
should take protective precautions.

[Although EEE is not responsible for massive and widespread epidemics, the
high mortality rate associated with this disease and its annual occurrence
along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. make this a serious illness.
Apparently, a "Distant Early Warning" system had been put in place but the
message might not have gotten to everyone; pity. On the brighter side,
consider all the people who have not contracted this illness because they are
taking adequate precautions. -- Mod CHC]
