First Report of Sudden Death Syndrome (_Fusarium solani_ f. sp. glycines)
of Soybean in Minnesota.

In August 2002, soybean (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.) plants exhibiting foliar
and root symptoms typical of sudden death syndrome [SDS] were observed in
Blue Earth and Steele counties in south-central Minnesota.
Leaf symptoms ranging from small chlorotic spots to prominent interveinal
necrosis were present on soybean plants at the R6 to R7 growth stage. As
plants matured, complete defoliation took place, with only petioles
remaining. Symptomatic plants had necrotic secondary roots, truncated
taproots, and discolored cortical tissue at the soil line.
Blue sporodochia containing macroconidia were observed on taproots of
affected plants at both locations (3,4). Multiple cultures from both
locations were obtained by transferring macroconidia from the sporodochia
to PDA and modified Nash-Snyder Medium (NSM) (3). After 14 days, isolations
were made from fungal colonies exhibiting bluish pigmentation and masses of
bluish macroconidia (4).
The isolates grew slowly, developed a bluish color, and formed sporodochia
containing abundant macroconidia on NSM. These isolates were identified as
_Fusarium solani_ (Mart.) Sacc. f. sp. _glycines_ [Fsg] based on colony
characteristics and morphology of macroconidia (2).
Pathogenicity tests were conducted with a single isolate from each
location. Mycelia of the Blue Earth County isolate was inoculated as
mycelia in a plug of media onto taproots of plants of susceptible cvs.
Williams 82 and Spencer at the V2 growth stage. Chlorotic spots appeared on
leaves after 12 days of growth at 22 to 25 deg C in a greenhouse.
Interveinal necrosis appeared after 15 days (4).
Mycelia of the Steele County isolate was used to inoculate the susceptible
cv. Great Lakes 3202. Sorghum seeds (3 cubic cm) infested with Steele
County mycelia were placed 2 to 3 cm below soybean seed planted in
Cone-Tainers. Noninfested sorghum seed was used as a control. Plants were
maintained for 21 days at 22 to 28 deg C in a greenhouse.
Chlorotic spots appeared on leaves of inoculated plants within 21 days
after planting followed by development of interveinal chlorosis and
necrosis (1). Molecular analysis further supported the identification of
the Steele County isolate as Fsg.
PCR with specific primers Fsg1 and Fsg2 of total genomic DNA extracted from
the Steele County isolate amplified a 438-bp DNA fragment identical with
that extracted from previously identified isolates of Fsg (1).
In 2002, SDS symptoms were also reported in Olmsted, Freeborn, and Mower
counties. The occurrence of the symptoms at multiple sites suggests that
Fsg is widely distributed in southeast and south-central Minnesota.
SDS-affected counties are located in the most productive soybean-growing
region of Minnesota.
SDS could be a serious threat to soybean production in this area since
poorly drained, heavy, clay soils are common, and soil temperatures of 8
deg C or less are normal before the end of May.

[SDS is especially severe if infection occurs prior to flowering, usually
accompanied by abortion of seed pods and reduced seed number and size. Fsg
produces thick-walled chlamydospores, which can survive for several years
in infested soil. It appears that a high population of the soybean cyst
nematode (_Heterodera glycines_) in soil is associated with exacerbated SDS
symptoms. Disease management involves the use of resistant soybean
cultivars, delayed planting, practices that reduce cyst nematode
populations, and long crop rotations (at least 3 years) in which no
soybeans are planted in fields previously planted to soybean. Additional
