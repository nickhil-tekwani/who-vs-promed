A hospital in Daito, Osaka has become the scene of a norovirus outbreak that so far has claimed the lives of 2 patients. Since the outbreak began on Tue 27 Nov 2012, 48 patients and medical staff have contracted norovirus [infection] at the hospital. An 88-year-old woman and a 76-year-old man are believed to have died of organ failure after being infected, NTV reported Wednesday [5 Dec 2012].

Doctors say the gastroenteritis symptoms caused by norovirus [infection] include repeated vomiting and diarrhea. Although symptoms usually abate within a day or 2, norovirus infection] can also cause dehydration in young children and the elderly, affecting chronic diseases.

Norovirus infections are transmitted person to person, by contaminated food and water, and by contaminated surfaces. Local authorities say they are trying to identify the source of the outbreak.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases is warning of a norovirus epidemic, as 2012 shows one of the highest infection rates on record. According to data collected from around 3000 medical institutions, the average number of suspected norovirus patients per hospital stood at 11.39 in the week of 12-18 Nov 2012. This figure represents the highest number since 2006, when 16.42 people per hospital were infected.

[Norovirus infection is the most common cause of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Healthcare facilities, including nursing homes and hospitals, are the most commonly reported settings for norovirus outbreaks. Nearly 2/3rds of all norovirus outbreaks reported in industrialised countries occur in long-term care facilities. The virus can be introduced into healthcare facilities by infected patients -- who may or may not be showing symptoms -- or by staff, visitors, or contaminated foods. Outbreaks in these settings can be quite prolonged, and illness can be more severe, occasionally even fatal, in hospitalized or nursing home patients compared with otherwise healthy people. It is probable that the deaths of the 2 elderly patients in the hospital in Daito was a consequence of underlying health problems rather than as a direct result of norovirus infection.
