[The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), updated [Thu 23 Nov 2017], noted between [Thu 16 and Thu 23 Nov 2017], Spain reported 3 equine West Nile fever cases through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. Since the beginning of the 2017 transmission season and as of [Thu 23 Nov 2017], the EU Member States reported 128 West Nile fever cases through ADNS: 100 in Italy, 13 in Greece, 9 in Spain, 3 in Hungary, 2 in Austria and one in Portugal. https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/human-and-equine-west-nile-fever-cases

According to the ECDC - Communicable disease threats report (week 47, 19-25 Nov 2017): "During the 2017 West Nile fever transmission season, 203 human West Nile fever cases were reported in the EU/EEA: Romania (66 cases), Italy (57), Greece (48), Hungary (21), Croatia (5), Austria (4), France (1) and Bulgaria (1). Eighty-four cases were reported in neighbouring countries: Serbia (49), Israel (28) and Turkey (7). This season the case-fatality rate of West Nile fever was 9 percent with 26 reported deaths.

After 2 consecutive years with no West Nile fever cases reported in Greece, 48 cases were reported in the country in 2017, including cases in areas where West Nile fever transmission to humans was not observed before. This year [2017], Italy also reported cases in newly-affected areas, along the western coast (i.e. Livorno) and in the North-East of the country (i.e. Asti). France reported one case in the Alpes-Maritimes, [Note: where the current equine outbreak is located. - Mod.CRD] a region bordering Italy, which is an area that did not experience any human West Nile fever cases previously".
