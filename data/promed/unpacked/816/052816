Pig Disease Toll Increases to 39
-----------------------------------
On 6 Aug 2005, 2 new infections of _Streptococcus suis_ and one new
death were reported in Sichuan province, China. The number of human
infections has risen to 214 cases, and the death toll has hit 39.
According to the China News Agency, Sichuan's Health Department
announced the 2 new cases of _S. suis_ infection. Pi county
(district) in Chengdu city and Pengzhou city each had a case
diagnosed at a clinic. Shuangliu county in Chengdu city reportedly
had one new death, a case who was originally in critical condition.
The statement revealed a total of 214 cases, including 44 cases
diagnosed by a laboratory, 131 diagnosed at a clinic, and 39
suspected cases. Among the 214 infections, 39 have died, 58 were
cured and released from the hospitals, and 117 are in the hospitals,
with 12 still critically ill.
The 214 cases are spread across various townships, including Ziyang,
Neijiang, Chengdu, Zigong, Suining, Yibin, Luzhou, Deyang, Leshan,
Mianyang, and Nanchong. There have been 36 counties (districts), 132
towns (streets), and 202 villages (community offices) infected in
areas.
On 5 Aug 2005, the WHO urged China to examine the cases of _S. suis_
on a wider scale in order to eliminate other possible pathogenic
factors. A few scientists have raised doubts as to the cause of the
disease as diagnosed by Chinese officials.

2nd pig-borne disease case reported in Southern China
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities confirmed a 2nd case of a pig-borne illness in southern
China's Guangdong province on Mon 8 Aug 2005. 4 officials were
reportedly fired for mistakes in containing the spread of the
infection in another area, where it claimed 39 lives.
Chinese authorities have also arrested a couple in the Sichuan
province city of Chongqing, who were caught with 3740 pounds of pork
from sick pigs, the official Xinhua News Agency said on Mon 8 Aug
2005. It did not say whether the pigs were believed to have the same
illness.
The latest victim, a man who has slaughtered pigs from Guangdong
province's Yangjiang town, is hospitalized in serious condition, Hong
Kong health authorities said, after they were briefed by mainland
counterparts. The man's relatives and medical staff working on him
have not shown symptoms of infection with _S. suis_, the type of
bacterium blamed for the outbreak, said Hong Kong health department
spokeswoman Diana Kam.
Meanwhile, 4 officials were fired over the outbreak in southwestern
Sichuan province, where 208 people have been stricken by the illness
since June 2005, the China Daily newspaper reported. 39 have died and
15 remain in critical condition. The China Daily also said that the
chief of the Animal Husbandry and Food Bureau in Sichuan province's
Zizhong county allegedly claimed that the carcasses of 78 dead pigs
were properly disposed of when they had not been. The chief and 3
colleagues were fired, accused of failing to verify that the pigs had
been safely buried deeply enough, and of trying to deceive
investigators, the report said.

[To date, no clear explanation for this cluster, which is thought to
be human infection with _S. suis_, has been brought forward.
Increased bacterial inoculum (with or without increased toxin
production, but not necessarily a new toxin) facilitated by selling
dead, infected and previously buried swine may well be the major
factor. - Mod.LL]
