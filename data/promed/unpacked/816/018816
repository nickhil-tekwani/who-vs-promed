E.COLI O157:H7 IN SCHOOLCHILDREN - JAPAN: REQUEST FOR INFO
==========================================================
Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 15:27:28 -0800
From: David Dassey <ddassey@dhs.co.la.ca.us>

Does anyone know of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7
among schoolchildren in Japan? Our Environmental
Health Division just fielded questions from a local
Japanese newspaper reporter who said he was doing a
story on an outbreak. We in LA County Communicable
Disease Control and our counterparts at the California
State Health Services are unaware of such a problem in
Japan. If it has occurred, what is the probable source of
infection?
