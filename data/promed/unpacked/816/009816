A rise in the cases of Lumpy skin disease [LSD] is being witnessed despite the vaccination of cattle in Sindh, as it was reported on [Sun 10 Apr 2022].

According to the Livestock Department, the number of LSD cases in Sindh has reached 34 761, and 374 cattle heads have so far died of the disease.

In addition, as many as 14 600 cattle heads are currently infected with the virus.

[According to an earlier report, dated 25 Mar 2022, the LSD outbreak in Karachi "got aggravated due to misuse of live virus vaccines". Explaining how LSD spread in cattle in the city, livestock DG Dr. Nazeer Kalhoro said "dairy farmers, out of despair, made an indiscriminate use of live virus vaccines apparently without consulting a qualified veterinarian. These LSD vaccines were reportedly smuggled in from South Africa" (see 20220328.8702257). At that point in time, the number of LSD cases since the start of the event was reported as 28 857 cows. The current number, 34 761, indicates increased morbidity of about 25% within 2 weeks. It would be helpful to know if the added cases involved vaccinated animals or otherwise.

Subscribers are referred to the commentary in 20220328.8702257 addressing LSD vaccines' safety and efficacy.

A list of the 11 most commonly used vaccines registered for use in cattle against LSD, globally, is presented in Table 1 of a recent review paper available at https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/10/1136/htm (open access). Only live LSD vaccines are currently commercially available. - Mod.AS
