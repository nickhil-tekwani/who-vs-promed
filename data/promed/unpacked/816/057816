I think it should be noted here that hepatitis A is part of the Picornaviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped viruses. Most disinfectants used in daycares would not have label claim against poliovirus or norovirus (other small non-enveloped viruses). As the main mode of transmission of this organism is fecal-oral, and in day care we know how illnesses like norovirus can sweep through a facility, it might be prudent to ensure disinfectants used within these settings are effective against small, non-enveloped viruses within a realistic contact time. I have to remind myself that hepatitis A is not related to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, enveloped viruses which are much easier to kill with disinfectants.
