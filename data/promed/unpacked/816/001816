The Utah Department of Health and the CDC say they now have 16 confirmed cases of hepatitis C tied to an outbreak in Weber and Davis Counties [Utah]. The cases are all tied to a nurse, accused of stealing drugs from both Davis and McKay Dee Hospitals from 2011-2013. The 1st cases popped up a couple years ago and started this investigation that now has more than a dozen infected patients.

"We now know, half the people who may have been exposed by this nurse have not come in for free hepatitis C testing" With 16 confirmed cases, there is still concern that nearly half of the 7217 people who may have been exposed have not come in for free testing.

Hepatitis C is treatable, but can cause death if left undiagnosed and untreated.

"We do know in the USA, the most common way [to] transmit hepatitis C is through needles and the only way to transmit hepatitis C is blood to blood." Dr. Angela Dunn, a CDC epidemiologist says the cases were transferred through blood in a hospital setting but "unfortunately we do not know how it happened." The assumption is that the nurse, who was working as an emergency room nurse, was sharing needles for IV [intravenous] drugs with patients.

The now 16 known victims were exposed to a rare form of hepatitis C between 2011-2013 at Davis and McKay Dee hospitals, where the 49-year-old nurse worked. The nurse's record of troubles started at Davis Hospital where she was let go for stealing Benadryl in 2013. She started nursing at McKay Dee hospital not long after, where her alleged drug diversion escalated to narcotic IV drugs that disappeared on a weekly basis.

"Unfortunately I do not have a way of 100 percent knowing how the virus is transmitted and the directionality of the virus," Dunn said, adding that the 49-year-old nurse could have contracted hepatitis C from a patient and then passed it to others, or could have been the original carrier passing it on a total of 7217 possible patients.

Hepatitis C 2b is it a pretty rare genotype. It is only 8 to 10 percent of all hepatitis C in Utah, therefore making it easy to pinpoint connected cases. So far 3731 people have been tested, but just as many still have not. The investigation found 53 hepatitis C cases, but only 16 are linked to the nurse so far. One is from Davis hospital the rest from patients of McKay Dee hospital in Weber County.

"The good news" according to Dunn "is there is treatment for most cases of hepatitis C and the hospitals are working closely with the patients to get that done."

[ProMED awaits more definitive numbers related to patients thought to have been nosocomially infected.

Bloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C, and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).

Regarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication, http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X. [The comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:

An important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the "genotype" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only 1 principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).

Genotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.
