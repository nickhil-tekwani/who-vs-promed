Responses to Queries Regarding Treatment, Clinical Prognosis and Diagnosis
of CCHF Patient in Cape Town
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ProMED-mail post "Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (04)
20010215.0302", Dr. C. J. Peters wrote:
(1) "I wonder if the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient in the
Groote Schuur Hospital was treated with ribavirin?"
The answer is no. Does anyone know where one can get commercially available
intravenous ribavirin? The oral form is now available, thanks to its
success in treating Hepatitis C virus. However, the matter of access to
intravenous ribavirin remains a problem, and has been discussed in this
forum previously.
(2) "...and if his clinical laboratory parameters met the criteria
predicting a fatal case based on Swanepoel's retrospective paper a few
years ago?"
I have neither the patient's notes nor the Swanepoel et al. paper in front
of me, but here goes anyway (from memory)...
A) A lower white cell count (WCC) is related to survival. However, this
patient had an extremely low WCC of <1 with an absolute lymphopenia of 0.17
for a few days.
B) The transaminitis level (and bilirubin) is inversely related to
survival. This patient had moderately high levels around 250 u/l (upper
limit of normal = 40).
C) Non-survivors have a higher rate of impaired renal function. This
patient had initial raised creatinine and urea, which then normalized over
the first few days of admission.
D) Higher platelet count is related to survival. This patient was given
numerous daily platelet packs and still had counts of between 6 and 20
X10(9) for much of the illness in hospital. This rapidly reversed on
seroconversion and symptomatic improvement.
E) The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [DIC (and each
of the lab tests confirming this) is a poor prognostic indicator. This
patient had a marked DIC (lab confirmed) until seroconversion.
F) Hemoglobin (Hb) levels are inversely proportional to survival. This
patient had no massive bleeds, and so maintained his Hb reasonably well
with one drop below 10g/dl. However, even when the Hb dropped, it did not
seem to be associated with any big bleeds, and may have had more to do with
fluid shifts within the body, as it gradually returned to its baseline level.
All in all, while this patient had no marked bleeding episodes, this was in
the face of intensive management and replacement of blood and clotting
components. The laboratory picture was one of a man with a poor prognostic
picture (in terms of the Swanepoel criteria). However, "he turned the
corner" upon seroconversion and has improved steadily.
A note of support and admiration has to be added regarding the Groote
Schuur Hospital clinical (medical and nursing) staff who treated him. Some
of these individuals had "significant" exposure to this man prior to the
CCHF diagnosis being suspected, and this inevitably led to concern for
their own safety. However, these individuals all continued with their
excellent management and treatment of the man, with no energy spared
throughout.
In the same ProMED-mail post, Prof. Dr. Tino F. Schwarz wrote: "Is there
any explanation why the initial RT-PCR was negative?"
The National Institute of Virology (NIV) continues to give a remarkable
service to the region with excellent turn-around times, offering the
RT-PCR, IgM, IgG, cell culture and animal inoculation for all specimens. We
were fortunate that the IgM result was positive on the first set of samples
sent to the NIV, as we were then able to institute all of the necessary
"emergency plans." It is obviously a concern that the serum culture result
was positive in the presence of a negative RT-PCR. However, I am aware that
this matter is being actively addressed by the NIV staff currently.

Clinical Pathology, Therapy and Diagnosis of the CCHF Patient in Cape Town
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In reply to Dr Peters' inquiry [vide, 'Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South
Africa (04) 20010215.0302' about clinical pathology findings and ribavirin
therapy in the Cape Town patient with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF):
a) The clinical pathology values of which we were informed came close to
but did not exceed the predictive values for fatal outcome during the first
5 days of illness (for details of predictive values see Swanepoel et al.
1989 Reviews Inf Dis 11 (Suppl 4) S794-800);
b) the patient was not treated with ribavirin because his status was not
deemed to be critical. Dr. Peters was the last person to supply us with
intravenous ribavirin, so he should be aware that we find it to be
virtually unobtainable. Hence we have to be selective in making it
available for the treatment of patients, and the decision is based on
clinical assessment and the evaluation of clinical pathology findings.
In reply to Dr Schwarz: it appears that equipment failure, or rather a
temperamental thermocycler, was behind our PCR problem. On one of our
thermocyclers which had been in regular use control RNA was amplified, but
not the serum samples from the patient. In repeat tests on other machines
the specimens have proved to be positive. However, we never rely on a
single diagnostic procedure, and we found that the first serum sample had
IgM antibody activity (while the second sample showed serum IgG antibody
seroconversion and a rise in IgM antibody titre), so we were never in doubt
about the diagnosis. Moreover, the patient fitted our clinical criteria for
the presumptive diagnosis of CCHF.
I would hesitate to diagnose CCHF, or any other hemorrhagic fever, in a
country where it has never been recorded previously solely on the basis of
a PCR result, particularly if this were not supported by sequencing of the
amplicon. One should in addition use IgG and IgM antibody tests, plus an
antigen detection assay, and culture of the virus.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to our South African colleagues for these
comprehensive responses to questions posed by subscribers. Perhaps Dr.
Peters can clarify the current situation regarding the availability of
intravenous ribavirin? - Mod.CP
