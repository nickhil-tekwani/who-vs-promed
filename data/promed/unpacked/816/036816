Falsified copies of a drug to treat the parasitic disease leishmaniasis have been discovered in Iran and Pakistan, potentially putting patients at risk.

Both counterfeits claim to contain meglumine antimoniate, a drug that has been used since 1940s for the treatment of leishmaniasis and is on the WHO's list of essential medicines, and falsely claim to be manufactured by Swiss pharma company Tillotts Pharma AG.

Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by single celled parasites transmitted by sandflies, and most commonly causes skin ulcers (a form known as cutaneous leishmaniasis) although more serious forms can involve lesions in the mouth and other body cavities (mucocutaneous) and organs (visceral). If patients are treated with fake or substandard drugs that don't contain enough of the active ingredient the results can be life-threatening. In visceral leishmaniasis, drug treatment is essential or the disease is invariably fatal.

The WHO became aware of a counterfeit version of meglumine antimoniate being sold under the Gulucatime brand name in Iran in January [2019], and another falsified version sold as in Pakistan in March [2019]. Both have been confirmed as fraudulent by Tillotts.

In a statement, the WHO said that "the results of laboratory analysis facilitated by WHO indicate that the product Gulucatime was not manufactured in accordance to good manufacturing practices," while analysis of the Glucantime product is pending.

Circulation of the falsified products is confirmed in the WHO region of the eastern Mediterranean, says the agency. That batch numbers and other details of the fakes appear [at the source URL above].

Falsified meglumine antimoniate ampoules in Iran and Pakistan

This Medical Product Alert relates to 2 falsified products circulating in Iran and Pakistan, and which claim to contain meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of leishmaniosis. Both falsified products are presented in clear glass ampoules and falsely claim to be manufactured for Tillotts Pharma AG. Circulation of these falsified medical products is confirmed in the WHO Region of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Falsified product no.1: GULUCATIME In January 2019, WHO was informed that a product called GULUCATIME was available at patient level in Iran. This product claims to be manufactured for Tillotts Pharma AG; verification by WHO confirmed that the product is falsified. It is presented in carton packs each containing five ampoules. The packing is in English and French languages but displays spelling mistakes in both languages. Product details are listed in Table 1 below.

Falsified product no. 2: GLUCANTIME In March 2019, WHO was informed that a similar product called GLUCANTIME was available at patient level in Pakistan. This product also claims to be manufactured for Tillots Pharma AG and is confirmed falsified. Available photographs suggest the label is in English language only. Product details are listed in Table 1 below.

[Counterfeit medicine, that is, medicine that does not contain the drugs it is supposed to is a global problem, and the WHO has developed a fact sheet on counterfeit medicines (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products). It has been estimated that up to 25% of drugs sold over the counter in Asia and Africa may be substandard (Newton PN et al. Falsified medicines in Africa: all talk, no action. Lancet Glob Health. 2014; 2: e509-10). A recent review of counterfeit drugs (Kelesidis T, Falagas ME. Substandard/counterfeit antimicrobial drugs. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2015; 28(2): 443-64. doi: 10.1128/CMR.00072-14) states:
"According to the WHO, up to 10% of the drugs worldwide may be counterfeits; 50% of them involved antimicrobial drugs, and 78% were from developing countries. Moreover, 59% of cases with available information on the quality of drugs were fraudulent, and only 7% had the standard concentration of the active drug." - Mod.EP
