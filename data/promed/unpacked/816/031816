[Although the Kenyan Animal Health authorities are probably
overwhelmed with the outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, which began last
January [2007], there are several unfortunate indications that this
African swine fever outbreak may be seriously out of control. First
of all, all 5 of the outbreaks are continuing. Secondly, a glance at
the map provided with the report (link is provided above), indicates
a widely disparate geography to the 5 outbreaks. Finally, the OIE
(Animal World Health Organization) reference laboratory in Spain
confirmed the report in February (2007), yet the Kabete laboratory
results didn't come out until March (2007), and this report was not
sent to OIE until May (2007). Clearly, a timely response is lacking,
which doesn't bode well for the course of the outbreak. - Mod.PC]
