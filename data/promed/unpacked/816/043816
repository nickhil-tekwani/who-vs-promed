Taiwan alleged Friday that cattle on the offshore island of Quemoy [Kinmen
found to be infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were smuggled from
China.
Sung Hua-tsung, deputy head of plant and animal quarantine at the Cabinet's
Council of Agriculture, said the virus, confirmed Thursday, in 2 head of
cattle on a farm on Quemoy, which is located a few kilometers off the
Chinese mainland, is not identical to the type of FMD prevalent in Taiwan.

The island of Kinmen was declared a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)-infected
area after 2 cattle were diagnosed with the disease, the Republic of China
Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Thursday.
Kinmen, a fortress island 2.3 km from mainland China's Fujian Province, is
weighing the option of slaughtering all of its 3,000 head of cattle, COA
officials said.The 2 cases of FMD are the first in 5 decades on the island,
which has not imported any cattle from abroad since 1945.
Four veterinarians from the COA immediately set off for the frontline
island carrying 6,000 vials of vaccine, the officials said.
A ban on exports of the island's livestock produce was imposed as soon as
the FMD diagnosis was confirmed.
FMD ravaged Taiwan's swine population in 1997, crippling the island's
booming pig farming industry and totally wiping out its pork exports. The
disease flared up again among pigs on the offshore island of Penghu and in
southern Taiwan earlier this year, but no cattle were reported to have been
affected.

Taiwan on Friday reported a small outbreak of FMD among cows on outlying
Jinmen Island, which hugs the Chinese mainland, and pledged to destroy all
infected cows. The cabinet's Council of Agriculture said authorities
inspected cattle farms in Jinmen, also known as Quemoy or Kinmen, and found
2 animals infected with the deadly virus, which can be transmitted by air
to other livestock.
The council said it had ordered the destruction of any infected cows and
vaccination of all 3,000 cows and 2,000 sheep on Jinmen Island to avoid
further infections. The council said it would conduct thorough inspections
and take necessary measures to control the virus, adding they were
exploring whether the infection may have spread from mainland China.
Jinmen, Taiwan's main front-line defence outpost in its half-century-old
rivalry with communist China, lies a few thousand meters from China's
Xiamen port and has lively informal trade with the mainland despite an
official ban. On Thursday, Russia banned imports of meat and meat products
from China, citing the mainland's problems with FMD. China and Taiwan are
both regarded as FMD affected regions, a designation that can be lifted
only after up to 4 years without recurrence of the disease.
Taiwan's farm council has banned the transfer of any Jinmen livestock or
their meat and other by-products to Taiwan or other Taiwan-held islands.
Taiwan's feedlots were devastated in 1997 by an island wide outbreak of FMD
among hogs, which forced farmers to destroy a quarter of the island's 14
million hogs and devastated a lucrative export industry.
Japan and South Korea have banned imports of Taiwan pork, and the island's
pork exports value tumbled to US$240 million in 1997 from US$1.55 billion
in 1996, Taiwan statistics show.
Since 1997, Taiwan has reported isolated outbreaks of hog FMD on the Taiwan
strait island of Penghu and a major feedlot in southern Taiwan. Both were
quickly contained.
In July 1998, Japan approved a resumption of imports of cooked pork from
Taiwan, but export volumes remain far below pre-epidemic levels. Before
the hog epidemic, Japan imported 150,000 to 200,000 tons of pork worth
about US$1.5 billion a year for Taiwan, with processed pork accounting for
only about 10 percent.
