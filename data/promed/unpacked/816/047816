4 June 1999
Newcastle Disease on Mangrove Mountain in New South Wales
Further to my previous reports, I wish to provide the following additional
information.
Destruction of all the birds on the 32 broiler farms within the proclaimed
Infected Zone on Mangrove Mountain was completed by 12 May 1999. In
addition, all aviary and poultry birds from small non-commercial flocks
within the Infected Zone were destroyed by today. Over 1,900,000 birds have
been destroyed to date and decontamination is continuing on commercial and
non-commercial farms in the Infected Zone.
Since my update report 19 May, 2 more farms in the Infected Zone have been
identified as infected. These farms have since been depopulated. This
brings the total number of infected farms to 9 commercial farms. All the
infected farms are within the proclaimed Infected Zone.
Retrospectively, in the absence of overt clinical disease, virulent virus
was isolated from 2 additional commercial farms and 1 small non-commercial
flock. The small non-commercial flock was located within the Infected Zone
and was close to one of the infected premises. The 2 commercial farms where
virus was isolated retrospectively were both within the proclaimed
Surveillance Zone and close to the boundary of the proclaimed Infected Zone.
Epidemiological studies are continuing and a number of isolates detected
during surveillance will be investigated as part of the epidemiological
analysis of the outbreak.
There is no evidence of virulent Newcastle disease outside of the
Surveillance Zone, and virulent Newcastle disease has been regionalised
according to OIE principles. Therefore no restrictions have been placed on
the movement of poultry or poultry products within Australia, except from
the Infected and Surveillance Zones. The rest of Australia should be
recognised as a virulent Newcastle disease free zone.
Intensive surveillance is being maintained in both the Infected Zone and
the surrounding Surveillance Zone, and epidemiological investigations are
continuing. The poultry industry and poultry industry veterinarians have
been alerted to the outbreak and are applying increased vigilance to
surveillance on poultry farms in other parts of Australia.
As an added precaution restocking in the Infected Zone and Surveillance
Zone will be deferred until all broiler farms within the Surveillance Zone
have been destocked and approved disinfection has been completed.

Attachments:
Country/Location: Australia, Mangrove Mountain, in the State of New South
Wales.
Date of Notification: 2 April, 6 April, 7 April, 13 April, 17 April, 23
April, 6 May 1999, 17 May 1999 (at the 67th General Session), 3 June 1999
Name of Disease: Newcastle Disease
Nature of Diagnosis: Serological test; clinical diagnosis and isolation of
a Newcastle Disease Virus; immunohistology; gene sequence studies showing a
virulent cleavage sequence in the fusion (F) protein; death of chick
embryos at 48-72 hours in primary isolation; chorio-allantoic membrane
(CAM) antigen localisation test was positive; determination of
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.6.
Date of initial detection: 25 March 1999
Estimated Date of first infection: 18 March 1999 (provisional)
Number of separate outbreaks: 9 confirmed commercial farms within the
proclaimed Infected Zone.
Geographical identification: 33* 37' south, 151* 18' east, at Mangrove
Mountain near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak: As a precautionary measure all domestic
birds on a total of 32 farms and a number of small, non-commercial poultry
and aviary flocks in the proclaimed infected zone have been destroyed.
Additional comments regarding commercial farms: In the absence of clinical
disease, virus was isolated retrospectively from 2 commercial farms within
the Surveillance Zone, and close to the boundary of the proclaimed Infected
Zone. All birds from these farms had been destocked by processing. As with
all farms in the Surveillance Zone, the product from these farms was
subject to approved heat treatment. Tracing of product from these farms
confirmed that it had been processed according to approved protocols at
quality-assured outlets.
Comments on the epidemiology: All clinically infected farms are within an
intensive poultry production area on Mangrove Mountain.
Mangrove Mountain is a well-defined wedge-shaped area, about 18km long by
10km wide, bounded on the east, south and west by deep ravines, and on the
north by National Park/State Forest. There is no evidence of infection
elsewhere in Australia.
Avirulent to low virulence strains of Newcastle disease virus have been
present in Australia since the late 1960's. These strains have caused
little to no production problems and no vaccines have been used to control
these naturally circulating strains of the virus. Extensive molecular
characterisation of these endemic strains has been undertaken over these
years, concentrating on the genes encoding the F and HN proteins.
Nucleotide sequencing of the F gene, and particularly the HN gene, clearly
demonstrated that the outbreak virus strains were closely related to a
known Australian strain of low virulence for chickens. This suggested that
the outbreak viruses were derived from this Australian strain of NDV,
rather than from an imported strain of the virus.
Control measures taken to date: Destruction of all the birds on the 32
broiler farms within the proclaimed Infected Zone on Mangrove Mountain was
completed by 12 May 1999. In addition more than 2000 aviary and poultry
birds on small non-commercial flocks within the Infected Zone were
destroyed by 28 May 1999. Over 1,900,000 birds have been destroyed to date
and decontamination is continuing on commercial and non-commercial farms in
the Infected Zone.
A comprehensive surveillance program has been instituted within the
Infected Zone and surrounding Surveillance Zone and further control
measures applied to the movement of live birds and product from the
Mangrove Mountain area.
As an added precaution restocking in the Infected Zone and Surveillance
Zone will be deferred until all broiler farms within the Surveillance Zone
have been destocked and approved disinfection has been completed.
