Dengue Fever Cases Rise in Puerto Rico
--------------------------------------
A high number of cases of mosquito-borne dengue fever has led Puerto Rican
health officials to declare an alert, the Secretary of Health Johnny Rullan
said on Thu 8 Nov 2001.
He said there had been 1038 cases of the disease in October, the first time
in 3 years in the U.S. territory that the number of dengue cases in one
month passed the 1000 mark.
No one has died from the disease.
