Update: Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis - United States, 1998-1999
-------------------------------------------
>From early August 1998 through January 6, 1999, at least 50 illnesses
caused by a rare strain of the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_,
serotype
4b, have been reported to CDC by 11 states. Six adults have died and two
pregnant women have had spontaneous abortions. Reported illness onset
dates
were during August 2-December 13, 1998. CDC and state and local health
departments have identified the vehicle for transmission as hot dogs and
possibly deli meats produced under many brand names by one manufacturer.
This report updates the investigation of this outbreak...
[MMWR Editorial Note: Healthy persons rarely develop severe illness
from
_Listeria_. The illness primarily occurs in pregnant women, newborns,
and
persons with impaired immunity caused by serious illness, such as
acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome or cancer. _Listeria_ infections during
pregnancy
may cause an influenza-like illness with fever and chills, and may lead
to
loss of the fetus. In other persons, early symptoms can include fever,
severe headache, and stiff neck. Illness can begin 2-8 weeks after
eating
the contaminated food.
Consumers who have the affected product should not eat it, but rather
should discard it or return it to the point of purchase. The risk for
developing _Listeria_ infection after eating a contaminated product is
low.
Persons who have eaten a contaminated product and do not have any
symptoms
do not need any special medical evaluation or treatment, even if they
are
in high-risk groups. However, persons in high-risk groups who have eaten
the contaminated product, and within 2 months become ill with fever or
influenza-like illness, should inform their physicians about this
exposure.
Because of this long incubation period, cases may continue to occur and
be
reported for several weeks after an effective recall.
Consumers who have questions about the recall or the products involved
should contact Bil Mar Foods, telephone (800) 247-8339. Persons who have
questions about Listeria should call their physicians or their local or
state health departments or visit CDC's World-Wide Web site,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/foodborn/lister.htm>. General
questions
about meat handling should be directed to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline, telephone (800) 535-4555, Monday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. eastern time.
