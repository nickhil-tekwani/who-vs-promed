I have been having some thoughts about this posting. Specifically what
diseases might one be worried about contracting from the consumption of
mouse meat?
I would have thought that provided the meat were properly inspected and
well cooked, it should cause few problems. After all, there are
communities in various parts of the world where small rodents (often wild)
are an important part of the diet. Of course, (unless the patties are
actually advertised as mouse and newspaper burgers) one would be worried
that anyone unscrupulous enough to carry out the deception of passing off
newspaper and mouse as hamburger would be misbehaving in other more
dangerous ways but that's another issue altogether. My own worries about
this item concern the mouse handlers and also possible toxic effects of
some newspaper inks.
Nevertheless, I would view this as an interesting development. Even old
favourites like beef may cause problems for human consumers, not least
because of not-so-clever innovations in animal husbandry. However, the
introduction of non-traditional protein sources into the diet in areas
where traditional sources have become scarce or expensive might not
necessarily be such a bad thing. The main problem I see here is that of
supply. The average mouse weighs but a few grams. Even with considerable
newspaper augmentation of patties, it's going to take an awful lot of mice
to keep mouseburger factories in business. But let's look on the bright
side of things: Lots of street kids are going to find employment as mouse
catchers and Georgia [Middle South Asia, not the home of CDC - Mod. pc is
going to end up with much less of a rodent pest problem than it might
otherwise have!

[Thanks very much for the thoughtful, if somewhat sardonic, analysis. For
delicious recipes from around the world and a complete rationale for
consumption of unusual sources of protein see Cal Schwabe's book
"Unmentionable Cuisine". After all, what is one person's "disgusting,
yech, nauseating etc." is another person's meat. If the protein is in
short supply, I say bon appetit. Seriously, though, the more we know
about foodborne disease from non traditional sources of protein, the better
off we will be in the future. Given population growth and the importance of
and penchant for animal protein, it is not too early to begin. - Mod. pc
