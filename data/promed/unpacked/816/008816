Bird flu has become endemic in Hong Kong after its recent discovery
in both local wild birds and chickens, the territory's health
secretary said Friday.
"Since different kinds of wild birds and chickens have this virus, we
can be quite sure that this virus is endemic in our birds," York Chow
said at a press briefing. Chow used a Chinese term to describe bird
flu as having become part of the general environment in Hong Kong.
"It's not just Hong Kong. This virus will exist in neighbouring
areas, southern China as well as Hong Kong," he added.
Chow's comments came after the government announced Wednesday [1 Feb
2006] that both a local chicken brought in from China and a dead
crested myna tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus. In the past
year, Hong Kong officials also found avian flu in the oriental magpie
robin and heron species.
Previously, bird flu killed 6 people here in 1997, prompting the
government to slaughter the entire poultry population of about 1.5
million birds.
But since then, there have been no major outbreaks. Hong Kong has
been largely spared the recent outbreaks that have killed or forced
the slaughter of millions of birds across Asia since late 2003.

Bulgaria has discovered its 1st case of H5 bird flu in a dead swan on
its border with Romania, authorities said on Friday, and samples will
be sent to Britain to test whether it is a strain that can kill people.
Sandwiched between Romania and Turkey, which have both been hit by
outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, Bulgaria has been
seen as a possible destination for the virus.
"Our teams found a wild swan in the Danube River near the town of
Vidin. The tests on the swan showed it was infected with the H5
virus," Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil told a news conference.
He said he had put his veterinary offices on high alert but said the
discovery of one infected swan did not mean there was the danger of
wider outbreaks.
"This was a single bird," he said. "There is no sign of any strange
behaviour or massive deaths by wild birds."
The swan was found alive but died after showing symptoms of shaking
and partial paralysis.
Bulgaria is not able to conduct the complex tests which can tell
whether a strain of H5 is the highly pathogenic H5N1, which has
killed at least 86 people and millions of birds since 2003.
"If we send the samples on Monday or Tuesday to the EU-registered
laboratory in England, we will have the results by the end of the
week," Kabil said.
Scientists believe migratory birds first brought the virus to the
region from Russia as they travelled south along the Pontic migratory
route, which stretches south from northern Russia and Europe and
passes along the Black Sea's western coast.
Romania, home to Europe's largest wetlands in the Danube delta, has
detected cases in birds in 26 villages, while to the north Ukraine
officials have destroyed hundreds of thousands of domestic birds
after numerous outbreaks there.
Croatia has also detected H5N1 in wild swans.
Bulgaria, a relatively poor Black Sea country of 7.8 million, has
banned [the importation of] poultry from its neighbours, forbidden
the hunting of wild birds, told farmers to keep domestic fowl indoors
and has stepped up surveillance of migratory birds in wetland areas.

More than 10 dead wild ducks were discovered by fishermen in Batumi
port area. Batumi is the capital of Ajariya, in the southwestern part
of Georgia [map available at
<http://www.world-gazetteer.com/s/s_ge.htm>].
Some dead ducks were also discovered [on the beach near the port].
This information came from city administration.
Ajariya borders Turkey, where numerous cases of avian influenza have
recently been recorded.
According to the city administration, veterinary service staff have
already collected dead ducks, which are currently being tested for
avian influenza virus.
According to the Georgian Ministry of Health, no case of avian
influenza has yet been identified among birds or humans.

Turkey has reported an outbreak of avian influenza in chickens, less
than a month after declaring its territory free of the virus, and
said it had culled 359 birds as a precautionary measure.
In a statement released late on Tuesday [31 Jan 2006], the
Agriculture Ministry said it had imposed quarantine in the affected
area of Igdir, near Turkey's far-eastern border with Armenia, after
detecting a strain of the bird flu virus in dead chickens.
The strain has been identified as the H5 type; samples have been sent
to the World Health Organization and the European Union for more tests.
Igdir is a remote, rural area where farming and animal husbandry are
the main means of livelihood.
The Agriculture Ministry announced on 9 Dec 2005 that it had
successfully eliminated bird flu in western Turkey, but experts say
Turkey will remain vulnerable to further outbreaks because it lies on
the flight path of migratory birds, which are widely thought to help
spread the virus.
The ministry said it believed migratory birds may have brought the
virus to Igdir from the Caucasus region.

Update on the Avian Influenza situation: Country situation
----------------------------------------------------------
Turkey:
On 27 Dec 2005, a new outbreak was reported in poultry in eastern
Igdir Province. Since then, HPAI infection has been confirmed in
backyard poultry in 57 places [situated within] 27 provinces [see the
map in commentary to item 4 above]. Protection and surveillance zones
have been declared and susceptible animals in the protection zones
have been culled with compensation given. In Turkey, 98 percent of
the poultry is chicken. Of its approximately 300 million poultry, 10
million are raised in backyards. The national AI control policy is
stamping out on confirmed infected holdings and culling in backyard
systems within a 3-km radius. Province-wide culling has been
implemented in 3 provinces.
Culling on suspicion has been practised since a change in legislation
in late 2005. As of 30 Jan 2006, 1 596 000 poultry have been culled.
Laboratory tests conducted at Turkey's National Influenza Centre in
Ankara have confirmed 21 cases of human infection in Agri, Ankara,
Corum, Kastamonu, Samsun, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Sivas and Van Provinces.
Of these cases, 4 from Dogubayazit, Van Province have been fatal. An
international team of health professionals (FAO, OIE, WHO, EC/ECDC)
has assessed the country situation, epidemiological facts (human and
animal), and country needs.
Cyprus:
Preliminary test results of dead birds in Indzhirli Village in the
north part of Cyprus are being investigated for H5.
Romania:
Since October [2005], Romania has detected HPAI H5N1 in 25 places in
its southern and southeastern counties of Tulcea, Braila, Buzau,
Ialomita and Calarasi. On 10 Jan 2006, deaths of poultry were
reported in Ciresu and Dudesti, Braila Department and H5N1 infection
was confirmed. There are 7 active outbreaks: 3 villages in the
Braila, 3 in Ialomita and one in Calarasi. Since the beginning of
outbreaks, more than 53 000 birds have died or been culled.
Romania has adopted a zoning strategy based on risk levels to stop
further spread of disease: zone 0 (Infected Districts) with livestock
movement ban, disinfection, surveillance, confinement of poultry,
restriction of traffic, hunting and fishing ban; and zone 1 (all
districts bordering zone 0) with movement and trade ban of poultry
and pigs, disinfection, surveillance, confinement of poultry have
been established. The latest cases [were recorded] on 10 Jan 2006 in
Ciresu and Dudesti Villages in Braila Country.
Russia:
No new outbreaks have been reported in poultry since late December
2005. Dead pigeons were found in Leninsk District, Murmansk Oblast.
Samples from all poultry farms in the area were sent to the
laboratory in St. Petersburg, with negative results. Antibodies
against AI have been detected in 2 workers out of 450 that have been
sampled in 15 poultry-farming facilities in the Rostov Oblast.
Ukraine:
Since the last AIDEnews, outbreaks have been suspected / confirmed in
Beregove, Predmostnoye, Prymorske, Solar, Soniatchne and Zolotoie
Pole Villages in the Crimean Peninsula. H5N1 infection was also
detected in synanthropic [peridomestic] birds in the City of
Sevastopol. The government veterinary services imposed a standstill
order on all local poultry movements and instituted quarantine
perimeters 3 km around infected villages with an additional 10-km
buffer zone. AI outbreaks were reported in turkeys in Tsvitochne
village, Bilohirsk District, and in Flower Village, Belogorsky,
Crimea on 29 Jan 2006. A total of 137 wild birds have died in Alushta
on 27 Jan and were confirmed as having AI. Deaths of 217 wild birds
were also reported in Partenit on 29 Jan. As of 19 Jan 2006, more
than 200 000 poultry have died or been culled. Quarantine measures
have been lifted in 16 villages in 6 districts. As of 25 Jan 2006,
the total number of quarantined places is 9 (Feodosiya district (4),
Kirovskiy district (4) and Dzhankoyskiy district (1)).
China:
On 22 Dec 2006, H5N1 cases were found in chickens and ducks in
Liuyan, Da Zhu County, Sichuan Province; 1800 birds died and 12 900
were culled. Another outbreak was reported on 1 Jan 2006 in Wudang
Village in Guizhou province; 16 000 quails died and 42 000 birds were
culled. Since the last AIDEnews, human cases have been confirmed in
Fujan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan and Sichuan Provinces. Some human
cases were reported from provinces where no case in poultry has been
officially reported.
A 29-year-old woman from Chengdu City, Sichuan Province [who] died on
23 Jan 2006 was infected with H5N1.
Hong Kong SAR:
H5N1 virus was detected in a dead magpie robin found in Tai Po
village in New Territories on 10 Jan 206, and in an oriental magpie
robin found dead on 26 Jan 2006.
Hong Kong has collected 9000 samples from dead birds in 2005. All 8
chicken farms near [the site] where the [infected] bird was found
have been inspected and no sign of AI was found.
Indonesia:
More than 21 000 chickens have died in Indramayu, Sukabumi, Subang,
Cirebon regencies and Ciberon municipality, West Java over the last 2
months. At least 6 human cases have been suspected within 10 days in
a village in Indramayu, West Java, another 2 cases in East Jakarta
and one in south Jakarta. According to WHO, 3 cases were confirmed
[so far in] 2006, of which all 3 were fatal. The country's
presentation related to the AI situation and control is posted at:
<http://www.who.int/entity/mediacentre/events/2005/04_Indonesia_Sri_mulhani.pdf>.
Viet Nam:Viet Nam completed its first round [of] nationwide
vaccination in early Jan 2006, and currently post-vaccination
surveillance [is being] conducted. As of 22 Jan 2006, 7600 serum
samples have been tested with protective rates reaching 86.3 percent
for duck and 82.6 percent for chicken. Swab samples were also taken
for analyses, and the results of the 627 swab samples were negative
for H5 strain.
