A new human H7N9 avian flu case was reported in central China's Hunan province on [Thu 12 Jan 2017], the 2nd in the province this year [2017].

The patient, a 59-year-old man from Yuanjiang City, who is in a critical condition and under medical treatment, had contact with poultry before he fell ill, said the provincial center for disease control and prevention.

The 1st H7N9 case, a 35-year-old male, was confirmed on [Sat 7 Jan 2017]. Sporadic human H7N9 cases have been reported around the country.

H7N9, a bird flu strain most likely to strike in winter and spring, was first reported in humans in China in March 2013. People who suspect they are infected should seek medical treatment.
