[I wrote in post (03) of this thread:
>Perhaps ... CDC Fort Collins can inform us whether the virus has been named?<
But I had already received the following from Dr Gubler. New viruses
cannot be named until it has been determined that they are in fact new. I
regret the delay in posting this - Mod.JW]

This is is a flavivirus that by sequencing appears to be a subtype of KFD
[Kyasanur Forest Disease]. However, it appears to be associated with
slaughtering animals (sheep) and raw camel's milk in the Jeddah area (not
exactly KFD ecology). We have been trying to do or get done,
cross-neutralization tests to confirm its relationship with KFD and other
TB [tickborne] group viruses, but because of biocontainment problems, this
has not been done.
We are hopeful, however, that we can complete this work in the next few
months. Because of the completely different ecology, we are betting that
it is a new virus, but we cannot be sure at this point.

[KFD is a virus of forested areas in India. Its reservoir is monkeys and
it is transmitted by ticks. It affects forest workers - Mod.JW]
