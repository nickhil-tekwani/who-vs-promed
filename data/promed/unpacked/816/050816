[ProMED-mail originally covered this case in ProMED-mail posting 20150926.3671968 as a request for information. While the moderator strongly suspected ionophore intoxication, it had not at the time of that posting been confirmed. It has now been confirmed. - Mod.TG]


The owner of Black Fence Farm [Fresno County, California] didn't realize her business was going to crumble within hours when she received a call one Saturday morning in mid-September [2015] about a sick horse on her facility.

"I got called out of my house 1st thing in the morning, probably 7:30, by the woman who feeds the horses," said the owner, who specializes in training children how to ride and show horses.

One of the facility's horses was having trouble walking and couldn't get up, the owner was told. At the time, Black Fence Farm housed 49 horses, 21 of which belonged to the owner and the rest were boarded at the farm on behalf of clients.

The owner went out to see the sick horse and immediately called a veterinarian.

"At that point, we thought just one horse was sick," the owner said.

Several children at the farm that Saturday morning soon ran to the owner and informed her that other horses were sick and having similar problems.

"It started to snowball really quickly," the owner said. "It was kind of chaotic at 1st."

After roughly 20 minutes of thinking about the issue, the owner suspected the feed was responsible.

"So, I sent them back out to take the feed away from the horses to prevent them from eating anymore, in case that's what it was," she said. "Within about 2 hours of thinking about it and seeing the horses, I knew in my heart that's exactly what it was."

Lab results have since confirmed her suspicion, the owner said. The feed, which came from Goshen, California-based Western Milling, was tainted with monensin -- a common additive in cattle feed that is highly toxic to horses.

"We found it in the autopsy of the horses and in feed batches through multiple labs that have tested it," she said.

On [25 Sep 2015], Western Milling voluntarily recalled 1100 bags of feed. Western Milling declined to comment for this story.

"This is a lady who had a thriving business, who had the horses and the children's best interest at heart," said an attorney representing Black Fence Farm. "She researched and found the best and safest feed she could find, and lo and behold, she finds this feed is loaded with this poison. And through no fault of her own, she's dealing with this nightmare and she's trying to help these children deal with their nightmares as they're watching their horses die right before their eyes."

The attorney hopes that the company will accept responsibility for what their feed has done to his client.

"They appear to acknowledge their mistake and (are) wanting to do right by these folks," he said. "But time will tell how sincere these gestures are."

In regard to how Western Milling may compensate the individual horse owners in any possible settlement, the attorney said, "it depends on a case-by-case basis."

Once a horse has ingested monensin, signs can include wobbly gait, rapid heart rate and sudden death, which can occur weeks or months after the toxin was ingested.

There is no known antidote to monensin poisoning in horses. The other horses at the facility have consumed the same feed and their monensin intoxication means they can no longer be used as riding animals, the owner said.

"Here it is, it's wiped out our entire farm -- and people have never even heard about it. That's something I'd like to change."

[Ionophores modify the movement of ions across the membranes of rumen microbes. There are many ionophores, the most commonly known have names like monensin, lasalocid, salinomycin and narisin. This particular intoxication involved monensin. While there are many biological responses reported in the literature for monensin, they can be consolidated into 7 categories or system modes of action. The modification of volatile fatty acid production is one widely recognized category of great importance. This shift in volatile fatty acids results in improved feed efficiency. Some ionophores also function as a coccidiostat. Generally ionophores are used in the cattle industry.

However, ionophores are toxic to the heart of equines. There are a number of different ionophores and they vary in their toxicity to the horse. Sadly monensin is one of the more toxic ionophores.

While this type of toxicity does not occur often, it does occasionally occur and is sometimes the result of such a feed mixing error. - Mod.TG
