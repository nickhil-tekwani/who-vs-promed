Two districts (Kecamatan) in South Jakarta have been declared "Red
Zones" for bird flu virus. This statement was made regarding 2 fatal
victims who died from bird flu virus illness in February and March
2009.

"It means that this area is susceptible to bird flu spreading," said
head of the Livestock and Fishery Service, South Jakarta, Chaidir
Taufik after his team had finished a fowl depopulation measure this
afternoon [25 Mar 2009].

The 2 districts declared susceptible to bird flu are Kecamatan
Pesanggrahan and Kebayoran Lama. "We don't know how long this status
will last," he added.

The Livestock and Fishery Service of South Jakarta culled about 1322
fowl from 10 districts in South Jakarta. This measure was taken
according to regional regulation Perda No 4, 2007 for pandemic
preparedness, which states that all bird species without
certification from the government should be culled before April 2010.
Culling was done at Wartas Pinang.

Indonesia
---------
Indonesia continues to report a high number of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in
poultry in the last 3 years [2006-2008]. HPAI remains endemic on
Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi islands with sporadic outbreaks reported
from other areas. HPAI infection is considered to be established
throughout most of Indonesia, although incidence varies widely. Only
2 of its 33 provinces have not experienced the occurrence of H5N1
HPAI.

The high number of reported outbreaks monthly for Indonesia can be
explained by the implementation of the "participatory disease
surveillance and response" (PDSR) 1 programme that targets
village-type poultry production systems (both backyard and
small-scale intensive) and has been very effective at detecting
evidence of virus circulation in the village environment. The
programme is supported by FAO, thanks to USAID financial support.

Larger, less densely-populated provinces report HPAI outbreaks more
infrequently than more densely populated provinces. It appears that
H5N1 HPAI is more sporadic in the smaller, more dispersed poultry
populations.

During February 2009, PDSR officers visited 1483 villages, of which
204 (13.8 percent) were infected. This was noticeably higher than the
January 2009 infection rate of 8.5 percent. On the day of 28 Feb 2009,
and in comparison with the situation on the day of 31 Jan 2009, an
increased percentage of villages were classified as "infected" (HPAI
compatible event supported by a positive antigen test result).
Infected villages are throughout Java, but with more in East Java than
last month [February 2009]. Bali had HPAI positive villages for the
1st time due to a single incident during March 2009. South Sulawesi
has more infected villages than last month [January 2009]. Kalimantan
[Indonesian Borneo] continues to have no reported infection.

PDSR teams operate in 331/448 (74 percent) districts across 31/33
provinces including all known endemically infected areas. During the
previous 6 months, PDSR officers visited 11 345 villages (20 percent)
in the 331 districts under PDSR surveillance. An average of 6.4
percent of the villages visited during the previous 6 months were
classified as infected at the time of visit. Cases over the last 6
months were concentrated in Yogyakarta, Banten and Lampung.

[Indonesia submitted to the OIE its immediate notification on HPAI
H5N1 on 25 Sep 2006. A day later, on 26 Sep 2006, it notified the OIE
that the disease was regarded endemic. No additional follow-up
reports have been submitted since. The number of outbreaks and their
locations are submitted in the 6-monthly and annual reports.

According to the information available in WAHID's table "Detailed
country (ies) disease incidence: number of new outbreaks reported,"
the disease was present in Indonesia during 2005, but no number of
outbreaks is given. The numbers for the period January 2006-June 2008
for each of Indonesia's administrative regions are available at
