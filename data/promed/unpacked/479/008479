E. coli hits day-care center
-----------------
A particular strain of _Escherichia coli_ known as _E. coli_ O157:H7 has
struck at least 9 children in a Fort Wayne day-care center, Allen County
Commissioner of Health Dr. Deborah McMahan confirmed Wednesday [18 May
2005]. It is considered the most deadly strain of the bacterium.
The department is not releasing the name of the center, but McMahan said
one child was taken to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. The
investigation is still under way, with additional test results expected.
Tests on food and water consumed at the day care have all been negative.
"It looks like this was spread person-to-person," McMahan said, noting day
cares are common sites of outbreaks because little children put their hands
in their mouths and on various parts of their own bodies, then have direct
contact with other youngsters.
An estimated 73 000 cases and 61 deaths from the infection occur annually,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many more
cases likely occur because some people carry the infection but have no
symptoms. Another name for the illness is hemorrhagic colitis.
Usual symptoms include abdominal cramping, severe diarrhea, and blood in
the stool. Vomiting may occur, but there is normally little or no fever in
those who have it. In young children and the elderly, the illness can be
especially serious, leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition in
which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. 2-7 percent
of infections lead to kidney failure.
The bacterium can be found in undercooked meat, sewage-contaminated lakes
and streams, and contaminated drinking water. Babies can spread it to
adults during diaper changes without proper hand-washing.
Although symptoms may be gone after 5-10 days, young children can shed the
bacteria in their feces for another week or 2, which is why parents and
child-care providers should remain vigilant about hand-washing.
In most cases, the infection must run its course. Antibiotics are not
considered effective, according to the CDC. Anti-diarrheal agents also are
discouraged in favor of the body naturally ridding itself of the bacteria.
Caregivers should be on the alert for dehydration in children and the elderly.
The average number of annual cases in Allen County of this _E. coli_ strain
is about 2, McMahan said, although in 2000, there were 13. Any number above
the average is considered an outbreak.

[Day care centers have long been recognized as sites of _E. coli_ O157
outbreaks. As with many other enteropathogens found in day care center
outbreaks, spread is frequently hand-to-mouth or fomite to mouth, without
any food or water source being recognized. Toddlers are marvelous sharers
of toys as well as fecally contaminated hands. Use of antibiotics in
therapy for the diarrhea is controversial, as some studies (but not others)
have reported a marked increase in episodes of hemolytic uremic syndrome
following use of antibiotics for the _E. coli infection_. - Mod.DK]
