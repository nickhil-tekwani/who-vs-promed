While it is very encouraging to see an international effort mounted to
investigate this outbreak, I haven't heard of much emphasis being given to
documenting entomological aspects of the epidemic. Heavy rains and flooding
have no doubt impacted the populations of RVF and other disease vectors in
the area, as well as populations of reservoir hosts. Vector control may be
the key to stemming the tide of infection, but without the requisite vector
information, control efforts will be largely ineffective.

[Good point. This has been copied to WHO Geneva so that a description of
the entomological investigations in Garissa and elsewhere may be adequately
covered in their press releases. - Mod.MHJ
