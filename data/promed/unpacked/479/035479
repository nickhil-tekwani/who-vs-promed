Staff members of veterinary services and the Ministry of Emergencies
continue the special action in Ust-Kutsk region of Irkutsk oblast, where an
outbreak of classical swine fever [CSF] has been registered.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Emergencies, by 19 Sep
2007, out of 138 animals in the farm "Lena", 86 swine [were ill] and had 56
died. In "Kazarki" farm, 119 swine have been infected and 34 have died; 157
animals have been slaughtered in this farm, out of a total number of 348
pigs. The carcasses are being incinerated.
A vaccination campaign has been started in the areas at risk of the city
Ust-Kut and the settlement Verkhnemarkovo. Transportation and movement of
animals are prohibited and some surveillance check-points have been
established, as well as patrols on the riverside to control the
transportation of swine by boats.
As informed by IA Regnum earlier, the serological tests from dead animals
tested were positive for classical swine fever. Large-scale mortality
started in Kazarki on 6 Sep 2007. Initially, the mayor of Ust-Kut announced
state of emergency, but on 13 Sep 2007 he signed an order for quarantine.
Results of additional tests are expected by 29 Sep 2007.

Earlier in 2007, Russia reported outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF)
in the Volgograd and Stavropol oblasts; a report on the outbreak in Irkutsk
is anticipated. Laboratory confirmations of suspected cases of CSF are of
particular importance in view of the recent spread of African swine fever
in Russia's neighbour, Georgia.
