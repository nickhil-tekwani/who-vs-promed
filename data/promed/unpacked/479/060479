Dr. Paul Blake, epidemiologist for the Georgia Division of Public Health,
was cited as saying that the _E. coli_ O157:H7 that sickened more than two
dozen children in the White Water outbreak has a unique genetic fingerprint
that matches an _E. coli_ strain found in beef served this spring in at
least one Madison County school; the only ones in the nation to have
identical DNA, adding, "What this means to us is that this beef could have
been the way the organism that caused the outbreak got into Georgia,
although we'll never know for sure."
The U.S. Department of Agriculture revoked the plant's mark of inspection
Aug.12. USDA spokesman Andy Solomon was cited as saying the plant has been
under investigation, although he would not say for how long, and because
the investigation is ongoing, he would not comment on its focus.
In May, Bauer Meat recalled 37,500 pounds of meat patties supplied to
Georgia, North Carolina and overseas military facilities.
The recall was prompted by a Danielsville boy who became ill after saying
he ate a hamburger, which had been supplied by Bauer, in the cafeteria at
Danielsville Elementary School. Although public health workers were unable
to test a stool sample from the boy for _E. coli_ infection, the USDA and
the Georgia Division of Public Health both found _E. coli_ 0157:H7 in meat
samples taken from the school.
