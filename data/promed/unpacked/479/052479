Fourth Case of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Confirmed in Panama
-----------------------------------------------------------
A fourth case of dengue hemorrhagic fever was confirmed by the health
authorities of Panama, where there have been 596 cases of classical dengue
reported during the last 10 months, the Minister of Health Fernando Gracia
informed the press on Sun 4 Nov 2001. Gracia said that the health
authorities have declared "a state of maximum alert" in the district of La
Chorrera, 40 kilometers to the west of the capital, where the fourth case
was confirmed.
According to Gracia, the number of cases of classical dengue fever reported
during the first 10 months of the year is 50 percent higher than those
reported in the same period of 2000, which has led to an intensification of
preventive educational campaigns in order to eliminate the breeding sites
of the vectors of the disease, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
The symptoms of dengue are muscle pains, fever and diarrhea. In the
hemorrhagic form, there is bleeding, which can be fatal if not diagnosed
and treated in time.
