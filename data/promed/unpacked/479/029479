Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has survived the winter and is already circulating among livestock again in Britain, Defra has announced.

The virus has been identified on around 5 farms in new-born lambs born in May and June 2012. This means the ewes that carried them must have been infected in the early part of this year [2012], January or February 2012, after the peak winter period when the midges that carry them are no longer circulating, according to Defra Deputy Chief veterinary Officer Alick Simmons.

He told Farmers Guardian the discovery that the virus had survived the winter was no surprise, given what was already known about it and related viruses.

Mr Simmons announced that Defra is set to embark on a nationwide surveillance programme to establish how far the virus has spread and urged farmers to be vigilant in looking for signs in infected cattle that could show flu-like symptoms and in any lambs born out of season at this time of year.

He said it was impossible to gauge the effect the virus would have on the livestock industry this year [2012], partly because the virus's worst effects are seen in newborn lambs and calves, rather than the adult animals that are infected by midges.

He said the virus was likely to spread northwards and westwards from southern and eastern England where the bulk of infection was identified last year [2011]. However, initially at least, the implications for infected livestock will not be too severe, as very few sheep are currently in lamb, and a tiny proportion of cattle infected go on to have problems with their calves.

What is more, as the virus spreads, animals that are infected are likely to gain immunity from future infection based, again, on what is known about SBV and related diseases, Mr Simmons [said]. He added that the history of the disease in mainland Europe, particularly France, showed that SBV can spread rapidly, far more quickly than bluetongue, for example.

"In some ways, it is better for farmers if the disease spreads quickly in Britain, as more of the country will have been covered, with the benefit of immunity, before the autumn breeding season," he said [In other words: activity of BSV-infected vectors during the 1st 6-7 months of the year, when most susceptible animals (at least, ovines) are not pregnant, will most probably render them lifelong immunity and prevent the appearance of malformed progeny. - Mod.AS].

The problems are most likely to come when infection reaches counties to the north and west of the current centre of infection in the autumn, when many ewes and cows are in the early stages of pregnancy, the critical period when infection results in stillborn and deformed offspring.

"We cannot say at this stage which areas will be particularly at risk," he said.

[Circulation of SBV in Europe during 2012 has already been confirmed in Switzerland; its renewed circulation in southern UK may mean a 2nd wave of cases (malformed offspring) later this year (2012) and particularly in early 2013 in areas/farms which remained untouched during the previous season. Updated information on the SBV situation from the other 8 countries affected during the previous season (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy and Denmark) is anticipated. A recently reported unidentified illness (diarrhea) in northwest Ukraine has yet to be diagnosed, SBV to be excluded or otherwise.

The most recent update of UK's AHVLA (Animal Health & Veterinary Laboratories Agency) on SBV, published today, 25 Jul 2012 (see at http://tinyurl.com/dxcnhfh), says: "There are 276 UK farms reporting SBV: 53 in cattle, 220 in sheep and 3 premises which reported sheep (earlier in the year) and are now also reporting cattle cases. Using the most up-to-date knowledge to diagnose the disease, we are reviewing previous cases where clinical signs and testing of brains did not provide consistent conclusions, as the testing of fetal fluids may be of additional value in diagnosing SBV."

SBV-affected ruminants were 1st reported from the UK on 31 Jan 2012; this reflected earlier infections, namely during the fall of 2011 (see posting 20120201.1027941). According to the above "Farmers Guardian" information, the circulation of the virus has been renewed (or continued?!) during 2012. The appearance of affected (malformed) neonatal lambs in May-June 2012 is the result of infections which had taken place 3-4 months earlier and may predict the appearance (several months later, namely in late summer 2012), of malformed affected offspring in cattle as well, in case pregnant bovines were also exposed within the affected region. However, the peak activity of culicoides is still to be expected.

Serological tests, if applied, will furnish early information on the evolving 2012 situation within the 10 affected countries and beyond. For serology, the following tests are available:

1. ELISA: commercial kit available
2. Indirect Immunofluorescence
3. Neutralization test
