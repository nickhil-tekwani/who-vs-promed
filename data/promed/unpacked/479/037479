China: Close Contacts of [19th] human Avian Influenza Case Cleared
-----------------------------------------------
All 98 people who had close contact with a suspected [now confirmed] human
case of avian influenza in South China have tested clear of the disease,
the local health bureau stated on Thu 15 Jun 2006. The contacts included
relatives of the 31-year-old male patient, medical workers in a local
clinic and in Shenzhen People's Hospital, where the man had been treated,
and the patients in the same ward. Tests on the 98 contacts all proved
negative for the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus, but doctors [will]
continue observations of them, according to the health bureau of Shenzhen,
a city in Guangdong Province.
A bureau source said the man was still in critical condition and being
treated in Donghu Hospital in the city. A test sample from him had been
sent to Beijing for verification by the Ministry of Health. The patient
started to show symptoms of back pain, fever and a cough on 3 Jun 2006. He
was admitted to the Shenzhen People's Hospital on 9 Jun 2006.
The Shenzhen Center of Disease Control conducted tests for the H5N1 virus.
The Guangdong provincial health bureau immediately reported the case to the
Ministry of Health for verification. The patient was transferred to Donghu
Hospital on Tuesday [13 Jun 2006] for advanced treatment.
The Shenzhen city government has announced a 2nd-degree emergency as a
precaution against bird flu in the city.
The male patient, a truck driver, had no contacts with birds before
becoming ill. However, his wife bought a freshly slaughtered chicken from a
local market 2 weeks ago and cooked it for dinner for 5 family members,
including the man. None of the man's family showed similar symptoms. They
and other close contacts are under medical observation. He will become
China's 19th reported human case if he is confirmed as having the H5N1
strain of bird flu.
[In fact, this patient was confirmed as a positive case of H5N1 avian
influenza by the WHO later on Fri 16 Jun 2006: see Avian influenza, human
(85) - China 20060617.1685. China has now reported 19 human cases,
involving 12 deaths. According to the World Health Organization, as of 16
Jun 2006, 227 human bird flu cases have been confirmed since late 2003,
involving 129 fatalities. - Mod.CP]

[The confirmation of this 19th human case in an area where apparently no
outbreak of disease in poultry has been reported prior to discovery of this
human case suggests that surveillance of animal disease may have been
inadequate. However, it is possible that the patient's occupation as a
truck driver exposed him to infection at another locality. It is reassuring
to learn that there has been no indication of transmissibility of the avian
virus either among close relatives or unrelated contacts. - Mod.CP]
