[This recent report provides a good summary of West Nile virus
presence and infections in the Caribbean Basin countries. A summary
from the published article is given below. One hopes that it will
stimulate additional field studies throughout the region and
intensify surveillance of possible human and animal (wild birds,
equines) clinical disease. - Mod.TY]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
----------
West Nile virus (_Flavivirus_: _Flaviviridae_; WNV) has spread
rapidly throughout the Caribbean Basin since its initial detection
there in 2001. This report summarizes our current knowledge of WNV
transmission in tropical America.

Methods
-------
We reviewed the published literature and consulted with key public
health officials to obtain unpublished data.

Results
-------
West Nile virus infections first appeared in human residents of the
Cayman Islands and the Florida Keys in 2001, and in apparently
healthy Jamaican birds sampled early in 2002. Serologic evidence of
WNV infection in 2002 was detected in horses, chickens, and resident
free-ranging birds in Guadeloupe, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Mexico. In 2003, WNV spread in Mexico and northern Central America,
and serologic evidence was detected in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and
Cuba. In 2004, the 1st serologic evidence of WNV activity in South
American ecosystems surfaced in September-October in Colombia and
Trinidad, where domestic animals circulated WNV-neutralizing antibodies.

Conclusions
-----------
The sparse reports of equine, human, and avian disease in Latin
America and the Caribbean are puzzling. Isolates are needed to
evaluate viral attenuation or other possible explanations for reduced
disease burden in tropical ecosystems.

[A related report in Spanish (<http://journal.paho.org/?a_ID=1171>)
published in the same issue of the journal mentions the 1st 4
serologically confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection in Latin
America in Argentina in patients with clinical encephalitis.
Additional information is provided giving more detailed results of
WNV surveillance in Puerto Rico. The article points out that despite
serological evidence of considerable WNV transmission in the
Caribbean Basin and some South American countries, there have not
been any reported outbreaks of human disease due to this virus.
