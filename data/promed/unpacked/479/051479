From: Robert A. LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>

I am a reasonably healthy male 50-yr. old, and came down with a mild case of
foodborne listeriosis last summer. The etiological agent was _L.
monocytogenes_ in a package of Orvall-Kent potato salad purchased at Super
K-Mart. The product was recalled for Listeria contamination by the company.
At the time, no cases of infection were reported.
The strain involved in my sickness was probably serotype 1/2b, since a
complex of symptoms occurred about 24 hr. after ingestion of the food. These
symptoms included fever, headache, body ache, slight nausea and malaise.
Within 24 hr. all symptoms disappeared.
The potato salad had been totally consumed and the container discarded. I
would never have associated the symptoms with listeriosis, except for
receiving
a notice of recall of the particular food item on one of the listserves I
subscribe to. Since the illness was minor and ephemeral, no stool cultures
were taken, so the agent was not conclusively identified.
All this means is that mild cases are rarely reported, but still occur.

[In the last posting it has been kindly and gently pointed out that I used
some coded phrases, "VIO" and "VIC". The British veterinary diagnostic
laboratories are known as "Veterinary Investigation Centres" and thus the
head of such a laboratory was known as the "Veterinary Investigation
Officer". I apologise for this presumption of arcane knowledge. I would
point out that they did investigate livestock problems on the farms in their
areas and were not passive diagnosticians. - Mod.MHJ
