1st report of spot type of barley net blotch caused by _Pyrenophora teres_
f. sp. _maculata_ in Uruguay
-----------------------------------------------
S. A. Pereyra and S. E. German, Instituto Nacional de Investigacion
Agropecuaria (National Institute for Agricultural Research), INIA La
Estanzuela, Ruta 50 km 11, 70000, Colonia, Uruguay. Plant Dis. 88:1162,
2004; published on-line as D-2004-0803-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication
8 Jun 2004.
In September 2003, leaves exhibiting spot-type lesions similar to those
produced by _Cochliobolus sativus_ Drechs. ex Dastur were widely observed
in 6 commercial barley crops of cvs. Nortena Dayman, Nortena Carumbe, and
MUSA 936 in Soriano and Rio Negro provinces, the main barley production
region in western Uruguay.
Spot lesions were tan to dark brown, circular to elliptical, and 3 to 10 mm
in diameter. Larger lesions were surrounded by a chlorotic margin of
varying width. Affected leaf pieces (10 to 15) from each field were placed
in a moist chamber for 2 days to promote sporulation. A fungus identified
morphologically as _Pyrenophora teres_ (Died.) Drechs. (1) was consistently
isolated from infected leaves. However, symptoms did not correspond to the
net-type lesions of net blotch commonly produced by _P. teres_ f. sp.
_teres_ in Uruguay.
3 monoconidial cultures were obtained by transferring single conidia to
potato dextrose agar and then to 10 percent V8 juice agar and incubated at
20 to 22 C, with a 12-h photoperiod, for 10 days. Adding sterile water to
each plate and gently rubbing the surface with a microscope slide prepared
inoculum for pathogenicity tests. Conidia concentration was adjusted to
about 10 000 conidia per ml.
68 barley genotypes from Uruguay, ICARDA/CIMMYT, and North Dakota were
grown in the greenhouse for 2 weeks at 20 to 22 C with a 14-h photoperiod.
For each monoconidial isolate, 3 seedlings of each genotype were inoculated
at the 3-leaf stage 15 to 16 days after seeding with 0.4 ml of the inoculum
suspension with an airbrush inoculator. A drop of Tween 20 was added per 40
ml of inoculum suspension. One set of each genotype was inoculated with
sterile water as a control. Seedlings were placed in a dew chamber at 20 C
and 100 percent relative humidity in the dark for 24 h and then returned to
prior conditions.
The 1st lesions developed after 7 to 9 days. Leaves 2 and 3 of the plants
were visually rated for disease (3) 13 days after inoculation. Control
plants were disease free. The most susceptible reactions were observed on
cvs. Nortena Dayman, MUSA 936, and line CLE 230 (Uruguay). Symptoms were
similar in shape and size to those observed in the fields. The most
resistant infection types were observed on several Uruguayan and North
Dakota advanced lines.
The fungus was consistently re-isolated from inoculated plants. On the
basis of morphology and symptoms produced, the pathogen was identified (2)
as _P. teres_. f. sp. _maculata_ Smedeg.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of this fungus causing spot-like
symptoms of net blotch in Uruguay.

[_Pyrenophora teres_ f. _teres_ [Ptft] (causing net blotch) and
_Pyrenophora teres_ f. _maculata_ [Ptfm] (causing "spot form" of the
disease) are important foliar pathogens of barley. Estimated losses
worldwide are up to 20 percent. Isolates derived from single conidia were
evaluated for their virulence phenotypes on 25 differential barley
genotypes. In general, the Ptft isolates exhibited a broader spectrum and a
higher level of virulence on the host differentials than the Ptfm isolates.
8 barley genotypes were resistant to all 19 pathotypes identified and
should be useful in breeding barley for resistance to both forms of _P. teres_.
Genetic variation was also examined by restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. A 0.46-kb DNA fragment (ND218) generated by
PCR from genomic DNA of a California isolate of Ptft was used as a probe.
Every _P. teres_ isolate tested with ND218 exhibited a unique RFLP pattern.
Cluster analysis, based on both the virulence phenotypes and RFLP patterns,
indicates that _P. teres_ possesses a high degree of diversity at the
species and subspecies levels. The high degree of polymorphism revealed by
ND218 will make this probe a useful tool for the DNA fingerprinting of _P.
teres_ isolates. Sequence analysis of the 18s rDNA revealed 100 percent
homology between the 2 forms. This intron distinguishes _P. teres_ from the
barley leaf spot pathogen _Cochliobolus sativus_, the symptoms of which are
often confused with those of Ptfm. The closely related _P.
tritici-repentis_, which causes similar spot lesions, also lacked this
intron. DNA sequence analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 spacer regions revealed
only 1.6 percent divergence between the 2 forms.
Disease management involves the use of seed treated with fungicide,
avoidance of direct sowing on stubble without ploughing, and starting
fungicidal treatment according to local advice when symptoms occur on one
of the last 3 barley leaves. When plants are severely attacked,
applications of fungicide should commence at the one node stage to delay
possible disease outbreak.
