Deadly scrub typhus is rearing its ugly head once again in the state [Rajasthan]. Till a few years ago, cases were reported only from Alwar, but now there are 17 districts that have reported scrub typhus cases. 9 deaths and 189 cases have already been reported. Slowly but surely it is taking entire state under its grip.

In the past 3 days, 6 deaths from scrub typhus were reported in different parts of the state. During the last 3 days 15 persons were tested positive for scrub typhus.

According to a health department official the total positive cases of scrub typhus were 133 and 4 deaths till [17 Sep 204]. But, now the health department figures show that in the past 10 days, the number of patients suffering from scrub typhus has increased significantly. In the past 10 days, 59 more cases of the disease were reported and 8 persons died of the disease in the same period.

Recently, the health department held a meeting and directed the officials to spread awareness about the disease as it is not infectious [scrub typhus is an infection, but it is not contagious] but it can be prevented by taking certain precautions. Like dengue is caused by a mosquito bite, scrub typhus is caused by a mite, known as chigger found in grass. Such cases are reported commonly after monsoon rains.

The health department is keen to ensure that the disease does not spread to other districts, which was popularly known as a mysterious disease. The deaths reported in Jaipur are 2, Kota (2), Jhalawar (2), Bundi (2), Bharatpur (2), Alwar (2), and 1 case each in Bhilwara and Chittorgarh in 2014.

The highest [number of] cases of the disease are reported in Jaipur and Jhalawar with 28 positive cases in each district. In Alwar 20 cases, Kota 17, Baran 13, and in Bundi 16 cases were reported. Moreover, there are 23 such cases that were reported in the state but they belonged to another state.

[Scrub typhus is an infection caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. A picture of the eschar can be found at http://medind.nic.in/icb/t10/i8/icbt10i8p918.pdf.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation. Azithromycin is an alternative in children and pregnant women with scrub typhus (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full).

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Dipstick assays (http://www.ajtmh.org/content/67/5/497.long) have been developed that are easy to perform and do not require sophisticated equipment, making them suitable for use in rural areas where more sophisticated diagnostic tests such as the IFA may not be available. The news report above does say how the diagnosis was made in the fatal cases or in previous cases.
