It is not surprising that raccoons scavenge deer carcasses and could
contract bovine tuberculosis from affected deer - raccoons are omnivorous
and opportunistic in food habits. The following is from J.H. Kaufmann.
1982. Raccoon and Allies. In Wild Mammals of North America, J.A. Chapman
and G.A. Feldhamer, eds. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.
pp.567-585.
"Hundreds of species of plants and animal food have been recorded from
scats and stomachs and the relative proportions of different foods vary
with the season and locality." ... "Most classes of vertebrates are eaten.
...raccoons also eat carrion from deer, cows, and horses. Garbage is a
common element in the diet around farms and towns."

[Thanks, Beth. So he next time you see one of those cuddly, round-eyed,
furry, Disneyesque creatures, just remember where he was last and leave him
be! - Mod.MHJ
