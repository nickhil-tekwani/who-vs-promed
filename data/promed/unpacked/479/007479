Jujube yield decreased this year [2016] after the orchards were hit by a "viral" disease [see comment below] in western Farah province.

A senior official said the agriculture department lacked specialists and facilities and had been so far unable to prevent the viral disease. The jujube fruit was infested with worms, resulting in decreased yield and low quality. The fruit faced such a major threat once in several years, he said, adding the main reason behind the disaster remained unknown.

[A farmer] said most of the fruits were destroyed. He said there were more than 300 orchards in his village and most had [been] infected with the viral disease. The disease-hit fruit couldn't be sold and people have to face economic problems. Currently hundreds of jujube orchards exist in different parts of the province.

[Jujube (_Ziziphus_ spp.) is an important fruit crop in parts of Asia and southeastern Europe. They are small trees or shrubs in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae) including both species suitable for cultivation in tropical (for example, _Z. mauritiana_) and cooler (such as _Z. jujuba; also called 'red date') conditions.

A number of fungal diseases are known to affect the crop, as well as witches' broom caused by isolates of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma ziziphi (16SrV group). While symptomless infection with _Hop stunt viroid_ was reported in jujube from China, so far, there have been no records of any viral diseases in jujubes.

The claim above of a "viral" disease, therefore, is more likely to refer either to jujube witches' broom, or since "worms" are also mentioned, the term "viral" may have been used as a generic expression of a general disease or pest attack.
