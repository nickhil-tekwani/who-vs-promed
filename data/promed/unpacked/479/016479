Antibiotic-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ infections, one of the most common hospital-acquired infections in children across the United States, are on the rise, according to results of a recent study published in the Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society on [22 Mar 2018] [1].

"_Acinetobacter_ are bacteria known to cause serious infections and notoriously difficult to treat because of growing antibiotic resistance. The bacteria survive for long periods in the environment," said study primary author Dr Latania Logan, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and associate professor of pediatrics at Rush University Medical Center.

The research examined national and regional trends of antibiotic resistance in clinical specimens over a 13-year period. The data was taken from The Surveillance Network Database, a network of 300 laboratories distributed throughout the US and is compiled by the Centers for Disease Dynamics Economics and Policy in Washington, DC.

Because _A. baumannii_ is an infection caused by bacteria that takes advantage of patients with compromised immune systems, children with a chronic condition are at a higher risk of infections of the lung, urinary tract, or other sites after surgery, intubation, trauma, or catheterization.

The [frequency] of _A. baumannii_ in infected children that were resistant to the cephalosporin and carbapenem [antibiotics] increased between 1999 and 2012 overall. However, the authors of the study noted a slight decline after a peak in 2008. Antibiotic stewardship guidelines released in 2007 or infection control guidance specifically designed to combat multi-drug resistant _A. baumannii_ in health care settings may have been related to the decrease.

"While we are encouraged by the slight downtrend in resistance after 2008, there is still an overall increase in these infections. Further studies are needed to assess the most effective prevention strategies in children," Logan said.

_A. baumannii_ has numerous ways that protect it from antibiotics. The bacteria are able to protect themselves by using genetic adaptations that support survival in dry, harsh environments, and additionally have in place several mechanisms to render antibiotics ineffective. In this situation, "a perfect storm" results, Logan said. As a result, highly resistant _A. baumannii_ infections are increasingly being reported worldwide.

The study results show that the number of cephalosporin-resistant _A. baumannii_ increased from 13.2 percent of infections in 1999 to 23.4 percent in 2012, whereas the number of carbapenem-resistant _A. baumannii_ increased from 0.6 percent in 1999 to 6.1 percent in 2012. From 1999 to 2012, the proportion of cephalosporin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant bacteria among all _A. baumannii_ increased each year by 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively. After 2008, a downward trend was observed, but resistance remained higher than the 1999 baseline.

"It is encouraging to see the downtrend after 2008, but we need to continue to monitor," said the study co-author Dr Sumanth Gandra, a resident scholar in the Center For Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, an independent research initiative based in Washington, DC and New Delhi, India.

Abstract
--------
"Background. _Acinetobacter baumannii_ is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections. Carbapenem-resistant (CR) _A. baumannii_ is a significant threat globally. We used a large reference laboratory database to study the epidemiology of _A. baumannii_ in children in the United States.

"Methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network were used to phenotypically identify antibiotic resistance in _A. baumannii_ isolates in children 1-17 years of age between January 1999 and July 2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate trends in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in _A. baumannii_. Isolates from infants (less than 1 year old) were excluded.

"Results. The crude proportion of cephalosporin-resistant (CephR) _A. baumannii_ increased from 13.2 percent in 1999 to 23.4 percent in 2012 with a peak of 32.5 percent in 2008, and the proportion of CR _A. baumannii_ increased from 0.6 percent in 1999 to 6.1 percent in 2012 with a peak of 12.7 percent in 2008. From 1999 to 2012, the proportion of CephR and CR _A. baumannii_ increased each year by 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively (CephR odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.04; CR OR = 1.08, 95 percent CI, 1.05-1.12); however, after 2008, a significant decrease in trend was observed (CephR OR = 0.78, 95 percent CI, 0.71-0.87; CR OR = 0.73, 95 percent CI, 0.62-0.86), but resistance remained higher than baseline (1999).

"Conclusions. Overall, between 1999 and 2012, CephR and CR _A. baumannii_ isolates increased in children; however, a decreasing trend was observed after 2008. There is a need for ongoing surveillance of _A. baumannii_ infections and continued assessment of effective prevention strategies in vulnerable populations."

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail posts Antibiotic resistance - USA: (CA) MDR-Acinetobacter, bacteriophage therapy 20170429.5003312 and Acinetobacter - Spain: (MU) fatal, ICU 20160914.4487658:

_Acinetobacter_ are aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli commonly found in soil and water and readily survive in a hospital environment. During nosocomial outbreaks, _Acinetobacter_ have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. Of the many _Acinetobacter_ species, _A. baumannii_ accounts for about 80 percent of reported infections.

Outbreaks of _Acinetobacter_ infections usually occur in healthcare settings, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units. These organisms may colonize patients or cause a variety of infections, such as pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, burn wounds, traumatic and surgical wound infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. _Acinetobacter_ have been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms.

_Acinetobacter_ infections have been especially a problem for the military wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include various aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes, plasmid-mediated, and/or chromosomal-linked beta-lactamases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, alteration of targets for antimicrobial drugs such as the penicillin-binding proteins, and antibiotic efflux pumps; these mechanisms are at times combined with absent or reduced expression of porin channels that limit penetration of antibiotics to their site of action (see: Dijkshoorn L, et al: An increasing threat in hospitals: multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007; 5(12): 939-51; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18007677).

Resistance of _Acinetobacter_ to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by these organisms. Some _Acinetobacter_ isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins [such as colistin] and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et al: Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet North Am Ed. 1994; 344(8933): 1329-32; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin and thereby to allow ampicillin to kill the bacteria. Versus _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial activity. - Mod.ML
