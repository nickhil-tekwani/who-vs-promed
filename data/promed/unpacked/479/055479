Abstract
--------
A countrywide survey in Oman revealed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nucleic acid in 5 of 76 dromedary camels. Camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences (3754 nucleotides assembled from partial sequences of the open reading frame (ORF)1a, spike, and ORF4b genes) from Oman and Qatar were slightly different from each other, but closely related to human MERS-CoV sequences from the same geographical areas, suggesting local zoonotic transmission. High viral loads in nasal and conjunctival swabs suggest possible transmission by the respiratory route.

Discussion
----------
The results of our study and similar studies from Qatar and Saudi Arabia show a close genetic relationship between camel-derived and human-derived MERS-CoV from the same geographical areas, suggesting local zoonotic transmission. A proof of cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans was reported in a publication on human infection with MERS-CoV after exposure to infected camels in Saudi Arabia recently. The authors concluded that camels may act as a direct source of human MERS-CoV infection. For the implementation of effective, but reasonable precautions, however, further pieces of the puzzle must be put together: a Ct-value of 15.74, corresponding to approximately 33 million RNA copies, in the nasal swab of one of the Omani camels (this study) indicates a very high virus load and the probability of the transmission of high numbers of virus particles by the nasal route. Data from another recent publication suggest that neither passively acquired maternal antibodies nor prior infections seem to lead to full immunity in the camels, and viral nucleic acid was detected in such animals, though at a significantly lower level; these and other recent results, however, require confirmation.

Evidence was provided that MERS-CoV has been circulating in camels at least since 1992, but probably much longer, while strains in humans emerged only recently. Initially, dromedary camels have been considered possible intermediate hosts of MERS-CoV, while bats were suggested as primary reservoirs -- in analogy to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). According to our current knowledge, however, dromedary camels might even be considered the primary reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV. Comparative analyses of camel- and human-derived MERS-CoV sequences exhibit higher than 99 percent nt identities to each other with so far no striking genetic differences observed. Given the high prevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in dromedary camels, infection of camels with this virus seems to be frequent on the Arabian Peninsula. This is in sharp contrast to the comparatively low number of recorded human infections. Since currently no other obvious explanation for this discrepancy exists, it is postulated that a high infectious dose through very close contact between an infected camel and a human being is required for initiation of human MERS-CoV infection by camels. Younger camels may play a particular role in zoonotic transmission since they seem to be more frequently infected and seem to shed more virus than older ones. Although the respiratory route is, in our opinion, the most likely route of transmission, a recent paper demonstrated that MERS-CoV survived in raw camel milk slightly longer than in milk of other species, suggesting further investigations on a possible food-borne route of transmission. Also, it is not clear yet whether the course of MERS-CoV infection in camels is generally asymptomatic or associated with mild respiratory symptoms, as suggested recently.

[Following the isolation of MERS-CoV from nasal swabs of young dromedary camels kept on a farm owned by a MERS-CoV patient, Qatar duly submitted, in October 2013, an official notification to the OIE on an "emerging (zoonotic) disease" in camels (20131129.2082115). Following a 2nd isolate from the same location, where surveillance had been ongoing since the 1st case, a follow-up report has been submitted on 22 Apr 2014 (20140424.2426491).

MERS-CoV infection of (young) camels on farms in Saudi Arabia related to human infection there (in 2013), has been described in a recent paper; see item 2 in 20140325.2356854. The paper is available online at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0402_article.htm; the agent was identified by real-time RT-PCR, Saudi Arabia has been suffering a significant upsurge of human infections during 2014.

The current Eurosurveillance paper adds data on similar findings in Oman. The diagnosis was performed by 2 published MERS-CoV reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays (for details, see the source URL).

Serological findings in dromedary camels have been received during 2013 from other countries; their significance is yet to be established.

While no human cases have been reported in Qatar since November 2013 and Oman has reported one suspected patient in 2014 (see 20140109.2162284 and 20140326.2359173), Saudi Arabia has been experiencing a dramatic upsurge of human cases during the last 2 months. WHO's MERS-CoV updates, available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/, seem to be lagging behind the situation on the ground. A continuously updated summary presenting the accumulated number of reported cases per country, since the start of the event in 2012, could be helpful.

Qatar's MERS-CoV surveillance in camels has been described in its OIE reports. It would be interesting to note if other species (including bats), are covered in the sampling scheme. Qatar has been, so far, the only country reporting MERS-CoV in animals (as an emerging zoonotic disease) to the OIE. - Mod.AS
