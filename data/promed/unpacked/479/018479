[The encephalitis case count in Uttar Pradesh has risen from 551 on 8
Nov 2011 to 585 as of today [23 Nov 2011]. The 8 Nov 2011 report
indicated that these were Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection
cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111109.3328). However, the above
report does not indicate what the etiological agents involved in these
cases are. Previous reports from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states this
year (2011) implicate JEV in approximately 1/3rd of the encephalitis
cases, the majority being due to undiagnosed viruses, perhaps
enteroviruses, associated with contaminated water.
