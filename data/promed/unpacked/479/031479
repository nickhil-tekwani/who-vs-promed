New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
----------------------------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on the EPPO
Alert List. The situation of the pest concerned is indicated in bold [in the
original], using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
Detailed records:
Fire blight
-----------
In Italy in 2005, _Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 list) was found on _Malus_
(apple) in the "Valle di Non" province of Trento (Trentino-Alto Adige region).
Phytosanitary measures are being applied to prevent any further spread. In
this region, _E. amylovora_ was 1st reported in 1999 (EPPO RS 2000/002) on
pear (NPPO of Italy, 2005).
Strawberry anthracnose
-----------------------
In Italy, _Glomerella acutata_ (anamorph _Colletrichum acutatum_ - EU Annexes)
was detected in a collection of isolates collected in Calabria during the last
10 years from strawberry fields showing anthracnose symptoms (Agosteo et al.,
2005).
Tomato spotted wilt virus on pepper
--------------------------------------
In Turkey, tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2 list) was reported on
_Capsicum annuum_ in the Samsun province, Black Sea region. The virus was also
detected by ELISA in several weed species: _Amaranthus retroflexus_, _Datura
stramonium_, _Hibiscus trionum_, and _Taraxacum officinale_ (Arli-Sokmen et
al., 2005).
Plum pox virus (PPV)
--------------------
In Italy, the presence of plum pox potyvirus (EPPO A2 list) was
reported in 2004 in Friuli Venezia Giulia on plums (_Prunus
domestica_ cvs. "Susina di Dro" and "Locale"). PPV was detected in
the localities of Chiampore and Santa Barbara (commune of Muggia,
province of Trieste). Eradication measures were applied (NPPO of
Italy, 2005).
New host plants
-------------------
In the USA, the occurrence of impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus
(INSV - EPPO A2 list) was reported on glasshouse-grown _Capsicum
annuum_ (Naidu et al., 2005).
In Spain, both tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia begomovirus (TYLCSV)
and tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV) were reported on
tomato crops. TYLCV was also reported in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ and
_Capsicum annuum_ crops. During summer 2004, symptoms of yellowing,
crumpling and necrosis of new leaves were observed sporadically in
young, field-grown tobacco plants (_Nicotiana tabacum_) in the
Badajoz province (Extremadura). The presence of TYLCV was detected in
mixed infections with potato Y potyvirus (PVY) in the tested samples
(Font et al., 2005).

[One phytobacterium, one fungus and 3 viral pathogens of crop plants
are described in this report. Fire blight is a serious disease of
pear and apple. It is native to North America, was introduced to
Europe in the 1950s, and has spread throughout many countries in
Europe and the Middle East. It is relatively newly introduced to
Italy (1999), hence the concern in the 1st report.
