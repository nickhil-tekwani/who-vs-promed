Dr Peter Kirkland, Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute in Camden
[Australia, recently told a forum on human disease that the discovery of a
paramyxovirus in pigs which also affected Australian farm workers last year
should serve as a warning to government not to cut back funds for
veterinary laboratories, and that the virus also raised questions about the
potential hazards of transplanting pig tissue into humans.
Kirkland was further cited as saying the farm, close to Sydney, was still
in quarantine nearly a year after paramyxovirus caused stillbirths and
deformities in pigs and made two workers seriously ill with flu-like symptoms.
The story adds that Kirkland's research, showing that the measles-like
virus probably sprang originally from fruit bats, will shortly be published
in the US Center for Disease Control's journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Kirkland said that the paramyxovirus, in the same family as canine
distemper and human measles, was the third human infection - after equine
morbillivirus and lyssavirus - to be found in Australian fruit bats in
three years, adding that "If farmers are discouraged from bringing in their
sick animals we run the risk that a number of these diseases will remain
concealed."
Scott Cameron of the South Australian Health Commission and University of
Adelaide, was cited as saying that farmers' dwindling access to free
autopsies for animals reduced the likelihood of human disease risks being
picked up, adding, "A lot of farmers would find it easier to bury the
animal and forget about it."
Kirkland said tests of pigs around Australia had found no trace of the
virus anywhere but in three related commercial piggeries which had existed
close to a huge fruit bat colony for the last 30 years.
It was not a public health threat, although it may be an occupational risk
for farm workers through contact with bodily fluids of pigs.

[The earlier report (29 September 1997) on ProMED-mail did not mention that
there had been evidence for human infection with this virus, so this
certainly is something new. If such diagnosis was by routine serology
only, perhaps it is not the new problem it might appear to be. ProMED-mail
lacks details in this regard but the human disease has been described as a
severe one.
Actually, other than the possibly significant human cases, there is nothing
new here and this report is not meant to indicate that there is, although
it is obvious that those concerned about the inherent potential dangers of
xenotransplantation will not be encouraged by this report.
Peter Kirkland was kind enough to respond to my request for more
information and told me that he had not been announcing anything that might
be considered news, only that he had presented a paper at an emerging
diseases meeting and mentioned this experience with the porcine virus, but
he did say that a probable association with fruit bats was being
investigated. The original posting indicated that studies to characterize
the virus were progressing and experimental transmission trials were
underway but no further progress in this regard appears to have taken
place, at least to our knowledge.
Martin Hugh-Jones asks: (1) Why are paramyxoviruses coming to the forefront
of perhaps truly emerging diseases? There also have been the seal
"distemper" viruses, the African lion story, equine morbillivirus, etc. Is
there something significant occurring, or do we simply have more competent
virologists?
(2) Scot Cameron has an excellent point about the present financial
disincentives in veterinary diagnostic laboratory systems. Until not long
ago, UK veterinary diagnostic services were done at no cost to
veterinarians and Veterinary Investigation Centres (VIC) services were for
use by veterinarians, not farmers. As a result, VICs obtained a wealth of
material. Also, the system was not passive, as is the US system, in which
diagnostic labs are totally dependent on what might or might not be dropped
off. Could be that, in due course, and after some high profile problems,
the wisdom and economy of this structure will be rediscovered.
We look forward to seeing the publications about the new paramyxovirus in
Emerging Infectious Diseases. - Mod.CHC
