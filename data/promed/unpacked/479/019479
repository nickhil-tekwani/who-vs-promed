As of 23 Nov 2021, health officials in Maricopa County, Arizona have reported a total of 1091 human West Nile virus (WNV) cases in 2021. This total accounts for roughly half the total cases in the United States this year (1974 reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through 16 Nov 2021). The previous annual record of 355 cases [in Arizona] was set in 2004.

County officials also report 79 deaths due to the mosquitoborne disease. In all of 2000, Maricopa County saw 3 cases and one death. Melissa Kretschmer with the Maricopa County Health Department said a dry 2020 season followed by this very wet monsoon season contributed to more standing water, leading to more mosquitoes.

Statewide, Arizona has reported 1233 total confirmed and probable cases and 90 deaths. Pinal and Pima counties recorded cases in the double digits with 94 and 74 total cases, respectively.

West Nile virus is typically spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Although it can cause severe disease, only about 1 in 5 of those infected will develop any symptoms at all. Those who do develop symptoms usually experience a flulike illness including fever, headache, body aches and muscle weakness.

Rarely, about 1 in 150 people infected can develop encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or of the spinal cord). This more severe form of the disease can present with headache, neck stiffness, vision loss, paralysis and other neurologic symptoms. These severe cases can lead to very prolonged illness, permanent paralysis or death. Those who are over 60 years old, have underlying medical conditions or have depressed immune systems are at higher risk for the more severe form of West Nile virus.

[Arizona is experiencing an unusually high number of human West Nile virus infections this year (2021), with Maricopa County the main focus of infection. As of 17 Nov 2021, the US CDC reports that Arizona has a total of 1049 cases (724 neurological and 325 non-neurological), about 10 times more human cases than the next highest 2 states, California (101 cases) and Nebraska (102 cases).

The above report states that Arizona has 1233 cases. The USA national total is 1974 cases so far this year (2021) as of 17 Nov 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2021/disease-cases-state-2021.html).

There is a vaccine for equine animals but not for humans. The only preventive measure for people is to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
