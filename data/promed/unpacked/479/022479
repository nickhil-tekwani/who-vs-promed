The recent spell of warmer weather has led to an increase in cases of foodborne illness on the island. The barbecue season always tends to see a rise in the number of cases of bugs such as _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_.

However, Food Safety Manager Ivan Bratty says that in 2014, they've seen a higher peak than normal, with around 36 cases reported recently, around 10 higher than normal.

Mr Bratty says whilst numbers are relatively small, seeing an increase in the cases is never a good sign, particularly when most of them can be easily avoided.
