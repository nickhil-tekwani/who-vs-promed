South Korea is mulling over the use of vaccines to stem the worst
ever outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) disease that has spread
across the country despite concerted quarantine efforts, the
country's farm minister said Tuesday [21 Dec 2010].

In a meeting with reporters, Yoo Jeong-bok said Seoul is reviewing
various options that include vaccinating animals and raising the
animal quarantine alert level to the highest "red" from the current
"orange" to reflect the seriousness of the situation.

"Nothing has been decided about vaccinating local livestock since
various considerations must be reviewed in advance," he said.

Vaccinating animals may prevent further spread of the disease, but
such a move could cause South Korea to loose FMD-free country status
for an extended period of time and prevent meat exports.

Since the 1st outbreak was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010, the country
reported 38 cases of the disease with close to 200 000 livestock
having been culled or slated to be destroyed.

"Making any kind of decision on vaccination is hard, especially since
there is no way to tell how quickly FMD may spread," Yoo stressed. He
said local experts present at a marathon livestock quarantine
consultation committee meeting gave differing advice on the vaccine issue.

The minister's remarks come after Seoul confirmed an additional case
of FMD earlier in the day at a cattle farm in Gapyeong, a rural
county 60 km from the capital city, where local authorities detected
animals showing symptoms such as excessive drooling late Monday [20
Dec 2010]. All 55 head of cattle on the farm have been culled to
prevent further spread of the disease, with other livestock within a
500-meter radius to be destroyed as well.

In addition to the latest confirmed case, the ministry said 7 new
suspected cases of FMD were reported during the day.

Of the 7 cases, 2 were detected in Gangwon Province and one in South
Chungcheong Province, both of which have no confirmed cases of FMD so far.

If the disease is confirmed in Gangwon and Chungcheong, it
effectively means FMD has spread to 4 provinces and may compel the
government to take emergency measures, including the vaccination of
livestock. The disease 1st swept through North Gyeongsang Province
before hitting the Gyeonggi region.

Official sources, meanwhile, hinted that if the government decides to
give vaccines to animals, up to 70 billion won [USD 60.6 million] may
have to be spent if 100 000 livestock are given shots. This does not
include the 300 billion won-plus [USD 260 million] that has to be
spent on reimbursing farmers for culled animals up to the present point.

The country has 100 000 doses of animal vaccines in stock and can
import more from abroad if the need arises. There are about 3 million
head of cattle and 10 million head of pigs, with smaller numbers of
goats, sheep and deer.

Seoul, which reported its 1st FMD case in 2000, was hit again in 2002
and 2 more times earlier this year [2010, by 2 different FMD virus
types, A and O; the FMFV-O was, probably, similar to the one
circulating at present]. In 2000, the government used vaccines to
stem the outbreak, although it has opted not to resort to drugs in
the years thereafter.

[South Korea (mainland) includes a total of 8 provinces and 7 smaller
self-governing administrative units; see map at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/520px-Provinces_of_South_Korea_Txt.PNG>.

Gangwon (No. 9 on the map) province borders both provinces which are
already FMD-infected, namely Gyeongsanbuk and Gyeonggi;
Chungcheongnam province (No. 11), in the midwest, borders Gyeonggi on
its north. Gangwon and Gyeongsanbuk are S. Korea's largest provinces.

With the addition (if FMD confirmed) of 2 provinces, this has become
one of the world's worst FMD epizootics since 2001, affecting
industrialised countries where stamping out policy without
vaccination has initially been attempted to control and eradicate the
disease. It will be interesting to note if and which vaccination
scheme is eventually applied in S. Korea.

Japan, earlier this year [2010], dealing with an epizootic in
Miyazaki which started on 7 Apr 2010 and was caused by the same virus
strain (but see note at bottom), decided to apply limited vaccination
on 19 May 2010, after 131 outbreaks. The reason for vaccination was
said to be the need to speedily control the spread of the disease by
saving time for the slaughter of cattle. At this stage, only 60 000
out of the 118 000 head of [pigs and cattle] known to have contracted
the disease or suspected as exposed were slaughtered (No such delays
have been reported recently from S. Korea.). Therefore, it was
decided by the Japanese authorities to vaccinate all livestock within
a 10-km [6.2-mi] radius of affected farms (compared to the 500 m
radius exercised in S. Korea) but eventually to slaughter the
vaccinated animals. Such "vaccinate to kill" policy had been applied
earlier in the Netherlands (2001).

A detailed professional evaluation of the Japanese epizootic, its
evolvement, control and lessons to be learned, has not become
publicly available so far. The financial loss to Japan's farming
community has been calculated at approximately 235 billion yen [USD
2.8 billion]; see <http://www.zenoaq.jp/english/aij/1009.html> and
archived 20101211.4414.

"Stamping out without vaccination" has been subject to extensive
discussions for decades, and intensified since the major UK epizootic
in 2001 with its catastrophic results. The 2010 FMD epizootics in
Japan and Korea, their diagnosis, epidemiology and disease control
strategies deserve to be carefully analysed, both by the local
authorities and, while compared to previous events, also by the
international animal-health community for lessons to be drawn.
Proponents and opponents of vaccination (either preventive or
post-introduction, selective or general, geographically-restricted or
countywide, etc.) and its potential impact upon the status of
vaccinated countries/regions, particularly as related to
international trade, will undoubtedly have their say.

The results of the genotyping of the current (November-December 2010)
FMD serotype strain(s) in S. Korea have not yet become available. A
sample, collected on 8 Apr 2010 from cattle in Inch'on-Jikhalsi, was
sent shortly thereafter to the World FMD Reference Lab, Pirbright.
Its genotyping results are available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000H%20O%20South%20Korea%202010.pdf>.

The virus, of serotype O, was defined as Topotype SEA,
Genotype/strain Mya-98. The most closely related viruses were found
to be strains collected in February 2010 from pigs in Hong Kong
(number of matching nucleotides 633/639 = 99.06 percent identity). A
similar virus strain caused the Japanese epizootic. It may be assumed
that the current virus in S. Korea is similar as well. - Mod.AS]
