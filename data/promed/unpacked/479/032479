The Philippines confirmed that African swine fever [ASF] caused the deaths of hundreds of pigs in towns near its capital, becoming the latest Asian country to be affected by the highly contagious viral disease.

"We are still waiting on whether the virus affecting the hog areas in the country is weak or virulent," agriculture secretary William Dar said in a briefing Monday [9 Sep 2019]. He said the majority of the 20 blood samples sent to the UK [Pirbright] tested positive for the virus.

President Rodrigo Duterte approved the formation of a task force that will include the police and the military to prevent an outbreak, Dar said. The virus potentially came from hotels, restaurants, or even overseas Filipino workers bringing pork products from affected countries, he said [see comment].

The agriculture department on 19 Aug 2019 opened a probe following increased swine deaths from backyard raisers and ordered that all pigs within a 1 km [about 0.62 mi] radius of the infected farms be culled. Economic planning secretary Ernesto Pernia last month [August 2019] said the possible entry of the deadly swine disease that's spreading across Asia is among the risks to inflation this year [2019]. The virus isn't known to harm humans.

"We are not in an epidemic stage yet," Dar said, adding that there are new incident areas from initially 3 locations in Rizal and Bulacan provinces. "We have yet to see how fast the virus can spread."

Hog raisers must promptly report unusual animal deaths in their farms, Dar said. The Philippines' PHP 260 billion [USD 5 billion] swine industry provides livelihood to millions of Filipinos as small backyard raisers account for 65% of the industry, the agriculture department said.

Livestock accounts for 17% of Philippine agricultural output. Philippine hog production was more than 2.3 million metric tons based on live weight in 2018, valued at PHP 242 billion [USD 4.7 billion]. As of 1 Jul 2019, the nation's hog inventory was estimated at 12.7 million heads, little changed from a year ago [1 Jul 2018].

The southeast Asian nation in July [2019] banned pork imports from Germany, citing concerns about food safety in one of the world's major shippers. The Philippines is the 4th biggest destination for European pork this year [2019]. In June [2019], the ASF virus gene was detected by authorities in confiscated canned goods from Hong Kong.

[The 1st official information on a new health problem in domestic pigs in the Philippines was made public during a press conference in Manila on Mon 19 Aug 2019, when the agriculture secretary informed that the agency received on 16 Aug 2019 a report of "increased mortality of pigs raised by farmers in their backyards" in Rizal. According to additional information, the mortality rate in the area was "spiked to as much as 20%," while "usual mortality for pigs is between 3%-5% (ProMED-mail archive no. 20190819.6630039). Information on clinical signs or pathological changes was not available; diagnosis was not made/published. Agriculture secretary William Dar informed that he ordered the Bureau of Animal Industry to conduct laboratory tests and send blood samples of affected pigs to foreign counterparts to identify the cause of the deaths.

In a press conference 2 days later, the Department of Agriculture said that "there is no outbreak of African swine fever in the country," while confirming that "there have been incidents of hog mortality in some areas," the cause of which are "pending confirmatory laboratory tests." Though no diagnosis was made, "all pigs within the 1 km [about 0.62 mi] radius from the virus' ground zero were culled." (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190822.6635634).

It may be assumed that the authorities' decision to disregard, at that stage, ASF as the main suspect, was based (in addition to the absence of local lab diagnosis) on the rate of pig mortality recorded; ASF is traditionally expected to cause acute disease and mortality significantly higher than 20%. This aspect of the event is yet to be explained.

The Philippines province of Rizal is located on the country's largest island, Luzon, in the Calabarzon region, 16 km [about 10 mi] east of Manila; maps at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizal#/media/File:Ph_locator_map_rizal.png and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6664694,590.

The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) listed, in its Early Warning Early Action Report on Food Security and Agriculture, released 15 Apr 2019, several countries as being at ASF risk, "such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and the Philippines" (ProMED-mail archive no. 20190430.6449134). This prediction has, unfortunately, already been fully realized.

The source of infection in Rizal is yet to be determined; genotyping of the virus may be helpful in this respect. The route(s) of introduction, speculated in the above report, are still in need of further investigation, just for the sake of lessons to be learned. - Mod.AS]
