A particularly bad strain of chlamydia not usually seen in the USA
appears to be slowly spreading among men who have sex with men
(MSMs), an infection that can increase their chances of getting or
spreading the AIDS virus. Called LGV (lymphogranuloma venereum), this
sexually transmitted disease has caused a worrisome outbreak in
Europe, where some countries have confirmed dozens of cases.
Diagnoses confirmed by health officials in the USA still are low,
just 27 since they warned in 2005 that the strain was headed here.
But specialists say that's undoubtedly a fraction of the infections,
because this illness is incredibly hard to diagnose: few clinics and
laboratories can test for it. Painful symptoms can be mistaken for
other illnesses, such as irritable bowel syndrome.
"My feeling is that what we're seeing now is still the tip of the
iceberg," says Dr. Philippe Chiliade of the Whitman-Walker Clinic in
Washington, DC, which diagnosed its 1st few cases of LGV in January
2006 and is beginning to push for asymptomatic men to be screened.
Increasing the ability to test for LGV is "what's really critically
important," she adds. "The prevalence of the disease is probably
quite a bit higher than the reported cases indicate, either here or
in Europe, but we don't yet know that."
3 weeks of the antibiotic doxycycline effectively treats LGV. But
patients have to know they're at risk and then find a test.
LGV is not a new disease, but one rarely seen outside of Africa or
Southeast Asia. So STD specialists were stunned in late 2004, when
the Netherlands announced an outbreak that reached over 100 cases; in
the summer of 2005, one clinic there reported seeing one to 2 new
patients a week. Cases also have surfaced in much of Western Europe
and Britain. As with the cases in the USA, many also have HIV.
Symptoms differ from regular chlamydia: swollen lymph nodes in the
groin; genital or rectal ulcers; and painful bowel movements and
other gastrointestinal symptoms that may mimic inflammatory bowel
disease. Such symptoms leave patients particularly susceptible to HIV
infection if they also encounter that virus. LGV can infect both
sexes, although new cases diagnosed so far are among men having sex
with men.
Because testing is difficult, no one knows how prevalent LGV truly
is. In a surprise finding in the fall of 2005, Dutch scientists
tested some tissue samples stored in San Francisco since the 1980s
and found evidence that today's LGV strain had gone unrecognized at
the time. So has it been simmering here all along, or is it on the
rise?

[ProMED would like to thank Powell Gammill for contributing this
posting. Increasing numbers of reports of LGV infection have arisen
since 2004 in the developed world, primarily in MSMs in western
Europe. One factor that has been linked to this apparent upswing is
the use of crystal methamphetamine. - Mod.LL]
