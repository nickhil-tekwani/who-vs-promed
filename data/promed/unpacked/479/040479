Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Health Officer is taking steps to make sure pet owners don't contract an illness that's been striking dogs in the Halifax area.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that affects the liver or kidneys. It can be fatal for animals if it progresses, and the signs can be difficult to spot. The highly contagious infection can also be passed on to humans.

Dr. Tricia Horsman says there are currently dogs sick with the infection who are being cared for at the Metro Animal Emergency Clinic in a closed off area.

"Last week, I think we had 12 inpatients; this week, we probably we have about 6 that are suspected leptospirosis cases," she says.

Vomiting, increased drinking, diarrhea and jaundice are all signs of the disease.

Concerned with the number of cases in Halifax, the Nova Scotia Department of Health recently wrote to veterinarians and medical doctors alerting them to some of the signs in pet and symptoms in people and precautions pet owners should take.

"Basic common sense personal hygiene measures will significantly reduce even the low-level risk that might be in place right now," advises Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Robert Strang.

Leptospirosis is more commonly found in tropical climates, and Strang adds that colder weather is expected to reduce the number of cases.

There haven't been any human cases reported so far, but pet owners with sick animals say it can be very serious to treat.

Tim Dixon's 10-month-old lab puppy is currently on the mend.

"She was running a high fever, and couldn't even walk," Dixon says. "She was transported that afternoon to the emergency clinic here in Dartmouth."

Officials say dogs even just sniffing urine left by other animals can transfer the bacterial disease. Dogs can also contract leptospirosis by drinking contaminated water or if scratches on their skin come into contact with contaminated soil.

Meredith Darrah says she's avoiding certain areas to keep her dog Olive from catching the infection.

"We're just going to try to avoid the high-concentrated dog areas, so we'll stay away from Point Pleasant Park and Shubie, places where there are hundreds of dogs," she says.

Darrah says she's taking the extra precautions even though her dog has been vaccinated against the disease.

[Leptospirosis is bacterial, zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to people. Infection in people can cause flu-like symptoms and can cause liver or kidney disease, which can also happen in animals. In the United States, most cases of human leptospirosis result from recreational activities involving water. Infection resulting from contact with an infected pet is much less common, but it is possible.

Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs.

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness, some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis in dogs may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend a number of other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (X-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Dogs can be vaccinated to prevent leptospirosis. Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the Leptospira bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- Administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- Avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- If your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- Encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- Wash your hands after handling your pet.

If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV or other conditions), consult your physician for advice.

Other information readers may find interesting regards the different serovars of leptospirosis. Dogs are the maintenance host for _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar Canicola, and before widespread vaccination programs, serovars Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae were the most common serovars in dogs in the USA. The prevalence of canine serovars has shifted significantly in the last 20 years; currently the most prevalent serovars are believed to be Grippotyphosa, Pomona, and Bratislava; however, this belief is largely based on serologic results that are now known to be inaccurate in predicting the infecting serovar in dogs with leptospirosis. The serovars that cause disease in dogs are likely to vary with geographic region and the presence of reservoir hosts. Unfortunately, current understanding of the serovars that cause natural disease in dogs is limited by the fact that isolation of leptospires is rarely performed; thus, studies to date have relied on serologic data. It is possible the serovars causing disease in dogs are those circulating in local wildlife
