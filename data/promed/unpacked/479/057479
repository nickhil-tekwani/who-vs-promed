[1] Vaccine hesitancy (editorial)
Date: Sat 19 Jan 2019
Source: New York Times editorial board [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/opinion/vaccines-public-health.html


The no-vaccine crowd has persuaded a lot of people. But public health can prevail.

The World Health Organization has ranked vaccine hesitancy -- the growing resistance to widely available lifesaving vaccines -- as one of the top 10 health threats in the world for 2019. That news will not come as a surprise in New York City, where the worst measles outbreak in decades is now underway. Nor in California or Minnesota, where similar outbreaks unfolded in 2014 and 2017, respectively. Nor in Texas, where some 60 000 children remain wholly unvaccinated thanks in part to an aggressive anti-vaccine lobby.

Leading global health threats typically are caused by the plagues and perils of low-income countries, but vaccine hesitancy is as American as can be. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of children who are unvaccinated has quadrupled since 2001, even though the overall utilization of most vaccines remains high. More than 100 000 American infants and toddlers have received no vaccines whatsoever, and millions more have received only some crucial shots.

It's no mystery how we got here. On the internet, anti-vaccine propaganda has outpaced pro-vaccine public health information. The anti-vaxxers, as they are colloquially known, have hundreds of websites promoting their message, a roster of tech- and media-savvy influencers and an aggressive political arm that includes at least a dozen political action committees. Defense against this onslaught has been meager. The CDC, the nation's leading public health agency, has a website with accurate information, but no loud public voice. The United States Surgeon General's office has been mum. So has the White House -- and not just under the current administration. That leaves just a handful of academics who get bombarded with vitriol, including outright threats, every time they try to counter pseudoscience with fact.

The consequences of this disparity are substantial: a surge in outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis and other diseases; an increase in influenza deaths; and dismal rates of HPV vaccination, which doctors say could effectively wipe out cervical cancer if it were better utilized. But infectious disease experts warn that things could get much worse. Trust in vaccines is being so thoroughly eroded, they say, that these prevention tools are in danger of becoming useless. The next major disease outbreak "will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies," Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, writes in the journal Nature, but to an "emotional contagion, digitally enabled."

Thwarting this danger will require a campaign as bold and aggressive as the one being waged by the anti-vaccination contingent. And to launch such a campaign would require overcoming strong inertia: a waning public health apparatus, countervailing politics and a collective amnesia over the havoc the diseases in question once wrought. But to succeed would be to rescue from oblivion one of the greatest triumphs of human ingenuity over disease -- and to save countless lives.

Here's how to get started
--------------------.
Get tough. After the 2014 California measles outbreak, the state eliminated nonmedical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations. After a similar outbreak in Michigan, health officials there began requiring individuals to formally consult with their local health departments before opting out of otherwise-mandatory shots. In both cases, these tougher policies drove up vaccination rates. Other states ought to follow this lead, and the federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.

Be savvy. The Vaccine Confidence Project is a London-based academic endeavor that monitors anti-vaccine websites for rumors and conspiracies and addresses them before the messages go viral. It also conducts regular surveys of attitudes and puts out a vaccine confidence index. Federal health officials would do well to implement a similar program, make it as public as possible and pair it with an aggressive and targeted social media campaign that makes as much use of celebrities as the anti-vaccine movement has.

Be clear. Vaccines, to some extent, are victims of their own success. In the United States especially, they've beaten so many infectious foes into oblivion that hardly any practicing doctors, let alone new parents, remember how terrible those diseases once were. An effective pro-vaccine campaign needs to remind us: Vaccines prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths globally each year. In developing countries, people line up for hours to get these shots. It's also O.K. to get out of the gray zone. Scientists, especially, are uncomfortable with black-and-white statements, because science is all about nuance. But, in the case of vaccines, there are some hard truths that deserve to be trumpeted. Vaccines are not toxic, and they do not cause autism. Full stop.

Know the enemy. The arguments used by people driving the anti-vaccination movement have not changed in about a century. These arguments are effective because they are intuitively appealing -- but they are also easily refutable. Instead of ignoring these arguments, an effective pro-vaccine campaign would confront them directly, over and over, for as long as it takes. Yes, there are chemicals in vaccines, but they are not toxic. No, vaccines can't overwhelm your immune system, which already confronts countless pathogens every day.

Know the audience. Not every parent with concerns about vaccination is a rabid conspiracy theorist bent on resisting inoculation forever. In fact, studies suggest that less than 2 percent of all parents fall into this category. The rest of vaccine-hesitant families sit along a spectrum. Some reject all vaccines but are still open to receiving information. Others are only worried about one specific vaccine. And others still are merely anxious and looking for reliable information. Any successful campaign will need to mind this diversity and prioritize listening to concerns as much as dispelling myths.

Enlist the right support. Some doctors and scientists have referred to "uneventful vaccination" as "The Greatest Story Never Told." Though they may not spread on the internet like the stories of terrible mishaps that anti-vaxxers traffic in, these far more common tales of inoculation without incident can be a powerful elixir for a nervous new parent. The best ambassadors of these stories are likely to be parents themselves. Surveys suggest that pro-vaccine families are often eager to help counter misinformation, but they don't know where to start. If health officials corralled these families and trained them in the basics of vaccine science, they might succeed where official voices sometimes fail.

[The entire editorial is reprinted here because some readers likely will not have full access to the NYTimes. Vaccine hesitancy is only part of the problem, albeit a very serious one. A parallel can be drawn between the experience with vaccines and that of mosquito control. When either is successful, no one thinks it is needed any longer because the cause of the problem ostensibly has disappeared. It is only when there is a lapse and disease increases that people again take notice and blame the public health system. Complacency leads many people, especially in developed countries, to think infectious diseases are not a problem for them any longer. This is far from the truth in this global environment, with high speed of travel, increasing number of travelers, density of populations in urban areas, and more. - Mod.LK]

[2] WHO list of global threats
Date: Thu 17 Jan 2019
Source: Live Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.livescience.com/64523-anti-vaccine-movement-top-global-threats-who.html


A new list of top global health threats from the World Health Organization (WHO) reads like a "who's who" of public health hazards: Pandemic flu. Ebola. Drug resistance. But tucked in this list of much-talked-about threats is one perhaps-surprising inclusion: the anti-vaccine movement.

The list, released this week, highlighted "10 of the many issues that will demand attention from WHO and health partners in 2019," the organization said in a statement. And the anti-vaccine movement, which the list refers to as "vaccine hesitancy," made the cut.

Vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths a year globally. However, vaccine hesitancy -- defined as delays in vaccination or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services -- threatens to reverse progress being made against infectious diseases, the WHO said.

For example, measles -- a vaccine-preventable disease -- has seen a 30 percent rise in cases globally in recent years, and vaccine hesitancy may have played a role in that increase. In fact, some countries that were close to eliminating the measles have now seen a resurgence in cases, the WHO said.

The inclusion of vaccine hesitancy in the WHO's list of global health threats puts a focus on the "danger of this movement," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.

If this list had been made 100 years ago, all of the top 10 health threats would have been infectious diseases, Adalja said. But that's not the case today, and that's because of vaccines. "Vaccine hesitancy threatens to undo a lot of that progress," Adalja told Live Science.

Adalja also noted that another health threat on the WHO's 2019 list is "noncommunicable," or noninfectious, diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

But in years past, "you wouldn't even live to get many of these noncommunicable diseases," Adalja said. "The fact that noncommunicable disease are included is a testament to how powerful vaccines are."

Vaccine hesitancy is a complex problem to tackle, the WHO said. Indeed, the reasons for refusing vaccines can differ depending on the individual, Adalja said. Some people question the safety of vaccines, even though numerous studies show that vaccines are safe and effective. Other people may think their children are getting "too many vaccines" over a short period and so ask to have the vaccines spread out. But such "alternative vaccination schedules" put children at risk for contracting preventable infectious diseases.

When a patient shows vaccine hesitancy, doctors need to figure out what that individual's concerns are and "provide facts and evidence for why vaccination is the best course of action," Adalja said.

Another reason for vaccine hesitancy is complacency, when people perceive the risks of infectious diseases as low, the WHO said, even though these diseases are real threats.

Adalja said he would like to see today's society better embrace vaccines and their life-saving benefits, as was the case, for example, in the 1950s when news of the release of the polio vaccine was met with much public jubilation.

"We need to get back to that era where vaccines were celebrated the way a new iPhone [is]," Adalja said.

Other important global health threats on WHO's list include: Climate change, which is predicted to lead to an additional 250 000 deaths each year from factors such as malnutrition, heat stress and malaria; weak primary health care services; dengue fever; HIV; and fragile and venerable settings, including those affected by ongoing crises.

[3] USA - Washington (Clark county) and Oregon (Multnomah County)
Date: Sat 19 Jan 2019

https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/19/health/washington-state-measles-cases/index.html:


A person infected with measles attended a Portland Trail Blazers home game in Oregon last week amid an outbreak that has left at least 19 people ill this month [January 2019] in neighboring Washington state.

Contagious people also went to Portland International Airport, as well as to hospitals, schools, stores, churches and restaurants across Washington's Clark County and the 2-state region, county officials said.

A public health emergency was declared Fri 17 Jan 2019 in Clark County, less than a half hour drive from Portland, in response to the measles outbreak. Of 19 people with confirmed cases, 18 are children, county officials said. 16 had not been immunized, and it's unclear whether the remaining 3 were.

Seven suspected cases also have been identified since 1 Jan 2019.

Though someone infected with measles attended the NBA game on 11 Jan 2019 at the Moda Center, no Oregon residents have been diagnosed with the virus, public health officials in Multnomah County, Oregon, said. But it raises the possibility the Washington outbreak could spread across the state line.

"Public Health is continuing to identify and contact potential measles cases, and identify possible locations of public exposure," Washington county officials said, noting that the emergency declaration will help them fight the virus and access resources outside the region.

In 1978, the CDC set a goal to eliminate measles from the United States by 1982. Measles was declared eliminated -- defined by absence of continuous disease transmission for greater than 12 months -- from the United States in 2000.

But there has been a recent rise in unvaccinated children. The proportion of children receiving no vaccine doses by 2 years old rose from 0.9% among those born in 2011 to 1.3% among those born in 2015, the CDC reported in October 2018.

[4] South Korea (Gyeonggi Province)
Date: Sun 20 Jan 2019
Source: The Korea Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/01/119_262339.html


Measles infections are growing here, putting health authorities on high alert. Five infants aged under 4 as well as 3 of their mothers were confirmed to have contracted measles in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province Sun 20 Jan 2019.

The infants were attending 2 daycare centers there. The 3 mothers tested positive, but they had had vaccinations in the past, and their symptoms were not grave, according to the provincial health office.

Some of the patients had visited a hospital in the nearby city of Siheung where an 8-month-old infant had been confirmed to have measles earlier on 11 Jan 2019.

"We are working out exactly how they contracted it," an official of Gyeonggi's regional health office said, adding that those patients have been hospitalized at quarantined wards.

The provincial government had an emergency meeting with officials of the health offices and major hospitals in the region to discuss measures to prevent further spread of the disease.

The authorities are examining about 400 people who may have been exposed to the patients, including family members, other infants at the daycare centers, and staffers at the hospitals the patients visited.

"We'll be on alert for the next 6 weeks. If we get additional patients in the region, we'll take countermeasures such as recommending parents not send children to daycare centers," the official said.

Between last month [December 2018] and last Sat 12 Jan 2019, 16 measles infections have been confirmed in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province: 8 adults in their 20s to 30s and 8 infants. But the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the genotype of the measles found in Gyeonggi was different from that in Daegu and North Gyeongsang.

It was believed that measles had been eradicated here due to vaccinations, but health authorities say people can contract the disease through overseas travel or contact with foreign visitors carrying the virus.

Two cases of measles have measles have been confirmed in the Bay of Plenty and Lakes district. But they are not linked to the outbreak in the Waikato.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Phil Shoemack says one case was notified yesterday [19 Jan 2019], the other 10 days ago.

"One of them contracted measles in the Philippines, and it's unclear where the other picked it up visiting a number of countries from Singapore to Japan," he says.

"We are in the process of identifying people who have had close contact with the 2 patients, and those who haven't been vaccinated will be required to be quarantined.

"With the case identified yesterday [19 Jan 2019], we are aware one person who was in close contact hasn't been vaccinated and there may be more."

The Waikato District Health Board has declared a measles outbreak and is urging people in the region to get immunised.

The District Health Board has been notified of 6 cases of measles in the last week, with 2 of those cases going back to late December 2018.

The DHB's chief medical officer of health, Dr Richard Hoskins, says the DHB had been working with the families to find out where they might have contracted measles.
