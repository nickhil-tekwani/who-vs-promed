Ex-Katanga: 428 dead of measles since January 2015
-----------------------------------------------------
30 000 cases of measles were reported, of which there were 428 deaths since January 2015 in the province of the former Katanga. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) that delivered this information Friday, 16 Oct 2015, reported that in the space of 3 months, the number of affected health zones has more than doubled, from 11 at the end of May 2015 to 26 at the end of September 2015.

In the 1st week of October [2015], the former Katanga recorded nearly 30 000 cases of measles since January [2015], 80 percent of the cases throughout the country. 428 people died. Compared to the previous year [2014] where the province reported approximately 10 000 cases in the same period, the number of cases has almost tripled in 2015, according to the OCHA report.

Several suspected measles cases are registered in more than half of the 11 health zones of Lubumbashi, even if the outbreak is confirmed so far only in a health zone, said the same report. Of the 24 health zones for outbreaks reported in the province, 8 have already received support.

OCHA invites the authorities of the province and the health stakeholders to review the health system to effectively fight against this epidemic by offering including access to basic health care, the regularity of vaccination, access to drinking water.

[Measles, a viral disease preventable by vaccination, continues to be a major public health problem. Yet there is an effective vaccine available, well tolerated and available for free, against the disease. Measles is even about to become endemic in our countries because the disease is found in all periods of the year. Previously, it was an epidemic disease occurring during the cold and dry season when a hot, dry wind (called harmattan) flows and disappearing during the rainy season, like meningitis. To overcome this disease, you need a high rate of vaccine coverage. To achieve high vaccine coverage requires a broad awareness of populations to vaccinate children, who are most affected. But the disease can even affect adults who are not vaccinated.

10 Die Of Measles in IDP Camps
------------------------------
The Executive Secretary of FCT Primary Health Care Board, Dr Rilwan Mohammed has disclosed that 10 children at Wasa IDP camp [Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (FCT)] died as a result of measles outbreak last week.

He gave the disclosure on Friday [20 Nov 2015] in Abuja during the flag off of the Measles Immunisation campaign in 19 northern states, including FCT.

Rilwanu added that as a result of this measles outbreak, which affected about 41 children, the FCT Health Board is targeting 900 000 children, including children in the Internally Displaced Camps where a lot of children may have been missed out because of insurgency.

Also in his remarks, the Minister of Health, Prof Issac Adewole pledged that government would take the measles campaign to the door steps of all Nigerians irrespective of their place of residence in the country.

He said that the present administration is also determined to take health care to the estimated 65 per cent of Nigerians who live in the rural areas through its change agenda.

He said, "we are determined to eliminate measles from Nigeria by 2030. The flag-off is in the urban area but as expected this administration is committed to be taking to the doorstep of every Nigerian."

"We want to reach out to people in the rural areas to strengthen coverage of health care to everybody that's why we said the Universal Health Coverage should be even in Primary Health Care level and we will target every Nigerian irrespective of where they live. The target is to take it right to your doorstep'', he emphasised.

Meanwhile, the WHO Country Representative, Dr. Ruiz Vas, who was represented by Dr. Fiona Braka noted that measles remains a highly infectious disease which leads to significant deaths among children in developing countries.

"At the September 2010 African ministers of health regional committee session the minsters in the African region adopted a goal to eliminate measles by 2020. The resolution called on all members in Africa to develop strategic plan towards measles elimination and to mobilise the necessary resources need to implement those plans."

"The strategies for measles elimination include high routine vaccination coverage at the sub national level at over 80 percent at every sub national locality. It includes at least achieving 90 percent coverage with supplemental vaccination campaign and at sensitive faith based surveillance in the states."

The efforts in the African region have resulted in over 90% reduction in measles burdens compared to 2000 estimates, however we continue to experience measles outbreak that pose a real challenge to us at achieving our elimination efforts at the region and in the country as a whole.

Braka hinted that WHO recommends that every child should receive at least 2 doses of measles vaccine adding that Nigeria and many countries have reached many children through mass vaccination campaigns.

She noted that measles vaccination combined with mass immunisation campaign with high death burden are key health strategies which helps to reduce global measles deaths, adding that strengthening and maintaining progress in reducing measles cases requires strengthening health systems so that they can provide sustained effective routine immunisation.

The Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Ado Mohammed, said that the measles campaign is going beyond primary health care institutions because government has made provision for immunisation in out-reach places such as market places, churches, mosques, transit points and high density populated communities. The position this time is very comprehensive and we are determined to reach 85 percent coverage, Ado added.

The 5-day measles campaign, which starts today [20 Nov 2015], is targeted at children from the ages of 6 months to 5 years.

Nigeria: Kebbi Records 392 Cases of Measles
-------------------------------------------
Acting Chairman of the Kebbi State Primary Health Care Development Agency (PHCDA), Alhaji Faruku Wakili, said Monday [16 Nov 2015] that the state recorded 329 cases of measles.

He said this during the flag-off of an awareness programme on measles by wife of the governor, Dr. Zainab Atiku Bagudu.

"States and the federal government initiated measles sensitization campaign due to number of reported cases. Three persons out of the 329 victims died and the local governments that were seriously affected include; Jega,Koko-Besse, Shanga and Bagudo," he said.

Wakili said the campaign would last for 4 days and urged the public to cooperate with health workers.

Wife of the governor said the state government paid N100 million as counterpart fund to the EUMCH/UNICEF project as part of efforts to tackle such diseases.

She described measles as a highly infectious disease.

"In the North-western part of Nigeria, where Kebbi State belongs, many people are still dying from measles," she said.

Nigeria: SMC Winds Up, As Katsina Ranks High in Measles Deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------
About 500 000 children in 4 local government areas of Katsina State have undergone the Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) initiative aimed at addressing the scourge of malaria.

The local governments areas are Mashi, Baure, Dutsi and Maiadua. SMC was adopted to combat malaria in the Sahelian states of Nigeria where about 11 million children are believed to be at risk of malaria.

The project involves the intermittent administration of full doses of malaria vaccines to children between 3-59 months of age.

The state's Director of Malaria and Sickle Cell disease Control, Dr Shamsudeen Yahaya, who was speaking at the end of project dissemination of SMC, said that prior to the initiative Katsina was among the states with high burden of the disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality, adding that a recent study has shown that the intervention has drastically reduced death from malaria in children.

He called for concerted efforts towards sustaining the achievement recorded so far and equally stressed the need for extension to other local government areas.

In a related development, About 203 children have so far died in the last 44 weeks from measles in Katsina, Dr. Umole Elfrida has said.

Speaking at a one day sensitization meeting for stakeholders ahead of the nationwide measles campaign next week, Umole said the deaths is out of the total 2781 measles cases reported across the state.

According to her, this calls for concerted efforts towards ensuring that the vulnerable children are immunized to build immunity, noting that these figures ranked the state as the highest in the country.

WHO to examine suspected measles patients in Guna
-------------------------------------------------
A World Health Organisation (WHO) team will examine suspected measles patients in 2 villages -- Chhoti Kanthi and Badi Kanthi -- of Madhya Pradesh's Guna district where 11 children were found to be suffering from the disease 5 days back. Disease Monitoring Committee's District Incharge Satyendra Singh Raghuvanshi said that 7 children in Chhoti Kanthi village and 4 in Badi Kanthi village have been detected to be suffering from measles. All the children are aged between 2-12 years. A report has been sent to the states Health Directorate. Samples would be collected in the presence of WHO officials and sent for examination. On the reports arrival, the Health Department would chalk out strategy for vaccination. Chief Medical and Health Officer Sarojini Jevek said that all the children are stable, The WHO collects sample when more than 5 cases come up so that measures could be taken to contain the disease from spreading. Presently, all the cases have been classified under suspected category and would be confirmed only after examination.

http://naija247news.com/2015/11/17-1-million-lives-saved-due-to-sustained-measles-vaccination-who/


The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for sustained measles vaccination as reports had shown that the number of measles-related deaths had decreased largely due to increased vaccination.

The world health body made the call in a new data it released for the Measles and Rubella Initiative on [Fri 13 Nov 2015].

The data showed that the number of measles-related deaths had decreased by 79 per cent from 546 800 at the beginning of the century to 114 900 in 2014.

It estimated that 17.1 million lives had been saved since 2000, largely due to increased vaccination coverage against the highly-contagious viral disease.

However, the new data showed that overall progress toward increasing global immunisation coverage had recently stagnated.

It noted that while coverage with the 1st dose of the measles vaccine increased globally from 72 per cent to 85 per cent between 2000 and 2010, it remained unchanged in the past 4 years.

The data quoted Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, the Director of WHO's Department of Immunisation, Vaccines and Biologicals, as saying "we cannot afford to drop our guard.

"If children miss routine vaccination and are not reached by national immunisation campaigns, we will not close the immunisation gap.

"Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the 2015 global milestones and measles elimination goals set by WHO member states will not be achieved on time."

The report said that all countries included at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine in their routine vaccination schedule.

However, only 122, about 63 per cent had met the target of at least 90 per cent of children vaccinated with a 1st dose.

The report also said only half of the world's children were receiving the recommended 2nd dose of the vaccine.

It added that measles was highly infectious and strong and sustained efforts were needed to maintain the current level of control. This would require some actions such as changes in policies and practices in high-burden countries, vaccination and surveillance efforts to be funded, maintained and strengthened.

The report also quoted Dr Seth Berkley, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said "a coordinated approach that puts stronger routine immunisation at its core will be central to getting measles under control.

"It will also secure further reductions in mortality from this vaccine-preventable disease."

According to the world body, measles is a highly contagious viral disease, which affects mostly children and is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.

It said "initial symptoms, which usually appear between 10 and 12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards and there is no specific treatment for measles; most people recover within 2 to 3 weeks. However, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, pneumonia, and death.

"Measles vaccination has played a key role in reducing child mortality and in progress toward Millennium Development Goal 4," the WHO said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that an estimated 17.1 million people have been saved from the measles virus since 1990 due to increased vaccination efforts, they announced on [Thu 12 Nov 2015].

Despite this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO have reported that progress toward total immunization has stalled during the past 4 years. Between 2000 and 2010, measles vaccine coverage increased to 85 percent.

"We cannot afford to drop our guard," Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, WHO's director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said. "If children miss routine vaccination and are not reached by national immunization campaigns, we will not close the immunization gap."

The WHO reports that global milestone and measles elimination goals will likely not be achieved on time considering current trends.

Primary challenges to meeting global targets for vaccination remain in the form of gaps in vaccination programs that lead to outbreaks of the disease. In 2014 these occurred in China, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. The Americas and the Western Pacific also saw increased measles cases in 2014. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, played a role in large-scale campaigns in high-risk countries that has improved the control of the disease, including the Congo and Pakistan.

Despite this, Robert Linkins, CDC's Accelerated Disease Control and Surveillance Branch chief, said approximately 100 000 children succumb to measles each year.

[Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the mucous membranes, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/measles/en/).

Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on reducing measles deaths. During 2000-2014, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 17.1 million deaths. Global measles deaths have decreased by 79 percent from an estimated 546 800 in 2000 to 114 900 in 2014. The benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented.

The 1st 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the US prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17 400 cases of mental retardation, and 5200 deaths [Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Stetler HC, et al: Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States. Pediatrics 76(4): 524-32. PMID 3931045; abstract available at http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/76/4/524.]

During 1999-2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Progress in reducing global measles deaths, 1999-2004. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 55(9): 247-9. PMID 16528234; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a8.htm]. The vaccine for measles has led to the near-complete elimination of the disease in the United States and other developed countries [Martin D: Dr Thomas C Peebles, who identified measles virus, dies at 89." The New York Times, 4 Aug 2010; available at http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/health/05peebles.html].

Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death. Unvaccinated pregnant women are also at risk. Any non-immune person (who has not been vaccinated or was vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected.

Measles is still common in many developing countries -- particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. The overwhelming majority (more than 95 percent) of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures.

Measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict. Damage to health infrastructure and health services interrupts routine immunization, and overcrowding in residential camps greatly increases the risk of infection.

There are various factors that can be held responsible for increasing outbreaks of measles, despite global efforts for better vaccination coverage:
- the rates of vaccine refusal have increased, owing to many factors;
- the vaccine efficacy, even with 99 percent coverage, is only 85 percent [Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC health information for international travel. The Yellow Book; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-home-2014];
- issues of cold chain maintenance in temperate and tropical regions;
- administration route; recent recommendation of 2 doses as opposed to one previously;
- increasing problems of malnutrition in various effected regions.
