[7] Treatment: preventing COVID-19-induced pneumonia with anticytokine therapy

--------------
Immune-mediated disorders are a group of disabling conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. These pathologies include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Each of these diseases has a unique epidemiology and pathophysiology, despite sharing several pathways of tissue damage, which rely on an excessive cytokine response. Indeed, cytokine blockers, such as infliximab, adalimumab (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), and ustekinumab (anti-interleukin [IL]-12/IL-23 [p40 subunit]), used for the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, are used with success for inducing and maintaining remission. Unfortunately, however, the use of these therapies enhances the risk of bacterial and viral infections, and of viral reactivation in cases with previous viral infection.

With the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the increasing incidence of associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in countries where immune-mediated disorders are frequent, the use of these drugs poses major challenges for clinicians. Studies so far suggest that most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms, but approximately 15-20% of patients develop severe respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock. The treatment of these critically ill patients is particularly difficult, as no specific antiviral drug or vaccine is currently recommended.

Morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 are highest in the elderly and among people with comorbidities. Individuals with comorbidities could theoretically include patients with immune-mediated disorders taking cytokine blockers, as these drugs inhibit the function of molecules involved in the host defence against pathogens. Surprisingly, however, no increase of SARS-CoV-2-driven pneumonia has been documented in such patients so far. Therefore, the question arises as to whether patients with immune-mediated disorders on cytokine inhibitors represent a privileged group who are resistant to COVID-19 disease. Analysis of the cytokine profile characterising severe cases of COVID-19 suggests this assumption might be the case.

SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia is marked by hyperactivation of effector T cells and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6.
This reaction, known as a cytokine storm, was initially described as a life-threatening complication in patients receiving antibody-based immune therapy. In addition to IL-6, other cytokines (i.e, IL-1, TNF, and interferon-γ), which are produced during the cytokine storm, contribute to the pathological process that leads to plasma leakage, vascular permeability, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the case of viral infection, these events increase dissemination of the virus, thus providing a metabolic milieu in which a fatal outcome might result. In line with these events, blockade of IL-6 function with a monoclonal antibody against its receptor (eg, tocilizumab) is useful for the initial treatment of patients with a so-called cytokine storm, and preliminary evidence suggests that such a therapy can help to prevent the detrimental inflammatory response in some cases of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia (unpublished).

Most cytokines secreted during a cytokine storm and in COVID-19 are also produced in high amounts during exacerbations of immune-mediated disorders, and represent major therapeutic targets. We speculate that patients with immune-mediated disorders taking IL-6 inhibitors, or compounds that suppress immune pathways leading to IL-6 production or mediation of IL-6 signaling, might be somewhat protected against SARS-CoV-2-driven pneumonia. Although we are waiting for direct data in support of this hypothesis, clinicians should advise patients with immune-mediated disorders about the necessity to stay on their treatment with cytokine blockers, and patients with immune-mediated disorders should stay on medication unless discussed with their doctor. In addition, clinicians should stress that such treatments do not confer protection against infection, and therefore patients with immune-mediated disorders should adopt self-isolating behaviour designed to prevent social contact and the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

[8] Maintaining HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic
Date: Mon 6 Apr 2020

Comment
-------
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world since the 1st reports from Wuhan in China in December 2019, and the outbreak was characterised as a pandemic by WHO on [12 Mar 2020]. Approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV are at risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Although some international institutions, in collaboration with governments and community partners, are working to sustain HIV service provision for people living with HIV, the COVID-19 pandemic presents several barriers and challenges to the HIV care continuum.

First, implementation of quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures have reduced access to routine HIV testing, which challenges completion of UNAIDS' first 90-90-90 target globally, that 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. HIV testing is the vital 1st step towards initiation into the HIV care continuum. Even with availability of HIV self-testing kits in some areas, testing remains a big challenge in settings with scarce access to these kits. Therefore, increased efforts are needed to augment access and to facilitate testing.

Second, timely linkage to HIV care could be hindered during the COVID-19 pandemic. People living with HIV who should have initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in hospital might be deterred or delayed because hospitals are busy treating patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, because many public health authorities globally are focused on COVID-19 control, allocation of resources for HIV care could be diminished, and circumstances surrounding the HIV care continuum could worsen.

Third, the COVID-19 pandemic might also hinder ART continuation. Hospital visits could be restricted because of implementation of city lockdowns or traffic controls. UNAIDS and the BaiHuaLin alliance of people living with HIV, with support of the Chinese National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, did a survey among people living with HIV in China in February, 2020. Among this population, 32.6% were at risk of ART discontinuation and about 48.6% did not know where to get antiviral drugs in the near future. People living with HIV who are faced with ART discontinuation not only could undergo physical health deterioration but also might suffer great psychological pressure.

In response to these challenges, WHO, UNAIDS, and the Global Network of People Living With HIV are working together to ensure continued provision of HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services. The Chinese National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention issued a notice guaranteeing free antiviral drugs for selected treatment management agencies in China, and released a list of ART clinics. People living with HIV can refill antiviral drugs either at the nearest local Center for Disease Control and Prevention or by post, to maintain enrolment in treatment programmes and to continue ART. Hospitals in Thailand are to dispense antiviral drugs in 3-6-month doses to meet the needs of people living with HIV and reduce facility visits. The US Department of Health and Human Services released interim guidance for COVID-19 and people living with HIV on [20 Mar 2020], which emphasised that people living with HIV should maintain at least a 30-day supply and ideally a 90-day supply of ART and all other drugs, by mail-order delivery if possible.

Community-based organisations have also played an important part in maintaining HIV services. UNAIDS is working with the BaiHuaLin alliance of people living with HIV and other community partners to reach and help those who will run out of antiviral drugs in the near future. Since the lock down of Wuhan on [23 Jan 2020], a community-based organisation (Wuhan TongZhi Center) has dedicated resources to ensure the supply of antiviral drugs and opened a hotline to provide consultations. As of [31 Mar 2020], this organisation has had more than 5500 consultations with people living with HIV and has helped more than 2664 individuals obtain antiviral drugs. The Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre set up a visible platform outside their anonymous clinic with a screening system for every client, providing HIV testing and prevention supplies (eg, condoms, postexposure prophylaxis, and pre-exposure prophylaxis).

As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, many locations are facing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and barriers and challenges for maintaining the HIV care continuum. The situation could be worse in places with weak health-care systems. We recommend that governments, community-based organisations, and international partners should work together to maintain the HIV care continuum during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular efforts made to ensure timely access to, and to avoid disruption of, routine HIV services.
