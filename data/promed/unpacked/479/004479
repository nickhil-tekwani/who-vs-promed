UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - NEPAL (SANKHUWASABHA) (03): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Dear ProMED-mail Editors,
As you correctly indicated, it is definitely hazardous to do an armchair
diagnosis. I was somewhat disturbed to see some responses, such as
ergotism. The symptoms described clearly indicate a febrile illness for a
couple of weeks followed by diarrhea and death. This clinical picture is
typical of typhoid fever, which is rampant in Nepal. Japanese encephalitis
is unlikely in high mountains, where mosquitoes virtually do not exist.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Koirala for the above comments. Rather
than have continued speculations on the possible etiologies of the outbreak
posted on 30 Jul 2006, ProMED-mail would very much appreciate it if we
could receive official information on results of investigations into this
outbreak. Perhaps we have subscribers from either the Ministry of Health,
International assistance agencies -- governmental or non-governmental -- or
other international organizations that have personnel in situ in Nepal. -
