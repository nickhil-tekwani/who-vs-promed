Re: Chronic wasting disease in Colorado and Wyoming
Apparently a recent (and somewhat sensationalized) media report [WASTING
DISEASE Jan. 24 /98 AP MARTHA BELLISLE was referred to Mike for informed
comment. MHJ has once again focussed attention on our ongoing studies of
chronic wasting disease (CWD) in native deer and elk. Although sample
collections have been completed, some laboratory analyses remain in
progress.
To date over 2,500 samples from Colorado and over 380 from Wyoming have
been collected and examined since September 1997. The results of our most
recent surveys have been neither alarming nor surprising. As reported
previously, CWD is endemic in northeastern Colorado and southeastern
Wyoming. In Colorado, the main focus is in the eastern half of Larimer
County, where about 5% of the deer examined in 1997 tested positive for CWD
via immunohistochemistry; IHC-based prevalence rates in this area have
remained essentially unchanged over the last 3 yrs. CWD appears to be
considerably less common in sympatric elk populations, where far fewer than
1% of the animals examined in 1997 tested positive. Results of surveys in
southeastern Wyoming are similar to those in Colorado. We plan to continue
using targeted surveillance to monitor CWD distribution in Colorado and
Wyoming, and we've planned additional annual surveys in both states to
estimate and monitor changes in prevalence in endemic areas.
As with other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a variety
of other research projects are also underway to enhance understanding of
the pathogenesis, diagnosis, epidemiology, and potential host range of CWD.
Scientists from the University of Wyoming, Colorado State University,
Creighton University, the Colorado Division of Wildlife, the Wyoming Game
and Fish Department, USDA's Agricultural Research Services and
APHIS/Veterinary Services, the National Institutes of Health, and the
Institute for Animal Health's Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh,
Scotland, are collaborating on numerous studies designed to address
specific facets of the foregoing, as well as to complement existing and
emerging knowledge about other animal and human TSEs. Results of these
studies, along with those of our aforementioned surveillance work, will be
submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals for publication upon
completion.

This morning's Fort Collins Coloradoan had a short report (Sports Section)
on CWD. Said: The Colo. Div. Wildlife found 5% of deer heads turned in at
Larimer County have been diagnosed with CWD. About 1% of deer from eastern
plains units where heads were turned in were positive. <1% of elk heads
were positive. The percentages were about the same for deer and elk as last
year. Also, due to low prevalence in elk the past 2 years, hunters will no
longer be required to turn in elk heads.
