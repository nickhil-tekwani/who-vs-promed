With last year [2014] being the 3rd hottest since 1910 and 2013 dubbed the country's hottest year on record according to the Bureau of Meteorology, creepy crawlies normally found in tropical Queensland are breeding in Sydney and sticking around for the winter.

Tropical huntsman spiders and saltmarsh and yellow fever mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_] are just some of the species from the north that are now calling Sydney home.

"The migration in part is the warm winds which come from the north, northeast, and occasionally northwest, which tend to blow insects and arachnids down here," Australian Museum naturalist Martyn Robinson said. "In the past, they would survive while the weather is warm before dying in the winter. Now they are not dying out. They are maintaining their populations further south than they have ever been recorded."

Mr Robinson said there is concern that Queensland's yellow fever mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_; yellow fever virus is not present in Australia] could become "a major problem in Sydney, as it is a carrier of dengue fever as well as Ross River fever and Murray Valley encephalitis."

The invaders:
Yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_: found near human environments, often biting indoors or in sheltered areas. Biting is predominantly by day in shaded areas but may also occur early in the night.

Saltmarsh mosquito, _Aedes vigilax_: a mainstay of subtropical Queensland, this species carries viruses including arbovirus disease. They are common in wetlands and responsible for 4000-8000 cases of Ross River virus [infection] every year [Ross River virus infections have occurred in various localities in Australia, not just in Queensland. - Mod.TY]

[The spread of _Ae. aegypti_ and salt marsh mosquitoes is of particular concern. _Ae. aegypti_ has been responsible for small dengue outbreaks in northern Queensland (the Cairns area) in recent years. The virus is introduced from other [foreign] dengue endemic localities by viremic travelers, with ongoing transmission in Queensland.

As the report above mentions, salt marsh mosquitoes transmit Ross River virus, also a human pathogen.

How far south these mosquito vectors will go and become established in coastal areas remains to be seen as ambient temperatures continue to rise. Surveillance is needed to determine any changes in geographic distribution in Australia.
