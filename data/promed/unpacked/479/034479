The coronavirus variant that drove India's devastating COVID-19 epidemic is the most infectious to emerge so far. Doctors now want to know if it's also more severe. Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in COVID patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called Delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the now-dominant strain carries a higher risk of hospitalization.

Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past 6 months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the U.S. A spike in infections, fueled by the Delta variant, has put pressure on the U.K. government to reconsider its plans of reopening later this month [June 2021]. Higher rates of transmission compared with other variants, and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines, have made understanding the strain's effects especially critical.

"We need more scientific research to analyze if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not," said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India's largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more COVID-19 patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the epidemic.

"Last year [2020], we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed," Ghafur said. "This virus has become so, so unpredictable." Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments COVID-19 patients are experiencing, according to 6 doctors treating patients across India. Beta and Gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil respectively have shown little or no evidence of producing different clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from University of New South Wales last month.

Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated 8 patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past 2 months. As many as 2 required amputations of fingers or a foot. "I saw 3-to-4 cases the whole of last year [2020], and now it's one patient a week," Manudhane said.

India has reported 18.6 million COVID-19 cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year [2020]. The Delta variant was the "primary cause" behind the country's deadlier 2nd wave and is 50% more contagious than the Alpha strain that was first spotted in the U.K., according to a recent study by an Indian government panel.

The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare COVID-19 complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he's seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.

"We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant," he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don't. Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom, local media have reported.

As the 2nd wave of COVID-19 recedes, nearly a dozen cases of COVID-induced intestinal clots and gangrene have been reported in Mumbai. According to doctors, if the gangrene is left untreated for 24 hours, the chances of survival drop to 50%.

Some COVID patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital. "Every person is showing different symptoms" in the 2nd wave, she said.

The unusual presentations for Delta and a closely related variant known as Kappa, whose spread led to a 4th lockdown in Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. "In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations," she said.

The most alarming aspect of the current epidemic in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a pediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad. Apollo's Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with COVID symptoms, instead of the individuals that dominated last year [2020], reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the Delta variant.

Cases of Mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8800 COVID patients and survivors as of [22 May 2021], forcing local health care authorities to call it an epidemic. Even as India's outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to about a quarter of the [7 May 2021] peak -- Delta has sparked outbreaks elsewhere, including virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, bolstering calls for mass immunization.

But with emerging evidence Delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones. "New vaccines have to prepared with new variants in mind," said Ghafur. "We can't get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it."

[2] Severe COVID-19 in children

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/underlying-illness-respiratory-infection-raise-risk-severe-COVID-kids


Of 2 new studies on severe COVID-19 in children, the first finds that more than one in 4 had an underlying medical condition, and the 2nd shows that kids diagnosed as having acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) were over twice as likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation.

Type 1 diabetes, obesity, heart problems
----------------------------------------
In the first study, published today in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which houses data from 872 hospitals, to study 43 465 patients 18 and younger who visited an emergency department or were hospitalized for severe COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2021. [Kompaniyets L, Agathis NT, Nelson JM, et al. Underlying Medical Conditions Associated With Severe COVID-19 Illness Among Children. JAMA Netw Open. 2021;4(6):e2111182. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11182]

They found that 28.7% of all COVID-19 patients had at least one chronic condition, the most common of which were asthma (10.2%), neurodevelopmental disorders (3.9%), anxiety and fear-related conditions (3.2%), depression (2.8%), and obesity (2.5%). Underlying illness were identified in 62.9% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The strongest risk factors for hospitalization included type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60) and obesity (aRR, 3.07), while type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38) and cardiac and circulatory congenital disorders (aRR, 1.72) were the strongest risks for severe illness.

Prioritizing public health, vaccination efforts
-----------------------------------------------
Among children younger than 2 years, prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease (aRR, 1.83). Chronic and complex chronic illnesses were risk factors for hospitalization (aRRs, 2.91 and 7.86, respectively) and serious illness (aRRs,1.95 and 2.86).

Chronic conditions tied to a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization of children of any age were epilepsy and/or convulsions (aRR, 1.97); dependence on medical support, such as a feeding tube (aRR, 1.96); trauma and stress-related disorders (aRR, 1.82); neurodevelopmental disorders (aRR, 1.64); type 2 diabetes (aRR, 1.59); depression (aRR, 1.58); essential high blood pressure (aRR, 1.51); anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR, 1.47); and asthma (aRR, 1.23).

Among the 4302 children admitted to a hospital with COVID-19, risk intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death was highest in those with type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38), cardiac and circulatory congenital disorders (aRR, 1.72), and epilepsy and/or convulsions (aRR, 1.71).

Other conditions linked to higher risk of poor outcomes included obesity (aRR, 1.42); essential high blood pressure (aRR, 1.39); sleep disorders such as sleep apnea (aRR, 1.26); and dependence on medical support (aRR, 1.25). Of all COVID-19 patients, 29.6% were admitted to the ICU, 9.9% were hospitalized, 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 0.9% died. Median patient age was 12 years (range, 4 to 16), 52.8% were female, 33.0% were Hispanic or Latino, and 24.1% were Black.

The researchers said that public health mitigation efforts and vaccine prioritization should be considered for children with chronic underlying diseases. "Health care practitioners can consider the potential need for cautious clinical management of children with these conditions and COVID-19," they concluded. "Further epidemiologic investigation could provide insight into the causal pathways underlying our findings and identify other factors that place children at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness."

Death, need for mechanical ventilation
--------------------------------------
In a letter to the editor late last week in the Journal of Infection, Vivian Botelho Lorenzo, MD, and Cristiana Nascimento-Carvalho, MD, PhD, both of the Federal University of Bahia School of Medicine in Salvador, Brazil, described a retrospective study of 210 children younger than 17 years admitted to a pediatric ICU with severe ALRI from April 2020 to April 2021. The median age was 2.8 years. [Lorenzo VB and Nascimento-Carvalho C. Differences between children with severe acute lower respiratory infection with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection. Published: 3 Jun 2021DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016 /j.jinf. 2021. 05.038]

Of the 210 ALRI patients, 29.5% tested positive for COVID-19, 15.7% needed mechanical ventilation, and 3.8% died. COVID-19 patients were more likely than their peers to need mechanical ventilation (25.8% vs 11.5%) and to died (8.1% vs 2.0%). Boys and patients with sickle cell disease were more likely than others to test positive for COVID-19 (67.7% vs 52.7%; 6.5% vs 0%).

Among all patients, the most common ALRI symptoms were shortness of breath (98.1%), cough (68.6%), and fever (57.6%), while the most common signs were oxygen concentration below 92% (73.3%), needing respiratory support (62.4%), and dehydration (39.5%). The researchers note that wheezing at admission was more likely to be a symptom in those who weren't admitted (21.0% vs 38.5%, respectively).

More than one in 3 patients also had an underlying medical condition (34.3%), the most common of which were chronic lung disease (18.6%), neurological diseases other than epilepsy (7.1%), and epilepsy (5.2%). Also, 3 of the 5 COVID-19 patients who died had an underlying condition, with 2 diagnosed as having cerebral palsy and one having floppy infant syndrome.

The researchers noted that amid the coronavirus pandemic, about 2-thirds of patients were hospitalized with severe ALRIs without COVID-19. "In 2016, 3 years before the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic, ALRI was estimated to cause 652 572 deaths among children younger than 5 years all over the world," they wrote. "Therefore, besides SARS-CoV-2, other causative agents remain causing severe ALRI." The authors said that clinicians should be aware that children with severe ALRI and COVID-19 need mechanical ventilation more often than other patients and that children with sickle cell disease should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/uganda-enters-2nd-COVID-19-lockdown-surges-noted-elsewhere


Amid a worrisome rise in cases in some African nations, Uganda's president yesterday [Sun 6 Jun 2021] reimposed a lockdown as part of an effort to prevent its COVID-19 surge from overwhelming the healthcare system.

In other developments, some countries in Asia continue to battle stubborn spikes, but with some promising developments about vaccine supply.

Cases rise in 8 African nations
--------------------------------
Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office warned of abrupt rises in 8 countries, including Uganda, and urged nations to boost their intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. African countries are also falling behind the global pace of vaccination, given interruptions in the shipment and limited supplies of vaccine through COVAX, the program designed to equitably distribute immunizations on low- and middle-income countries.

Uganda's lockdown is set to last 42 days and includes the closure of schools, open-market shutdowns, suspended church services, and some travel limits, according to Reuters. (https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-06-06/uganda-re-imposes-lockdown-to-beat-back-COVID-19-case-surge)

The country's surge started a month ago and is also affecting younger people. In his address, the country's President Yoweri Museveni called the outbreak "diffuse and sustained," with fatality and critical illness levels that were greater than the country's first wave. He also aired concerns that the surge would top the country hospital capacity and oxygen supply.

Asia hot spot developments
--------------------------
Thailand, which is battling a variant-fueled surge of cases, today launched its mass vaccination campaign that hinges on AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine produced by the country's Siam Bioscience, which has never manufactured vaccines before, according to the Washington Post. Some are concerned the company can't make enough doses to vaccinate about 70 million people, and supply shortages have already led to vaccine appointment cancellations. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/07/coronavirus-COVID-live-updates-us/#link-H2OIB7JQTZGI5EA3NAVO232PG4)

Elsewhere, Taiwan is still reporting record daily numbers of local cases, and on [5 Jun 2021] announced new measures to curb the spread, which include barring migrant workers from moving between factories. Earlier in the pandemic, Taiwan was widely praised for its efforts to keep COVID cases low, but like other locations is now struggling to beat back more transmissible variants.

In a related development, a group of US Senators who recently visited Taiwan announced that the United States will donate 750 000 vaccine doses as part of the Biden administration's plan to donate vaccine to global partners that need them.

Meanwhile, Indonesian health officials have sent more health workers to hospitals on the islands of Java and Madura that are near capacity, according to Reuters. The country, the world 4th most populous, has been bracing for a COVID surge due to the spread of variants, especially following Ramadan holiday travel.

More global headlines
---------------------
- India's prime minister today [Mon 7 Jun 2021] announced that the federal government would take over the vaccination program, which has been partly run by the states, according to Reuters. As part of the change, the vaccine will now be offered free of charge to all adults. (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-reports-100636-new-covid-19-infections-2427-deaths-2021-06-07/)

- Australia's Victoria state, which is experiencing a variant-related outbreak in Melbourne, reported 11 more cases today [Mon 7 Jun 2021], according to Reuters. All are linked to existing cases. The state is in a 2-week circuit-breaker lockdown, which is slated to end [10 Jun 2021]. (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-victoria-reports-biggest-rise-covid-19-cases-week-2021-06-06/)

- G7 countries should support 2-thirds of the USD66 billion cost of providing COVID vaccine to lower- and middle-income countries, a letter signed by more than 100 former world leaders said, according to The Guardian. The letter comes days ahead of a G7 leaders meeting that begins at the end of the week in the United Kingdom, where support for global COVID vaccination is expected to be one of the themes. (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/06/covid-global-leaders-urge-g7-to-help-vaccinate-worlds-poorest)

- The global total topped 173 million over the weekend and is now at 173 378 250 cases, along with 3 730 776 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

[4] Alpha variant
Date: Mon 7 Jun 2021
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/health/covid-alpha-uk-variant.html?searchResultPosition=1


A new study suggests how the variant first identified in Britain hides from the human immune system. Its stealth may be part of its success

In December [2020], British researchers discovered that a new variant was sweeping through their country. When it arrived in other countries, the variant, now known as Alpha, tended to become more common in its new homes as well. By April [2021], it had become the dominant variant in the United States, and it has remained so ever since.

Alpha's swift success has left scientists wondering how the variant conquered the world. A new study points to one secret to its success: Alpha disables the first line of immune defense in our bodies, giving the variant more time to multiply. "It's very impressive," said Dr. Maudry Laurent-Rolle, a physician and virologist at the Yale School of Medicine who was not involved in the new study. "Any successful virus has to get beyond that first defense system. The more successful it is at doing that, the better off the virus is." The report was posted online on [Mon 7 Jun 2021] and has not yet been published in a scientific journal.

Alpha has 23 mutations that set it apart from other coronaviruses. When the variant started to surge in Britain, researchers began inspecting these genetic tweaks to look for explanations as to why it was spreading faster than other variants. A lot of researchers focused their attention on the 9 mutations that alter the so-called spike protein that covers the coronavirus and allows it to invade cells. One of those mutations helps the virus bind more tightly to cells, potentially improving its chances of a successful infection.

But other scientists have focused on how Alpha affects the human immune response. Gregory Towers, a virologist at the University College London, and his colleagues grew coronaviruses in human lung cells, comparing Alpha-infected cells with those infected with earlier variants of the coronavirus. They found that lung cells with Alpha made drastically less interferon, a protein that switches on a host of immune defenses. They also found that in the Alpha cells, the defensive genes normally switched on by interferon were quieter than in cells infected with other variants. Somehow, the immune system's most important alarm bells were barely ringing in the presence of the Alpha variant. "It's making itself more invisible," Dr. Towers said.

To investigate how Alpha achieved this invisibility, the researchers looked at how the coronavirus replicated inside of infected cells. They found that Alpha-infected cells make a lot of extra copies -- some 80 times more than other versions of the virus -- of a gene called Orf9b.

"It's off the chart," said Nevan Krogan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author of the new study. In previous research, Dr. Krogan and his colleagues had found that Orf9b makes a viral protein that locks onto a human protein called Tom70. And it just so happens that Tom70 is essential for a cell's release of interferon in the face of an invading virus.

Putting all of the evidence together, Dr. Krogan and his colleagues argue that the Alpha variant carries a mutation that forces the production of a lot more Orf9b proteins. Those proteins swarm the human Tom70 proteins, dampening the production of interferon and a full immune response. The virus, protected from attack, has better odds of making copies of itself.

An infected cell can gradually remove the Orf9b proteins from its Tom70 molecules, however. By about 12 hours after infection, the alarm system starts coming back online. And because of that immune response, Dr. Towers said, "all hell breaks loose."

Dr. Towers speculated that when the delayed immune response finally happens, people infected with Alpha have a more robust reaction than they would with other variants, coughing and shedding virus-laden mucus from not only their mouths, but also their noses -- making Alpha even better at spreading. "What they're showing makes sense," Dr. Laurent-Rolle said. But she would like to see more lines of evidence in support of their conclusion. For example, the scientists did not run a standard test to measure the number of Orf9b proteins. "That's one thing that could be concerning," she said. Dr. Krogan said he and his colleagues were developing that test now.

Dr. Krogan's team has also started similar experiments on other variants, including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta, and the one first identified in India, known as Delta. The preliminary results surprised them. Both Beta and Delta drive down interferon in infected cells. But there's no sign that they do so by flooding the cells with Orf9b proteins. They may have independently evolved their own tricks for manipulating our immune system. "They're all turning down the immune response in different ways," Dr. Krogan said.

Cecile King, an immunologist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, Australia, who was not involved in the study, said that understanding how the virus was evolving these escapes would help scientists design better vaccines for COVID-19. The current crop of vaccines direct the immune system to recognize spike proteins. But studies on people who recover naturally from COVID-19 have shown that their immune systems learn to recognize other viral proteins, including Orf9b.

A number of researchers are putting together combinations of coronavirus proteins into new vaccines. But they need to take caution, because some of the proteins may actually dampen immunity. "It's quite a tricky enterprise, but becoming more possible as we learn more," Dr. King said.

Abstract
Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the globally successful B.1.1.7 lineage, suggests viral adaptations to host selective pressures resulting in more efficient transmission. Although much effort has focused on Spike adaptation for viral entry and adaptive immune escape, B.1.1.7 mutations outside Spike likely contribute to enhance transmission.

Here we used unbiased abundance proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mRNA sequencing and viral replication assays to show that B.1.1.7 isolates more effectively suppress host innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells. We found that B.1.1.7 isolates have dramatically increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of Orf9b and Orf6, both known innate immune antagonists.

Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70, a mitochondrial protein required for RNA sensing adaptor MAVS activation, and Orf9b binding and activity was regulated via phosphorylation.

We conclude that B.1.1.7 has evolved beyond the Spike coding region to more effectively antagonise host innate immune responses through upregulation of specific subgenomic RNA synthesis and increased protein expression of key innate immune antagonists.

We propose that more effective innate immune antagonism increases the likelihood of successful B.1.1.7 transmission, and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection. - Mod.LK]
