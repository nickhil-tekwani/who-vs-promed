Tomatoes blamed for salmonella outbreak that sickens at least 110 people
-----------------------------------------------
A salmonella outbreak, among at least 110 people who ate deli sandwiches
from a convenience store chain, has been traced to contaminated tomatoes,
officials said Mon 19 Jul 2004. The tomatoes were supplied to the Sheetz
stores by Coronet Foods of Wheeling, WV.
Sheetz, based in Altoona, pulled all tomatoes, and lettuce, from its
300-plus stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia,
and North Carolina, after the salmonella cases were 1st reported one week
ago. The stores sanitized their deli areas, switched suppliers, and brought
in new produce.
An unopened bag of tomatoes from a Sheetz store in Greencastle, about 60
miles southwest of Harrisburg, tested positive for the bacteria, officials
said.
"This test result brings us one step closer to understanding this
outbreak," said Joel Hersh, director of epidemiology at the Pennsylvania
Department of Health. "Government agencies can now begin the process of
finding out how the tomatoes became involved."
Coronet officials did not immediately return a call.
The Food and Drug Administration said at least 57 people in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and West Virginia, who ate at Sheetz convenience stores, were
sickened as of last week [2nd week of July 2004]. State health officials
said, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that 110 people were sickened in Pennsylvania alone.

[Although it is not stated that the organism found in/on the tomatoes was
_S. enteritidis_ serogroup Javiana, the posting certainly implicates
tomatoes as the food vector. The number of cases continues to climb. - Mod.LL]
