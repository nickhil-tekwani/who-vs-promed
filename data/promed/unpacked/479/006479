E. coli Case Update
---------------------
An outbreak of enterohemorrhagic (bloody diarrhea) illnesses caused by _E.
coli_ O157:H7 associated with visits to the North Carolina State Fair
occurred in NC during Oct and Nov 2004. After receiving reports of
hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS, a severe complication of _E. coli_
O157:H7 disease, among State Fair visitors in late Oct 2004, the NC
Division of Public Health recognized the potential for a large outbreak
with potentially hundreds of thousands of fair visitors exposed. Resources
were gathered from within state government as well as the CDC to
investigate the outbreak. The Public Health Command Center was opened for
command, control and communications management of a statewide
outbreak. Early goals included rapidly collecting reports of patients to
gauge the size of the outbreak, and identifying common links between patients.
Reports were received of over 180 patients during initial case finding.
Over half of all case-patients were 5 years old or younger; 2/3s were
younger than 18 years. 15 children with HUS were identified. HUS has a
significant potential for mortality and can leave survivors with lasting
kidney damage. HUS typically develops in approximately 8 percent of all _E.
coli_ O157:H7 cases. The average age of HUS cases in this outbreak was 3
years, with a range of 1 to 13 years. Many case-patients reported fair
visits and contact to animals in petting zoos.
By early Nov 2004, a downward trend in new cases provided some reassurance.
Recognizing the ongoing risk for spread within households or in child care
settings, and by food service workers, public health officials maintained
vigilance and reinforced isolation and hygiene policies. While some
secondary cases did occur, there was not a large secondary outbreak.
Partway through the investigation, the case-definition was redefined to
reflect recognition that most cases had attended the State Fair. Using a
refined case definition which included State Fair attendance, 108 reported
cases were classified as outbreak-related. To more clearly identify the
nature of the exposures, a case-control study was designed to compare cases
to other fair attendees who did not become ill.
Investigators also conducted microbiological testing at various locations
at the fairgrounds to see if _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria were present. The
leading hypothesis was that contact between animals and case-patients at
petting zoos at the fair had led to infection. However, to avoid biasing
the study toward petting zoo exposures, the questionnaire was designed to
include questions about the fair's 2 petting zoos as well as 8 other animal
exhibit areas. We also included questions about foods and beverages such as
undercooked hamburger or fresh apple cider which have well-known
associations with _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks. Questions about other food
and beverage items purchased at the fair were also included. Household
exposures was asked about that might have led to illness as well. Between
Nov 14-21, interviewers enrolled 45 cases and 188 control persons chosen
randomly from a list of persons who purchased tickets to the fair online
who did not become ill after attending the fair. Interviewers selected
controls to match the age distribution of case-patients.
Information from the questionnaires was coded and analyzed using SAS
statistical software. Preliminary analysis showed that 4 animal exhibits at
the State Fair were associated with illness. These exhibits included the
Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo where direct contact with sheep and goats
occurred, the Children's Barnyard, the Graham Building, and the Poultry
Tent. Many activities in the Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo were associated
with illness in the preliminary analysis, while only a few activities were
associated with illness in the other 3 sites. Among children younger than 3
who visited Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo, case-patients were 7.5 times more
likely to have reported contact with manure. Children who became ill were
over 5 times more likely to fall or sit on the ground than children who did
not fall or sit on the ground in the petting zoo.
The Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo had implemented guidelines from a national
group of public health veterinarians to encourage hand hygiene to protect
visitors from illness. Signs and hand sanitizing stations were present. Yet
the information from our interviews indicates that hand hygiene did not
protect against infection. Exposures from direct contact between petting
zoo visitors and animals or manure might have already led to infection
before hand-sanitizer use, or contamination may have occurred in areas that
hand hygiene may not have removed. A very low number of _E. coli_ O157:H7
organisms can cause infection.
Lab results from case-patients and environmental samples supported the
case-control study's findings. Microbiological cultures from case-patients
with _E. coli_ O157:H7 were further tested by a DNA fingerprinting method
called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or PFGE. PFGE testing can give
additional information about unique strains of _E. coli_ O157:H7. Cultures
from 33 case-patients had the same PFGE patterns. Samples obtained from 4
fairground areas grew _E. coli_ O157:H7. These included the Crossroads Farm
Petting Zoo site, the Graham Building, the Sheep and Goat exhibit, and the
State Fair Ark. Investigators obtained more samples from the Crossroads
Farm Petting Zoo site because a high number of the initial samples from
this area were positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. 19 of the 30 samples
obtained during this second sampling grew _E. coli_ O157:H7. Most positive
samples were from areas where people could have direct contact with sheep
and goats. All 19 positive cultures from the Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo
site had the same PFGE patterns seen from the 33 case-patient cultures.
Findings from clinical specimens and environmental lab samples, along with
the case-control study findings, support that most case-patients in this
outbreak became ill after exposure at the Crossroads Farm Petting Zoo Other
case-patients likely became ill after exposures elsewhere at the fair.
In light of this investigation, we recommend restricting direct contact
with animals, reducing fecal contamination, and reducing crowding in
petting zoos in addition to existing recommendations to prevent future _E.
coli_ O157:H7 infections (see <http://www.nasphv.org/83416/84501.html>).
These recommendations are particularly pertinent for young children and
others with reduced immunity to infection. We believe these recommendations
are prudent to implement to protect the health of North Carolinians who
visit petting zoos and our state fairs.
Further analysis of data collected in this investigation may require
revision of these findings and recommendations.
