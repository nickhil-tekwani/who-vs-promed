Lake County [Ohio] has a confirmed human case of La Crosse encephalitis, a viral disease spread to people by the bite of an infected _Aedes triseriatus_ (Eastern tree hole) mosquito.

It's the 3rd case of La Crosse encephalitis in the county in the past 10 years and the 1st since 2014, according to the Lake County General Health District.

The health district stated in a [10 Dec 2019] news release that it was notified of the confirmed case by the Ohio Department of Health.

Tree hole mosquitoes are generally found in woodland/forested environments, including suburban areas, and are rare in open areas, the health district stated. They prefer to lay eggs in pools of water found in tree holes, but will also lay eggs in man-made water-holding containers, particularly discarded tires. Their eggs can live through the winter when located in dry sites, and become active with water in spring. The females most often feed on the blood of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The main hosts for this mosquito are the eastern chipmunk, the gray squirrel, and fox squirrels.

Many people infected have no visible symptoms, according to the health district. Some of those who become ill develop severe neuroinvasive disease (disease that affects the nervous system). Severe disease often involves encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), and can include seizures, coma, and paralysis. Severe disease occurs most often in children under the age of 16.

The health district stated that although the mosquito season has ended in Northeast Ohio, residents can still do their part to control breeding sites for next spring. The department offers the following tips:
- dispose of tin cans, old tires, buckets, unused plastic swimming pools, plastic covers, or other containers that collect and hold water;
- keep roof gutters unclogged; clean gutters in the spring and fall;
- fill or drain puddles, ditches, and swampy areas, and either remove, drain, or fill tree holes and stumps with mortar;
- eliminate seepage from cisterns, cesspools, and septic tanks.
- eliminate standing water around animal watering troughs.

[La Crosse virus encephalitis occurs sporadically in Ohio. This report does not indicate the date when the individual became ill, their age and sex, current condition, or if the individual is hospitalized. Severe neurological cases of La Crosse virus encephalitis mainly occur in pre-school age children. They are seldom fatal, but prolonged hospitalization and sequelae including personality changes may occur.

As noted earlier, La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of south eastern Minnesota/south western Wisconsin/north western Illinois, (2) Ohio, where this case occurred, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee, (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html).

Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal.

As the report above encourages, it is wise to eliminate fresh water catchments, which are breeding sites of _Aedes triseriatus_, the La Crosse virus vector mosquito. The Asian tiger mosquito _A. albopictus_ can also transmit the virus.

The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html.
