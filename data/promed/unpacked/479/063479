USDA probes possible 3rd case of mad cow disease
------------------------------------------------
A 12-year-old animal suspected of having mad cow disease will be retested
by animal health laboratories in Britain and Iowa for confirmation of what
would be America's 3rd case, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on
Wednesday [27 Jul 2005].
Final test results are expected early next week.
USDA Chief Veterinarian John Clifford [see item 2] said the suspect animal,
which was destroyed after having trouble giving birth in April 2005,
produced an inconclusive result in an initial round of testing for the
brain-wasting disease.
"USDA is conducting further testing at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, in consultation with experts from the
international reference laboratory in Weybridge, England," he told reporters.
"We are also sending samples from this animal to the Weybridge laboratory
for further testing. It is important to note that this animal poses no
threat to our food supply because it did not enter the human food or animal
feed chains," Clifford said.
Clifford described the suspect animal as U.S.-born, but refused to identify
where it had lived.
America's 2nd case of mad cow disease -- its 1st in a native animal -- was
confirmed last month. That animal, a 12-year-old Texas cow, tested positive
for the brain wasting disease after initially returning inconclusive results.
The latest case also involves confusion over test procedures.
A local veterinarian who submitted the cow's brain sample to the USDA first
treated it with a preservative, making it impossible to conduct a
sophisticated test known as the western blot, Clifford said. USDA
scientists can still conduct an immunohistochemistry (IHC) test, but they
cannot use the western blot test for a comparison.
In addition, the veterinarian obtained the brain sample in April but did
not send it to the USDA until a few days ago, Clifford said, because he
"simply forgot to send it in."
The U.S. cattle industry said the suspect cow never entered the human food
supply.
"It is important to remember that the U.S. government and the beef industry
have put science-based precautions in place over the past 15 years to
ensure our beef remains safe from BSE," said Terry Stokes, chief executive
of the national Cattlemen's Beef Association.
Meanwhile, the suspect animal's herd has not been quarantined, Clifford said.
"We do not have a hold order on the location at this time. We have not
called this a case of BSE. At the time that we would do that it would be
appropriate for us to put a hold order only for a length of time for us to
look at other animals of interest that may be in that herd."
The 1st case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease
discovered in the United States was in December 2003, in a Washington state
dairy cow imported from Canada. In response, the USDA adopted several new
safeguards including an increase in testing U.S. cattle for the disease, a
ban on using crippled or downer cattle in the human food supply, and a ban
on using the brain, eyes and small intestines of older cattle in human food.
That case prompted major beef trading partners like Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan to close their borders, shutting off billions of dollars worth of
U.S. beef imports.
The latest incidents come as Bush administration officials had started to
make optimistic comments about persuading those countries to start buying
U.S. beef once more.
Clifford said he did not think the new investigation would affect trade
negotiations.
"Japan has had 20 cases of BSE," he said. "We would hope this would not
have any impact on our negotiations. Both our animals were born prior to
the feed ban."
The USDA also recently won its appeal to start imports of live young
Canadian cattle for the 1st time in 2 years, arguing against protests from
ranchers and consumer groups that Canada's safeguards against the disease
were adequate.

Statement by Dr. John Clifford Regarding Non-Definitive BSE Test Results
--------------------------------------------------
Late yesterday, we received non-definitive test results on an animal
sampled as part of a voluntary extension of our enhanced BSE surveillance
program. USDA is conducting further testing at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, in consultation with experts from the
international reference laboratory in Weybridge, England. We are also
sending samples from this animal to the Weybridge laboratory for further
testing. It is important to note that this animal poses no threat to our
food supply because it did not enter the human food or animal feed chains.
The sample was submitted to us by a private veterinarian. As an extension
of our enhanced surveillance program, accredited private veterinarians, who
often visit farms in remote areas, collect samples when warranted. The
sample in question today was taken from a cow that was at least 12 years of
age and experienced complications during calving. The veterinarian treated
the sample with a preservative, which readies it for testing using the
immunohistochemistry (IHC) test -- an internationally recognized
confirmatory test for BSE. Neither the rapid screening test nor the western
blot confirmatory test can be conducted on a sample that has been preserved.
Our laboratory ran the IHC test on the sample and received non-definitive
results that suggest the need for further testing. As we have previously
experienced, it is possible for an IHC test to yield differing results
depending on the "slice" of tissue that is tested. Therefore, scientists at
our laboratory and at Weybridge will run the IHC test on additional
"slices" of tissue from this animal to determine whether or not it was
infected with BSE. We will announce results as soon as they are compiled,
which we expect to occur by next week.
I would note that the sample was taken in April, at which time the
protocols allowed for a preservative to be used (protocols changed in June
2005). The sample was not submitted to us until last week, because the
veterinarian set aside the sample after preserving it and simply forgot to
send it in. On that point, I would like to emphasize that while that time
lag is not optimal, it has no implications in terms of the risk to human
health. The carcass of this animal was destroyed; therefore there is
absolutely no risk to human or animal health from this animal.
Regardless of the outcome of the further testing, I want to emphasize that
human and animal health in the United States are protected by a system of
interlocking safeguards. The most important of these is the ban on
specified risk materials from the food supply and the Food and Drug
Administration's feed ban. And by any measure, the incidence of BSE in this
country is extremely low. Our enhanced surveillance program is designed to
provide information about the level of prevalence of BSE in the United
States. We are extremely gratified that to date, all sectors of the cattle
industry have cooperated in this program by submitting samples from more
than 419 000 animals from the highest risk populations. To date, only one
animal has tested positive for the disease as part of the surveillance
program. These interlocking safeguards continue to protect our food supply.

Commission outlines next steps on BSE
--------------------------------------
The European Commission today [15 Jul 2005] adopted a reflection paper, the
TSE Roadmap, providing an outline of possible future changes to EU measures
on BSE in the short, medium and long-term.
TSEs are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, namely BSE, affecting
cattle and scrapie affecting goats and sheep. Over the past few years,
there has been a significant decrease in the number of positive cases of
BSE detected in the EU, due to the stringent risk reducing measures at the
EU level. In light of this positive trend and new developments in science
and technology, the TSE Roadmap considers possible amendments to certain
BSE measures currently in place while still making food safety and consumer
protection the highest priority.
Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said, "The EU
has made great strides in its battle against BSE and the consistent fall in
the number of cases is testament to the strong, comprehensive EU measures
put in place to tackle this disease. The Commission has at no point stopped
monitoring or reacting to the challenge of BSE, and this Roadmap is a
response to the improved situation and positive developments. Rest assured,
however, that any adaptations made to the BSE measures will not affect in
any way our fundamental objectives of BSE eradication and the protection of
the EU citizen. These have always been, and will continue to be, the first
consideration."
The TSE Roadmap is a reflection paper looking at the next steps that could
be taken with regard to BSE. It provides an overview of possible future
amendments that could be taken on issues such as the removal of Specified
Risk Material (SRM), the feed ban, the culling policy and monitoring
programmes. The Roadmap will be used as a basis for discussion with Member
States, the European Parliament and other stakeholders.
A review of the age limit for the removal of certain SRM may be envisaged
based on data from BSE surveillance and supported by scientific advice [The
current list of SRM for all bovine animals over 12 months includes the
skull, brain, eyes, vertebral column and spinal cord, while the tonsils,
intestines and mesentery of bovine animals of all ages must be removed.
According to the scientific advice, 12 months are to become 21 months. -
Mod.AS]
With regard to the total ban on processed animal protein in feed, which was
introduced in 1994 and extended in 2001, certain measures could also be
reviewed once specific criteria are met and it is scientifically shown that
this would not jeopardise current eradication measures.
The TSE Roadmap considers a review of current regimes for testing animals
for TSE, possibly with a more targeted approach. It also suggests that
alternatives could be sought for the immediate slaughter of the whole
cohort when one case of BSE is detected, to avoid the social and economic
damage of mass culling. In the longer term, the Roadmap proposes that the
situation should be re-examined in light of the new measures introduced in
the short to medium term, and evolving scientific knowledge.

Specialists demand cause investigation by fodder industry
---------------------------------------------------
The "Stock Raising System Society," composed of livestock industry
specialists, the enterprise [?], the administration, and citizens opened
the symposium "BSE and the fodder problem" at the Nippon Veterinary and
Zootechnical College on 11 Jun 2005.
Katsunosuke Mitani, Professor of Hiroshima University Graduate School,
Chairman of this society, reported on the route of infection of mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in cows that were born
in Japan between 1995 and 1996. "The milk replacer/milk substitute that
used animal oil and fat from the Netherlands [contaminated] by the
anomalous prion protein for the raw material might be a cause".
Prof. Mitani criticized the report of the "BSE Epidemiology Examination
Team" of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that denied the milk
substitute infection theory [for its faulty] statistical work.
On the other hand, Prof. Mitani emphasized, "The fodder industry had to
share the information with consumers and to investigate the cause of BSE
infection".
Prof. Mitani points out, "The cause of BSE infection in Japan must have
been an imported raw material in the fodder used when the cows first
infected were calves" [as outlined in the] thesis, "Problem of BSE report
and in the future" presented on that day.
[Mitani went on to explain], "The first [group of cows with] mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was processed between
1999 and 2001. The possibility that those cows polluted the domestic
production raw material for the first time cannot be denied".
As for the milk substitute that had been given to the first infection
group, powdered oils and fats from the Netherlands were used as the raw
material.
The thesis was published in "Stock raising system society report" (No.29)
in June 2005.
