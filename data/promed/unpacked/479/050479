Armenia's Ministry of Health has issued an official statement refuting the report disseminated by one of the local media claiming a cholera outbreak in one of the country's provinces.

Earlier, Ilur.am had published a report suggesting a cholera outbreak in the villages of Oshakan, Voskevaz and Voskehat of the Aragatsotn [Aragacot'n] region.

"Not a single case of cholera has been registered in Armenia since 1998," the ministry said in the statement published on its official website. It added that as many as 54 cases of intestinal infection were registered in the mentioned community on 28-29 Aug 2013. All people with such symptoms were hospitalized and treated, and local health specialists in Aragatsotn visited the households in the communities for inspection purposes and for conducting explanatory work among local residents about prevention of intestinal infections, it added.

Data received as a result of epidemiological examination shows that the contagion was spread because of a one-time contamination of drinking water, said the ministry, adding that on 28 Aug 2013 and during subsequent days, laboratory analyses of drinking water from the communities did not reveal any pathogens.
