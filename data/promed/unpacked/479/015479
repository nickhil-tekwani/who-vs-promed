The Larimer County [Colorado] Department of Health has confirmed the 1st human case in 2015 of tularemia, otherwise known as "rabbit fever". The victim, who lives in northern Larimer County, was infected while planting trees or gardening. Soil can be contaminated by bacteria from the droppings or urine of sick animals and bacteria can enter the skin through tiny cuts or abrasions, according to the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment.

Officials said there's been a recent die-off of rabbits in the neighborhood, which suggests a possible tularemia outbreak among the animals in that area. "These bacteria can persist in the soil or water for weeks, and it takes very few bacteria to cause an infection," Katie O'Donnell said in a news release to the community.

In the summer of 2014, residents in Larimer, Broomfield, Weld and Boulder counties were diagnosed with tularemia.

[Colorado saw 15 human cases of tularemia reported in 2014, 5 times the annual average for the state. Tularemia-related small-mammal die-offs were reported in at least 27 Colorado counties.

The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection are not stated.

Tularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation, as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as acanthamoeba), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of 1 to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza [inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity], and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. - Mod.LL
