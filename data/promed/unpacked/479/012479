[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 46 cases with 1 new death, compared with 17 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (21 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 74 consecutive days. Today's (22 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 16 cases were locally transmitted and 30 were imported. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (6), Daejon (4), Gyeonggi (4), Daegu (1), and Incheon (1). Imported cases were in airport quarantine (26), Gyeonggi (3), and Chungbuk (1). Note that 11 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. That said, it looks as if the proportion of locally acquired cases is decreasing daily, and provinces outside of Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon, and Daejeon have seen little local transmission.

The English language page (current one with the 46 cases reported above, becomes available after I log off) is worth checking. Notice 389 and 390 give updates on the clusters that had additional cases added yesterday 21 Jun 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 720 cases, including 34 657 deaths, up by +218 cases and 23 deaths in the past 24 hours. Our calculation has an increase of +221 newly confirmed cases -- the website mentions Marche has reported 3 additional cases not previously reported which would explain the 3 case discrepancy. The previous day's (21 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +228 cases and 24 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 143 newly confirmed cases, up from 128 the previous day -- possible weekend reporting artifact.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4924_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4924_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (143). Also, 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases), with only 2 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases Emilia-Romagna 22 cases and Bolzano 11 cases). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 49 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 33 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

The spokeswoman of Iran's Health Ministry has confirmed 2573 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], raising the total number of cases to 207 525. In her press briefing on Monday [22 Jun 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 119 people have died of the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 9742.

She said 8 provinces reported zero fatalities and 4 provinces reported only one death during the past 24 hours. The spokeswoman noted that 166 427 patients have so far recovered from the disease, and been discharged from hospital. 2898 patients are also in severe conditions of the disease, she added.

Lari noted that 1 449 420 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

Khuzestan, Hormozgan, East Azerbaijan, and Kermanshah provinces are still considered red zones, and Fars and Kerman provinces are on the verge of reaching that level, Lari added.

[As of 22 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 207 525, including 9742 deaths, an increase of 2573 cases and 119 deaths since 21 Jun 2020. The number of provinces designated as red zones has changed from 7 on 19 and 20 Jun 2020 to 4 provinces since 21 Jun 2020. From the sounds of the media report above, the number of red zone provinces may increase to 6.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a recrudescence (a challenge as to whether to call this a continuance of the 1st wave with transmission never having been interrupted, or to acknowledge there while had been relative control of the outbreak that was lost due to restrictions being lifted too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 388 153, including 122 610 deaths, an increase from 2 356 657 cases and 122 247 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 209 562 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 22 Jun 2020, including 17 636 confirmed deaths and an additional 4682 probable deaths, representing an increase of 249 newly confirmed cases and 40 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, (US military), North Carolina, Ohio, and New York. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
