[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 853 155 with 882 160 (4.4%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 770 995 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 214 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 72 735 cases when compared with the data on 11 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 39 391 (54.2%), France 7722 (10.6%), the UK 5288 (7.3%), Spain for 4979 (6.9%), Turkey for 4789 (6.6%), Italy for 4092 (5.6%), Germany for 3976 (5.5%), France for 2937 (4.0%), Russia for 2186 (3.0%), Germany for 1707 (3.1%), and Iran for 1657 (2.3%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 95.6% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 30.2% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 114 247 deaths have been reported, 110 906 (97.1%) outside mainland China.

The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2, and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey has shown a rapid increase in the number of cases with 4789 cases reported in the last 24 hours. The case numbers in the UK have also been accelerating, reporting 5288 cases in the past 24 hours. - Mod.MPP]

Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 within Austria
---------------------------------------------
Two recent studies have investigated the number of unreported asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 within Austria. The number of undetected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections is expected to be a multiple of the reported figures mainly due to the high ratio of asymptomatic infections and to limited testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using data from testing in Iceland, which offers large scale testing among the general population, the researchers investigated the magnitude and uncertainty of the number of undetected cases of the COVID-19 disease in Austria. The study suggested that the estimated number of infections within Austria to be on average around 9 times higher than the recorded number of infections (95% confidence range: 3.76 to 15.55). Such findings support the need for systematic tests in the general population in order to fully understand the true incidence.

Abstract
--------
The number of undetected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections is expected to be a multiple of the reported figures mainly due to the high ratio of asymptomatic infections and to limited availability of trustworthy testing resources. Relying on the deCODE study in Iceland, which offers large scale testing among the general population, we investigate the magnitude and uncertainty of the number of undetected cases of the COVID-19 disease in Austria. We formulate several scenarios relying on data on the number of COVID-19 cases which have been hospitalized, in intensive care, as well as on the number of deaths and positive tests in Iceland and Austria. We employ frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating the dark figure [asymptomatic infections] in Austria based on the hypothesized scenarios and for accounting for the uncertainty surrounding this figure. Our study contains two main findings: First, we find the estimated number of infections to be on average around 9 times higher than the recorded number of infections. Second, the width of the uncertainty bounds associated with this figure depends highly on the statistical method employed. At a 95% level, lower bounds range from 3.76 to 7.09 and upper bounds range from 10.93 to 15.55. Overall, our findings confirm the need for systematic tests in the general population of Austria.

2. COVID-19 prevalence in Austria. SORA Institute for Social Research and Consulting https://www.csh.ac.at/covid-19-prevalence-in-austria/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the period 1-6 Apr 2020, 1544 randomly selected individuals from across all regions of Austria were sampled and tested for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The study revealed [a prevalence] rate of 0.32% (95% confidence interval 0.12%-0.76%). This number represents the number of infected individuals at the time of sampling and calculated up to the whole population would indicate a total number of between 10 200 und 67 400 infected individuals circulating at the time of sampling (in addition to those infected individuals either in hospital or self-isolating at the time of sampling).

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Austria stands at 13 818 as of [12 Apr 2020] (representing all cases reported in Austria since early March [2020]) and would seem to confirm that the number of asymptomatic individuals within the Austrian population is approximately an order of magnitude higher than are being detected by the targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Andy Bailey for sharing these studies with ProMED. These are both very interesting studies and clearly point to the presence of a significant number of asymptomatic infections in Austria. Not surprising. More and more information is coming out confirming that asymptomatic infections are occurring, and quite possibly playing a significant role in transmission of the virus "under the radarscope". These studies have been using PCRs to identify viral RNA in the study subjects, some probably active viruses, others perhaps residual viral DNA post infection. Viral cultures are necessary to identify live viral particles versus viral debris as the infection is clearing. There have also been numerous reports of "false negative" PCR testing which may be a function of variable virus shedding or a reduced sensitivity of the testing. Challenges in interpretation of PCR results.

It will be interesting to see results of community based serosurveys as a validation of prior infection, and compare results with those estimated through the PCR testing and through modeling of estimates. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 37 276 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 84.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil (4.8%) and Canada (3.5%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 31.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 23.2%, Peru at 11.3%, Chile at 7.5%, and Mexico at 7.1%.

The European region seems to be picking up again, having confirmed 40 849 (47.7% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3672 (58.6%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, up from 39 561 new cases and down from 4352 new deaths from yesterday's update [11 Apr 2020]. The UK reported 21.3% of newly confirmed cases, Spain reported 11.8%, Turkey 12.6%, Italy 11.5%, France 7.6%, and Germany 6.9%. These 6 countries (representing 10% of the European countries) account for 71.7% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1837 new cases representing 49.4%% of the regional newly reported cases. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Pakistan, and Qatar represent 10.3%, 10.1%, 6.7%, and 5.8% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Saudi Arabia represents 20.3% of newly confirmed cases, followed by the UAE at 20.0, Pakistan at 13.3%, and Qatar at 11.5%.

In the African region, Algeria reported 16.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Guinea at 14.4%, Cote d'Ivoire and Niger at 13.7% each, and Ghana at 7.7%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 51.1% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), the Philippines 16.0%, Singapore 13.1%, and the Malaysia 12.7%.

In South East Asia, 4 of the 10 countries reported no new cases in the previous 24 hours. Of the remaining countries, India reported 48.4% of newly reported cases, Indonesia 38.8%, Bangladesh, 10.5% and Thailand 1.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [12 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing and even decreasing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24-hour newly reported case total for the European region was 40 849 today (12 Apr 2020), compared with 37 276 for the Americas region. After a dip the week of 1 Apr 2020 that looked promising, the European region has returned to the higher levels of cumulative cases. My cautious optimism that there might be a seasonality to this virus that would buy us time is tossed out the window with recent events.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
