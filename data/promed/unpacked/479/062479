[Re: ProMED-mail Hepatitis A - Indonesia: (WJ) 20111115.3370]
-------------------------------------------------------------
Concerning the hepatitis A outbreak in Indonesia, people do die from
acute liver failure as a result of that infection, especially those
over the age of 40 years. Molecular epidemiology has been widely and
successfully used in determining the source of the infection and
transmission patterns and this might be of benefit in this situation.

While proper hand-washing is the most critical control measure, in
addition to the avoidance of work practices that facilitate
contamination of hands when taking care of children younger than 2
years, it is important to appreciate that this non-enveloped virus is
highly resistant to detergents as well as organic solvents so that
soap is not an essential ingredient to control and 70 percent ethanol
has limited usefulness (2.25 logs after exposure for 3 minutes and 5.5
logs after 60 minutes).
