The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into Asia,
Europe, and Africa has resulted in enormous impacts on the poultry
industry and presents an important threat to human health. The
pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries
have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed
comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on
phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird
movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the
pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and
predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to
countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were
most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most
(20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds.
Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and
partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is
more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through
infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent
movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than
from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism
between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic
spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models
for disease control.

[2] Global & inter-regional spread
Date: 23 Jan 2007
From: Dany Shoham <shoham_d@netvision.net.il>

While the spread of avian flu viruses from Siberia to Alaska may
expectedly occur through transactions of wandering birds,
transatlantic spread through Greenland should presumably be
considered of paramount importance, because Greenland is actually the
only place worldwide where migrating bird populations regularly and
systematically occupy common territories from May to September every
year. This course has initially been suggested fairly recently in
Medical Hypotheses 67 (6), 1460-1461, 2006, Dany Shoham and Scott O.
Rogers; Greenland as a plausible springboard for trans-Atlantic avian
influenza spread.

HK experts cite "prayer bird" concerns over H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
Hong Kong should tighten imports of wild birds from China, which are
released en masse at Buddhist religious rites, due to the risk they
could spread bird flu to poultry, experts say. Six scaly-breasted
munias -- a popular species of "prayer birds" used for release in
Buddhist rituals to enhance a devotee's karma -- were found dead in a
busy shopping area on New Year's eve, including one which tested
positive for the H5N1 virus.
"We really have to seriously consider this possibility of (prayer
bird) infection," said Malik Peiris, a virologist and leading bird
flu expert at the University of Hong Kong. "In Hong Kong, there is no
H5N1 activity in poultry. So for this bird that was found dead, the
question is how (it) got infected?"
Prayer bird species range from munias, Japanese white-eye,
white-rumped munia and tree sparrows costing as little as HK 4 (USD
0.50) each, to the more expensive azure-winged magpies and Mongolian
larks. Hunters in China use large fine "mist" nets that the birds fly into.
While the Hong Kong government tightly regulates poultry imports,
laws for wild bird imports are much more lax, making it a potential
crack in the city's bird flu defenses. The territory banned imports
of poultry from Japan on Monday [15 Jan 2007] after a fresh outbreak
of bird flu there, the South China Morning Post reported.
Richard Corlett, a professor of ecology at the University of Hong
Kong, said the trade in wild birds was on a much larger scale than
previously thought, with at least half a million birds freed by
Buddhists in 2005, sometimes thousands at a time. "Mongolian larks,
for instance, must have been caught in northern China, trucked down
to Hong Kong then released here in a totally unsuitable environment,
where they promptly die." Mass bird release sites in quiet corners of
Hong Kong's country parks are often littered with discarded empty
bamboo cages and dead bird carcasses, Corlett added.
Hong Kong's concerns come as the European Union passed new laws last
week banning imports of wild birds on health and animal welfare
grounds, a move which Corlett said the Hong Kong government should
follow. "There's a great deal of reluctance to acknowledge this is a
problem ... You can go and buy 10 000 budgerigars and release them in
a country park, and there's nothing to stop you doing that," Corlett said.
Some experts see unregulated imports of wild birds as a serious bird
flu risk. "This speculation or hypothesis is becoming more and more
of a concern. There is more evidence to support this," said Dr. Lo
Wing-lok, an infectious diseases expert and former legislator.
The government has not said whether it would consider a ban on wild
bird imports but has urged Buddhist organizations not to release such
birds in the future.
Hong Kong reported 17 cases of wild birds with H5N1 infection last
year [2006]. The H5N1 virus made its 1st known jump to humans in Hong
Kong in 1997, killing 6 people and leading to a mass culling of poultry.

[A dead crested goshawk was recently diagnosed with H5 virus in Hong Kong:
<http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=36148&sid=11742477&con_type=1>.
This species is very rare in the city, and its appearance probably
reflects its release in a religious ceremony. Where this predator
became infected is a matter of conjecture. The released birds are
highly stressed by capture, transport, and holding before release,
and so likely to have a variety of infections and be more than
usually vulnerable to hawks and other predators.
There are a total of 45 reports on this topic so far. Anyone wishing
