The woman farmer who was confirmed on Tuesday [27 Feb 2007] to be infected
with the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is in critical but stable condition
in hospital. The 44 year old woman is receiving medical treatment in
Jian'ou City Hospital, said Xu Longshan, chief of the Fujian Provincial
Professional Panel for Prevention and Control of Human Infection of Bird
Flu, on Fri 2 Mar 2007. [The patient's] pneumonia symptoms developed
quickly and she went into a coma after being admitted to hospital. A chest
x-ray on 25 Feb 2007 showed large shadows on her lungs.
According to Xu, medical experts have worked out a detailed treatment plan
to save her. As of Thursday evening [1 Mar 2007], her body temperature and
pulse had returned to normal, and her lungs and breathing appeared to be
functioning better. Doctors say the woman is still in critical situation,
however, and they are trying to boost her immunity to prevent further
organic infection. This is the country's 1st human case of bird flu in 7
weeks since China reported on 10 Jan 2007 that a 37 year old farmer in east
China's Anhui Province had contracted bird flu last December [2006] but had
recovered [see report below].
[The patient] is a native of Damiao Village, a marketplace in the
mountainous township of Xiaosong. The farmer, who keeps 5 chickens at her
home, developed symptoms including fever and pneumonia on 18 Feb 2007, and
was confirmed to be infected with the virus by the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention on 27 Feb 2007. [She] is known to have been
in contact with dead poultry.
All live poultry in Damiao Village and its adjacent areas within a 3 km
radius have been culled, and [the victim's] home and adjacent areas have
been properly disinfected, said a local government spokesman. Local markets
for live fowls and processed fowl products in Damiao and its adjacent
regions have been closed until further notice. Local health authorities
said they were closely monitoring people who had had close contacts with
[the patient]. So far, they have showed no symptoms of the disease, they said.
According to the Fujian health authorities, China's Health Ministry has
passed on the information to the World Health Organization, health agencies
in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan province, and other countries. The virus has
killed 14 people in China since 2003.

[2] China, 23rd case (Fujian Province), treatment, use of convalescent serum

The farmer from east China's Anhui Province, who contracted the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu last December [2006] but later [recovered from] the
avian disease, was called in to donate his serum for treatment of another
rural Chinese woman who was confirmed last month [February 2007] to have
been infected by the same virus.
Xu Longshan, spokesman and chief of the Fujian Provincial Professional
Panel for Prevention and Control of Human Infection of Bird Flu, told
Xinhua on Sat 3 Mar 2007 that on Thursday [1 Mar 2007] health workers from
Anhui Province escorted the farmer, to Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province,
where experts from the blood center affiliated to the Fujian Provincial
Bureau of Health obtained serum from him the 2nd day.
[The farmer] has returned home. "The serum was brought to Jian'ou on the
same day, and so far, medical workers have carried out the 1st round of
injections on the woman who was just confirmed as being infected by the
lethal [H5N1] strain of the avian [influenza virus]," said Xu. "The method
is new but is for sure to be of some effect in improving the woman's
capability of fighting against new rounds of infection," said Xu, who
admitted it would take some time before the woman could develop immunity of
her own against the avian disease.
The 44 year old woman is a native of Damiao Village, a marketplace in the
mountainous township of Xiaosong, Fujian Province. The woman, who kept 5
chickens at her home, developed symptoms including fever on 18 Feb 2007.
She had visited village clinics and township hospitals before being
hospitalized on 24 Feb 2007 in the Jian'ou City hospital. She was confirmed
to be infected with the virus by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention on 27 Feb 2007. She is known to have eaten 2 chickens she had
raised, but her husband and son, who also ate the chicken, have not
developed bird flu.
According to Xu, the woman patient was found with inflammation in her left
lung when she came to the hospital on 24 Feb 2007, but her pneumonia
symptoms developed quickly and she went into a coma the next day [25 Feb
2007]. A chest x-ray on 25 Feb 2007 showed large shadows on her lungs. As
of Thursday evening [29 Feb 2007], Li's body temperature and pulse had
returned to normal, and her lungs and breathing appeared to be functioning
better but she was still breathing with the help of a respirator, Xu said.
Doctors say [the patient] is still in critical condition and they are
trying to boost her immunity to prevent further organic infection.
Over 10 doctors and medical experts from local hospitals, and the
Beijing-based Chaoyang Hospital and Ditan Hospital are trying to work out a
detailed treatment plan to save the woman, said Xu Yongxi, head of the
hospital. Policemen and hospital staff have been seen guarding the ward
where the patient is staying and doctors are wearing thick, disinfected suits.
This is the country's 1st human case of bird flu in 7 weeks since China
reported on 10 Jan 2007, that the other victim from Anhui, aged 37, had
contracted bird flu last December [2006] but had recovered. The deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu has killed 14 people in China since 2003.

[The use of human convalescent serum, possibly from an immunologically
unmatched source, is a novel and risky approach in the treatment of avian
influenza. Further information is awaited regarding the outcome of this
treatment and whether other more conventional approaches such as the use of
anti-neuraminidase drugs have been used. - Mod.CP
