The following background information on gonorrhea and gonococcal ophthalmia
in Australia was extracted from the GIDEON software program:
- 10,000 to 20,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported yearly during 1917 to
1929.
- The male/female ratio was 2.4/1.0 in 1991; 2.6/1 in 1992; 1.8/1 in 1996.
- 126 cases of gonococcal ophthalmia (nonvenereal gonococcal
conjunctivitis) were reported during 1917 to 1929. Over 50 cases of
gonococcal ophthalmia were reported most years during 1950 to 1969. 432
cases were reported among Central Australian Aboriginals in 1991; 447 from
Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia during February
to June 1997. 13 cases were confirmed in the Northern Territory and Western
Australia during January to March 1998.
- In 1995, 15.8% of strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were
penicillin-resistant, 8.1% were penicillinase-producing (PPNG), and 1.9%
were quinolone-resistant. In 1996, 16%
were penicillin-resistant, 5.8% PPNG and 2.6% quinolone-resistant.
