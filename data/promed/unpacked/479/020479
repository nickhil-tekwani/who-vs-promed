FDA issues alert on additional recalled stocks of Paramount Farms raw almonds
----------------------------------------------
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is advising
distributors, wholesalers, and consumers that a recall of raw almonds due
to reports of _Salmonella enteriditis_ that was announced by Paramount
Farms, Lost Hills, CA, on 18 May 2004 has expanded.
Before eating any raw almonds having a "best before" date of 21 Aug 2004 or
later, consumers are advised to check with the store where they purchased
the product to see whether the almonds came from Paramount Farms. FDA has
learned that Paramount Farms distributed the recalled almonds in bulk or
packaged nationwide to brokers, distributors and grocery store chains,
which in turn sold the almonds to consumers in various package sizes and
with various brand names. The almonds were also distributed to Mexico,
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, France, England, and Italy.
The almonds have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella
enteriditis_, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal
infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with
weakened immune systems. Healthy people infected with salmonella often
experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result
in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe
illnesses. Consumers who are experiencing symptoms that could be
salmonellosis should consult their health care providers or their local
health department.
Paramount Farms announced a limited recall on 18 May 2004 of whole natural
raw almonds sold under the Kirkland Signature, Trader Joe's and Sunkist
brands. FDA, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state
health and agriculture departments are aware of about 18 reports of
_Salmonella enteriditis_ infection possibly related to the consumption of
the almonds now under recall. FDA continues to work with CDC and state and
local agencies to investigate the source of this outbreak. Individuals who
have purchased the recalled raw almonds should not consume them but instead
return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
The almonds may be sold under other unknown brand names.

Secretary of Health recalls almonds contaminated with salmonella
-----------------------------------
The Secretariat of Health through the Federal Commission for Protection
Against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris) recalled raw almonds under the brand

In a communication, he explained that the product was imported from the
United States and sold in Mexico in the Cosco chain.

of Self-service stores and Department Stores AC (ANTAD), who were informed
of the recall and details of the contaminated product. The recall was made
by the Paramount Farms Company, who produce the Kirkland almonds, in
addition to [almonds] with brand names Trader Joe's and Sunkist. The
company notified the Food and Drug Administration of the United States of
the contamination after they had reports of 7 cases of people infected with
the salmonella bacteria.
