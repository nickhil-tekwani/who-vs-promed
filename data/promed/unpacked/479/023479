Beijing. Jan 08 . Officals and experts in the Disease Control Department
of MOH and National
Flu Center comfirmed that the large-scale flu epidemic of last month in
HUABEI region is
going to ease gradually. According to them, fears that the flu is
moving south are groundless.
An official from Disease Control Department, MOH stressed that his
department is responsible
for the disease surveillance of the country, especially for the disease
epidemic situation.
If flu outbreaks occur, reports from the local health departments will
be sent to his department as
soon as possible, but as yet there are no flu outbreak reports from
southern region of China.
According to the official, there is no possiblility of flu outbreak in
southern China in the
near future.
Dr. Guo Yuanji, chief of the National Flu Centre, indicated that media
have irreponsibly
spread the rumors of flu moving to the south. The reports of flu to his
centre showed
that the HUABEI region flu epidemic is going to ease gradually. The
number of patients in Beijing
hospitals with flu have decreased sharply. Affected universities and big
organizations
have returned to normal. There are no large scale flu outbreak reports
from Jiangsu,
Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong provinces. The rumor of flu moving
south is groundless.
