["Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) is a rhabdovirus infection capable of inducing an acute haemorrhagic and contagious viraemia in several carp species and of some other cyprinid and ictalurid fish species.

"The virus appears to enter the host via the gill. A viraemia follows and the virus rapidly spreads to the liver, kidney, spleen, and alimentary tract. The virus can be detected in faeces and is also shed into the water via faeces and urine.

"During an outbreak of SVC, there will be a noticeable increase in mortality in the population. Diseased fish usually appear darker in colour. Typical clinical signs include exophthalmia, pale gills, haemorrhages on the skin, base of the fins, and the vent, abdominal distension or dropsy, and a protruding vent (anus), often with trailing mucoid faecal casts. All these clinical signs may not be present in individual fish, and they may not all be present in the affected population. Some of these signs may be present in diseases caused by other pathogens. There may be no clinical signs in cases with a sudden onset of mortality.

"For a long time, the geographical range of SVC was limited to countries of the European continent that experience low water temperatures during winter. Consequently, the disease has been recorded from most European countries and from certain of the western Independent States of the former Soviet Union (Belarus, Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine). However, in 1998, the disease was recorded in goldfish in a lake in Brazil, in 2002 it was reported for the 1st time in 2 separate sites in the USA, and it was reported from Canada in 2006. Detection of the virus in carp in China (People's Rep. of) was confirmed in 2004. Confirmation of the isolation of SVCV from rainbow trout and Indian carp in Iran, and from Nile tilapia in Egypt awaits more data, and so the addition of those countries to the geographical range of the virus also awaits those data".
