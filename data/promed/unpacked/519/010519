Diners contract norovirus at Redwood City hotel
-----------------------------------------------
Several health violations were discovered at a Redwood Shores hotel that
may have contributed to a small norovirus outbreak that sickened dozens of
people last week [21-25 Jan 2008], health officials said.

Laboratory tests revealed on Thursday [31 Jan 2008] that 62 people
attending a Redwood City-San Mateo County Chamber of Commerce event at
Hotel Sofitel on 24 Jan 2008 were infected with the highly contagious
virus, said San Mateo County director of environmental health Dean
Peterson. About 200 people attended the annual dinner and awards reception
banquet.

Health officials said those who fell ill contracted the virus through
either the salmon or chicken, which was served as the evening's main
course. Nobody who chose the vegetarian entree fell sick, Peterson said.
Inspectors found evidence that the Sofitel's staff were re-using dirty
towels to wipe down tables, food was being kept too hot or too cold, and a
dishwasher was touching clean dishes directly after touching dirty dishes,
said Peterson, who added that hotel management immediately corrected the
violations.

While the exact method of transmission will probably never be known,
investigators say it's possible the chicken or fish was contaminated either
through someone's hands or through contaminated utensils. "We definitely
know norovirus is killed by high searing heat from pan frying or from an
oven. It may have been contaminated after it was cooked," Peterson said.

Norovirus most often causes symptoms similar to food poisoning 24 to 48
hours after infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The virus is usually gone in a day or 2, and all of the San
Mateo County victims are now on the mend, though dehydration sent several
people to the emergency room, Peterson said.

Among those who fell ill was San Mateo County Supervisor Mark Church, his
legislative aide Randy Torrijos confirmed. Hotel Sofitel's general manager,
Didier de La Ferrier, was also sickened, said Sofitel spokeswoman Janice
Maragakis. De La Ferrier was attending the event as a member of the
chamber. No employees or hotel guests were affected, Maragakis said. Andrew
Berthelsen, legislative aide for Supervisor Rich Gordon, got sick 2 days
after the event. The lab results didn't matter much to him, he said
Thursday [31 Jan 2008]. "It doesn't really help me to know what it was.
It's gone now and I'd rather not think about it," he said.

Maragakis said the Sofitel did not have any previous incidents involving
norovirus. She said the hotel has since been cleaned from top to bottom and
hand sanitizer been placed throughout employee work areas. "This is
something totally out of the ordinary. When something like this happens,
you tend to go overboard and make sure things are dealt with," she said.

[A small outbreak with no serious consequences. But a reminder that
norovirus transmission is often foodborne.
