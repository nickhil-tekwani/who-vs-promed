A federal appeals court refused Thursday to stop Montana from
slaughtering bison outside Yellowstone National Park to prevent
the animals from infecting cattle with brucellosis, a serious livestock
disease. Bison leave Yellowstone in search of winter forage. About
half test positive for brucellosis, a disease that can cause cows to
abort and, in rare cases, can spread to humans and cause a
recurring fever.
In a one-sentence ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
a federal judge's decision allowing the state and the National Park
Service to continue killing bison as they have for the last 3 winters.
More than 1200 bison that left Yellowstone have been shot or shipped
to slaughter in the last 3 years, mostly in the winter of 1996-97.
Environmental groups challenging the plan contended there was no
evidence the disease could spread from Yellowstone bison to cattle
grazing on neighboring land. Also, they contended the slaughter
conflicts with the designated role of the park as a wildlife sanctuary.
John Bloomquist, the state's lawyer, told the court in a hearing last
month that the state's stringent measures for controlling brucellosis
have protected the cattle industry.
Justice Department lawyer Andrew Mergen said at the same hearing
brucellosis, target of a $1 billion government eradication program, has
been eliminated virtually everywhere but among Yellowstone bison.
