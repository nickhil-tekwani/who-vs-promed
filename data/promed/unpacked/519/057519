Plague in Prairie Dogs in Texas Pet Broker's Facility
In late April and early May of 1998, approximately 500 prairie dogs were
captured from a site in Southwest Hockley County, Texas by an exotic animal
dealer in the Texas Panhandle. Five days after the last collection, 356 of
the animals were shipped to a broker in another part of the state. A few
deaths occurred 3-4 days post-arrival at that facility but were considered
to be due to shipping stress. Seven days after arrival (12-17 days
post-capture) a significant number of deaths began and continued for 3-4
days. Tetracycline and sulfamethazine were administered and about 75 of the
animals survived.
Cohorts retained by the dealer remained healthy so a feed or environmental
problem was suspected. Three of the dead prairie dogs arrived at the Texas
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) in Amarillo on May 15.
Contaminants prevented bacteriological confirmation but Gram staining and
gross pathology resulted in the Texas Department of Health (TDH) Public
Health Region 1 being notified of suspected plague on May 20. The CDC
plague laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado confirmed plague by FA testing
on May 22, 1998. Upon notification of the results, the broker immediately
euthanized and incinerated all remaining prairie dogs. Since the cohorts in
the Panhandle remained unaffected the dealer returned them to the capture
site. A plague alert was issued to all appropriate health professionals in
the area. Although the capture site apparently remains unaffected, die off
in other prairie dog towns in the vicinity has been detected since the
incident. Notification of oil companies operating in the area has been
implemented.
In spite of a stringent flea control program during and following capture
and a minimum 10 day post-capture isolation protocol for plague detection
(on site or at the broker's facility), diseased prairie dogs had the
potential to be shipped around the world. Based on the shipper's protocol,
the animals in this incident could have been shipped 2 days prior to the
occurrence of significant death losses, which would have exposed a myriad
of people.
This incident highlights the danger inherent in removing wild animals from
their environment for sale as pets or research subjects, placing them in
close contact with humans.
