The FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] epizootic is still remembered in this county [Boghni commune, Tizi Ouzou province] where over 100 cattle were affected. To prevent the appearance of the disease in animals (sheep and cattle), a free vaccination campaign is being implemented from 20 Dec [2014] to last until 7 Jan [2015]. A program was established by the agricultural division and was displayed in all villages. This vaccination against FMD and sheep pox began in Chouhada city, and then Tirmitine Ichiouache. "It will cover all villages. The campaign will take place in the usual gathering points for vaccination. The farmers are requested to be at these points as planned; otherwise they will miss this opportunity," said a local source. Furthermore, it was announced that the last day will be devoted to vaccination recalls. In this county, there are many farmers who are engaged in this activity. Cattle population amounts to some 2000 to 3000 head scattered over a number of villages within the county. "In our village, the veterinarian passed and no animal has escaped vaccination. The organization was perfect. Agricultural services deployed veterinarians and no animal was forgotten," said a farmer from Tirmitine. He added that since the appearance of FMD last summer [2014], farmers are aware of the importance of such a campaign. "I lost 4 cows because they were not vaccinated. Fortunately, the state took over the compensations". In all the villages of the counties of the daira [circle], such campaigns are planned in order to avoid falling into "alarmism" like last summer. In any case, according to the county's agricultural extension agents, the vaccination campaign is rather successful and only a few breeders neglect it.

[Boghni is a county in the province of Tizi Ouzou in Kabylia (Algeria). It is located 38 km (about 24 miles) south-west of the capital city of the province under same name, Tizi Ouzou, and 120 km (about 75 miles) from Algiers (see map URL: http://dz.distancevilles.net/distance-alger-et-boghni). It seems that during the emergency vaccination campaign against FMD in summer 2014, a number of animals/cattle herds as well as the entire sheep population were not covered by the campaign. It was therefore decided to fill this gap now by vaccinating all susceptible animals, diminishing the risk of recurrence of the disease.

Since sheep pox is known to cause serious losses in sheep of all ages, with particular high mortality in lambs, vaccination against this disease is generally in high demand by sheep owners. On the other hand, FMD is generally regarded by farmers as a mild disease in sheep, though high losses in offspring are not rare. The authorities' decision to combine the 2 vaccines is likely to commendably increase the FMD vaccination coverage in sheep.

FMD vaccine will actively protect adult sheep against infection with matching virus strains, and will render maternal immunity to their offspring. Sheep can potentially become carriers of the virus (generally, up to 3 months post infection). Mass vaccination of sheep is thus expected to prevent the reoccurrence of FMD circulation in the relevant territory and population.

The FMDV strain which caused the major outbreak in Tunisia and Algeria during in 2014 has been genotyped as O/ME-SA/Ind2001. This emerging strain was found to match the reference strain O Tur 5/09, while 2 vaccine strains applied in the region, namely O Manisa and O BFS 1860, were found to not satisfactorily match it.

Information on the valencies and strains included in the vaccine currently applied in Algeria is requested.
