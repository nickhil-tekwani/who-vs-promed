Pet owners are growing worried about a sudden illness that caused the deaths of 2 dogs and clinical signs in a 3rd that is recovering.

After those deaths, one woman put together an online survey, and after dozens of submissions from other residents, they think the illness could be more widespread. The problem is local vets have no idea what's causing it.

Chris Sturtz, a dog owner in Paradise Hills, has a 6-year-old dog named Roxxi. She was healthy and happy, and then all of a sudden, Sturtz took her to the vet and found a serious problem.

"I decided to go get liver enzymes tested and some blood work done, and my vet was stunned when they came back with elevated enzymes," Sturtz said.

It was a sign her neighbor, Kasia Zaryczny, told her was also discovered in her dog Luka, along with other signs like diarrhea and lack of appetite.

Much like Roxxi, Zaryczny said it happened out of nowhere; the only difference was that after 3 days, Luka had to be put down.

"My dog was perfectly fine, jumping, just a happy-go-lucky dog, then all of a sudden, she just got really sick," Zaryczny said.

It's the same story shared by another neighbor whose dog also died. Local veterinarians said they don't know what's causing it.

"We need to have the lab look at tissues and see, does it look like it's a bacterial infection? Does it look like a viral infection? Does it look like it's a toxic problem? We need more information to figure out exactly what's going on," Dr. George Abernathy said.

He said many of the clinical signs are too broad to attribute to one specific illness. Solving the mystery means doing more tests on dogs that do not survive.

"This is emergent; get your dog tested if your dog is sick; now that you know this is going on, get a necropsy," Sturtz said. "If Roxxi died, I would get a necropsy; she won't have died for nothing. Get your dog tested."

One crowd-sourcing survey found as many as 50 families reporting animal deaths with similar symptoms.

Abernathy said because the other 50 pets were not tested by him he can't say for sure that all the animals had the same illness. However, he encourages residents to monitor any illness your pet may have.

Local residents encourage other animal owners to participate in the survey that can be found in the Nextdoor App.

Albuquerque Animal Welfare officials said they are aware of the problem but have not received an uptick in calls for dead dogs. However, they said it is something they will continue to monitor.

[Aside from sick or dying dogs with elevated liver enzymes, anorexia (not eating) and diarrhea, there is not much else to go on.

This article does not mention any vomiting. Often with elevated liver enzymes, there is vomiting. This article does not mention any use of ultrasound to look at the abdomen for abscess or for fluid in the abdomen or other abnormalities or growths.

Necropsies of dogs that die are critical. The lesions in the tissues, especially the liver, may reveal whether it is a known toxin or a new and emerging toxin or other illness.

Liver disease was diagnosed a few times earlier and was in those previous years linked to aflatoxin in dog food. In both cases, it was an accidental contamination because of the way aflatoxin grows.

Aflatoxin, a naturally occurring chemical that comes from a fungus sometimes found on corn and other crops, can cause severe liver damage. Aflatoxin poisoning can cause sluggishness, a lack of appetite and in severe cases severe vomiting, fever and jaundice.

The growth aflatoxin is not uniform in a batch of grain. Dogs can and do recover from aflatoxin intoxication, however, an accurate diagnosis is required as well as testing of the food.

Levels of aflatoxin in dog food in the USA should be less than 20 parts per billion (ppb). Low levels of aflatoxin (21-250 or 300 ppm) will not cause visible signs of illness until the dog has consumed the contaminated food for 60-90 days. This situation is a chronic intoxication that has an acute presentation.

In other words, the dogs have been eating it for the 60-90 days but only suddenly become ill.

Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does not cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of cancer that may be associated with aflatoxin.

There is no indication as of this writing whether this illness is linked to any aflatoxin or dog food. However, thorough clinical records are needed, including blood work involving liver enzymes and GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase) as well histopathology on any animal succumbing to this mysterious illness.

We hope there are no other ill or deceased animals, but this bears watching at all levels of the veterinary world. - Mod.TG
