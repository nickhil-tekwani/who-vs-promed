Re: Sheep pox & goat pox - Kazakhstan: (ZM) ovine, caprine, OIE, RFI
-------------------------------------------
The above posting (archived 20130927.1970644) included ProMED-mail's request for information regarding the identity of the animal species affected in Kazakhstan (Jambyl [Zhambyl], adjacent to the border with Kyrgyzstan) by a capripox virus, and, if possible, for the vaccine applied.

We have received the following information from a reliable source pertaining to the said issues but relevant to neighbouring Kyrgyzstan:

1. Both sheep and goats show clinical disease.
2. The sheep population is significantly larger than the goat population.
3. The vaccine applied is a "caprine-pox" vaccine; on the package, the letters GK are indicated.
4. There are frequent sheep/goat pox outbreaks in Talas region.

[In ProMED-mail's commentary to 20130927.1970644 addressing the outbreak in Kazakhstan, it was stated: "The origin of infection is, reportedly, illegal movement of animals. The focus is adjacent to Kazakhstan's border with Kyrgyzstan, which reported 2 outbreaks of SGP [sheep pox and goat pox] in February 2012." Thus, the above information from Kyrgyzstan is of particular interest in relation to the reported sheep/goat outbreak in Kazakhstan.

The following relates to the 4 received points, respectively:

1. It may be assumed that in Kazakhstan, sheep and goats have been similarly affected. This might be interpreted from Kazakhstan's OIE notification; a clear confirmation from Kazakhstan would be reassuring.
2. Description of the clinical disease in both species, in Kyrgyzstan as well as in Kazakhstan, will be helpful. Some strains may cause more severe disease in one of the 2 species.
3. The letters GK on the vaccine package may refer to goat kidney tissue culture.
4. The Talas region in northern Kyrgyztan borders Kazakhstan's infected area (map at http://tinyurl.com/pzejf3q).

Information, particularly from Kazakhstan, pertaining to the above points is anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
