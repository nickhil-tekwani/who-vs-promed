Parents in Lincolnshire [England] are being warned to look out for symptoms of scarlet fever in their children after an increase in reports of the disease. The county council is writing to all primary and nursery schools, urging them to ask parents to be vigilant.

According to figures from Public Health England (PHE), there have been 134 cases of scarlet fever across the East Midlands so far this year [2014]. In the same period in 2013, there were just 56. In Lincolnshire, there have been 10 reported cases so far, compared to just 6 last year [2013].

Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial infection, which usually affects young children. PHE chiefs have asked for head teachers' assistance in preventing the spread of infection. They stress the need to exclude any children with the fever from nursery and school until they have had 24 hours of treatment with antibiotics, which will help reduce the risk of complications and the further spread of infection. The council has sent an email to all of Lincolnshire's primary and nursery schools.

Dr Jharna Kumbang, a consultant in communicable disease at PHE, said: "Scarlet fever is an infection caused by bacteria which affect the throat. The bacteria that cause the infection produce toxins, which cause the rash, swollen tongue, and flushed cheeks."

Liz Morgan, Assistant Director for Public Health at Lincolnshire County Council, said: "In the vast majority of mild cases, scarlet fever will clear up by itself, but antibiotics reduce symptoms, the risk of complications, and of passing the infection on to someone else. Children can generally return to school after 24 hours of antibiotics. An increase would be expected around this time of year, but following Public Health England advice of a potential rise in reported cases across the East Midlands, we've raised awareness in primary schools and nurseries as a common sense measure. As scarlet fever is particularly contagious, it's always best to take children to see their GP."

[Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, or the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever). Scarlet fever usually occurs in children. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity.

Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Transmission occurs via airborne respiratory particles dispersed from infected patients by coughing or sneezing, usually in the colder winter months, or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. Those who carry the bacteria in the nasopharynx or on the skin but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than one percent. Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as happened in Hong Kong in 2011; (see prior ProMED-mail posts in 2011 on scarlet fever in Hong Kong).
