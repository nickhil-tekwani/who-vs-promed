Apparently, the most recent patient to die had been in hospital in Kuala
Lumpur since last April. This clearly is not a new case, just the sad end
of a long clinical history. The previously reported fatal case from
Selangor died the end of January.
There is nothing new here, except that illness caused by Nipah virus can
cause death remote from the acute illness. According to this article,
people in Malaysia with antibody to Nipah virus are concerned that they
might become ill sometime from now. That is unlikely. What is likely is
that those are the only (about 200) people in Malaysia who are protected
against Nipah virus infection.
The concern, of course, is that humans (and pigs) can be persistently and
asymptomatically infected and then show signs of illness many months after
primary infection. There is no evidence for that at this time.
