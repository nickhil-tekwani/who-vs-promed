Junco's Pub, an elaborately designed bird feeder described by its creator as a "miniature bar for wild birds", has announced it is closing down. On Facebook, the pub's owner and operator, Elling Lien, explained why he's closing its doors. "It's with a heavy heart that I let you know that I've decided to close Junco's Pub. While it hasn't appeared at the pub, the recent frounce [trichomoniasis] scare on the east coast of Newfoundland has taken the fun out of feeding wild birds."

Possible signs of a parasitic infection known as frounce are being spotted in Newfoundland and Labrador birds, and that has the province's top veterinarian asking the public to take precautions. Frounce attacks the bird's crop, a pouch in its throat that's part of its digestive system. It can be fatal to birds but does not affect humans. "It causes an infection in the crop of the bird that makes them be unable to swallow, essentially, and they can't eat and they sort of waste away," said chief veterinary officer Dr Laura Rogers, adding the parasite also causes inflammation and ulcers.

Lien is asking other people in the province with bird feeders to consider removing theirs too. "I encourage other folks to listen to the advice of the experts like Laura Rogers and take their feeders down -- at the very least until winter each year. And even in winter, try to only use feeders as an emergency support during cold snaps or bad weather," he said.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes), which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis (inflammation of the crop and esophagus). Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite may infect other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the Mauritius Island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.

Although it had been assumed that the parasite caused little pathogenic effect on non-columbiformes, recent studies showed trichomonads were associated with morbidity and mortality amongst free ranging house finches, mockingbirds, and corvids.

Feeders can enhance the transmission of this parasite, and also of other diseases such as mycoplasmosis and salmonellosis. - Mod.PMB
