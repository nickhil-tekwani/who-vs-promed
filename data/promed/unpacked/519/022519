USDA test confirms soybean rust in Arkansas
-------------------------------------------
The University of Arkansas agriculture division was cited as saying
on Monday that a U.S. government test confirmed the highly contagious
soybean rust has infected a field in Arkansas, the 6th state found to
be infected in less than 2 weeks.
Chris Tingle, soybean agronomist with the university, was quoted as
saying, "While it is unclear (what) future problems this disease may
cause, Arkansas producers can rest assured they will have every tool
available to combat this problem."
Richard Cartwright, plant pathologist with the university, said that
scientists were testing more suspect fields throughout the state and
expected to confirm more crops had been infected. Arkansas harvested
about 125 million bushels of soybeans this year, ranking 9th among
U.S. states.

[Occurrence of the Asian strain of soybean rust [SR] in Arkansas is
unlikely to be a surprise to pathologists. Attention is now being
drawn to the involvement of kudzu (_Pueraria montana_), which is
common in the southern U.S. states, as a susceptible host for the SR
pathogen. Moreover, in addition to kudzu, soybean, yam bean
(_Pachyrhizus erosus_), and cowpea (_Vigna unguiculata_) are
principal hosts of SR, all of which are found in Florida and
presumably in contiguous states. Both _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and _P.
meibomiae_ are autoecious (no alternate hosts) and microcyclic (with
uredinial and telial spore stages), with the obligate pathogens
surviving and reproducing only on live hosts.
Officials in Brazil issued a phytosanitary alert to farmers in
October 2004, identifying kudzu as a potential reservoir host for SR.
Immediate measures to prevent further proliferation include
application of chemical herbicides, followed by controlled burning to
prevent possible regeneration of plants, and destroying SR-infected
plants where detected.
Confirmed soybean rust-infected areas in the southeast United States
now stand at 16.
