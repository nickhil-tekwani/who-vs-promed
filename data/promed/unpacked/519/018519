[1] Zimbabwe: outbreak

A measles outbreak has killed more than 700 children and infected thousands of others across Zimbabwe, highlighting the risks of faltering childhood immunization campaigns around the globe.

As of 6 Sep [2022], the country's Ministry of Health and Child Care was reporting more than 6500 cases and 704 deaths. It has not released numbers since then.

The outbreak is the result of a grim confluence of factors endangering child health in many countries. Routine immunization dropped significantly in Zimbabwe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxious parents stayed away from health centers; health-care workers were reassigned from routine vaccination programs to the COVID-19 pandemic response; and school closures and lengthy lockdowns scuppered the usual outreach campaigns.

In July [2022], the World Health Organization and UNICEF warned that millions of children, most of them in the poorest countries, had missed some or all of their childhood vaccinations because of COVID lockdowns, armed conflicts, and other obstacles. The UN agencies called the situation the largest backslide in routine immunization in 30 years and warned that, combined with rapidly rising rates of malnutrition, it created conditions that could threaten the lives of millions of children.

Vaccination coverage was already flagging in Zimbabwe before the pandemic, declining each year since 2017, because a decades-long political and economic crisis has gutted the public health system.

Zimbabwe's health system is desperately short-staffed. Health-care workers have moved to neighboring South Africa or high-income countries for jobs where they will earn much higher salaries than the meager wages in Zimbabwe that often don't arrive at all.

Twenty-five years ago, Zimbabwe had one of the highest rates of vaccination coverage in sub-Saharan Africa, but vaccine hesitancy has swelled, amplified by influential churches that discourage immunization and urge members to rely on prayer and the intercession of pastors instead. The Johane Marange Apostolic Church, which has hundreds of thousands of members, is at the center of the measles outbreak.

Some Apostolic and evangelical pastors have long opposed vaccination, saying their prayers and sacred stones are enough to protect the faithful, and have threatened to expel women who take children to clinics. This rhetoric, fueled by social media, ramped up in opposition to COVID-19 shots, which some evangelical leaders warned would contain "the mark of the beast." The hesitancy has spilled over into resistance to routine childhood shots.

A spokesman for the federal health ministry said it was making clergy a focus of the government's renewed efforts to get young children vaccinated.

"Government has embarked on a mass vaccination campaign reaching out to faith leaders to garner support and awareness," Donald Mujiri, the spokesman, said. "Children aged between 6 months and 15 years are the most affected, especially in those religious sects who do not believe in vaccination. The ministry remains committed that no child should die of measles."

The 1st measles cases in this outbreak were reported in April [2022] in the village of Makabvepi near the border with Mozambique. While district health officers were alerted to the presence of measles, the 1st children to die were buried quickly, and their deaths were not reported, said Dr. Cephas Fonte, the medical officer for Mutasa District. The children who died came from families that belonged to the Johane Marange Apostolic Church; after the group held a large Easter service, and then a Passover celebration in July [2022] that drew worshipers from across the country, measles spread across Zimbabwe.

The group publicly opposes vaccination. It represents a powerful voting bloc and is closely aligned with President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who attended the Passover gathering.

The Ministry of Health and Child Care recognized by late 2020 that COVID had derailed vaccination campaigns, but a catch-up measles campaign targeting children from infancy to age 5 began only last month [August 2022], as the reported death toll began to climb. Major international health agencies are supporting that campaign but would not speak to the New York Times on the record because the subject is perceived as politically sensitive.

Monica Mutsvangwa, Zimbabwe's information minister, said that she believed most evangelical families wanted to have their children vaccinated.

"Contrary to the usual resistance, the Apostolic Church worshipers in Manicaland have come out in their numbers for measles vaccination," she said. "The process was, however, slow at first. And there are still some religious groups that continue to resist. A lot of advocacy and work with leaders of these groups is ongoing."

Zimbabwean children are more susceptible to acute illness from measles because many are malnourished. Per capita income has dropped in each of the last 4 years, while food prices have surged because of numerous factors, including grain shortages caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and drought and higher temperatures related to climate change.

Zimbabwe last had a severe measles outbreak in 2009, at the peak of a hyperinflation crisis. There were more than 8000 cases, and at least 500 children died. The cash-starved health system has struggled since then to boost vaccination coverage.

A typhoid outbreak last year [2021] led to a 10-day campaign in which 3 million children were immunized against typhoid and polio and given vitamin A, which reduces the severity of measles, but they were not vaccinated against the measles virus.

[VM]'s 20-month-old daughter, [A], died on 4 Sep [2022]. Measles struck each of her 3 older children, and they recovered, but vomiting, diarrhea, and fever left the baby fatally dehydrated.

[A] was diagnosed with measles by a nurse at a clinic near her family's home in Muzarabani in the north of the country, but her mother, a farmer who is a member of the Johane Marange church, believes there were other causes of her death.

"We could see she was getting better when I brought her home, but witchcraft was used against us," [VM] said. "Why did she die, when the others overcame measles? This is the work of evil."

She said she was still hesitant about vaccinating her other children.

"I don't know; the herbs we used cured the other children, so they work," she said, adding, "I still believe in our way. We can't vaccinate."

["There has been little detailed research on Apostolic churches in Zimbabwe, but studies by the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, estimate it is the largest denomination with around 2.5 million followers in a country of 15 million. Some allow members to seek health care.

"Many are still resistant.

"So to save their children, some mothers visit clinics in secret, sometimes under the cover of night and without their husbands knowing. A group of Apostolic church members who are open to modern medicine have been trying to change church attitudes, but also advise women to go against church rules if it means helping their children."

"The World Health Organization warned in April [2022] of an increase in measles in vulnerable countries due to COVID-19 disruptions, with more than 40 countries postponing or suspending their regular immunization campaigns. In July [2022], UNICEF said about 25 million children worldwide had missed out on routine immunizations against common childhood diseases, calling it a "red alert" for child health.

"Globally, WHO and UNICEF reported a 79% spike in measles in the 1st 2 months of 2022 alone and warned of the potential for large outbreaks. Children and pregnant women are most at risk of severe disease from measles, which is among the most infectious diseases and easily preventable with a vaccine. More than 95% of measles deaths occur in developing countries."

[2] USA (Minnesota): outbreak
Date: Tue 27 Sep 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/minnesota-reports-measles-outbreak-10-travel-related-cases-confirmed-since-june-75908/


In a follow-up report about measles in Minnesota, state health officials report that as of 21 Sep [2022], 10 confirmed measles cases have been reported. All the cases are classified as travel related.

Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world.

Minnesota health officials are encouraging providers to be on high alert for measles among patients returning from recent international travel to endemic or outbreak areas (including Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America).

Individuals of any age who are not vaccinated have a high chance of exposure to measles when traveling to countries where measles is still common.

Initial symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body. It generally takes 8-12 days from exposure to someone with measles to develop the 1st symptom, which is usually fever. The measles rash usually appears 2-3 days after the fever begins. Measles can be a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. If you have symptoms of measles, call your doctor or clinic and they will let you know if you need to come in for a visit.
