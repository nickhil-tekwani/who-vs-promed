A quarantine in connection with rabies has been declared in the
Uglichesky district (left bank). During the last 3 months, 3 cases of
rabies have been found among foxes, which approached people and were
displaying abnormal behavior. Prior to 2003, no rabies cases had been
registered in the left bank of the Uglich district for 46 years.
However, 16 such cases have been recorded since. This year [2009], the
condition is most unfavorable.

The last infected fox has been caught in Otradny village. Vaccination
of all domestic animals is being carried out now in the village and
its surroundings. It is forbidden to remove domestic animals from this
territory. Specialists recommend inhabitants to be more attentive and
careful.

The head of the Uglich vet station said that rabies has been
registered only among wild animals. All people bitten are vaccinated
within hours after the bites.
