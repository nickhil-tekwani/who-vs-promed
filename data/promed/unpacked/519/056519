An epidemic of whooping cough may be the worst to hit New Zealand for many
years.
A total of 810 cases have been notified in the first three months of this
year, after the present epidemic began late last year.
But Yvonne Galloway of the Institution of Environment and Research says
because whooping cough only became a notifiable disease during the last
epidemic in 1996, it is difficult to compare figures.
However Galloway says the number of cases confirmed in laboratories can be
a pointer: In the whole of 1996 there were just over 400 cases confirmed in
labs, and so far this year there has been almost 340.
