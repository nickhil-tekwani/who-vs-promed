[A war veteran] who survived 3 years as a prisoner of war died after
catching _Clostridium difficile_ following an operation. [The
88-year-old] was admitted to hospital after slipping on the floor at
home and fracturing his femur. [He] had surgery at Gloucestershire
Royal Hospital but he developed an infection and was given a course
of antibiotics. Weeks later he died and an inquest was told the
medicine had left him more vulnerable to catching the superbug.
The coroner told the inquest hearing in Gloucester that [the Major]
probably would not have died if he had not been given the drugs
following the operation. The inquest heard how the medicine can alter
bacteria in the bowel, making vulnerable patients more susceptible to
contracting [_C. difficile_]. Surgeon Nadir Kalap said [the patient]
was given a 7-day course of antibiotics to combat low blood pressure
and signs of an infection.
A post-mortem examination by pathologist Dr John McCarthy revealed
the primary cause of death was [_C. difficile_] with heart disease a
contributing factor. He said: "It's known that patients treated with
antibiotics are at most risk of developing [_C.
difficile_]." Summing up the case, Gloucestershire coroner Alan
Crickmore said [the patient] would not have contracted the disease
had he not had the antibiotics.
A spokesman for Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS [National health
Service] Foundation Trust said it had been working hard over the past
year to reduce rates of infection. "We have been successful in our
efforts and infection rates have fallen considerably," he said.
"However, we are not complacent and will continue to implement our
wide-ranging action plan."
Almost 56 000 vulnerable and elderly patients have been infected with
[_C. difficile_] in the past year. Between January and March [2007]
alone, 15 592 caught the bug -- an astonishing 22 per cent rise on
the previous 3 months. [_C. difficile_], which is spread by dirty
hands and bedding, is a bigger killer than MRSA
[methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_]. It claimed 2247
lives in 2005 -- a 69 per cent rise on the previous year [2004]. It
exists naturally in the stomachs [intestines] of many healthy adults,
where it is kept under control by 'friendly' bacteria. Problems start
if the balance of bacteria is disturbed, perhaps as a result of
taking antibiotics for another infection. Once the "friendly"
bacteria are killed off, the [_C. difficile_] is able to multiply and
produce the toxins which cause diarrhoea and, in the worst cases, a
fatal infection of the abdomen.

[Recent outbreaks of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea with
increased severity, high relapse rate and significant mortality, have
been related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_
strain in North America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain,
which hyper-produces toxins A and B, is referred to as North American
pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027.
It is not stated whether the patient in the news release above was
infected with ribotype 027, which has spread extensively in the UK
(see prior ProMED-mail postings below).
Control of spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities involves
aggressive infection control measures and restraint in the use of
antimicrobial agents. However, it seems the patient described in the
news release above received appropriate antibiotic therapy for what
was likely septic shock ("low blood pressure and signs of an infection").
In addition, cases of community-acquired _C. difficile_-associated
diarrhea (CA-CDAD) are increasing, and half of these cases have been
reported to be not attributable to antibiotic use.
