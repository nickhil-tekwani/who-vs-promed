A 44-year-old woman resident of Curacautin died after contracting a hantavirus according to confirmation by health authorities in Araucania.

Verification of the case is continuing with interviews with family members and neighbors of the victim, "who appeared to have acquired the infection in rural areas of the community," according to the regional health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat], Gloria Rodriguez.

"This investigation is still underway so we will issue information later," the official added, emphasizing that, "this case makes us remember all the preventive measures that we must take related to infection by hantaviruses." And thus, Rodriguez reiterated the recommendation to avoid infection, especially those who visit foothill Andean communities such as Curacautin and Lonquimay.

An additional report indicated that the woman was admitted to the Dr Hernan Henriquez Aravena Hospital in Temuco after transfer from the Curacautin Hospital (https://www.radioagricultura.cl/nacional/2021/07/28/mujer-murio-por-virus-hanta-en-la-araucania.html.

As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta while in contact with the environment where rodents were present. Cases of human hantavirus infections can occur in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. In Chile, Andes virus can be transmitted directly person-to-person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
