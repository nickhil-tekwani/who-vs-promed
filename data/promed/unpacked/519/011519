Officials at the Danville Correctional Center say that a respiratory virus, not influenza, was the illness that led to the lockdown of a housing unit at the centre. As a result, the quarantine period for the affected inmates in the housing unit is expected to last at least another 2 weeks, according to Tom Shaer, director of communications for the Illinois Department of Corrections.

Shaer said on Sunday [1 Sep 2013] that extensive tests conducted at the Illinois Department of Public Health laboratory and other medical facilities determined the outbreak was caused by a respiratory virus. "The virus is an adenovirus that can cause many symptoms similar to influenza virus infection," Shaer said in a written statement. "It usually runs its course over several days but is contagious for up to 2 weeks, the shedding period."

Among the symptoms reported were fever, headache, sore throat, mild cough and some chest pains with deep breathing. "The Danville Correctional Center health care staff identified very early that an outbreak was occurring, and appropriate isolation and quarantine techniques were immediately initiated," Shaer said. "The quarantine period shall be safe and prolonged: 2 weeks from the last identified case."

According to Shaer, there are 1835 inmates at Danville Correctional Center, with the staff working to limit the number with the virus. The outbreak has been contained in one housing unit at the centre. Shaer said a few affected inmates were moved to the facility's infirmary in the Health Care Unit. "Some of the 1st cases, discovered Wednesday [28 Aug 2013], are already showing signs of improvement," Shaer said. Eight new cases were diagnosed on Saturday and 10 on Sunday [31 Aug and 1 Sep 2013]. A total of 71 inmates are affected; all are in either housing unit R3 or in the infirmary.

Since the virus is highly contagious, Shaer said no visitors or volunteers can enter the prison. In addition, there has been no movement between Danville and other Illinois Department of Corrections facilities. In addition, Shaer said all units at the correctional center have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, with medical and security staff members using surgical masks and gloves and taking other standard precautions.

Shaer thanked the Illinois Department of Public Health [IDPH] and University of Illinois at Chicago labs for identifying the virus. "We will continue to work closely with IDPH and follow all proper procedures for the care and treatment of inmates and the safety and security of them and our hardworking staff at Danville Correctional Center," Shaer said.

[Adenoviruses are common viruses that can cause illness in humans. Adenoviruses are medium-sized (90-100 nm), non-enveloped icosohedral viruses with double-stranded DNA. There are over 50 types that are immunologically distinct that can cause infections in humans. Adenoviruses are relatively resistant to chemical and physical agents and to adverse pH conditions and can live for a long time outside the body.

Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness. The symptoms can range from the common cold to pneumonia, croup, and bronchitis. Depending on the type, adenoviruses can cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and less commonly, neurological disease. Infants and people with weakened immune systems are at high risk for severe complications of adenovirus infection. Also, adenoviruses commonly cause acute respiratory illness in military recruits and in detention centres where inmates are held in close contact. Some people infected with adenoviruses can have ongoing infections in their tonsils, adenoids, and intestines that do not cause symptoms. They can shed the virus for months or years.

Currently, there is no adenovirus vaccine available for the general public. A vaccine against adenovirus types 4 and 7 was given to U.S. military recruits from 1971 to 1999. The manufacturer stopped producing the vaccine in 1999. A new live, oral vaccine against adenovirus types 4 and 7 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2011 for U.S. military personnel 17 through 50 years old. The vaccine is recommended by the U.S. Department of Defense for military recruits entering basic training in order to prevent acute respiratory disease.

To prevent nosocomial outbreaks of adenovirus infections, health care providers and others should strictly follow infection control practices, including contact and droplet precautions.
