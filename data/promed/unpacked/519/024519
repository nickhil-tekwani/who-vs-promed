A total of 27 confirmed cases of cholera have occurred in Coast Province of
Kenya. Twenty cases have occurred in Malindi and 7 cases in Mombasa. There
have been 3 deaths due to cholera. Serotyping has been done, and it shows
Ogawa [presumably _V.
cholerae_ O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa -Mod.ES.
There is also an outbreak of diarrhoea due to the organisms other then
_Vibrio_ in these two places. The organism(s) have not yet been
identified. There have been 11 deaths due to this. The Coast Province has
been effected by floods in the past three weeks.
