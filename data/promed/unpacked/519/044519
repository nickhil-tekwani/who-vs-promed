A gymnasium and an outdoor swimming pool at the police training school in Aberdeen [an area and town on the Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong; administratively, part of the Southern District] have been closed by an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease that has hit 21 recruits in less than 2 weeks. The Police College, next to Ocean Park, has undergone a massive clean-up and tightened hygiene measures since the 14 Aug 2015 outbreak while the Centre for Health Protection investigates the source of the virus.

Hand, foot and mouth disease has been rife in 2015, the centre warned, with 237 institutional outbreaks reported by 20 Aug. 7 cases, all of them children, were severe but none proved fatal. There were 346 cases of institutional outbreaks in 2014 compared with 779 in 2013.

"Several classes of recruits whose colleagues have been infected are now receiving training separately in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease," a police source familiar with the outbreak said. "The college's facilities are being cleaned and disinfected 3 or 4 times a day." He said no new cases had been reported on Wednesday or Thursday [26-27 Aug].

None of the 21 patients -- all male constables aged 18 to 30 -- required hospital care. All have been in stable condition since contracting the disease. They were given sick leave by doctors and stayed at home to recover. Half of them have now returned to the college.

It is understood the decision to close the pool and gymnasium was made by police themselves. The source said the force did not receive any advice from the Department of Health to shut down the training school or any of its facilities. There are about 600 recruits receiving training at the college.

Police alerted the department on 17 Aug 2015 after the 1st few cases emerged. Department officers visited the premises and provided health advice.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is usually caused by enteroviruses and is common among children. It usually begins with a fever, poor appetite, tiredness and a sore throat. The usual peak season is from early summer to autumn; a smaller peak may also occur in winter. In children, the infection is more likely to be associated with severe medical complications and even death. But to most adults, the disease is mostly self-limiting and is resolved in 7-10 days.

It spreads mainly by contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from vesicles or patients' stool, or contaminated objects, according to the centre. The centre advises that play facilities hit with the disease should be properly disinfected and should maintain good indoor ventilation. Notices should be posted at the entrance to advise people with infectious diseases not to enter.

[From the UK's National Health Service "Choices" website (http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx):

"Hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that can affect young children. It doesn't usually pose a serious threat to a child's health, but it can be be an unpleasant condition, particularly if it affects younger children.

Typical symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease include:
----------------------------------------------------
Cold-like symptoms, such as loss of appetite, cough and a moderately high temperature of around 38-39°C (100.4-102.2°F) a non-itchy red rash, made up of spots or small fluid-filled sacs (vesicles), which usually develops on the hands and feet, but may also occur on the knees, elbows, groin and buttocks; sometimes the rash can develop into painful blisters.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is a self-limiting condition, which means it will get better on its own without treatment. The symptoms will usually pass within seven days. However, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 if you're unsure whether your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. You should also contact your GP if your child isn't drinking any fluid or their symptoms last longer than seven days.

Treating hand, foot and mouth disease.
---------------------------------------------
There is currently no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease, so treatment involves making your child feel as comfortable as possible while waiting for the infection to take its course. Possible treatment options include: using paracetamol, ibuprofen and mouth gels to relieve the pain of mouth ulcer drinking plenty of fluids to help relieve a high temperature.

Etiology
---------
Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses. The most common types of viruses that can cause the condition are:

Coxsackievirus A16, A6 or A10
Enteroviruses 71
Enterovirus 71 carries a higher risk of causing serious complications.

How the infection spreads:
-----------------
A person with hand, foot and mouth disease is highly contagious until about a week after the symptoms begin. The infection can be spread if: (1) contaminated droplets are transferred from an infected person - for example, if an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets can be inhaled by another person or can contaminate surfaces, leading to the spread of infection; (2) fecal matter (stool) is transferred from an infected person - for example, if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet and then contaminates food or surfaces (the viruses can live for up to four weeks in a person's stools); or (3) you come into contact with the fluids of an infected person's blisters or saliva.

Because of the way the infection is spread, outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease can occur in places where groups of children need to have their nappies changed or use a potty, such as nurseries or childcare centres. You should keep your child away from school or nursery while they are unwell. However, there's no need to wait until the last blister has gone before your child can return to school or nursery, providing they are otherwise well. However, some schools and nurseries may reserve the right to refuse to take your child until the condition has cleared up completely.

It is rare, but possible, to get hand, foot and mouth disease more than once, although not during the same outbreak. As they get older, most children will develop immunity to the viruses that cause the condition.

Complications
----------
It's important to make sure that anyone with hand, foot and mouth disease keeps drinking fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Dehydration can often occur because the mouth ulcers can make drinking fluids painful.

Life-threatening complications such as brain infections (encephalitis) have been reported during epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease caused by the enterovirus 71. However, these complications are very rare and they have been limited to the Asia-Pacific region.

Adults with hand, foot and mouth disease
--------------------------
Although hand, foot and mouth disease mainly affects children aged 10 or younger, adults can be affected. Adults with the condition are also contagious and should stay away from the workplace until it has completely cleared up.

Hand, foot and mouth disease gets better on its own without treatment and complications are rare in adults. However, the symptoms can cause severe discomfort.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is not the same as foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs. The two infections are unrelated, and you cannot catch hand, foot and mouth disease from animals."
