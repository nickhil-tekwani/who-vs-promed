Woman dies mysterious death at Thessaloniki clinic, children hospitalised
------------------------------------------
The husband and two children of a 30-year-old woman, who died at a
Thessaloniki clinic on Wednesday afternoon after being brought in with flu
symptoms, have been hospitalised as a precaution. Thessaloniki coroner
Dimitris Psaroulis has not yet determined the cause of death but believes
it was brought on by a virus. "I believe [the cause of death] is a viral
infection," he said. "I don't know where it originated from," he added,
noting that he would have to wait for the laboratory test results to
ascertain the exact cause.
Reports stated yesterday that the woman was transferred to the Panagia
clinic in Thessaloniki 3 days after developing flu symptoms. Efthymios
Sofianos, head of the
ambulance service (EKAV) in Thessaloniki, told reporters that when the
husband called them, his wife's symptoms had not caused them any particular
concern as they seemed to be associated with the common cold. "He spoke of
a temperature and weakness then 3 days later told us she was also
vomiting," said Sofianos.
When she arrived at Panagia, Aristidis Grammatikopoulos, the clinic's chief
administrator, said that the wife was unable to breathe. He said that she
was taken to intensive care but died 5 hours later. Her husband, 4-year-old
son and 7-year-old daughter were hospitalised yesterday morning at the
Thessaloniki Hospital for Infectious Diseases after developing a high fever
and headaches.
Psaroulis is also investigating the deaths of another woman & a man who
also succumbed to a viral infection in Thessaloniki this week. He said that
the deaths could have been caused by meningitis though he did not exclude
the possibility of influenza.
A 20-year-old man brought to hospital in Thessaloniki from the northern
Greek town of Kozani was reported to have died from meningitis yesterday,
while another 2 cases of this viral infection were reported on the Ionian
island of Corfu. A 16-year-old boy and 17-year-old girl diagnosed with the
disease were transferred to a Ioannina hospital and to Athens' Evangelismos
hospital respectively, where doctors are hopeful they will recover.
Scores of individuals flocked to Sotiria hospital complaining of breathing
difficulties brought on by colds and viral infections. They were
hospitalised but due to the increased demand on the facility, were forced
to sleep in the hospital's corridors on camp beds.

[In the midst of the current influenza epidemic in Greece some sudden
deaths from influenza are to be expected, but the medica authorities
apparently suspect these cases to be viral meningitis. Since it is not the
mosquito season there, West Nile viral meningitis can be ruled out. - Mod.JW]
