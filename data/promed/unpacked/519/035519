A healthy 30-year-old male resident of Boston, Massachusetts attended
a wedding in a resort in the Dominican Republic from 20-23 Jan 2011.
He returned to Boston at 1 am on 24 Jan 2011.

He was awoken from sleep at 5 am 24 Jan 22011 with watery diarrhea.
Over the next 36 hours he had approximately 12 bowel movements, small
to moderate volume without fever or blood in the stool. His wife who
accompanied him to the wedding has remained well. The patient reports
he was contacted by his family who also attended the wedding, and that
at least 13 members of the wedding party had developed watery diarrhea
and were presenting to medical care in Venezuela and the Dominican
Republic with "probable cholera" (no additional details available).

The patient presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital on 25 Jan
2011. He was afebrile and with no dehydration to examination. He was
walking, nontoxic, mucus membranes were moist, and he was urinating
well. The frequency and volume of bowel movements were decreasing.

The clinical diagnosis was possible _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, presumably
extension of Hispaniola outbreak. The patient was treated with fluids
ad libitum, and azithromycin 1 gm orally. Stool was sent for culture,
and, on 27 Jan 2011, has yellow colonies on TCBS [thiosulfate citrate
bile salts sucrose] agar. Gram stain shows comma shaped Gram negative
rods. The organism is oxidase positive. Formal identification is in
process and should be available soon. The Massachusetts Department of
Public health has been notified of a possible case of _V. cholerae_ O1
infection and a sample is being sent to the State Laboratory.

[ProMED thanks Dr Ryan for this prompt 1st hand report and looks
forward to microbiological confirmation. Travelers who bring cholera
home to their native countries pose little risk of spread as long as
there are good sanitary facilities and clean water. - Mod.LL

According to another news report (Bloomberg
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-26/venezuela-reports-at-least-21-cholera-cases-among-tour-group.html>), other cases of people who attended the party have been confirmed in Spain (Madrid) and Mexico. Depending on the source, the party has been variously described as a tour group, a banquet and a family gathering. This report clarifies that, in fact, it was a wedding comprising all the
above,
