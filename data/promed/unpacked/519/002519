Resurgence of West Nile Virus?
------------------------------
On my RaptorCare listserv (for raptor rehabilitators), we've had a
couple of comments about an apparent resurgence of West Nile virus
(WNV) patients coming in after a lull of a few weeks: 8 birds in 48
hours in Kentucky, 7 birds (5 with WNV-type symptoms) in the last
week at a center in Ohio. Is there anyone else reporting such a
resurgence in any species?

Louisiana: West Nile Virus Infection in Canines
-----------------------------------------------
State officials said 4 dogs with encephalitis-symptoms have
[contracted] West Nile virus, in one of the first signs the disease
may be becoming more widespread in animals. State veterinarian Martha
Littlefield said on Fri 18 Oct 2002 that 3 of the dogs died. They had
symptoms that included seizures, trouble walking, "stargazing", and
flinching at a gentle touch. The virus may not have caused the
disease, but veterinarians should consider West Nile virus as a
possible cause of brain or central nervous system trouble in dogs,
Littlefield said.

It has also infected more than 110 species of birds, including the
bald eagle and the endangered Mississippi sandhill crane. Horses have
also been susceptible. The American Veterinary Medical Association
has estimated at least 40 percent of the horses infected with West
Nile during a 1999 outbreak died.

But the disease has been rarer in dogs and cats. Officials at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reported last month the
deaths of a 3-month-old wolf and an 8-year-old dog were linked to
West Nile virus. The American Veterinary Medical Association's Web
site reported 3 cats who died in 1999 and 2000 were believed to be
infected. "The biggest thing right now is that so many people have
been told it's not a big deal in dogs, so a lot of veterinarians
don't look for it," Littlefield said. None of the dogs in Louisiana
was old or otherwise ill, she said. The youngest was a 5-month-old
German shepherd. The oldest, a 6-year-old Dalmatian, has recovered.

Ohio: West Nile Virus Confirmed as Cause of Some Raptor Death
-------------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus likely caused thousands of birds of prey to die in
Ohio and other states in July 2002, federal wildlife officials have
concluded. But the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.,
is calling its results "presumptive" because active virus was not
found in the blood of all owls and hawks tested. Tests found active
virus in both of the hawks but only 2 of the 5 great horned owls
submitted by Ohio. Reports of dead and sick birds have diminished in
recent weeks, and officials believe the disease is reaching the end
of its run for the year. Much of Ohio has had frosts that killed off
the mosquitoes that carry the virus, said Pat Ruble of the state's
Division of Wildlife.

Ohio had more dead birds of prey than any other state. Ohio wildlife
officials say it's impossible to determine how many thousands of
birds died in the state. "Some 500 to 750 raptors actually came
through rehabilitation centers," said Mark Shieldcastle, a biologist
with the Ohio wildlife division. "I think that's a small percentage
of birds that actually went down."

West Nile Virus in the United States - WHO Update 7
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 21 Oct 2002, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arthropod
Borne Viruses - Western Hemisphere, at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 3231 human cases of West
Nile virus infection, with 176 deaths occurring in 37 states and the
District of Columbia.

During 2002, West Nile virus activity (evidence of infections in
birds, humans, mosquitoes, and other animals - primarily horses) has
been documented in 43 states and the District of Columbia (see
previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/october/15october2002.html>

West Nile Virus Latest News - as of Tue 22 Oct 2002
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has been detected in 43 states in the US in 2002 and
5 provinces in Canada, from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia. In the US
the only states where it has not been detected are Alaska, Arizona,
Hawaii, Idaho (on 2 Oct 2002 it was reported in a raven in a
bordering county in NE Washington), Nevada, Oregon and Utah. In many
states WNV has been detected in all, or nearly all, counties,
including several on the Mexican border.

During the week 10 to 16 Oct 2002, 256 new lab-positive human cases
were reported, with largest numbers of new cases from Indiana and
Nebraska. The number of human cases and fatalities continues to
increase, while the rate of increase has slowed to about half that of
mid-September (256 new cases last week compared with 487 during a
week one month ago). As of 16 Oct 2002, CDC reports 3052 human cases
(164 fatalities) in 37 states. [This website also displays a
histogram of weekly case counts and mortalities compiled by Dr. Henry
Huang, of the Washington University School of Medicine.]

Equine cases are up to 10 172 in 38 states, reported to USDA APHIS by
state health officials as of 13 Oct 2002. WNV has now been associated
with illness and death in several other mammal species, including
squirrel, wolf, and dog in Illinois, which leads the country in
number of human cases, and mountain goat and sheep in Nebraska, which
leads the country in numbers of equine cases.

Health officials have become convinced that WNV can be transmitted
via organ transplant and blood transfusion. However, risks of
contracting WNV by these routes are very small as compared with other
risks related to these treatments. Evidence is also mounting that WNV
can be transmitted to babies in breast milk: WNV genetic material was
transiently present in the breast milk of a woman with WNV infection
and measurable WNV-specific IgM was detected in her baby. Despite
this finding, the risk of WNV illness in young children is very low;
only 4 infants in the US are known to have become infected with WNV
during the 4 years that the virus has been reported in the US.
