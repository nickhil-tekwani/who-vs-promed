Hong Kong Boy, 9, Contracts Bird Flu
--------------------------------
HONG KONG (AP) -- A 9-year-old boy contracted bird flu after visiting
southern China last month and his sister and father have died of
unspecified illnesses, officials said Wednesday, raising fears of a
recurrence of the deadly disease that first hit humans and killed six
people in 1997.

Incidents of bird flu set off alarms in Hong Kong because of the deadly
outbreak six years ago. Officials then killed all 1.4 million chickens in
the territory to try to wipe out the virus.

The boy suffering from bird flu and his family visited relatives in China's
Fujian province late last month.

The boy's 8-year-old sister developed pneumonia and died in a Fujian
hospital on Jan. 28. Their 33-year-old father fell sick with pneumonia Feb.
7 and returned to Hong Kong for treatment before dying in Princess Margaret
Hospital on Monday. The exact cause of both deaths was still being
investigated, officials said.

The Health Department said the boy tested positive for the H5N1 strain of
the avian flu, or bird flu. It is a different strain of the disease than
the one that infected humans in 1997.

The boy was admitted to a hospital Feb. 12, three days after the start of a
fever. He was in stable condition Wednesday, officials said.

The boy's 30-year-old mother, his sister and grandfather were also in
Princess Margaret Hospital. The mother had an influenza virus infection but
has since recovered. The hospital said all three were in good condition and
it was not immediately clear why the three were in the hospital.

``The Department of Health has stepped up its surveillance system further
by testing all severe pneumonia cases for H5. So far, we have no other
positive results,'' Dr. Tse Lai-yin said in a statement.

The department is closely liaising with mainland authorities to monitor the
situation and has reported the case to the World Health Organization, said
Diana Kam, a health department spokeswoman.

Medical experts said the government needs to learn if the H5N1 virus
originated in Hong Kong or on the mainland.

``We have to see whether the boy's family has also contracted the bird
flu,'' lawmaker Dr. Lo Wing-lok, who represents the medical sector, told
reporters. ``Is this an independent case or an outbreak?''

Meanwhile, Hong Kong agricultural officials reported new cases of bird flu
at four poultry stalls in suburban Tai Po market where 12 chickens were
found dead Wednesday morning.

After samples from the dead chickens tested positive for the H5 strain of
avian flu, the poultry stall owners slaughtered all the birds in the
stalls, authorities said.

Earlier this month, Hong Kong sent back almost 10,000 chickens from
mainland China after tests indicated they may have been exposed to bird flu.

Influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
---------------------
As of 19 February results from two laboratories have confirmed the presence
of an avian influenza virus in a child in Hong Kong SAR. Tests conducted in
two samples from this single patient have identified the virus as the
strain of influenza A(H5N1). A similar virus caused an outbreak in Hong
Kong SAR in 1997, with 18 cases detected and six deaths.

In the current outbreak, a 9-year-old boy who travelled to Fujian Province
(China) in January with his mother and his two sisters became ill on
February 9 and was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital on February 12. He has
recovered and is in a stable condition. Other members of his family
presented with a similar illness. The child's sister and father have died.
The boy's mother was ill but has recovered.

It is not yet known whether the other family members were also infected
with influenza A(H5N1). A medical and epidemiological investigation is
ongoing in Hong Kong to determine the cause of those illnesses. Results
should be available in the next few days. Investigations are ongoing to
determine the source of the infection.

The World Health Organization is collaborating closely with health
authorities in Hong Kong SAR and China in investigating the outbreak. The
WHO Global Influenza Surveillance network has been alerted.

[As these articles mention, there was an outbreak of H5N1 influenza in Hong
Kong in 1997/1998 (see ProMED-mail postings below covering this
outbreak). In this current instance there is the suggestion that the
location of infection may have been in Fujian Province (China) if the
father also had H5N1 influenza. These articles also suggest that the
current strain of H5N1 is different from the strain involved in the 1997
outbreak.

On a provocative note, checking the geography it is noteworthy that
Guangdon Province is adjacent to Hong Kong and Fujian Province is the next
northerly province on mainland China. A rather curious coincidence to have
a major respiratory outbreak in a nearby province (see ProMED-mail postings
on Pnuemonia - China (Guangdong) listed below). As a reminder there were
approximately 350 cases of pneumonia with 5 deaths reported in Guangdong
province. Checking population statistics, Guangdong province has a
population of 70,510,000 with a population density of 1,027 per square mile
-- a respiratory syndrome outbreak with approximately 350 cases in this
environment would be classified as a small outbreak.

More information on this outbreak as it becomes available would be
appreciated. - Mod. MPP]
