As a Massachusetts Department of Public Health worker, I'd like to offer
brief clarification about the recent posting on tularemia in Massachusetts
and commentary by the moderator. The Boston Globe article that you printed
[referenced had some, but not all, of the facts straight. Here is what we
know so far. A 4-year-old from Newton (a suburb of Boston) was recently
confirmed for tularemia. He had the ulceroglandular form of the disease.
The ulcer developed in the same spot where a tick was removed after
vacationing on Martha's Vineyard. The 2 "suspect" cases are not "suspect"
by the CDC case definition. Because of a rare outbreak of pneumonic
tularemia on Martha's Vineyard during the summer and fall of 2000 involving
15 individuals (one fatality), physicians in this area have a heightened
awareness of tularemia, and many are testing individuals with pneumonia of
unknown etiology. The 2 cases currently being tested are both individuals
with pneumonia of unknown etiology. Acute sera on both are negative for
tularemia, and convalescent sera will be tested by CDC in a few weeks.
Research done by the CDC and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
last fall showed that cases in the 2000 outbreak were statistically more
likely to work outdoors with "dust-generating" equipment (lawnmowers,
brushcutters, etc.) than controls.
