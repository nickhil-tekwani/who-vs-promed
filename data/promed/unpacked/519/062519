Canker at UF research grove near Fort Pierce; 10 000 trees doomed
-----------------------------------------------
Citrus canker has been found in a University of Florida research
grove at the Indian River Research and Education Center near Fort
Pierce, and about 10 000 trees will have to be destroyed, officials
said on Friday [1 Jul 2005].

The discovery was confirmed Thursday [30 Jun 2005] by the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services , stopping all citrus
research projects at the center, said Brian Scully, director of the
center and a horticulture professor with UF's Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences.

More than 2 dozen experiments were under way at the center, using
trees planted 30 to 50 years ago. "It will take us a number of years
to recover, but, ultimately, this setback will offer us a fresh start
and improved groves in which to conduct research," Scully said.

Canker is one of the most destructive disease threats to Florida's
USD 9 billion citrus industry. The disease, caused by bacteria, can
affect all citrus varieties, including grapefruit, oranges and
tangerines, all of which are grown at the center. Infected trees
develop small brown lesions on leaves, stems and fruit, eventually
reducing tree productivity.

The bacteria can be spread by air currents, in rainwater, and on
people, animals, plants and farm equipment, Scully said.

The outbreak was discovered Monday [27 June 2005] during a grove inspection.

Canker eradication rules require the destruction of all infected
trees and of any exposed tree, meaning those found within 1900 feet
of an infected tree.

Officials will step up efforts to protect citrus research centers in
Lake Alfred and the Southwest Florida Research and Education Center
in Immokalee.

[Citrus canker continues to erupt in Florida. The outbreak in a
university research grove will certainly mean the loss of valuable
genetic material. It looks more and more likely that the hurricanes
in late 2004 were involved in distributing the bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ in the affected areas.
