Bacterial leaf streak of corn confirmed
---------------------------------------
Bacterial leaf streak [BLS] disease of corn, caused by _Xanthomonas vasicola_ pv. _vasculorum_, has now been confirmed in Nebraska, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas. The disease had not been previously identified in the US, but had been reported on corn in South Africa.

Surveys are currently underway to identify the disease distribution. Initial results suggest that it may be widely distributed throughout the Corn Belt. No research evidence is available to predict its potential impact on yield.

Confirmation of the disease was delayed because of the lack of historic research on the pathogen and limited data on this bacterium and its close relatives. Advanced testing procedures were conducted at multiple institutions to confirm its identity.

Symptoms may look similar to other diseases, especially the fungal gray leaf spot. It is very important to correctly identify the disease to make effective treatment decisions.

This bacterium has also been found to cause gumming disease in sugarcane in other countries. The species is also recognized by _X. campestris_ pv. _vasculorum_.

[_Xanthomonas vasicola_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _vasculorum_ (Xvv) has previously primarily been reported as a pathogen of sugarcane to cause gumming disease. Gumming has been considered one of the most serious diseases of this crop in many countries and was one of the first plant disease proven to be of bacterial aetiology.

It is not clear at this stage if a new strain of Xvv with increased pathogenicity on maize has led to the emerging problems, or if intensified agricultural systems may have led to easier spread between crops, perhaps via non-crop reservoirs.

_Xanthomonas_ pathogens can survives between seasons on volunteer crop plants or plant debris. They can be seed borne, depending on the host, and they can be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water and mechanical means (including human and insect activity). Disease management is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds) and use of resistant crop varieties.
