Vet diagnoses Rocky Mountain spotted fever in local canine
----------------------------------------------------------
Mention a tick bite and most people are worried about Lyme disease. But one
Scotland County family found out there can be worse, after a canine friend
was struck by a much rarer disease courtesy of one of the nasty little
parasites. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is not unheard of, but most
Missourians are far more familiar with the sister malady, Lyme disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RMSF is
the most severe tickborne illness in the United States. This disease is
caused by infection with the rickettsia organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_.
The organism causing RMSF is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick.
The American dog tick and Rocky Mountain wood tick are the primary
transmitters of RMSF rickettsia in the United States. The brown dog tick
has also been implicated as a vector.

Initially, the dog in question suffered from seizures, leading its owners
to seek medical treatment for what was believed to be epilepsy. But after
reading an article in Hounds & Hunting magazine, the owners noticed joint
stiffness in the dog, which along with seizures are key signs of RMSF. A
trip to Lindquist Veterinary Clinic confirmed that the animal had been
exposed to RMSF after complete review of the animal's blood tests.

"We haven't seen a whole lot of RMSF because the signs are fairly vague and
a lot of animal owners may not realize their pet needs to be tested," said
Dr. Carla Miller. "I suspect it may be more common than we realize." Miller
added that while a dog may test positive that doesn't mean the animal is
actually suffering from the disease. "A lot of dogs may be exposed to it
but are not actually diseased," she said. "It is sort of like when someone
has a cold and they sneeze on you. You have been exposed to the sickness,
and it is in your body, where you begin to build antibodies to fight it.
Sometimes you get diseased and suffer a cold and other times you do not
succumb to the symptoms and your body fights it off."

Miller said the test for RMSF confirms the presence in the blood of the
antibodies that are made by the body to fight the disease. While the
outbreak of RMSF is scary thought for animal lovers, it has concerned
physicians as well. The Missouri Department of Health issued a public
health advisory on 14 Jun 2007 warning about an increase of tickborne
diseases in the state.

The DHSS report was issued following confirmation of a tickborne disease
related death in a Missouri citizen. A north east Missouri child died 23
May 2007. Diagnostic tests performed at St Louis Children's Hospital
indicate the child was infected with _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_, a tickborne
rickettsia that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). [HME has
recently been renamed to human anaplasmosis. - Mod.TG]

Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) and local public
health disease investigators found that the child had been hospitalized
with symptoms consistent with ehrlichiosis after apparently being bitten by
a tick. The child died about 10 days after symptoms initially appeared
despite intensive medical care.

The DHSS report stated that from 1 Jan 2007 to 1 Jun 2007, cases of
suspected and confirmed tick-borne rickettsial diseases (TBRDs), including
ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis and RMSF, increased in Missouri compared to the
previous 5 years.

The DHSS report revealed increased reports in 2007 of several TBRD,
including RMSF. Provisional data showed that 16 cases of ehrlichiosis have
been officially reported from 1 Jan 2007 to 1 June 2007, compared to an
average of 9 cases per year for the same periods of the past 5 years. In
addition, 54 cases of RMSF have been reported from 1 Jan 2007 to 1 Jun
2007, compared to an average of 22 cases per year for the same periods of
the past 5 years. Other, non-ricketsial, tickborne diseases reported in
Missouri in 2007 include 2 cases of tularemia and 10 cases of Lyme-like
disease. (Some of these reported cases are still under investigation or in
various stages of testing.)

Does a confirmed case of RMSF in a canine pose danger for humans? The CDC
says "Yes, but not directly. People get this disease when they are bitten
by a tick that is carrying the bacterium _R. rickettsia_. Because ticks on
dogs can be infected with _R. rickettsii_, dogs and people can get RMSF
from the same ticks.

These ticks can also bite other animals and pass Rocky Mountain spotted
fever to them. When you remove ticks from any animal, the crushed tick or
its parts can also pass this disease through any cuts or scrapes on your skin."

The DHSS report warns individuals to beware of symptoms: acute onset of
fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Nausea and vomiting may be present
in some cases. Severe manifestations of the disease may include prolonged
fever, renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, seizures, and/or
coma. An estimated 2-3 per cent of ehrlichiosis patients die from the
infection.

In RMSF the initial presenting symptoms are the same as for HME. The rash
of RMSF occurs in about 90 per cent of cases and it occurs sooner in the
course of the illness, usually 2-4 days after onset of fever. The rash
begins on the wrists and ankles. Eventually, the rash spreads to almost the
entire body, including the palms and soles, but sparing the face.

[The rickettsiae are small (0.3-0.5 x 0.8-2.0 micrometres), Gram negative,
aerobic, coccobacilli that are obligate intracellular parasites of
eukaryotic cells. They may reside in the cytoplasm or within the nucleus of
the cell that they invade. They divide by binary fission and they
metabolize host-derived glutamate via aerobic respiration and the citric
acid (TCA) cycle. They have typical Gram negative cell walls, and they lack
flagella. The rickettsiae frequently have a close relationship with
arthropod vectors that may transmit the organism to mammalian hosts. The
rickettsiae have very small genomes of about 1.0-1.5 million bases.

Rickettsiae must be grown in the laboratory by co-cultivation with
eukaryotic cells, and they have not been grown by in axenic culture. The
basis of their obligate relationship with eukaryotic cells has been
explained by rickettsial possesion of "leaky membranes" that require the
osmolarity and nutritional environment supplied by an intracellular habitat.

The rickettsiae, in spite of their small size and obligate intracellular
habitat, are a group of alphaproteobacteria, which inlcude many well-known
organisms such as acetobacter, rhodobacter, rhizobium, and agrobacterium_.
Very few of the alphaproteobacteria are pathogens of humans. Brucella,
bartonella, rickettsia, and a related intracellular parasite, ehrlichia,
are the main exceptions.

Upon attaching to the host cell membrane, rickettsiae are phagocytosed by
the host cell. The rickettsiae are believed to induce host cell
phagocytosis because they can enter cells that normally do not phagocytose
particles. Once phagocytosed by the host cell, rickettsiae are observed to
quickly escape from the phagosome membrane and enter the cyoplasm. The
mechanism of escape from the phagosome membrane is not well understood, but
it is thought to be mediated by a rickettsial enzyme, phospholipase A2.

Observations in cell culture systems suggest that the mechanisms of
intracellular movement and destruction of the host cells differ among the
spotted fever group and typhus group rickettsiae.

Typhus group (TG) rickettsiae are released from host cells by lysis of the
cells. After infection with _R. prowazekii_ or _R. typhi_, the rickettsiae
continue to multiply until the cell is packed with organisms and then
bursts. Phospholipase A2 may be involved in cell llysis. Typhus group
rickettsia-infected host cells have a normal ultrastructural appearance.

Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae seldom accumulate in large numbers
and do not lyse the host cells. They escape from the cell by stimulating
polymerization of host cell-derived actin tails, which propel them through
the cytoplasm and into tips of membranous extrusions, from which they
emerge. Infected cells exhibit signs of membrane damage associated with an
influx of water, but the means by which rickettsiae damage host cell
membranes is uncertain. There is evidence to suggest a role for free
radicals of oxygen, phospholipase, and a protease. The protein responsible
for the actin-based movement in spotted fever group rickettsiae has yet to
be identified, but it is apparently different than the proteins responsible
for actin polymerization by _Listeria monocytogenes_ and _Shigella Flexneri_.

Rickettsial diseases vary in clinical severity according to the virulence
of the rickettsia and host factors, such as age, male gender, alcoholism,
and other underlying diseases. The most virulent rickettsiae are R.
rickettsii and R. prowazekii, which kill a significant portion of infected
people, unless the diseases are treated sufficiently early in the course of
infection with an effective antimicrobial agent, usually doxycycline.

All rickettsial infections begin with introduction of the organisms into
the skin, either through a tick bite or cutaneous abrasions contaminated by
flea or louse feces. Rickettsiae enter dermal cells including endothelium
and proliferate locally intracellularly with endothelial cell-to-cell
spread for most SFG rickettsioses resulting in an eschar or tache noire, a
zone of dermal and epidermal necrosis approximately 1 cm in diameter with a
surrounding zone of erythema. Eschars do not occur in epidemic and murine
typhus and are rarely observed in RMSF.

SFG rickettsioses often manifest regional lymphadenopathy in the drainage
of the eschar, suggesting that rickettsiae may spread via lymphatic vessels
from the tick bite inoculation site early in the infection. Rickettsiae
spread throughout the body and infect mainly endothelial cells,
establishing many foci of contiguous infected blood vessel-lining cells.
Injury in these local sites causes vascular damage manifesting as rash,
interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis, interstitial nephritis, and
interstitial myocarditis, as well as lesions in the liver, gastrointestinal
wall, pancreas, and potentially any vascularized tissue of the body.

The most important pathophysiologic effect is increased vascular
permeability with consequent edema, loss of blood volume, hypoalbuminemia,
decreased osmotic pressure, and hypotension. These effects can be life
threatening resulting in pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress
syndrome, shock, or acute tubular necrosis.

The name RMSF is somewhat of a misnomer. Beginning in the 1930s, it became
clear that this disease occurred in many areas of the United States other
than the Rocky Mountain region. It is now recognized that this disease is
broadly distributed throughout the continental United States, as well as
southern Canada, Central America, Mexico, and parts of South America.
Between 1981 and 1996, this disease was reported from every US state except
Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, and Alaska.

Generally treatment with tetracycline or doxycycline is recommended and if
caught early enough results in a cure. Limiting exposure to ticks is the
most effective way to reduce the likelihood of Rocky Mountain spotted fever
infection. In persons exposed to tick-infested habitats, prompt careful
inspection and removal of crawling or attached ticks is an important method
of preventing disease. It may take several hours of attachment before
organisms are transmitted from the tick to the host. Currently, no licensed
vaccine is available for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

It is unreasonable to assume that a person can completely eliminate
activities that may result in tick exposure. Therefore, prevention measures
should be aimed at personal protection. Likewise, careful examination of
pets is critical to help prevent the disease. After an excursion it is
important to very carefully and thoroughly examine your pet, and even dip
the animal in a recommended acaracide recommended by your veterinarian.
