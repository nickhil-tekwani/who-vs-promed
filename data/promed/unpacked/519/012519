Tappe D, Nachtigall S, Kapaun A, Schnitzler P, Gunther S, Schmidt-Chanasit J. Acute Zika virus infection after travel to Malaysian Borneo, September 2014 [letter].

We report an acute ZIKV [Zika virus] infection in a traveler returning from Malaysian Borneo [Sarawak] who experienced bilateral hearing difficulties during the course of illness.

On 1 Sep 2014, a 45-year-old woman was seen in an outpatient clinic in Heidelberg, Germany for fever of up to 39 C [102.2 F] and maculopapular rash covering her trunk, arms, and legs. Fever had started on 30 Aug [2014], which was 6 days after she had returned from a 3-week vacation to peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Laboratory analyses showed a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level of 5.2 mg/L (reference range under 5.0), but liver function test and complete blood count results were within reference range. During the next 3 days, the fever subsided, but the patient experienced a sore throat, bilateral conjunctivitis, and a burning sensation of the palms and soles. These symptoms were accompanied by swelling of the hands and increasing arthralgia of the wrists, palms, and fingers. There was no lymphadenopathy. An indirect immunofluorescence assay for ZIKV demonstrated an IgM titer of 1:640 and an IgG titer of 1:320 (cutoff under 1:20) on day 6 of illness. An indirect immunofluorescence assay for dengue virus demonstrated an IgG titer of 1:80 and no IgM (cutoff under 1:20).

Two days later, the patient experienced sudden bilateral dull and metallic hearing; in her left ear, she experienced a very short delay between a sound and her perception of the sound. Follow-up ZIKV serologic testing on day 11 of illness showed a decreased IgM titer of 1:160 and an increased IgG titer of 1:2560 (Figure). Viral neutralization testing (3) of the same sample demonstrated the presence of ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Chikungunya virus serology results were negative. An archived serum sample from day 3 of illness studied by ZIKV serology and a ZIKV-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR was negative. Hearing difficulties lasted for 10 days and resolved gradually.

During her journey to several cities and villages in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, the patient had noticed several mosquito bites, even though she had used repellents. She had stayed in hotels, private homes, and remote church homes under various conditions.

In Asia, Zika fever has been described sporadically in Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia (Java and Lombok). On the basis of the incubation time of around 6 days in returning travelers, we assumed that the patient became infected in Keningau or surrounding villages, in northern Borneo. Although ZIKV was detected in _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in peninsular Malaysia in 1969 and antibodies against ZIKV were demonstrated in serum samples from 15 of 79 patients on peninsular Malaysia and 9 of 50 patients in Borneo in 1953, Zika fever in peninsular Malaysia or Borneo has not been reported. In 2001, ZIKV seropositivity was demonstrated in a native Bornean, 2 migrants to Borneo, and 2 Bornean orangutans (_Pongo pygmaeus_). A later study found an additional 8 Bornean orangutans to be seropositive for antibodies against ZIKV. Thus, in Borneo, either the virus only rarely infects humans or the disease is mistaken for dengue fever.

Neurologic complications of ZIKV infections had previously been reported only as Guillain-Barre syndrome, and hearing difficulties in Zika fever patients have not been reported. Because this symptom resolved spontaneously, no audiometry or auditory brainstem response testing was performed, and the cause of the disorder remains unclear. Because of increasing travel and migration and heightened clinical and laboratory awareness, more ZIKV infections are likely to be diagnosed outside of epidemic events.

[This is the 1st report of a human clinical case of Zika virus infection acquired in Malaysia that ProMED-mail has posted. Given the previously published serological evidence for Zika virus infections in Borneo in humans and orangutans, it is not surprising that a human clinical case occurred, apparently acquired there. This case is another good example of an individual becoming infected in one area and then traveling a long distance -- half way around he world -- and coming down with clinical disease in another. In this instance, there was no risk of ongoing transmission in Germany because no competent vectors were present there. This case illustrates the importance of taking patients' travel histories. A temporary hearing loss from Zika virus infection is unusual. Interestingly, in 2013, there was another occurrence of an individual acquiring a Zika virus infection in Asia, in that instance in Thailand, and becoming ill in Germany -- see ProMED archive below.
