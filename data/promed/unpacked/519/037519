Stripe rust in wheat across Texas could be a new race
-----------------------------------------------------
The results are not finalized, but Texas AgriLife [TAL] believe the
crop is being damaged this year [2010] by a new or different race of
stripe rust. Because winter and early spring were cooler and wetter
than normal, conditions were prime for stripe rust, said Ron French,
TAL. "We first saw it in the wheat nursery, then in north Texas on a
soft red winter wheat." He said samples have been sent to a wheat
genetics lab where it will be determined if it is a new race.

"Some of the wheat that we thought had good resistance is showing a
potential breakdown," said Rob Duncan, TAL. "This could well have
been accentuated by weather conditions that are favorable for both
the pathogen and disease development. We will have to wait until
harvest to determine the economic impact," he said. "We have a
diversity of varieties planted."

Fungal inoculum may have built up and may be present in higher
numbers in 2011. The possibility of a stripe rust epidemic was
apparent in north Texas by the 1st week of April [2010], with
widespread infection levels, Duncan said. As of late April, stripe
rust has been observed throughout Texas except for the Panhandle.

"Since there has been an apparent race change, resistance in
previously resistant varieties should not be taken for granted,"
French said. "There is no substitute for field scouting."

[2] Downy mildew - sorghum and maize

Sorghum downy mildew found in local corn field
----------------------------------------------
A plant disease, sorghum downy mildew, recently developed in a corn
field in Victoria County. This disease, caused by a fungus in the
soil, occurred in the same field when sorghum was grown on the site
in 2008.

Sorghum downy mildew was a serious disease in the Upper Coast
counties during the 1960s and early 1970s, but since then, its
incidence has diminished due to fungicide treated seed.
Unfortunately, the seed treatment used in the past is not used
anymore, so sorghum downy mildew disease may increase again.

In the affected corn field, the incidence of downy mildew is less
than 5 percent. Infected corn plants may or may not develop ears.
Infected sorghum plants do not develop seed. Current recommendations
are that if the disease is present in a field, to rotate out of
sorghum for at least 2 years and plant a resistant hybrid in the
future. Crops such as soybeans, cotton, and rice are not susceptible
and can be used in rotations.

[Stripe rust
-------------
Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living
host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease
management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported
in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and
are also suspected to emerge in China. Monitoring programmes are
important to recognise these emerging new strains and it can be
expected that they will differ in national or regional significance,
depending on the susceptibility of preferred cereal varieties.

Sorghum downy mildew
---------------------
Sorghum downy mildew (_Peronosclerospora sorghi_; SDM) is a damaging
disease of sorghum and maize crops. The fungus affects _Sorghum_
species, maize, teosinte, millet, and _Panicum_ species. Many common
grasses can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Plants can be systemically
or locally infected.

Symptoms of systemic infection may include chlorosis, stunting, and
premature death of seedlings, striking leaf stripes followed by
necrosis and shredding of leaf blades on older plants, and
occasionally white downy growth on leaf undersides. Symptoms of local
infections are less dramatic and usually result in necrotic streaks
on leaf blades.

The fungus overwinters as oospores in the soil and plant debris and
can also survive in perennial grasses. Spores can be spread within a
crop by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. Mycelium can be
found in seed embryos, but looses its viability when seed moisture
drops below 20 percent. Disease management mostly relies on crop
rotation, removal of infected crop debris and other inoculum, and
fungicide seed and crop treatments.

In maize, around 10 different species of downy mildew fungi in the
genera _Peronosclerospora_, _Sclerospora_, and _Sclerophthora_ have
been reported. A number of these pathogens can occur together, but
different species may be common in different areas.
