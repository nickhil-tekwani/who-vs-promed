Re the discussion on ProMED on the effectiveness of current
rabies vaccines used off-label, in connection with the episode with
the bear cub at the petting zoo, the conclusion seems to be that
not enough data has been published to establish its effectiveness
in bears or other wildlife.
We know that rabies vaccine is used off-label in a number of zoos
to protect wildlife species. We also know that a number of zoo
veterinarians subscribe to ProMED, and to other Internet lists
concerning zoo animals.
We would like to suggest that somebody undertake a meta-analysis
of data on the results of rabies vaccination in zoo species. This
would involve analysing the species vaccinated, their age & sex,
the date and brand of the vaccine used, and the date and results of
subsequent blood samples tested for rabies antibody levels.
We think the results could go a long way to establishing the value,
or otherwise, of off-label use in wildlife. Would one or more of our
subscribers like to do this study?
