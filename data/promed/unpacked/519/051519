Since August 2006, there has been a rapid increase in clinical cases of
aseptic meningitis due to enterovirus infection in several areas of eastern
Latvia, including the region of Rezekne (consisting of the city and
district of Rezekne and the district of Ludza), and the region of
Daugavpils (consisting of the city and district of Daugavpils and the
district of Kraslava). By 27 Sep 258 cases had been registered in the 2
regions of Rezekne and Daugavpils. Enterovirus has been isolated from
samples taken from 54 patients from these regions. In Latvia, surveillance
of aseptic meningitis is based on mandatory clinical notification.

Rezekne city and region: epidemiological and microbiological investigation
---------------------------------------------------
From 5 Aug to 27 Sep 2006, 105 cases of aseptic meningitis were registered
(71 in Rezekne city, 21 in Rezekne district, and 13 in Ludza district). The
patients included 89 children aged up to 18 years and 16 adults. The cases
of aseptic meningitis in children were registered in 12 pre-school
facilities and in 13 schools in Rezekne city, Rezekne district and Ludza
district, and in a boarding school. To date, no cases have been severe and
no sequelae have been reported in any of the patients.

By 27 Sep 2006, the national reference laboratory had isolated identical
strains of echovirus 30 from samples from 24 patients. Additionally,
enteroviruses have been isolated from 11 patients, but the strains have not
yet been serotyped.

An epidemiological investigation was launched by the Rezekne public health
authorities, and this determined that initial transmission was associated
with attending a sports centre in Rezekne, where several childrens' sports
teams simultaneously use a common changing room. The changing room is very
small and there was close contact between children. During the breaks, the
children reported drinking non-potable water from a tap intended for
cleaning the facilities. All the initial cases were associated with the
sports centre. Secondary transmission to the initial patients' household
and social contacts occurred. For the majority of subsequent cases it was
possible to trace a link to an earlier case.

Daugavpils city and district and Kraslava district: epidemiological and
microbiological investigation
----------------------------------------------------
A rapid increase in number of cases of aseptic meningitis has been observed
since the beginning of September 2006. By 27 Sep 2006, 153 cases had been
reported (104 in Daugavpils city, 38 in Daugavpils district, and 11 in
Kraslava district). Several cases reported in Kraslava are
epidemiologically linked to the outbreak in Rezekne. Most of the patients
are children. Cases have been registered in 12 pre-school facilities, 41
schools, 4 vocational schools, one children's home and one university. All
the patients were admitted to hospital. By 27 Sep 2006, the microbiological
investigation at the national reference laboratory had confirmed the
circulation of 3 serotypes of enterovirus: echovirus 6 (6 cases in August
2006), and echovirus 20 (4 cases in August 2006) and echovirus 30 (4 cases
in September 2006). Enterovirus has so far also been isolated from 5
patients, but not yet serotyped. [The distribution of cases of aseptic
meningitis by age group, sex and location are tabulated in the original text.]

Discussion
----------
In comparison with this year's numbers, in the period August to September
in the previous 3 years, less than one case (average 0.7, range 0.3 to 1)
was registered per week in the affected regions. The national Public Health
Agency is continuing to collect epidemiological data. The data [presented
as a figure in the original ext] indicate a [dramatic] growth in number of
cases of meningitis in the affected areas. In view of the rapid increase,
the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections, and other
factors, more cases are expected. Importation and transmission of infection
from and to other areas cannot be excluded.

Control measures initiated by the national Public Health Agency
---------------------------------------------------
From the very beginning of the outbreak, the PHA and its branches in the
affected areas have been working together to implement the following measures:
(1) Detailed recommendations have been prepared and distributed to the
residents and educational establishments for the prevention of enteroviral
aseptic meningitis;
(2) epidemiological monitoring of the morbidity of aseptic meningitis
(daily reporting and analysis on the national level) was reinforced;
(3) control measures in the foci of infection have been organised;
(4) consultations and recommendations to the residents and institutions,
including municipalities, boards of education, educational establishments
and health care facilities, were provided;
(5) control of drinking water quality, including virological control, has
been carried out;
(6) standard operational plans for other territories in case of an outbreak
of aseptic meningitis have been developed.

In addition, the PHA branches in Rezekne and Daugavpils have suggested that
the following preventive measures be carried out by the municipality in all
the educational establishments:
(1) To provide educational establishments with disposable cups for drinking
water;
(2) to provide all the schools with soft soap and paper towels for handwashing;
(3) to provide schools with disposable kitchenware when it is impossible to
ensure thermal treatment of dishes after washing;
(4) It has also been recommended that the local authorities in the affected
areas limit or cancel large social gatherings scheduled for late September
and early October. Public health authorities have strengthened the
epidemiological and virological surveillance of aseptic meningitis across
the whole country and will continue implementation of the measures
mentioned above.

[The highlights of this comprehensive investigation are the tracing of the
origin of the Rezekne city and region component of the outbreak to the
consumption by several disparate groups of children of non-potable water
from a single source at a sports centre. The causative agent has been
identified as echovirus 30. The source of the Daugavpils city and district
and Kraslava district has not been identified, but echovirus 6 and
echovirus 20, in addition to echovirus 30, all known to be aseptic
meningitis-associated, have been isolated from patients.
