Epidemiological comments: An intensive avian influenza surveillance system is in place for all poultry farms, pet bird shops and wild birds in Hong Kong. The H5N1-infected bird was detected in the ongoing territory-wide surveillance program on wild birds. No spread of the disease was evident. Cleaning and disinfection have been stepped up at the venue where the dead bird was found. There are 2 poultry farms located within 3 kilometers (1.86 mi) of where the bird was found. The Government had immediately informed the farms, and no abnormal mortality or symptoms of avian influenza among the chicken flocks were noted. The Government will closely monitor poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been taken. The government will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.
