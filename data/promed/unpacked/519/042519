A bird flu suspect rapid tests positive in West Sumatera
--------------------------------------------------------
The M Djamil hospital has treated 8 bird flu suspect patients since
during the period January to March 2011. Of these, 3 have been
released from the hospital, and 5 are still under intensive treatment.
The patients reside around Padang city, with one from Dharmasraya.

A total of 5 patients were tested negative for bird flu by a rapid
test, while one patient has tested positive. The hospital has
collected blood samples from the patients for laboratory
confirmation.

[One of the 8 patients suspected to have contracted avian A/(H5N1)
virus infection in the vicinity of Padang, North Sumatera, has tested
positive by a rapid test, and 5 have tested negative by the same test.
Results for the other 2 patients are presumably pending. The nature of
the rapid test is not explained and the outcome of the laboratory
analysis of the patients' blood samples is awaited.

A bird flu alert concerning an outbreak of avian influenza A/(H5N1)
in poultry in North Sumatera was posted on ProMED-mail yesterday, 4
Mar 2011 (see below).
