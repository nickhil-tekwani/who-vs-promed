Bihar rural areas in grip of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis)
---------------
The entire rural area of Vaishali district has been suffering from the
deadly kala-azar disease for the last 2 months, and more than a dozen
villagers including children have died.
However, according to official figures, only 3 persons have died of
kala-azar, while 298 are still affected in different areas. Officially, it
was admitted that as many as 157 patients with kala-azar were provided
medical treatment, while 138 patients are still undergoing treatment at
different primary health centres in the district.
Reports reaching the district headquarters from different blocks present an
alarming picture. Sources said that Mahua, Raghopur, Mahnar, Lalganj,
Goraul, Sahdeibujurag, Vaishali, Bidupur and Jandaha blocks are badly in
the grip of the kala-azar epidemic. This was confirmed officially as well.
Since 1989, Vaishali district has been gripped by kala-azar, but no
concrete measures have been undertaken to eliminate the sand-fly, which is
the carrier of the disease. The most stirring fact is that kala-azar
[affects] 2 to 3 persons daily on an average in different affected areas,
but health officials have not confirmed [this figure]. The medicine for
kala-azar, sodium antimony, is not available at primary health centres,
which officials deny. According to health officials, the chief malaria
officer had provided 300 vials of kala-azar medicine on 26 Feb 2004, but it
fell short of demand. There has been a shortage of the life-saving drug for
kala-azar since 5 May 2004 in the district.
During the current financial year, INR 3 million [approx. USD 66 000] was
provided to the department concerned but was returned unused. In 2003, INR
11 66 260 [approx. USD 26 000] was received for kala-azar elimination, but
only INR 75 643 [USD 1670] could be utilised, said official sources. The
scarcity of DDT has also added to the kala-azar menace. The district
magistrate H R Srinivas said he was personally monitoring the situation and
preventive steps were being taken.

[ProMED has previously published on the apparent increase in visceral
leishmaniasis in Bihar State, and readers are referred to our comment of 27
Jan 2004 on possible reservoirs and vectors [Leishmaniasis - Pakistan

increasing number of cases, and we would appreciate a comment from the
health authorities on the situation. - Mod.EP]
