Morbidity and Mortality after Polio vaccination in Assam
--------------------------------------------------------
CALCUTTA: At least 10 children have died in India's northeastern state of
Assam of side effects after being administered a vaccine during an polio
immunisation campaign run by the state government. More than 500 children
have been admitted to government and private hospitals after falling sick.
Angry groups of parents have surrounded offices of the local administration
in protest in Assam's southern city of Silchar.
On Sunday, thousands of children were administered a polio vaccine
throughout Assam and the rest of the country. But within a day of the
massive polio immunisation campaign, reports have come in of large-scale
side effects in and around the city of Silchar in southern Assam. Officials
say 9 children have died in one village -- Labok -- while one died in
Malugram locality of Silchar.
Non-governmental organisations in Silchar who assist the government in this
campaign say outdated vaccines were possibly supplied in some areas. But
officials were not willing to speculate on the causes of the large-scale
side effects.

[Dr. Huang comments that: The children became sick the day after the
vaccine campaign, so it's unlikely that the vaccine per se is the problem.
However, potential problems with that batch of vaccines, e.g.,
contamination, failure of cold chain, etc., are possible. - Mod.CP
