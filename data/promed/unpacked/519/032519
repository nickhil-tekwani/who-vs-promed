Outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ DT204b infection in Europe, 2000: update
------------------------------------------
The European outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ DT204b resistance type
ACGNeKSSuSpTTmNxCpL reported earlier in the year (1,2) appears to be over.
To date, 396 cases of this strain have been reported from 5 countries - 184
from Iceland, 141 from England and Wales, 28 from the Netherlands, 24 from
Scotland, and 19 from Germany. The first case was identified in England on
5 Aug 2000. The epidemic curve was bimodal: the first peak (20 Aug) was
due largely to English cases and the second peak (8 Sept) to cases from
Iceland. Only 6 cases were received in laboratories in November. Lettuce
was implicated by analytical studies in Iceland, but no single vehicle of
infection for the outbreak has been identified.

referred to _S. typhimurium_ DT104. The present posting represents a final
report. - Mod.ES
