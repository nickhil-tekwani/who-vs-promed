Clarification about malaria cases in Albania
--------------------------------------------
The imported malaria case in Albania were 43 [not clear which period]. 5 Albanian citizens are among them.

The imported cases have been from Asia, China, India (57.15 per cent); in Africa (35.71 per cent); only 2.38 per cent from South America and 4.76 per cent cases (Albanian citizens) were infected traveling in Africa, Middle East and Asia.

Most of the cases were found during the period between 1964-1971 and have been mostly _Plasmodium vivax_.

Since 2010, 7 malaria imported cases were registered in Albania.

In 2010 a male, 17 years old, was diagnosed with _P. vivax_ and imported from Greece (illegal migrant with a 7 months travel history in Greece).

The other 6 cases were diagnosed in 2012 starting from February and were imported from Equatorial Guinea, all young males 19-36 years old, neglecting prophylaxis and working for an Albanian company working in different areas of Equatorial Guinea. They are all citizens of Vlora, a coastal city in Albania. 3 cases were diagnosed as _P. ovale_ and 3 other as _P. falciparum_. All cases were diagnosed at IPH laboratories in Tirana and treated at Tirana University Hospital Infectious Diseases Clinic. The diagnosis was confirmed for most of the cases at ISS, Rome, Italy.

Also 2 other probable cases came to our knowledge but not as current patients. One referred to have been treated in Italy (we cannot confirm this case as we did not find any record until now) and the other one reported about malaria treatment in Equatorial Guinea but was lacking written diagnosis.

[ProMED thanks Silvia Bino for the comments. The malaria case diagnosed in 2010 with _P. vivax_ malaria was reported by ProMED-mail (Malaria - Albania: RFI: 20100518.1634) in May 2010. Other cases diagnosed in Albania were infected in Equatorial Guinea and thus imported cases. The other 2 cases were not confirmed. If the decision by the Albanian authorities to strengthen control with travelers from Greece and Italy it appears that the decision is based on one case from May 2010. - Mod.EP
