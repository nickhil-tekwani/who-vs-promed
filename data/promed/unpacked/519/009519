Germany has reported more than 300 cases of measles since the beginning of the year [2013]. The worst affected have been Berlin and Bavaria. More than 82 percent of the cases of infection were registered in these federal states. In Berlin, 323 cases have already been diagnosed. In 2001 there were 51 cases, then the numbers decreased 2-fold and then rose to 160 in 2011. Now, a new high has been reached already by June [2013].

"This year especially, many adults have also been infected with the measles virus," says Regina Kneiding of the press office of the Senate Health Administration. The Senate has therefore expanded the recommendation for vaccination. All Berliners should check their vaccination status and be immunized in the absence of protection, regardless of age. The usual recommendation from the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute recommends adult vaccination, but so far only for those born after 1970, the date when comprehensive measles vaccination was introduced. But that may leave some adults over the age of 43 unprotected.

This was revealed by a recent case at the Charite [a hospital in Berlin]. A 10-month-old girl had been treated by a doctor. Only a few days later did it became clear that the doctor was not suffering from a cold as supposed, but in fact had contracted measles virus infection. That the doctor had transmitted measles, however, could not be confirmed, since the measles epidemic had broken out already by this time in Berlin; 9 days had elapsed between the diagnoses of measles in doctor and child. It is appropriate now to introduce universal vaccination.

Vaccination complications are extremely rare. "To be involved in a traffic accident or be struck by lightning are more likely events. However, sometimes the elderly or the immune-compromised are affected by some fatal complications such as pneumonia. This shows well that measles is a threat not just for children. Very rarely even younger healthy people can suffer severely from measles virus infection. One in 1000 people suffers a brain inflammation and one in 10 000 suffer subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) -- a particularly dreaded complication. SSPE has a long incubation period. With a delay of some years there occurs a progressive loss of brain nerve cells. It will initially cause mental and intellectual changes that follow later with seizures and loss of essential nerve function and even death. Just recently, a 14-year-old from North Rhine-Westphalia [state] developed this condition and died. He had been infected at the age of 5 months in the waiting room of his paediatrician. In this instance the child contracted measles before the time of initial vaccination at one year of age. Before that time, newborn babies are mainly rely on one thing for their protection: the vaccination of their parents and adult contacts. Anyone who wants to protect themselves and others should quickly check their measles vaccination status. Because measles is not just a childhood disease -- but is also a serious health risk.

[One consequence of universal vaccination is that subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is rarely mentioned nowadays. SSPE is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most children with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system.

Contact tracing following a case of measles in an airline passenger
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Measles incidence in the UK continued at elevated levels during the early months of 2013 -- manifested in local outbreaks in Wales and north-east England, and in higher background levels in England and Scotland. In response, Public Health England's ongoing national catch-up programme, launched in April [2013], aims to prevent measles outbreaks by vaccinating as many unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10- to 16-year-olds as possible in time for the next school year.

With background incidence being elevated, a putative travel-related risk associated with individual cases may arise, requiring a response from front-line public health professionals. Such a situation arose in Scotland earlier this month when 2 unconnected laboratory confirmed cases of measles were reported to Health Protection Scotland (HPS), both of which had extensive travel during their infectious period. Travel included train (one journey) and flights (7 journeys).

A risk assessment for fellow passengers was undertaken, taking account of European guidance [ECDC guidance: risk assessment guidance for disease transmitted on aircraft, available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/1012_GUI_RAGIDA_2.pdf] and following discussion with colleagues at PHE [Public Health England] Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control. Balancing risk, exposure date, notification date and time scale for administering prophylaxis, HPS undertook contact tracing of passengers on one flight. Using information provided by the airline, around 75 percent of passengers were able to be contacted. The exposure risk was assessed to be low. Passengers were asked about risk factors for complications of measles such as immunosuppression and pregnancy; and their age, history of previous measles infection and vaccination status were discussed. No passengers were identified as requiring prophylaxis and reassurance was provided. Contract tracing for this one flight took about 4 working days of time; it was predominantly conducted over a weekend by the HPS on-call team.

Measles is highly infectious. It is spread through inhalation of droplets generated from an infectious person. A case of measles is infectious from around 4 days before onset of rash to around 4 days after onset of rash. The prodromal period (around 4 days before rash) is usually characterised by symptoms including fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough and small spots with white tops in the mouth (Koplik spots). Anyone experiencing these symptoms following known exposure to measles infection should telephone their GP detailing the possible exposure link and avoid public contact. Patients are advised not to travel whilst experiencing these symptoms or for the 1st 4 days of rash. Protection against measles is provided by 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine. Previous measles infection confers immunity and it is likely that most people born before 1970 had measles infection as a child.

A key milestone has been reached in Swansea to create a "herd immunity" against MMR [measles, mumps and rubella]. Herd immunity effectively stops the MMR viruses in their tracks, but requires a certain proportion of the population to be fully vaccinated. Early indications show that for the 1st time more than 95 per cent of young people in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) area have had at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. However, herd immunity is only achieved with 2 doses. Health chiefs stressed there is still more to do, with the number of youngsters dosed twice just under 90 per cent.

ABMU Director of Public Health, Sara Hayes, said it was delighted with the progress thus far. Measles is no longer circulating widely, and reported cases have dropped considerably. "The vital next step is to ensure the final few per cent of children and teenagers who still need a 2nd MMR to achieve full protection receive it as soon as possible," she said. "Once we hit 95 per cent of fully vaccinated young people it means that vulnerable members of our community, who can't have MMR because they are too young, or are immune-compromised for example, will be protected from the risk of outbreaks." She added that: "At least 4 weeks needs to pass between the 1st MMR jab and the 2nd to ensure they work properly. "That means that everyone who had their 1st MMR jab at any of our hospital drop-in clinics, or school MMR clinics, can now have their 2nd dose. They should contact their GP to arrange it."

A total of 356 measles cases with 4 deaths have been recorded since he beginning of January [2013] in the Isiro Health Area of Orientale province of the DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo]. The senior doctor of the Health Zone, Benjamin Anduguwe, stated on Fri 21 Jun 2013 that children in the age range from 0 to 5 years old were most affected by this disease. "At the present time, we have 4 times the number of cases observed in previous years, and a 3-fold increase since the beginning of the year. This is why we have designated this a measles outbreak. We have 10 health areas that are affected, including 7 in urban areas and 3 in rural areas," stated the Chief Medical Officer of Health for the Isiro area.

Dr. Benjamin Anduguwe regretted that most parents in this region preferred to treat their children at home rather than bringing them to health facilities where treatment is free. "There are parents who prefer to treat their children with traditional medicines." The senior doctor of the Isiro Health Zone stated that through the Expanded Program for Immunization (Pev), Isiro had received 2 consignments of aid sufficient to provide free treatment for all children of the district.

In April [2013], Dr. Granga Davuya, the Director of Immunization for UNICEF in the DRC, stated that as of that week, 607 000 children aged 0 to 7 years in the DRC had still not been vaccinated. According to him, the current epidemic of measles reflects the incompleteness of the vaccination programme in the DRC. To ensure that all children are protected, the coverage rate for the population must be greater than 95 percent, and this level of protection had not yet been reached in the DRC. He added, however, that by 2010 the vaccination camping had reduced the mortality rate among children under 5 years, from 213 in 2001 to 158 deaths per 1000 live births.

Halton Region is on alert for measles cases after a secondary case was reported in Burlington this week. The latest adult with measles had been in contact in a health-care setting with a person who had been reported with measles on 17 Jun 2013, said Halton's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Bob Nosal. The new case is the only known secondary case to date, and the health department is now on watch for any additional cases, said Nosal. The new case may have led to additional exposures in Burlington.

If you think you may have measles, the health department advises calling ahead to the doctor's office, walk-in clinic or emergency department. Symptoms of the highly contagious virus include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. It is normally spread by coughing and sneezing and close personal contact.
