An _E.coli_ epidemic in upstate New York claimed its second life Friday as
health investigators traced the source to a well at a fairground.
[A 79 year-old man died at Albany Stratton Veterans Administration Medical
Center, spokeswoman Linda Blumenstock said. His death followed that of a
three-year-old girl.
After a painstaking search for the source of the epidemic that has
afflicted 611 people so far -- up from 497 Thursday -- state health
officials said they found the _E.coli_ strain 0157:H7 in well number six at
the Washington County Fairgrounds in Greenwich, N.Y.
[The 79 year-old man who died sought treatment for nausea and diarrhea at
the medical center on September 5 after attending the fair, which ran from
August 28 to 29.
The epidemic is already the worst of its kind in state history and could
end up being the most widespread ever in the United States.
"As the counties call in, we may have 1000 (cases) by next week," said New
York state health commissioner Antonia Novello at a news conference Friday.
In 1993, four children died and more than 500 became ill after eating
undercooked hamburgers in Washington State in what was the worst outbreak
of _E.coli_ bacteria in the United States.
New York health officials have confirmed 85 cases so far of the disease,
which causes abdominal cramps and severe bloody diarrhea and can lead to
kidney failure and death.
The number of those hospitalized rose to 58 from 51 Thursday. Eleven
children were in area hospitals receiving kidney dialysis treatment,
including the younger sister of [the three-year-old who died Sept. 4 from
kidney failure related to the disease.
Nine of the children were listed in serious condition.
Novello said that while they have traced the strain to the fairgrounds
well, which supplied non-chlorinated water to seven vendors on the West
side of the fair as well as a nearby restroom, they have yet to discover
how the well became contaminated.
One theory is pools of water that collected in nearby dairy barns after
torrential rains became contaminated by the _E.coli_ and then seeped into
the ground water that feeds the well.
_E.coli_ is found in cattle intestines and can spread to humans through
tainted meat and unpasteurized milk. Most types of _E. coli_ are harmless
and useful.
The well, which had been tested and cleared in June, wasn't expected to be
used, but drought conditions in New York this summer made fair organizers
decide to tap it.
