Since August 2017, both France and Italy have reported autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus. In France, the Var department is affected; in Italy, the Lazio and Calabria regions reported autochthonous transmission. The 2 events involve strains of different origin and are, therefore, not related.

As of 13 Oct 2017, the Ministry of Health in Italy has reported 297 chikungunya cases in the Lazio region, 170 of which are confirmed, and 54 cases in Guardavalle marina, Calabria region, where 9 of these cases were confirmed. This brings the number of chikungunya cases in the country to 358.

Since the previous CDTR and as of 15 Oct 2017, France has not reported any additional chikungunya cases.

[This report brings the total number of chikungunya virus infection cases from 298 on 4 Oct 2017 to 358 to cases as of 20 Oct 2017. These cases appear to have been acquired in the same localities previous reported, indicating ongoing transmission. It will not be surprising if more cases occur in these places. It is good to learn that there are no new cases in France.
