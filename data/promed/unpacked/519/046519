The National Chief of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Vicente González Aramayo, stated on [Fri 19 Oct 2018] that, "so far there are 19 positive cases of hantavirus in La Asunta. The most recent ones are 2 members of the Joint Task Force [JTF] who were evacuated to the Foianini Clinic in the city of Santa Cruz."

Hantaviruses cause a severe acute viral disease, transmitted by saliva, feces and urine of field mice (mainly long-tailed mice).

"To improve management and avoid complications, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the 2 JTF personnel were evacuated from La Asunta to the Foianini clinic in the department of Santa Cruz," the official explained.

Both soldiers were transported yesterday [Thu 16 Oct 2018] in an Armed Force helicopter with the corresponding safety and protection measures.

"The laboratory was installed in the La Asunta municipality in order to make a timely diagnosis for patients and avoid complications. That is how these cases are detected in time to initiate treatment," stated González Aramayo.

Given this situation, up to now 40 confirmed hantavirus [infection] cases have been reported in the country: 19 from the JTF camps in the La Asunta municipality in La Paz [department], 2 in Cochabamba, 9 in Tarija and 10 in Santa Cruz.

The patients are currently hemodynamically stable (arterial pressure and heart rate) without apparent complications.

[Prompt helicopter evacuation of the 2 affected soldiers to a more sophisticated hospital was a wise measure. HPS can develop rapidly and ground transportation would have been physically difficult for the 2 patients. The previous ProMED posts of this cluster of cases reported 9 affected soldiers (see Hantavirus - Americas (53): Bolivia (LP) 20181011.6085684), then 13, including 2 in intensive care and one death, and now 19 cases. Hantavirus infections have occurred previously in various parts of Bolivia, including in tropical areas of La Paz department. Occurrence of scattered hantavirus infections in soldiers in military camps in Bolivia is not surprising although a cluster of cases occurring in 3 different areas at the same time is unusual. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last several years in Bolivia are not reported.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include:

Dr. Jan Clement earlier pointed out the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY
