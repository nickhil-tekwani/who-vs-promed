[1] COVID response: masks
Date: Tue 22 Feb 2022

[IW] is so fed up with the US response to Covid-19 that she's seriously considering moving to Europe. "I'm that disgusted. The lack of care for each other, to me, it's too much," said IW, 30, of Los Angeles. She has multiple sclerosis and takes a medicine that suppresses her immune system. "As a Black disabled person, I feel like nobody gives a [expletive] about me or my safety."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a strict definition of who is considered moderately or severely immunocompromised, such as cancer patients undergoing active treatment and organ transplant recipients. Still, millions of other people are living with chronic illnesses or disabilities that also make them especially susceptible to the disease. Though vulnerability differs based on each person and their health condition -- and can depend on circumstances -- catching COVID is a risk they cannot take.

As a result, these Americans who are at high risk -- and the loved ones who fear passing along the virus to them -- are speaking out about being left behind as the rest of society drops pandemic safeguards such as masking and physical distancing.

Their fears were amplified this month [February 2022] as several Democratic governors, including the leaders of California and New York -- places that were out front in implementing mask mandates early on -- moved to lift such safety requirements. To many people, the step signaled that "normal" life was returning. But for people considered immunocompromised or who face high risks from COVID because of other conditions, it upped the level of anxiety.

"I know my normal is never going to be normal," said [CN], 44, of Indiana, Pennsylvania, a kidney transplant recipient who takes immunosuppressive drugs to prevent his body from rejecting his transplanted organ. "I'm still going to be wearing a mask in public. I'm still probably going to go to the grocery store late at night or early in the morning to avoid other people."

He is especially concerned because his wife and young daughter recently tested positive for COVID. Even though he's fully vaccinated, he's not sure he is protected from the virus's worst outcomes. [CN] participates in a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine study tracking transplant recipients' immune response to the vaccine, so he knows his body produced only a low amount of antibodies after the 3rd dose and is waiting on the results of the 4th. For now, he's isolating himself from his wife and 2 kids for 10 days by staying in his 2nd garage.

"I told my wife when COVID first happened, 'I have to make it to the vaccine,'" he said. But learning the vaccine hasn't triggered an adequate immune-system response so far is crushing. "Your world really changes. You start wondering, 'Am I going to be a statistic? Am I going to be a number to people that don't seem to care?'"

Scientists estimate that almost 3% of Americans meet the strict definition of having weakened immune systems, but researchers acknowledge that many more chronically ill and disabled Americans could be severely affected if they catch COVID.

By summer 2021, scientific evidence indicated that immunocompromised people would likely benefit from a 3rd shot, but it took federal agencies time to update their guidance. Even then, only certain groups of immunocompromised people were eligible, leaving others out.

In October [2021], the CDC again quietly revised its vaccine guidance to allow immunocompromised people to receive a 4th COVID vaccine dose, though a recent KHN story revealed that pharmacists unaware of this change were still turning away eligible people in January [2022].

People with weakened immune systems or other high-risk conditions argue that now is the time, as the omicron surge subsides, to double down on policies that protect vulnerable Americans like them.

"The pandemic isn't over," said Matthew Cortland, a senior fellow working on disability and health care for Data for Progress, who is chronically ill and immunocompromised. "There is no reason to believe that another variant won't emerge. ... Now is the time, as this omicron wave begins to recede, to pursue policies and interventions that protect chronically ill, disabled, and immunocompromised people so that we aren't left behind."

Several people interviewed by KHN who are part of this community said that, instead, the opposite is taking place, pointing to a January [2022] comment by CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky that implied it was "encouraging news" that the majority of people dying of COVID were already sick.

"The overwhelming number of deaths, over 75%, occurred in people who had at least 4 comorbidities, so really these are people who were unwell to begin with," said Walensky, when discussing a study during a television interview that showed the level of protection vaccinated people had against severe illness from COVID. "And yes, really encouraging news in the context of omicron."

Although the CDC later said Walensky's remarks were taken out of context, [KC], a 29-year-old multimedia producer living in Brooklyn, New York, said she was disturbed by the comments.

Walensky's statement "sent shock waves through the disability community and the chronic illness community," said [KC], who has had 2 liver transplants. "It was saying the quiet part out loud," she added, noting that though it was likely a gaffe, the strong reaction to it "stemmed from this holistic feeling that these communities have not been prioritized during the pandemic and it feels like our lives are acceptable losses."

When asked by a KHN reporter at the 9 Feb 2022 White House COVID press briefing what she wanted to convey to people who feel they are being left behind, Walensky didn't offer a clear answer.

"We, of course, have to make recommendations that are, you know, relevant for New York City and rural Montana," she said, adding that they have to be "relevant for the public, but also for the public who is immunocompromised and disabled. And so, that -- all of those considerations are taken into account as we work on our guidance."

Although the CDC currently recommends that vaccinated people continue to wear masks indoors if they are in a place with high or substantial COVID transmission -- which includes most of the US -- federal officials have indicated this guidance may be updated soon.

"We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing, when these metrics are better, and then have the ability to reach for them again should things worsen," said Walensky during a 16 Feb 2022 White House COVID briefing, when discussing whether CDC's COVID prevention policies would be altered soon.

[The US population in general who are anxious for the pandemic to be over, are proceeding as if it is over. Yet, there have been more than 11 000 deaths due to COVID in the last 7 days. The death toll in the US has surpassed that of every other country. The dilemma is how to protect the health of vulnerable individuals, including the elderly and those with immunocompromised and other debilitating conditions at the same time, for example, as allowing children to return to a life where they can see their teacher smile and regain social skills and mental health. All of the people who are suffering economic hardships due to restrictions must also be considered. It is a difficult problem that cries out for public dialog free of politics and without rancor. With some exceptions, the tenor of the conversation to date has not been conducive to solving the problem. Messaging has been particularly inadequate, as noted in this report, exacerbating the problem. But as has been stated by many others, masks alone, while effective, won't control COVID. What are also needed are innovative ideas on how to reach the unvaccinated, improved distribution of rapid tests, and greater accessibility of COVID-19 treatments. This will become even more important as new variants emerge.

Read "New COVID variants likely and 'could be worse' than omicron, say government health advisers" in the Evening Standard (https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/other/new-covid-variants-likely-and-could-be-worse-than-omicron-say-government-advisers/ar-AAU8rvh, abridged, edited)

"Sir Patrick Vallance told the public that the pandemic was far from over and said, "we expect there to be more variants and they could be more severe."

The government's chief scientific adviser said coronavirus will continue to evolve over the next few years, adding there was no guarantee the next variant would have as reduced severity as the omicron variant.

"As it evolves, what it's trying to do is transmit more readily," Sir Patrick said. He added that protecting the most vulnerable people in society was absolutely crucial, and said the next year or more was a period of "quite unstable evolution." - Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[2] Ivermectin and COVID
Date: Tue 22 Feb 2022

Ivermectin and COVID-19: Legal intervention in clinical practice exposes patients to serious harm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America), HIVMA (HIV Medicine Association), and SHEA (Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America) response to lawsuits demanding ivermectin for COVID-19 patients]

Clinicians, scientists and public health leaders on the front lines of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic remain eager for new safe and effective therapies to treat the disease. The suffering and loss of life due to COVID-19 are tragic. We empathize with patients and their loved ones and are working to ensure the best care and outcomes for all.

It is for this reason that we insist upon rigorous scientific review processes and standards to ensure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 therapies and that we entrust medical decision-making to experts. To provide optimal outcomes for infected patients, treatment decisions should be made using evidence-based data and not anecdotal opinions. Efforts to influence clinical practice through lawsuits, including recent cases ordering hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients with ivermectin, could expose patients to serious harm and undermine the evaluation of COVID-19 treatments.

Regulatory drug review
----------------------
It is critical to our nation's public health that COVID-19 therapies be adequately studied and that data supporting their use be evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in a transparent manner. FDA is considered the global gold standard for safety and effectiveness review of medical products, and we rely upon FDA expertise now more than ever. Established FDA processes help to ensure that treatments are safe and effective, inform clinicians on optimal use and build public confidence.

To make therapies available as rapidly as possible during the pandemic, FDA has reviewed data quickly and utilized the Emergency Use Authorization mechanism repeatedly, including to authorize 15 therapeutics for COVID-19 (as of 18 Feb 2022). To date, ivermectin has not been authorized as a COVID-19 treatment by FDA.

COVID-19 clinical guidelines
----------------------------
The National Institutes of Health and professional societies have rapidly developed and updated clinical guidelines to keep pace with evolving science and therapeutic options.

In March 2020, IDSA formed a multidisciplinary panel of experts composed of infectious diseases clinicians, pharmacists, and guideline specialists to develop rapid, evidence-based guidelines on COVID-19 treatment and management. These guidelines have been continuously updated since that time to reflect new research findings. In assessing the literature regarding the use of ivermectin in patients with COVID-19, the guideline panel has determined the certainty of evidence is very low for both hospitalized patients and outpatients. For this reason, the panel has made a conditional recommendation against the use of ivermectin in these populations outside the context of a clinical trial. The panel has also stated that well-designed, adequately powered, and well-executed clinical trials are needed to inform decisions on treating COVID-19 with ivermectin.(1)

Clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 are relying upon their extensive training, evidence-based guidelines, and peer reviewed literature to evaluate individual patients and make the recommendations and treatment decisions most likely to result in positive outcomes. To ensure patients receive evidence-based care and achieve optimal outcomes, it is critical to avoid inappropriate interference in the practice of medicine.

[3] Reinfection: omicron BA.1 followed by BA.2

Citation: Stegger M, Edslev SM, Sieber RN, et al. Occurrence and significance of omicron BA.1 infection followed by BA.2 reinfection medRxiv 2022.02.19.22271112 (preprint not certified by peer review)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The newly found omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern has rapidly spread worldwide. Omicron carries numerous mutations in key regions and is associated with increased transmissibility and immune escape. The variant has recently been divided into 4 subvariants with substantial genomic differences, in particular between omicron BA.1 and BA.2. With the surge of omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2, a large number of reinfections from earlier cases has been observed, raising the question of whether BA.2 specifically can escape the natural immunity acquired shortly after a BA.1 infection.

To investigate this, we selected a subset of samples from more than 1.8 million cases of infections in the period from 22 Nov 2021 until 11 Feb 2022. Here, individuals with 2 positive samples, more than 20 and less than 60 days apart, were selected. From a total of 187 reinfection cases, we identified 47 instances of BA.2 reinfections shortly after a BA.1 infection, mostly in young unvaccinated individuals with mild disease not resulting in hospitalization or death. In conclusion, we provide evidence that omicron BA.2 reinfections do occur shortly after BA.1 infections but are rare.

Discussion
Given the short time period between infections it could be reasonable to re-evaluate the definition by ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] that requires 2 positive samples with more than 60 days apart in order to consider reinfection.

Omicron BA.2 reinfections after either delta or BA.1 initial infections, were mainly observed among young individuals below the age of 30 and the majority of these cases were not vaccinated, further emphasizing the enhanced immunity obtained by the combination of vaccination and infection compared to infection induced immunity only. For the omicron BA.1 infection to BA.2 reinfection among cases aged 15 or above, only 13% (3/24) had completed the primary vaccination program contrary to the overall vaccination rate in Denmark of >80%.

The capability of omicron BA.2 to cause reinfections in recently infected omicron BA.1 cases with low or no vaccination protection may be an intrinsic BA.2 property.

We observed significantly reduced overall viral load in secondary BA.2 infection samples compared to initial infection together with a lower ratio of subgenomic to genomic RNA. Taken together, this may indicate a more superficial and transient secondary infection that could be explained by T cell-mediated immunity obtained during the 1st infection.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that omicron BA.2 reinfections are rare but can occur relatively shortly after a BA.1 infection, causing mostly mild disease in unvaccinated young individuals. The reinfections were identified among SARS-CoV-2 cases testing positive for more than one time in a country with a high PCR test capacity and extensive community transmission.

[In the past 24 hours, 42 countries including South Korea (171 448), Germany (158 507), Russia (135 172), the USA (125 281), Japan (122 276), Brazil (101 285), France (97 382), Turkey (86 070), Italy (60 137), Indonesia (57 491), Viet Nam (56 149), UK (40 877), The Netherlands (34 665), Australia (29 616), Denmark (28 773), Malaysia (27 179), Belgium (26 345), Singapore (26 032), Ukraine (24 440), Spain (22 194), Iran (22 073), Austria (21 427), Thailand (21 232), Greece (19 601), Chile (19 476), Poland (18 771), Mexico (18 309), Norway (17 749), India (16 965), Argentina (16 950), Switzerland (14 954), Romania (14 775), Réunion (13 632), Czech Republic (13 509), Slovakia (13 420), Portugal (13 103), Georgia (12 101), Latvia (11 837), and Israel (10 107) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 16 300 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 20 Feb 2022 to late 21 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 83 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 39 of the 83 countries are from the European region, 14 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 10 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 12.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 39.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 14.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.89 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 428.28 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.92 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA]
