Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 07 Feb 2012
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 13 Feb 2012
Date submitted to OIE: 03 Mar 2012
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 : iou-Jia District, T'Ai-Nan
Date of start of the outbreak: 07 Feb 2012
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm

Species: birds
Susceptible: 4840
Cases: 804
Deaths: 804
Destroyed: 4036
Slaughtered: 0

Affected population: broiler breeder
Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 1

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: clinical cases were notified from the abattoir. The local disease control center (LDCC) traced back to the original broiler breeder farm. Movement restrictions and clinical and epidemiological investigation have been implemented. The mortality rate was about 16.6 per cent. All the chickens on the farm were destroyed by LDCC as a precautionary measure on 10 Feb 2012. The results of RT-PCR test, HA0 cleavage site sequencing, and pathogenicity test were obtained on 13 Feb 2012 and 20 Feb 2012, respectively. The results confirmed that the virus is classified as H5N2 HPAI virus. Clinical and epidemiological investigations were implemented on the surrounding poultry farms of the infected farm. No clinical suspected case or evidence of infection was detected.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, zoning, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[In the 1st place, it is important to note this is an H5N2 virus, not the H5N1 virus which has caused human mortality in Asia and other places. Then, it appears as if the outbreak has not spread. Finally, this is another case where disease control begins at an abattoir, which for animal origin epidemics is so critical. Yet our strategies for incorporating various level of personnel at such slaughterhouse into our emergency response structure has not evolved as rapidly as other areas within the veterinary community.
