Laboratory tests have shown that sheep in Denmark have contracted
bluetongue, the EU Commission confirmed Sunday [14 Oct 2007].

The herd was near Sakskbing on the island of Lolland, and one animal
had already died.

The EU Commission and the 27 member states had in early October 2007
agreed on preventative and security measures to be taken to combat
the insect-borne disease and to toughen notification duties.

The EU has registered 23 500 cases since August 2006.

Bluetongue has taken another turn after spreading to sheep in 2
Suffolk farms, government vets confirmed today [Sun 14 Oct 2007].

The virus had previously only been circulating among cattle, but it
has now been found in 2 flocks of sheep, the Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said.

It is a worrying development, as sheep are more susceptible to the
virus, and up to 70 per cent of flocks can be wiped out, although no
sheep are believed to have died from the virus yet.

The disease -- which has spread across the continent during the past
year -- emerged in the UK last month [September 2007] when a cow on a
farm near Ipswich was hit.

Since then, the virus has migrated into Essex, and more than 30
cattle herds have been affected.

A Defra spokeswoman said vets have confirmed that the virus had been
found in sheep flocks, although officials have not named the farms
involved.

Bluetongue has attacked cattle and sheep on the continent, and
experts are not surprised at the spread of the virus in the UK.

The news comes as the government is preparing to ease the
restrictions in East Anglia on moving livestock.

Defra initially imposed the restrictions in an attempt to limit the
spread of the disease, but they were set to be loosened from tomorrow
[15 Oct 2007] in an attempt to aid struggling farmers.

A National Farmers' Union spokesman said: "This isn't good news, but
it's not a surprise. Bluetongue is a disease which affects cattle and
sheep, so it's not unexpected that it's now been found in sheep."

The virus is spread by infected midges and is not passed on from
animal to animal.

Experts believe it was carried into England by midges blown across
the sea from the European coast.

Animals display a variety of symptoms and are normally culled [This
statement is arguable; there are animals -- particularly cattle -- in
which the disease may take a mild or subclinical form, not justifying
culling. Some sheep breeds may be particularly sensitive, with high
mortality and with a certain percentage of the surviving animals
suffering chronic changes and a protracted convalescence period,
which may justify culling. - Mod.AS].

Official figures handed to the World Animal Health Organisation [OIE]
reveal that about 60 infected animals have now been found.

It was hoped that a cold winter would help eradicate the disease by
killing the midges that carry it from animal to animal, but the
conditions in northern mainland Europe last year [2006] were too mild
to prevent the virus from reemerging to devastate flocks.

Epidemiologists are now carrying out urgent research to find out
whether midges with the disease survived the winter by breeding
inside shelters used by livestock. [This may relate to the raised
assumption that one of the suspected BTV-8 vectors, _Culicoides
dewulfi_, a cattle-dung breeder, may possess the potential to
accomplish its cycle within the cowsheds while protected from the
external low temperatures. - Mod.AS].

Vets at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have
also revealed that they expect the virus to continue spreading into
December 2007, raising fears that it will reach areas of intense
sheep farming, where it could decimate the industry.

[It is of importance to obtain information about the breed and age of
the affected sheep.

Susceptibility of sheep to bluetongue is breed-related. Reportedly,
there are at least 85 breeds of sheep in the UK. Subscribers are
invited to provide data on the respective population-sizes and the
geographic distribution of the various sheep breeds within the UK. -
