Poliomyelitis - Dominican Republic and Haiti, 2000--2001 [edited

From 12 Jul 2000 - 18 Sep 2001, a total of 21 cases of poliomyelitis
(including 2 fatal cases) were reported from the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola, divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In the
Dominican Republic, 13 of 168 reported cases of acute flaccid paralysis
(AFP) were confirmed as polio by isolation of poliovirus type 1 from either
patients or their healthy contacts. The median age of the patients was 3
years (range: 9 months--14 years). None was vaccinated adequately.
The most recent confirmed case-patient in the Dominican Republic had
paralysis onset on 25 Jan 2001. In Haiti, 8 of 40 AFP cases were confirmed
virologically; 7 of the confirmed cases occurred during January--July 2001.
The median age of the patients was 7 years (range: 2--12 years). One
patient had received at least 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The
most recent confirmed case occurred in Haiti and the patient had paralysis
onset on 12 Jul 2001. Currently 18 AFP cases from the Dominican Republic
and 3 from Haiti are pending final classification.
This outbreak was the first in the Americas since 1991 and was associated
with the circulation of a type 1 OPV-derived virus, having substitutions
affecting 1.8% to 4.1% of nucleotides encoding the major capsid protein
(VP1). The circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the
outbreak recovered the capacity to cause paralytic disease and widespread
person-to-person transmission and was biologically indistinguishable from
type 1 wild poliovirus. Contemporary vaccine-derived poliovirus isolates
from persons with AFP cases in other countries of the Americas are more
closely related (>99.5% VP1 sequence similarity) to the respective OPV
strains, are unrelated to the Hispaniola outbreak viruses, and show no
evidence of extensive person-to-person transmission. The outbreak in
Hispaniola occurred in areas of very low OPV coverage.
In response to the outbreak, health authorities in both countries conducted
house-to-house vaccination with OPV. In December 2000, and February and
April 2001, 3 rounds of mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in the
Dominican Republic. In each round, approximately 1.2 million OPV doses were
administered to an estimated population of 1.1 million children aged <5
years. Haiti conducted 2 rounds of mass vaccination in February and March
2001. However, these campaigns were hampered by logistic difficulties and
heavy rains and reached an estimated 40% of the 1.2 million children aged
<5 years. During May--July 2001, a door-to-door and school-based campaign
among all 2.3 million children aged <10 years was conducted sequentially in
all of the country's departments. Preliminary results suggest that 2.4
million OPV doses were administered, and a second door-to-door campaign is
under way.
Travelers to the Dominican Republic and Haiti who are not vaccinated
adequately are at risk for polio. Travelers should have received poliovirus
vaccination according to national vaccination policies.

[It is unclear from this report if transmission of the type 1 OPV-derived
virus has been interrupted on Hispaniola. The date of onset of the last
confirmed case in the Dominican Republic was January 2001, and the last
case in Haiti is reported as 12 Jul 2001, but there are still 18 cases in
the Dominican Republic and 3 cases in Haiti pending confirmation for which
the dates of onset have not been given.
In the ProMED-mail posting this past January (2001), there was a report on
the circulation of a type 2 OPV-derived virus during the period 1988-1993
resulting in 32 cases of poliomyelitis. One hopes that the massive
vaccination campaign efforts conducted on Hispaniola will result in
interruption of transmission of this current outbreak. - Mod.MPP
