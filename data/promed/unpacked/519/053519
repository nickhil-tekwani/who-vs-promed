The Kebbi commissioner for health, Alhaji Usman Kambaza, said on [Fri 2 Mar 2018] that 36 cases of yellow fever have been recorded in 8 local government areas of the state. Kambaza told newsmen in Birnin Kebbi that to counter the spread of the disease and to prevent an epidemic in the affected areas, a yellow fever reactive vaccination campaign would be conducted in the areas. He said that yellow fever disease [had been] recorded in Bagudo, Fakai, Koko/Besse, Maiyama, Ngaski, Shango, Suru and Yauri local government areas.

The commissioner said 1.6 million people had been targeted for the 10-day campaign against the disease and 4000 health workers would be involved in the exercise. The vaccination campaign would be conducted from [Sun 10 to Mon 19 Mar 2018], and would be supported by national and international development partners that included the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO, the [Nigeria] Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI).

"Health workers for the exercise would be stationed at specific locations close to the residential houses in all the 85 wards in the 8 affected areas and no care giver would travel more than one kilometre to get their children vaccinated. The yellow fever vaccination is for age groups from 9 months to 45 years, irrespective of their vaccination status," he added.

[Kebbi state is located in far north western Nigeria. The latest (2006) published census indicates a population of 3 256 541, which is doubtless larger now. The occurrence of 36 cases yellow fever (YF) in this relatively large population is of concern. Health authorities are wise to initiate this ambitious vaccination in the very near future. Unfortunately, no information is provided about the 36 cases, so one does not know how recent they are nor if they are a cluster or scattered across the state although the above report mentions 8 affected areas, suggesting scattered cases. - Mod.TY
