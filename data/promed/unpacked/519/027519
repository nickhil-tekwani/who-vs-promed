Relief over foot-and-mouth test results
-----------------------------------
The country's agri-food sector was relieved yesterday at reports there was
no evidence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in preliminary tests conducted
on samples taken from pigs in Co Carlow.
A Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary official noted symptoms
similar to the highly infectious disease in some pigs delivered to Ballon
Meats near Tullow.
Department officials sealed off the plant and the farm from which the
consignment of 12 pigs had come, amid fears that the country was facing an
FMD crisis for the second time in 4 years.
As a precautionary measure, the samples were rushed to a laboratory at
Pirbright in Surrey, England, for scientific analysis.
Yesterday's initial findings showed there was no evidence of the presence
of the virus in the samples.
The news was welcomed by Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan, who
had been kept informed of the developments during the 36-hour scare.
A Government contingency plan restricting the movement of animals and
people and putting other measures in place to prevent the spread of the
disease was ready to be activated in the event of the tests proving positive.
The Department of Agriculture and Food said the remaining stages of the
testing process will be completed over the next few days, during which
access to the Carlow plant and farm will remain restricted.
A spokesman said this was on a precautionary basis and in line with
standard practice.
Fine Gael agriculture spokesman Deputy Denis Naughten welcomed the negative
test results but said the scare highlighted the need for the Minister for
Agriculture to outlaw risky practices that could threaten our animal
population.
"While the current focus is on FMD, we need to also be conscious of other
diseases such as BSE," Mr Naughten said.
"Ireland successfully eradicated the last outbreak of FMD and is currently
in the process of virtually eradicating BSE from the country. But these
efforts will count for little unless the Minister for Agriculture ensures
that risky practices allowed by the EU are outlawed," he said.
Mr Naughten said the EU needs to enhance the monitoring of imports and the
labelling of such products. It must also review its regulations on the
import of animal feedstuffs between member states and from non-EU countries.
Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association president Malcolm Thompson said
the scare was a reminder that people must remain vigilant against imported
food and livestock that does not have the same traceability as Irish product.

[The negative results of the current clinically suspected case are preliminary.
Preliminary negative results might be based upon ELISA testing. A positive
ELISA test for FMD virus can be obtained in about 3 hours. To declare a
case finally negative, virus isolation has to be attempted, a procedure
that requires two 48 hours passages in cell culture i.e. 96 hours in total.
