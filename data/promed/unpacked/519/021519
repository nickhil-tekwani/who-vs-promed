Rabid kitten found on Cranbrook campus
--------------------------------------
A kitten found on the Cranbrook Educational Campus has been confirmed
as carrying rabies. Cranbrook officials are asking that any person
who has visited and had contact with kittens while on the campus to
immediately notify Oakland County Health Division Communicable
Disease office and Cranbrook Campus Security.

"It will be particularly important to question your children
carefully about having any interaction with a young, stray kitten
while playing outdoors on Cranbrook campus recently, and to caution
them against approaching any stray animals in the area," a notice
being issued to each person entering the campus stated. "We are also
actively searching for any other kittens that might be in the
Brookside School area," the notice continued.

The campus is working with the county health division to monitor this
case. Rabies is a deadly viral disease found in the saliva of
infected animals, which can be spread from a bite or scratch.

A cat believed to be the mother was taken in for testing over the
weekend, but test results are not available yet, said Dominic
DeMarco, Cranbrook spokesman, and George Miller, spokesman for
Oakland County Health Division on Monday [6 Jul 2009].

If anyone sees any kittens in the Brookside School area, where the
infected animal was found, or any stray kittens on campus, Cranbrook
security is asking to be immediately notified. Besides the many
visitors to the campus, faculty families and students live there, as well.

The rabies case was found after a woman who works at Cranbrook
noticed the kitten displaying erratic behavior characteristic of an
animal with rabies. She took it to a veterinarian. The kitten was
tested, rabies was confirmed and the animal was euthanized. [More
likely, the animal was euthanized, then rabies was confirmed on the
brain of the dead kitten. - Mod.TG]

Miller said tthere are quite a few stray cats in county communities
and they can carry rabies. "Luckily, the lady noticed the kitten
acting strangely and took it to a veterinarian. I'm sure a lot of
people would have said 'I found it in the wild' and return it. She
did the right thing," Miller said.

There have been no other rabies cases reported in Oakland County with
kittens, he said. While dogs and cats can be carriers, it is more
commonly found in wild animals such as foxes, raccoons, skunks and bats.

"They bite or nick a dog or cat and pass it on. But when a cat is
living in the wild, anything is possible. We have had some concern
with bats. But there have definitely not been more cases than usual.
Bats are guilty until proven innocent." Miller praised Cranbrook for
taking immediate action and for notifying residents and guests.

"From time to time, we do testing," DeMarco said. "We thought we did
the right thing when we had it tested. We decided to do the right
thing to send notices out to people who live in the community and
anybody who is visiting. Fortunately, Oakland County people have been
very helpful with it. We will continue to monitor the situation and
if we have any more incidents we will report it" to the health
division and the people who live in and visit the campus. "There
hasn't been a 2nd positive test and we are hoping there will not be
one," DeMarco said.

Officials also have included in the notice information about rabies
and what to do if a person is scratched or bitten by an animal.
Prompt washing with soap and water is most effective prevention
against rabies, according to the health division.

To protect your family, note changes in normal behavior of animals,
such as a nighttime animal moving around during the day or a wild
animal that is not afraid of a person or animal. Other signs of
rabies are aggressive or confused behavior, inability to walk, eat or
drink, change in the sound of the animal's voice or drooling or
foaming at the mouth.

[This will be an interesting case to follow and see how many people
were exposed. While the kitten was found on the campus, does this
make the campus liable? Or will exposed individuals desiring the
post-exposure prophylaxis be paying for their own preventative, or
will their insurance pay? It seems the campus has acted honorably in
notifying people. It should not be their responsibility for
post-exposure treatment.

Cranbrook campus is located in the Detroit suburn of Bloomfield Hills
in Michigan
