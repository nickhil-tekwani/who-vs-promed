Bulgaria will restore the fence on its Turkish border, which existed
in the Cold War period, to prevent animals with foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) from entering it, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers has
decided.

Currently, a fence covers a mere 28.5 km of the 209.5 km border. The
existing fence will be repaired, and a new one will be constructed to
cover all the rest.

The governors of the 3 regions through which the territory of the
fence will pass, those of Burgas, Haskovo and Yambol, will issue
orders for its construction. It will be financed by the country's
Finance Ministry and facilitated by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The new fence must be completed by October 2011, as FMD spreads
faster when temperatures are low.

After 12 years without FMD cases in Bulgaria, in late December
[2010], the 1st outbreak was detected near the south eastern village
of Kosti. Up to now, 6 villages in south east Bulgaria have registered
FMD outbreaks. At the end of March 2011, the agency announced that as
many as 700 animals might have to be euthanized to prevent the spread
of FMD in Strandzha, triggering mass farmers' protest rallies and
blockades.

In the Cold War period, the Bulgarian-Turkish border was a border
between the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact and NATO and as such was one
of the most-heavily fortified borders in Europe. Since the early
1990s, Bulgaria has torn down its border fortifications and dismissed
its Third Army, which was deployed in the area.

Because of the enormous amount of military equipment and large
numbers of soldiers concentrated in south eastern Bulgaria, the area
among the towns of Elhovo, Grudovo (today called Sredets), and
Zvezdets was known as the "Triangle of Death."

Bulgaria's intention to build a new fence on its Turkish border comes
as Greece is also planning a similar measure but designed to tackle
the influx of illegal immigrants from the Middle East via Turkey.

Turkey has met with suspicion the intentions of the 2 countries to
build border fences. According to the chairman of the Turkish Center
for International Relations and Strategic Analysis, Sinan Ogan, the 2
countries have hidden agendas.

[In case Bulgaria's decision to (re)construct the fence on its border
with Turkish Thrace is solely based upon epizootiological
considerations, this may be interpreted as Bulgaria challenging the
FMD-free status of Thrace. This region has been recognised by the OIE
as an "FMD free zone with vaccination" according to Resolution No. 15
of OIE's 78th General Session, Paris, May 2010.

The alleged Turkish origin of the Bulgarian outbreak is supported by
the close relatedness of the Bulgarian strain to Turkish 2010
FMDV-serotype O strain PanAsia-2ANT-10 (topotype ME-SA), as can be
seen in the WRLFMD genotyping report of 5 samples from Bulgarian
cattle, published 31 Mar 2011, available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00015%20O%20Bulgaria%202011.pdf.

The actual current situation in Turkish Thrace deserves to be
revisited and thoroughly investigated. In the apparent absence of
clinical complaints/observations there, an urgent performance of a
surveillance operation, covering large and small ruminants, is
prescribed. Ideally, wildlife (particularly boars) should be included.
