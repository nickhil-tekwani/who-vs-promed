Cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Orahovac and Gjakovica
------------------------------------------------------------------
Beta has reported that 2 people from Orahovac have died as a consequence of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and 9 others from Gjakovica have suffered
infection. The first cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever appeared 10
days earlier in the village of Sinovce, which is near Orahovac. Of the
infected, 2 are doctors who went to help the villagers. Skender Boshnjaku,
Director of the Health Institute in Pristina, stated that: "The disease is
a very serious one with a high extent of mortality and that is why we are
trying to get organized for a successful battle against it."
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is transmitted by ticks, with fatal
consequences for 15 to 70 percent of those infected. The disease can be
transmitted by contact with the body fluids of an infected person. People
living in rural areas with poor sanitary conditions are at greatest risk,
followed closely by slaughter house workers and veterinarians.
According to [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
appearance of Crimean-Congo fever is not something new for Eastern Europe.
This disease was noticed for the first time in the Crimea in 1941 and from
then on it showed up in Africa, middle Asia and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe. Cattle are also at risk from Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
The symptoms of the disease start to appear 9 days after infection. Fever,
sensitivity to light, headache, pain in the neck and in the stomach, and
vomiting, are among the first symptoms. After that, subcutaneous bleeding
starts. About 4 days after the first symptoms, the infected person becomes
depressed, and exhibits tachycardia and swelling of the lymph nodes. In the
final phase, the infected person has a bloody urine and gum hemorrhage.
After the fifth day of the infection, the patient exhausted by the disease
dies as a result of kidney and respiratory failure. Patients that succeeded
in fighting the disease usually start to recover after the ninth day.

Acute Haemorrhagic Fever Syndrome in Kosovo
-------------------------------------------
The WHO Office in Kosovo has reported 27 cases and 4 deaths between 18 May
and 7 Jun 2001 in the southwestern area. Samples have been sent for
laboratory confirmation of the disease to the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research in Ljubljana,
Slovenia, a partner in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. The
health authorities have implemented prevention and control measures and are
investigating the outbreak.

[It is not certain that the WHO Disease Outbreaks Report refers to the same
outbreak that in the Macedonian press report is attributed to Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus infection. However, it seems likely that this is
the case, since the town of Orahovac lies about 50 km southwest of
Pristina. - Mod.CP
