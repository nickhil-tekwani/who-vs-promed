In the south of Deux-Sevres [department in western France] near Lezay, 2
herds totalling 200 cattle infected with brucellosis are being slaughtered.
The [causative] bacterium [_Brucella abortus_ and other species] is less
infectious than the foot and mouth disease virus. [Human] infection can
cause illness, [which may be prolonged], but is [rarely] fatal.

[Brucellosis is also known as undulant fever in people. It can be
transmitted to people through the fluids associated with the birthing
process in cattle if [these are] splashed into the eyes or contact abraded
skin. People may also acquire the disease through unpasteurized milk. The
disease in people is treatable with antibiotics but may be fatal if left
untreated. Cattle do not usually die from the disease, but calves of
infected cows may be stillborn or die shortly after calving. - Mod.TG]
