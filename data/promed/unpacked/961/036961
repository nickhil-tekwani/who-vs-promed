[According to the report above, which includes an interactive map, all 40 cattle showing FMD clinical signs have been destroyed. No stamping out, addressing the remaining 860 in-contact-cattle and 3165 sheep/goats, has been applied. The serotype is not yet known.

Reportedly, vaccination in response to the outbreak has been carried out, apparently exclusively in the animals (cattle, sheep, and goats) remaining in the affected holding. Which vaccine serotype(s) was/were included in the vaccine used?! on which ground?

During previous FMD outbreaks in Kazakhstan (2012), serotypes O and A were reported from the Zhambyl oblast in south Kazakhstan, adjacent to the border with Kyrgyzstan. An isolate collected on 1 Feb 2012 was sent for genotyping to the World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright, UK (WRLFMD). According to the said laboratory, the said strain was eventually defined as FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, genotype/strain Iran-05 (HER-10); see WRLFMD genotyping report IAH-P-EP-MEG-FOR-005-3 at http://tinyurl.com/cn8btzq.

The current outbreak is situated in the extreme eastern side of Kazakhstan, close to the border with China. In the adjacent Chinese province of Xinjiang, 3 outbreaks of FMD serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97 (thus different from the 2012 serotype A strain in Kazakhstan) have been recorded in cattle since April 2013, the last of which was reported today (15 May 2013) to the OIE (follow-up report no. 2; see at http://tinyurl.com/chcmfrm).

According to China's official reports to the OIE, the epizootic of FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97 started in pigs in Guangdong on 18 Feb 2013. In view of the data accumulated since -- including detection of outbreaks in several provinces throughout China, including the 3 mentioned outbreaks in Xinjiang, as well as the penetration of this strain into Russia (Zabaykalsky kray) at the beginning of March 2013 -- it may be plausible to assume that the Chinese epizootic may have started earlier and that its spread is of wide dimensions. It seems that no potent vaccine has become available or applicable in China so far; stamping out policy is applied.

It will be interesting to obtain serotyping results of the current FMDV strain in East Kazakhstan. In case this is a serotype A FMD virus, genotyping may allow pinpointing its origin. - Mod.AS
