A mass slaughter of livestock has taken place in an effort to halt an
epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD despite resistance
from farmers, officials said yesterday.
A Beijing official said the fatal and highly contagious viral disease
among pigs and cattle had been found last month in Ningde city in
Fujian province, Baisha county in Hainan and the Xigazi region of
Tibet.
Xigazi recorded the highest number of animals slaughtered -- 60
cows and 1195 pigs.
"We ordered immediate mass killings of infected animals and the
sealing of those areas for sterilization," said Wang Changjiang,
vice-director of the veterinary bureau under the Ministry of
Agriculture.
Mr Wang said some farmers who were reluctant to give up their
livestock resisted. Some tried to evade paying the state slaughter
tax by killing livestock privately and selling their meat on the black
market.
"We have had some problems in having peasants pay for
vaccinations required after the FMD was discovered last month,"
Mr Wang said.
He said the 3 areas had been cleansed, but a Tibetan official said
farms in Xigazi were still under quarantine. "It will take another
month for observing and treatment," said Ren Qing, an officer with
Tibet's Veterinary Office.
Mr Ren said it was difficult to enforce mass slaughter in Tibet
because herding was a major source of income to locals. He said:
"The animals in the remote border areas are basically untouched.
But there were mass killings in urban areas to contain the disease.
Peasants are not happy as there is no compensation or subsidy
for the animals killed."
Although Beijing sent 1.5 million vaccination shots to Tibet, the
supplies were not enough to cover the region's two million livestock.
