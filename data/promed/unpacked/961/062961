A day after a 12-year-old boy in Kozhikode succumbed to the Nipah virus, Kerala health minister Veena George confirmed that 11 more people, including the child's mother, are showing symptoms of the viral infection.

Samples have been taken from all 11 persons suspected of contracting Nipah virus, of which results for 8 samples are expected by Monday [6 Sep 2021] night, said Veena George.

An animal husbandry team has inspected the house and premises where the 12-year-old lived with his family. Samples have been collected from 2 goats owned by the family. Samples have also been taken from 2 rambutan trees in their plot, as bats may have bitten the fruits on the tree. The team also found a habitat of bats across the lake from the house. A Bhopal NIV team will reach here on Wednesday [8 Sep 2021] to collect samples.

The state health department is closely monitoring the cases and meticulously conducting contact tracing, said the health minister. As many as 251 contacts have been identified, of which 54 people are in the high-risk category.

The health department will begin conducting house-to-house surveillance from Tuesday [7 Sep 2021] to see if anyone has symptoms or has been left out from contacts.

Earlier in the day [Mon 6 Sep 2021], the Kerala government issued a Nipah management plan listing the health protocol to be followed by government and private hospitals. District authorities can prepare a separate management plan for Nipah and also informed that the treatment and discharge guidelines were also published.

State health minister Veena George has asked all districts authorities to remain cautious and to keep under observation those who are affected by encephalitis. Healthcare workers, field workers, doctors and other staff of private hospitals, and others will be given special training.

Nipah is a zoonotic virus, i.e., it spreads from animals to humans. The Nipah virus is transmitted from flying foxes (fruit bats) [genus _Pteropus_] to animals and humans. Generally, it affects animals like pigs, dogs, and horses, among others. If spread among humans, Nipah virus can cause serious illness, which may result in death.

The World Health Organisation says the Nipah virus infects a range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, which makes it a cause of concern for public health. Nipah virus can be transmitted through "contaminated food or directly between people. In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis," WHO says in its guidelines on Nipah virus [see https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus].

[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sending in the above report.

The follow-up on the fatal Nipah virus (NPV) infection has identified 11 people suspected of having become infected with the virus. With the possibility of other virus diseases circulating in the local population, laboratory confirmation of these suspected cases is essential to rule NPV infection in or out. The results of the laboratory tests are awaited with interest.

NPV can be transmitted from an infected individual to susceptible ones. There is also a risk of infection from consumption of fruit contaminated by NPV-infected fruit bats. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for NPV infections, nor is a commercial vaccine available. The Kerala government's issuance of a Nipah management plan listing the health protocol to be followed by government and private hospitals is a prudent precaution. - Mod.TY
