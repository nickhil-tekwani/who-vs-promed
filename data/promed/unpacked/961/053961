Cattle vaccination against foot-and-mouth starts in Russian Far East
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A large-scale vaccination program to protect cattle from FMD has begun in
Russia's far-eastern Maritime Territory, a local agricultural department
official said Monday. Alexander Tabachenko said over 150 000 vaccine doses
against the Asia 1 (FMDV-Asia 1) virus had been delivered to the region, and
160 000 more were expected in the next few days. This will allow all cattle at
state and private farms to be vaccinated.
The spokesman said more than 2500 large cattle and 1000 small [livestock] had
already been vaccinated in the Spassky district, and the program was also
under way in the Pozharsky, Kirovsky, and Dalnerechensky districts, where the
disease was also discovered.
Quarantine has been imposed in Spassky district since 26 Aug 2005, and all the
markets where farmers usually sell meat and milk are closed, a spokesman for
the local authorities said.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include a move to draw up a
comprehensive register of cattle in Maritime Territory, and a ban on free
cattle transportation, the spokesman said.

More foot-and-mouth cases suspected in Russian Far East
-------------------------------------------------------
Specialists are in Russia's Primorye region near the Chinese border
to investigate the possible spread of foot-and-mouth disease to more
cattle, according to local government officials.
Physicians, epidemiologists and veterinarians have traveled from
Vladivostok to the Spassky district in Russia's Primorye region to
diagnose 15 cows suspected of contracting the foot-and-mouth disease,
the Primorye civil defense and emergencies agency told Interfax.
Earlier, about 150 FMD cases were registered in the Bikino and Vyazemsky
districts of Russia's Khabarovsk region, which borders China. All sick animals
diagnosed with the FMD virus type Asia 1 were culled.
China's Ministry of Agriculture has said they have no information that the
disease has crossed the border and would take immediate action if such an
event occurred. [It seems at least as likely that the disease crossed into
Russia from China. - Mod.JW].

FMD outbreak keeps maritime village children away from school
-------------------------------------------------------------
Maritime authorities, fearing the spread of FMD, closed the school in the
village of Krasny Kut, where the nidus of the infection was detected.
[Presumably it is the village, not the school, that is the nidus (focus).
Humans are not affected by FMD, but can move the infection from place to place
on their shoes and vehicle tires. - Mod.JW].
Veterinary and police cordons fully sealed off the village from the
outside world, and a disinfection barrier was put up on the approach
road. Authorities arranged the supply of foodstuffs for the
quarantined settlement, the regional crisis commission said on Monday
[29 Aug 2005].
46 cattle of the village's herd of 140 cows were found to be infected with
FMD. No decision to slaughter the cattle has been made yet. Veterinarians are
now trying to cure the sick animals. [This ambiguous statement, as well as
other aspects of the outbreak -- in particular the locations affected --
underline the urgent need for an official update by Russia's veterinary
services. The last update was sent to the OIE on 30 Jun 2005. - Mod. AS].
Meanwhile, 2 more suspected nidi [foci] of the infection have been found since
Sunday [28 Aug 2005]: in the village of Krasnorechensk, Kirovsky district,
where 15 cows fell ill, and in the village of Ignatyevka, Luchegorsk district,
where the virus is believed to have sickened 12 animals. [According to
available information, Luchgorsk is the administrative center of Pozharsky
District. - Mod AS].
Russia's Maritime territory launch an all-out vaccination of the cattle
against the Asia-1 serotype. The local veterinary services received more than
150 000 doses of the vaccine. The inoculation began in the districts bordering
on China. It is due to be completed on 30 Aug 2005.
The regional emergency situations commission recommends residents to
buy meat and dairy products only at standard retail outlets. Authorities are
eliminating unsanctioned trade in meat and have stepped up control over
authorities retail outlets. [This is to contain spread by contaminated meat,
not to protect human health; infected meat is safe to eat. - Mod.JW]

[FMD, serotype Asia 1, is spreading in Russia's Far East, which is one of
Russia's 7 federal districts. The disease has been identified, since June
2005, in separate locations hundreds of miles distant from each other, in 3
out of the 8 geographic subdivisions of the Far East, namely Amur oblast,
Khabarovsk Krai and -- most recently -- Primorsky Krai (Maritime Province).
All foci are situated on the Chinese border.
Primorsky Krai, 168 100 sq km (64 900 sq mi), 1992 pop 2 309 000, is
situated in the most south-eastern part of Russia's Far East, between
China (Manchuria or the Northeast) in the west and the Sea of Japan
in the east. The capital is Vladivostok. It is divided into 24
subdistricts, of which -- reportedly -- 4 have already been found
infected, namely Spassky, Pozharsky, Kirovsky, and Dalnerechensky.
Vladivostok is the final destination of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at the
end of a 6000 mile route from Moscow. Hopefully, it will not become a
route for the westward travel of the emerging Asia 1 virus.
An official Russian update of the current outbreak is long overdue. - Mod.AS].
