Salmonellosis Associated with Pet Turtles - Wisconsin and Wyoming, 2004
--------------------------------------------------
Salmonellosis associated with small pet turtles in the USA was a major
public health concern in the 1970s (1). In 1975, the FDA banned commercial
distribution of small turtles (i.e., those with a carapace of less than 4
inches) (2). The FDA ban prevents an estimated 100 000 cases of
salmonellosis among children each year (3). However, a recent resurgence in
the sale of small turtles has generated concern. In Wisconsin and Wyoming,
at least 6 human cases of salmonellosis have been linked to such turtles.
This report describes the investigation into those cases. The findings
underscore the need for health and environmental officials to prevent
illegal distribution of small turtles and consider patient contact with
turtles when investigating salmonellosis cases.
Wisconsin
---------
Case 1. While vacationing with her family in Wisconsin in late Jul 2004, a
Kansas girl aged 4 years was taken to an emergency department with diarrhea
and fever of 4 days' duration. Her mother was instructed to keep the child
on a clear liquid diet until the diarrhea ceased, and the child was
released. The next day, the patient was taken to an urgent-care clinic for
treatment of bloody diarrhea, cramps, and fever. Stool cultures yielded
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Pomona, a rare serotype. The child was
placed on a 3-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and the illness
resolved after 5 days.
Epidemiologic investigation by the Wisconsin Division of Public Health
(WDPH) determined that the family had purchased a small turtle at a
souvenir shop (store A) in northwest Wisconsin. Warned by the public health
nurse of the possible link between the turtle and the child's illness, the
family removed the turtle, so the animal was not available for testing.
Cases 2 and 3. In Jul 2004, a boy aged 2 years was taken to his physician
with watery diarrhea and fever of 4 days' duration. 12 days later, his
mother had onset of diarrhea and fever. The physician counseled the
patients; neither patient was treated, and both recovered completely.
Cultures of stool samples from both patients yielded _S. enterica_ serotype
Pomona. Epidemiologic investigation by WDPH determined that the family had
recently purchased small turtles at a souvenir shop (store B) in
south-central Wisconsin. The family provided water specimens obtained from
the turtle habitat; these were cultured and yielded serotype Pomona
salmonellae. The 3 patient isolates from cases 1, 2, and 3 and water from
the turtle habitat were tested by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene and produced indistinguishable
PFGE patterns with 2 different restriction enzymes.
Case 4. In Aug 2004, a boy aged 10 years was taken to an urgent-care clinic
with a 3-day history of diarrhea and vomiting. He was hospitalized for 3
days and treated with antibiotics, after which a stool specimen was
obtained for culture; no pathogenic organisms could be isolated. He
subsequently had no symptoms for several months. In Nov 2004, he was taken
to an urgent-care facility after a 2-day history of diarrhea and vomiting
and was hospitalized for 3 days.
Stool specimens for culture yielded _S. enterica_ serotype Pomona, with a
PFGE pattern indistinguishable from those of the 3 patient isolates and
turtle water obtained in cases 1, 2, and 3 when using 1 enzyme (XbaI) and
with a 2-band difference when using a 2nd enzyme (BlnI). Despite negative
cultures of stool specimens obtained 1 month after hospital discharge, the
child continued to have occasional loose, mucoid stools as of Jan 2005.
An epidemiologic investigation by WDPH determined that the family had
purchased a small turtle from a souvenir shop during a vacation to
south-central Wisconsin in late Jul 2004; the mother could not recall the
name of the store. A week after the 1st hospitalization, the boy heard
media coverage about a link between a pet turtle and an ill child.
Consequently, the boy released the turtle into a neighborhood creek. Thus,
neither the turtle nor its habitat were available for testing.
Public Health Response. In Jul 2004, WDPH began receiving reports that
small turtles were being sold or given away with purchase in several
tourist destinations in Wisconsin. WDPH sent a letter to all local health
departments on 5 Aug 2004 to alert them to this potential health threat and
asked local public health officials to stop the distribution of turtles in
their jurisdictions. Local health officers were also asked to determine
whether patients with salmonellosis had any contact with reptiles,
specifically turtles, and to provide education for reptile owners. WDPH
subsequently learned that at least 6 souvenir shops in 4 Wisconsin counties
were distributing turtles. The public health alert and subsequent media
coverage yielded at least 3 cases (including case 4) of Salmonella
infection reported in young children who had recently purchased small
turtles at Wisconsin tourist destinations. The 2 most recent cases had
onset dates in Feb 2005 and are under investigation.
When PFGE analysis indicated that patterns from the patient and turtle
isolates associated with the 1st 3 Wisconsin cases were indistinguishable,
WDPH issued a press release on 18 Aug 2004, that identified the link
between human cases of disease and contact with pet turtles. The release
also provided information on safe handling of these animals and suggested
options for surrendering the turtles if owners chose not to keep them.
Once informed of the FDA ban by local health departments, most Wisconsin
retailers immediately discontinued selling small turtles, including stores
A and B. One retailer refused to comply, stating that his turtles were free
of salmonellae and that he was distributing them for educational purposes
only, which was permissible under the FDA ban. The retailer produced a
report from a private laboratory indicating that cultures of cloacal swabs
obtained from 60 of a source batch of 10 000 turtles were negative for
salmonellae; the retailer claimed to be distributing turtles that
originated solely from this batch. Local health officials informed the
retailer that, because of the intermittent nature of bacterial shedding,
the results did not ensure that all of the turtles were free of salmonellae
and that their distribution was illegal, regardless of their carrier
status. The retailer refused to comply with the order from the local health
department and continued to distribute the animals. WDPH issued an
emergency order on 19 Aug 2004 directing him to terminate any public
distribution of small turtles.
The retailer contacted a laboratory that agreed to test the turtles and
submitted samples from 6 of his turtles. Cloacal swabs from 1 turtle
yielded a mixture of _S. enterica_ serotype Pomona and _S. enterica_
serotype IIIb 60:r:z (subspecies diarizonae); only serotype IIIb 60:r:z was
isolated from the other 5 turtles. PFGE analysis of the Pomona isolate
yielded a 1-band difference using the 1st enzyme (XbaI) and was
indistinguishable from the 2nd enzyme (BlnI) pattern of cases 1, 2, and 3.
The retailer stopped distributing turtles on 24 Aug 2004 and returned the
remaining animals to the supplier.
When specimens from the patient in case 4 were tested in Nov 2004, the
banding pattern of the PFGE supported an epidemiologic link among all 4
patients. Although slight differences existed in the banding pattern
between this last patient and the cloacal sample from the turtle,
epidemiologic and laboratory evidence supported the conclusion that the
illnesses in all 4 cases were the result of contact with turtles.
Wyoming
-------
Case 1. In Jul 2004, a woman aged 80 years from central Wyoming visited her
health care provider with a 5-day history of fever, severe diarrhea, and
increased urinary frequency. Cultures of urine, feces, and blood all
yielded _S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium. The patient was hospitalized
for 5 days, then discharged to a transitional care unit for an additional 9
days. She received intravenous (IV) antibiotics for 10 days during her stay
in the hospital and transitional care unit. At the time of discharge, her
condition had improved.
Investigation by the Casper-Natrona County Health Department (CNCHD)
determined that the woman lived with her daughter and the extended family
owned a turtle, but the woman had no known direct contact with the turtle.
However, the turtle bowl was cleaned in the family kitchen sink. Cultures
of environmental samples obtained from the turtle habitat grew serotype
Typhimurium. PFGE patterns of environmental and patient isolates tested at
the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory were indistinguishable.
Case 2. In Aug 2004, a boy aged 6 years from west-central Wyoming visited
his health care provider with a 3-day history of nausea, diarrhea, and
vomiting. On clinical examination, he had a temperature of 102.8 deg F
(39.3 deg C) and pain in the upper right abdominal quadrant. He was
admitted to a community hospital, where IV fluids and antibiotics were
administered. Blood cultures were negative, but a stool sample yielded _S.
enterica_ serotype Typhimurium.
Wyoming Department of Health staff visited the boy's home 7 days after
illness onset. His mother reported that the family owned 2 pet turtles. The
boy was allowed to handle the turtles, but his mother fed them and cleaned
their aquarium because she was aware of the risk for salmonella infection.
Specimens for culture were obtained from the turtles and their living
environment. All samples yielded serotype Typhimurium and were
indistinguishable from the patient's sample by PFGE. The samples did not
match the patterns of those from case 1.
Both turtles had been purchased from the same pet store (store C), which
had been contacted by CNCHD on 2 previous occasions regarding its illegal
sale of turtles. The pet store informed CNCHD that the turtles were being
used solely for educational purposes. After investigating the 2 cases of
human salmonellosis, CNCHD confiscated the remaining turtles from store C.
CNCHD publicized this event to discourage future sales of small turtles and
to inform the public about the risk for salmonellosis. The Wyoming
Department of Health plans to mail an informational packet about reptiles
and salmonellae to all pet stores in the state in summer 2005.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Salmonella infections usually result in a mild, self-limiting
gastroenteritis but can also lead to severe invasive illness, such as
septicemia or meningitis, especially in infants and immunocompromised
persons. <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037004.htm>
Reptiles are a well-recognized source of human salmonellosis, maintaining
fecal carriage rates of salmonellae of greater than 90 percent (5). Contact
with reptiles and amphibians accounts for an estimated 74 000 (6 percent)
of the approximately 1.2 million sporadic human Salmonella infections that
occur annually in the USA (6).
These cases highlight the need for local health and environmental officers
to be aware that illegal distribution of small turtles might be widespread.
Additional sales of small turtles were reported in South Carolina and Texas
in recent years. Investigators in both Wisconsin and Wyoming discovered
that many retailers were aware of the FDA ban but attempted to circumvent
it by giving turtles away with purchase of a turtle habitat or by claiming
that turtles were being distributed for educational purposes
only. Although the FDA ban does have an exemption for bona fide
scientific, educational (i.e., sale to an educational institute or
organization, not to a family for a child's educational benefit), or
exhibitional purposes, other than use as pets, verifiable documentation of
such use must be associated with the sale. Furthermore, the auction or
raffle of turtles over the Internet or free distribution of turtles with
purchase of a turtle habitat constitute instances of sale, offering for
sale, or offering for public distribution. Such practices are banned under
21 CFR 1240.62 (2).
Successful management of turtle-associated salmonellosis requires public
health investigations to incorporate laboratory, epidemiologic,
environmental health, and policy-making components. When investigating
cases of salmonellosis, health officials should consider patient contact
with reptiles and take action to ensure that vendors and stores do not
distribute small turtles illegally. Additional information about safe

[As reflected in this MMWR posting, human salmonellosis associated with
amphibians and reptiles is well-known and continues to occur. This reflects
Pesanti's Law: "Truth has a half-life of 6 months." The restriction on
turtles with carapace (see below) diameters of less than 4 inches is meant
to minimize the direct interaction of small children with small turtles,
which they are more likely to handle -- not that larger turtles do not
harbor salmonellosis.
It is important to stress the fact that excretion of salmonellae can be
intermittently detected and "certified" turtles just means that they are
certified to be turtles, not salmonella-free just as "certified" raw milk
means it is certified to be unpasteurized, not salmonella-free.
A carapace is a hard bony or chitinous outer covering, such as the fused
dorsal plates of a turtle or the portion of the exoskeleton covering the
head and thorax of a crustacean, commonly referred to as the
shell. Interestingly, the term can be applied to something likened to a
shell that serves to protect or isolate something or someone from an
external influence. As an example: "Eyewitness accounts we have...date
from a quarter century later, when Degas, celebrated and successful, had
developed a crusty, cantankerous carapace, from which he emerged
occasionally to deliver his famously caustic and enigmatic mots. C.E. G.
Benfey "Degas in New Orleans" - Mod.LL]
