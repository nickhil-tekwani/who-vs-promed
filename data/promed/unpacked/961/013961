Kentucky: 5 new cases of suspected monkeypox bring total to 6
-------------------------------------------------------------
As Kentucky health officials investigated up to 5 new suspected cases of
monkeypox, governor Paul Patton yesterday banned the importation into the
state of most rodents, primates, and rabbits. Only zoos and research
laboratories will be permitted to bring in these animals under the
governor's executive order, which also requires the state Agriculture
Department to quarantine any potential source of the unusual viral disease.
The state Department for Public Health announced that 3 members of a
Western Kentucky household had developed rashes, fever, and cold-like
symptoms after exposure to prairie dogs from a Paducah pet store. The 3,
and 2 other family members who also came into contact with the animals,
have agreed to remain isolated at home, pending the outcome of tests by the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Kentucky's first suspected case of monkeypox, reported on Fri 13 Jun 2003,
was a woman who had handled prairie dogs in the same pet store. The store
had received degus [a rodent similar to the chinchilla] and squirrels -
but not prairie dogs - from a pet supplier in Illinois. Infected prairie
dogs from the Illinois supplier have been linked to an outbreak of
monkeypox in the Midwest - the first known cases in the western
hemisphere. The prairie dogs were apparently infected at the Illinois
supplier by a Gambian giant rat that had been imported from Africa, where
monkeypox was first identified in 1970.
The disease is related to smallpox and causes similar rashes and blisters,
but it is less serious and less easily spread. None of the 12 confirmed US
cases - four each in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin - has been fatal.
As of noon yesterday, CDC reported that 82 cases were being investigated in
Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, but the suspected cases
in Kentucky are not included in that total. Like the initial suspected case
[in Kentucky], the new ones are not serious, said Gwenda Bond, a
spokeswoman for the Cabinet for Health Services. She said there were two
possible sources of exposure in the new cases: family members had contact
with prairie dogs at the pet store and with a neighbor's prairie dog that
was purchased at the pet store. Bond said neither the neighbor's prairie
dog nor any of the 11 others sold by the store since it opened last month
have shown signs of illness. Denise Marshall, the store's owner, said that,
despite publicity about monkeypox, customers are still coming in asking to
buy prairie dogs, which have become a popular pet.
The governor's executive order prohibits the importation of rodents,
rabbits, and primates for distribution to the public. The ban is more
far-reaching than one issued last week by the Department of Fish and
Wildlife Resources, which applied only to non-domesticated animals. The
order also requires the Agriculture Department to quarantine any potential
source of monkeypox until suspect animals have been either isolated or
euthanized, and the site has been cleaned and disinfected under the
department's supervision. The order gives the animal owner the option of
isolating the animals for 30 days or surrendering them to the Agriculture
Department or the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. The governor
also authorized the Department for Public Health to "take any and all
appropriate measures" if a human case of monkeypox is confirmed in Kentucky.
Agriculture officials balked last week at issuing a quarantine on the
Paducah pet store, which had been requested by Fish and Wildlife, but the
governor's order, which followed a meeting yesterday among officials of the
3 agencies involved, appears to have resolved the dispute. Bond said the
order clarifies the agencies' roles. "This is such a unique situation, and
there are a lot of overlapping powers," she said. Agriculture officials
could not be reached late yesterday, and it was unclear whether the agency
had taken any steps to implement the quarantine.

[It is not clear from this report whether the prairie dogs, the humans, or
both, are being tested for presence of monkeypox virus. "Any and all
appropriate measures" if a human case of monkeypox is confirmed in Kentucky
provides little clarification. - Mod.CP]
