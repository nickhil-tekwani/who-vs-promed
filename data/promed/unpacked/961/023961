Downey mildew confirmed in Norfolk
-----------------------------------
This could be another challenging summer for people who like to make
their own pickles. The Ridgetown campus of the University of Guelph
has confirmed the return of downey mildew to cucumber patches in
Norfolk County. The fungus devastated the province's cucumber crop
last year [2006] and is a threat to melons, squash and pumpkins as well.
Though downey mildew has been confirmed in Elgin, Norfolk and the
Leamington areas, crop officials are optimistic that the latest
outbreak can be contained. "The outbreak now is nowhere near what it
was like last year at this time," Elaine Roddy, a crop specialist
with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs,
said. "But it is out there. This is an ugly reminder that we have to
maintain an intensive spray campaign and do what we can to protect our crops."
OMAFRA [Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs] has
36 scouts in southern Ontario monitoring crops for downey mildew. The
outbreak in Norfolk has been traced to a commercial cucumber field
that has been spraying for the fungus.
Farmers are better prepared this year [2007] to do battle with downey
mildew. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PRMA) in Ottawa
pre-approved the fungicides Tattoo C and Tanos for use this spring.
Downey mildew had destroyed many fields last year by the time these
sprays were available. As well, PMRA approved a third fungicide --
Ranman -- for use on vine crops last Friday [13 Jul 2007]. Ranman is
normally used to control blight on potatoes. It has proven effective
in American trials on downey mildew. "It's a good product and we're
glad to have it," Roddy said.
Downey mildew is normally a problem in the American south. However,
strong summer storms last year swept spores into southern Ontario.
Local farmers had never been confronted with downey mildew before.
Some cucumber growers lost half their production. Processors had to
contend with shortages.
The fungus put strong upward pressure on cucumber prices sold at
farmers markets. Herb Bodnar of Villa Nova, a vendor at Simcoe's
Farmers Market, said cucumber prices will rise 3 or 4 times above the
historical average again if the fungus is as bad as it was last year
[2006]. "There was a shortage last year," Bodnar said. "The price
went up and no one wanted to pay it. This means there could be no
cucumbers again this year."
A vendor who asked not to be identified said diseases like downey
mildew put farmers and vendors in a difficult position. On the one
hand, customers want pesticide-free produce at an affordable price.
On the other, they want that produce to be bug- and defect-free. It's
a tall order, she observed. "You're damned if you do and you're
damned if you don't," she said.

[2] Late blight, potato - Canada (PEI)

Late blight hits P.E.I. potatoes
---------------------------------
With 3 cases of late blight reported on Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.)
on Thursday [26 Jul 2007], the province is warning potato farmers to
act quickly to stop the fungus from spreading. One case was found in
each county, in Kensington, Morell and O'Leary. Marlene Clark of the
provincial plant disease diagnostic laboratory in Kensington told CBC
News it is important for farmers to take quick action. "When you have
one case in an area, there's obviously more," said Clark. "It's
important for the farmers to bring in the samples, call their
neighbours to let them know they do have late blight and then adjust
their [pesticide spraying] programs accordingly."
Clark said plants from the infected areas have been pulled up and
bagged, along with surrounding plants which are assumed to be
infected as well but not yet showing symptoms. She added there are
reports of numerous piles of cull potatoes across the province and
they can be a source of the blight spores. Those piles, she said,
must be buried to prevent the spread of the fungus.
Late blight starts on the leaves of potato plants and spreads down to
the potato tuber, making it inedible. The fungus thrives in warm,
damp conditions. The province had issued a warning to farmers about
late blight earlier in the week, anticipating problems after warm,
damp weather through the spring and summer.
Blight is best known as the cause of the 19th-century Irish famine.
Modern pesticides generally prevent blight from causing crop failure,
but the presence of blight will mean more spraying of pesticides, and
higher costs for farmers.

[Downy mildew on cucurbits is caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora
cubensis_. Different strains with variable host preferences
(pathovars) seem to exist. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide, but it
is usually most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas. By
affecting the leaves and thus the photosynthetic potential of its
host it reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill
the host plant. It survives on cultivated or wild cucurbit species
and is spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease
development can occur over a wide temperature range under conditions
of high humidity. Control strategies include the use of resistant
cultivars and fungicide applications.
The related species _P. humuli_ causes a serious disease of hops.
Downy mildews in other genera affect grapevine, sunflower, and a
number of vegetable crops. Generally, each fungal species is confined
to a number of host species.
Potato late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_,
which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or
eggplant. It affects leaves as well as tubers and is spread by plant
material (including seed tubers), wind and water. Other fungi and
bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber
breakdown. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed.
_P. infestans_ was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the
late 1840s, which resulted in large-scale population loss from that
country due to deaths and emigration.
