[Some clarifications should be mentioned here. 1st, Nigeria did not confirm an AFP case due to cVDPV2 infection this past week, but rather identified a positive environmental sample in Kwara state. 2nd, the Philippines DOH and WHO have confirmed 2 cVDPV2-associated AFP cases in the Philippines: 1 in Lanao del Sur in the southern part of the Philippines and the other in Laguna province approximately 100 km [62 mi] to the south of the Manila metro area. (see Poliomyelitis update (75): Philippines, WHO, no new confirmed cases 20190925.6694087). The media is reflecting the heightened awareness ongoing in the Philippines with almost daily reports of new suspected cases pending laboratory results. As a reminder, the majority of AFP cases investigated in most countries end up classified as non-poliovirus infection associated, therefore, seeing these reports in the local media serves as a sign there is ongoing heightened AFP surveillance and an interest on the part of the general population towards the importance of the AFP surveillance.

This year (2019) to date, Pakistan has reported 66 cases of WPV1-associated polio, the highest annual report since 2014 when it had reported 306 cases (data available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LGiJJvFwjHhQq_XWWLwrqgezQjAnxaSo/view page 4). The same applies to the global totals. As of 25 Sep 2019, there have been a total of 82 confirmed cases of WPV1-associated polio this year [2019], the highest reported since 2014 when there were 359 cases confirmed. Similarly, 2019 is seeing the highest number of countries reporting cVDPV-associated cases (same link page 5) with 20 countries confirming cVDPV-associated polio cases since 1 Jan 2019.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 20 countries: 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific.

[2] ARCC certifies South Africa and Equatorial Guinea - WHO
Date: Sun 22 Sep 2019
Source: Relief Web / WHO [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/world/zambia-hosts-24th-meeting-african-regional-certification-commission-poliomyelitis


The 24th meeting of the African Regional Certification Commission for Poliomyelitis Eradication (ARCC), which was held in Lusaka from [16-20 Sep 2019], has come to a close. During the closing ceremony, the ARCC chairperson Professor Rose Leke announced that the commission had accepted the complete documentation of Equatorial Guinea and South Africa on their polio-free status and congratulated the chairpersons of the National Certification Committees and all who had contributed to this achievement at country level. She also stated that the commission acknowledged the quality of the reports presented on polio eradication activities from Central African Republic, Nigeria, and South Sudan that are pending documentation acceptance by the ARCC, including update reports from DRC and Zambia, whose complete documentation was previously accepted by ARCC. Professor Leke emphasized the need to accelerate the certification of the African Region as polio free through strengthened surveillance and routine immunization. "We also urge all countries to strengthen surveillance, especially at the sub-national level, including in areas of insecurity and at-risk populations, to strengthen population's immunity through a more robust routine vaccination and the quality of vaccination campaigns against polio," she said.

At the same occasion, the director of the Zambia National Public Health Institute, Dr. Victor Mukonka, who spoke on behalf of the minister of health, said that although much progress was made towards polio eradication in Africa, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) were a reminder of the need to redouble efforts of immunization and surveillance. "Universal health coverage demands that we reach every district and every child with quality immmunisation services," he said.

The WHO representative, Dr. Nathan Bakyaita, emphasized the importance of countries to implement the recommendations of the ARCC. He also reiterated that WHO working with other UN agencies and other partners would support government in its efforts of strengthening immunization systems and implementing the recommendations of the ARCC.

This meeting brought together 87 participants, which also included representatives from the WHO inter-country support teams, WHO Regional Office for Africa, WHO headquarters, UNICEF, Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, Rotary, and BMGF [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation].

The Africa Regional Commission for Certification of poliomyelitis eradication (ARCC) is an independent body appointed in 1998 by the WHO regional director for Africa to oversee the certification and containment process. It is the only body that can certify that the Africa region is free of polio. The primary requirements for certifying the region as free of wild poliovirus [WPV]: the absence of WPV for a minimum of 3 consecutive years in all countries of the region; the presence of high-quality certification-standard AFP surveillance in all countries during that 3-year period; a high OPV 3 coverage above 90%; implementation of phase 1 laboratory containment of polioviruses; a robust national polio outbreak preparedness and response plan; and a functional national polio certification committee.

[Reading the above report is uplifting, as more and more countries in the African region are preparing documentation of wild poliovirus [WPV]-free status. One concern that will need addressing is how to review the situation in countries with areas of civil unrest and limited access of the public health infrastructure to the population in these areas. As a reminder, Nigeria had not reported a WPV-associated case for 2 years until there were 2 confirmed cases located in Borno (an area of civil unrest) that were announced in August 2016. Genetic studies on the virus isolates identified the virus to be most closely related to a WPV isolated in Borno in 2011, suggesting there had been undetected probable low-level circulation of this virus in Borno during 5 years: a challenge, as Nigeria has reached the 3-year mark for no newly confirmed cases of AFP associated with WPV. There are other countries in the region with areas of civil unrest that would merit similar caution.

But that being said, it was very uplifting to read the above report.
