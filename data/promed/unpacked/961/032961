In a follow-up on the Japanese encephalitis situation in Taiwan, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced 7 new Japanese encephalitis cases confirmed in Taiwan last week.

The new cases include one each in Daya District, Taichung City, Xizhou Township, Changhua County, Puzi City, Chiayi County, District, Guiren District, Tainan City, Fengshan District, Kaohsiung City, Xiaogang District, Kaohsiung City, and Linyuan District, Kaohsiung City.

The 7 new cases age between 17 and 70, and their onset dates vary between 19 May [2018] - 5 Jun [2018]. During the period of communicability [acute infection; JE virus is not communicable between humans, nor do infected humans provide infectious blood meals for mosquitoes because their viremias are too low. - Mod. TY], they developed symptoms such as fever, headache, and consciousness disturbance. As of now, 3 cases are hospitalized in the intensive care unit for treatment, 2 cases are hospitalized in the general ward in stable condition, and 2 cases have been discharged.

According to the epidemiological investigation, all 7 cases either live or work near a high risk environment where there are pigpens, pigeon farms, rice paddy fields or irrigation canals.

Thus far this year [2018], as of 12 Jun 2018, a total of 12 Japanese encephalitis cases, including 6 in Kaohsiung City, 2 in Chiayi County, 1 in Pingtung County, 1 in Tainan City, 1 in Changhua County, and 1 in Taichung City, have been confirmed in Taiwan. All 12 cases live in or work near a high risk environment where there are vector breeding sites nearby.

As the Japanese encephalitis season (May-October) has arrived, Taiwan CDC advises people who frequent mosquito-prone areas such as pig farms and rice paddy fields to take precautions against mosquito bites and ensure age-appropriate children receive Japanese encephalitis vaccination in a timely manner in order to ward off infection.

[The occurrence of new Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in Taiwan at this time is not surprising. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission is now underway in Taiwan, as indicated with the 7 new cases last week, as mentioned above. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2018. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV and breeds in wet areas such as rice paddies. These _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individuals above probably had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that children are vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
