Suspected yellow fever (YF) cases have been reported from 8 villages within 3 sub-counties in Kenya since 12 Jan 2022. Consequently, on 4 Mar 2022, health authorities in Kenya declared an outbreak of YF in Isiolo County, central Kenya, which is around 270 km [168 mi] north of the capital city of Nairobi.

As of 10 Mar 2022, there are a total of 15 suspect YF cases (including 4 deaths) reported. In Isiolo County, 3 sub-counties -- Chari (33%), Cherab (46%), and Garba Tulla (20%) -- have been affected.

The majority of the presumptive YF cases are from Merti village (40%) in Cherab sub-county, followed by Biliqo Marara village (13%), Chari sub-county, and Grafarsa village (13%) in Garba Tulla sub-county. The symptoms described are fever, jaundice, and muscle and joint pain.

Of the 15 cases, 13 (87%) are males and 2 (13%) females. The age range reported is between 11 and 65 years, with the most-affected age group being between 21-30 years (35%). There is no information on the vaccination status of the reported cases; however, both the origin and the surrounding counties have no history of vaccination campaign or routine immunization.

The 6 samples that have been collected from Isiolo County are with a representative distribution of all areas reporting suspected YF cases for confirmation. Of these, 2 samples tested positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) at the national laboratory (Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)). In addition, 3 samples were presumptive YF IgM positive by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CDC MAC- ELISA), and another 5 samples were equivocal. Further information is pending regarding the differential diagnosis tests performed. On 8 Mar 2022, the samples were shipped to the YF regional reference laboratory - Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for confirmatory testing.

Public health actions:
- On 4 Mar 2022, the national authorities activated the alert mode in all the 47 counties, especially in the following high-risk counties: Wahir, Garissa, Marsabit, Mery, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, and Turkana.
- The national government and partners (UNICEF and CDC) are mobilising resources to support response activities.
- A national incident management structure has been put in place and is developing a response plan to deploy a rapid response team to Isiolo and neighbouring counties to investigate the outbreak, conduct a risk assessment, initiate risk communication and community engagement activities, implement integrated vector control measures, and build capacity in clinical management.
- The Ministry of Health is planning to conduct YF vaccination campaign in outbreak-affected areas, as informed by ongoing investigations and laboratory results.

Situation interpretation:
Kenya is endemic for YF and is classified as a high-risk country in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. However, YF hasn't been documented previously in Isiolo County. Previous outbreaks have been reported in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 2016 (where 2 cases were imported from Angola). Kenya has not yet benefited from large-scale preventive mass vaccination campaigns and has not introduced YF vaccine into routine immunization (RI) nationwide (YF RI is limited to 4 counties in the northwest of the country, not directly bordering Isiolo). Due to the minimal population immunity, there is high risk of outbreak amplification.

Proposed actions:
- Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of YF. As the country plans to introduce YF vaccination into the routine immunization program, expedited planning and implementation of these activities will help avert risk of future outbreaks.
- WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers aged 9 months and above going to Kenya. Yellow fever vaccination is safe and highly effective, and a single dose provides life-long protection.
- WHO also recommends avoiding mosquito bites including the use of repellents. The highest risk for transmission of YF virus is during the day and early evening. Communities should be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of YF infection.

[The previous yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Kenya was in 1991-1993 (see references below). Now Kenya has detected its 1st case in decades on 12 Jan [2022]. The low vaccination rate is of concern and raises the dilemma of the need and cost of ongoing vaccination of the population in areas where the disease has not occurred previously when outbreaks are so infrequent. One hopes that the rapid response will lead to a prompt vaccination campaign in the affected areas. A YF vaccine shortage was reported in 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (04): Kenya vaccine shortage 20200130.6935353). Apparently, that shortage has ended. - Mod.TY
