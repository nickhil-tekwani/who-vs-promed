This law has been in effect for a long time with no results on change of
local auction barns. For instance horses are traded on the alley several
times during and after a sale. Horses that come in with the 74A brand
commingle with the horses that are for sale for hours! Whats the point?
And after all this time mosquitos DON'T carry this disease, hard to believe!
Some horses are bitten thousands of times every night in some areas.
Further, horses sold to slaughter are commingled with other horses in
trailers leaving the sale, only to move to other sales. Just go to any cow
sale in South Texas and watch for yourself.
Then there's the issue of having an infected horse quarantined with so
called well horses. It's no wonder the numbers are increasing of "reported"
horses contracting EIA. Wonder how many have it and why is there no cure or
vaccine to prevent this. Why are there so many more horses in Louisiana
where there are billions more mosquitos?
The answer is in mandatory testing at all sales events, on the spot or 24
hrs. prior AND 48 hrs. after purchase.
And how does it affect a gelding anyway?

The regulation that has been in effect exempted markets from the EIA (Equine
Infections Anemia) testing.
Yes, positive (branded 74A) horses go through markets with some provisions.
For several years now, infected horses that were sold through a market had
to be inspected by a Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) veterinarian or
an accredited veterinarian within 24 hours PRIOR to entering the market. The
equine had to have a normal temperature and have no signs of the disease.
The equine then must have remained under a roof and be removed from the
market within 24 hours after arrival.
EIA-infected equines move under a form known as VS 1-27 permit to the
slaughter plant. In order to encourage owners to remove infected equines, a
convenient and cost-effective method must be provided. Many owners cannot
afford to take the infected equine to one of the two slaughter plants in
Texas, both of which are in the Dallas area.
According to research conducted in Louisiana and by the United States
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dr. Tim Cordes, the horsefly and other
biting flies are the culprit in mechanically transmitting EIA from an
infected equine to a 'clean' animal.
EIA-infected equines that are maintained must be kept at least 200 yards
(182.88 meters) from other equines. Research has found that this distance is
sufficient for blood to dry on the mouthparts of the fly. Normally, the fly
does not travel further than this distance.
The number of equines tested in Texas has increased significantly with the
implementation of regulations. We would expect to see a greater number of
infected equines, or *responders,* until those animals that have long
carried the infection are *routed out* of circulation with healthy equines.
The best action is to have an equine tested immediately before a purchase --
furthermore, you might even want to keep the equine isolated and have it
retested, just in case it was exposed just prior to being sold and did not
have sufficient time to develop a response to the test.
EIA affects geldings no differently than studs (stallions) fillies, mares,
etc.
What is most important is that it took 50 to 75 years to get the
tuberculosis and brucellosis programs to their current state of
sophistication. We have only been at EIA seriously since 1994, and no one
has made any decision to move on this as an eradication effort, but rather
to gain a measure of control so that we can accept a higher level of risk
until the industry and the TAHC and probably the legislature decides that
this should be eradicated.
Since 1997. the program as it is currently operating, is testing close to
200 000 horses per calendar year. In 1997, there were 750 positives
discovered, compared to 370 in 1998 and projections indicate we may come in
between 200-300 positive in 1999. The program is working and the new changes
should be helpful. The TAHC is faced with implementing the new law and
advising the many markets that they can no longer duck and dodge the test
requirement simply by stamping the buyer's sheet that this is an untested
equine and handing the buyer a pamphlet explaining what to do with the horse
when the buyers arrive home. The reason for the news release (which you saw
posted on ProMED) was to inform the markets, potential sellers, and buyers
[about the new regulations.
