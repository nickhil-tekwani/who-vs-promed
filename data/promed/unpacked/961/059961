A total number of 11 cases of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), also
known as monkey fever, have been reported in Shimoga in 2011 so far.
KFD is a tick-borne viral fever, the symptoms of which are high fever,
headache, and bleeding. The virus is transmitted from monkeys to human
beings through ticks. 17 suspected cases were reported in Tirthahalli
taluk this year [2011]. Of the blood samples of the 17 patients that
were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, 11 tested
positive.

The death of monkeys was reported in the forests of Mandagadde and
Konandur region in March 2011, which was followed by the outbreak of
KFD. The outbreak of KFD and other forms of viral fever in the region
had disrupted agricultural activities.

District Health Officer Dr. Channabasappa told The Hindu that of the
11 cases that tested positive, 6 were from Konandur region while 5
were from Mandagadde region. The patients were treated and recovered.
He clarified that so far none of the patients had died from any part
of the district.

About 4000 people in the region were vaccinated against KFD as a
precautionary measure. In addition, people who went to the forest to
collect firewood and those who worked in the fields on the periphery
of the forest were asked to apply dimethyl phosphate, which is a
repellent against the tick.

[KFD continues to be a sporadic problem in this part of India. In the
28 Feb 2009 post on KFD in India (ProMED-mail archive no. 20090302.0860), Mod.CP posted this excellent comment:

"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease
virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_. KFDV was
identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the
Kyasanur forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India. The main
hosts of KFDV are small rodents, but shrews, bats, and monkeys may
also carry the virus. KFD is transmitted from the bite of an infected
tick (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector). Humans can get
this disease from a tick bite or by contact with an infected animal,
such as a sick or recently dead monkey. Larger animals such as goats,
cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD, but they do not have a
role in the transmission of the disease. Furthermore, there is no
evidence of the disease being transmitted via the unpasteurized milk
of any of these animals. It occurs principally in the Shimoga and
Kanara district of Karnataka, India and is common in young adults
exposed during the dry season in the forest.

After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD begin
suddenly with fever, headache, severe muscle pain, cough, dehydration,
gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems. Patients may
experience abnormally low blood pressure and low platelet, red blood
cell, and white blood cell counts. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some
patients recover without complications. However, in most patients, the
illness is biphasic, and the patient begins experiencing a 2nd wave of
symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include
fever and signs of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The
diagnosis is made by virus isolation from blood or by serologic
testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. There are
approximately 400-500 cases of KFD per year with a case fatality rate
of 3-5 percent.

Some of this information has been extracted from the CDC fact sheet
(see:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf)."

KFD virus and its variants are found in a wider geographic area than
just India. A variant of KFD virus, Alkhurma virus, was isolated in
Saudi Arabia. The gene sequence of a Nanjianyin China virus isolate
obtained from a febrile patient is highly homologous to that of KFD
virus. ProMED-mail archive no. 20090303.0871 cites Prof. Steve Berger
saying, "... 22.4 percent of persons living in the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands were found to be seropositive for KFD in 2002," and that
"there is a safe and effective inactivated vaccine available in
India."
