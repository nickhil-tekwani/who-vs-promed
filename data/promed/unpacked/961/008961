Canadian statistics).
These data have been derived and compiled from OIE's BSE table, updated 27
Apr 2006 <http://oie.int/eng/info/en_esbmonde.htm>.
Key: (-), for 2006, means no reports yet available.
(...), for other years, means no data available.
During 2005, the decline in BSE incidence continued in most affected
countries [see 2]. Exceptions were seen in the Czech Republic, Japan and
Poland, where the trend of slight increase proceeded.

[2] FAO assessment
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Source:FAO news release 06/24e, 23 Mar 2006 [edited]
<http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000258/index.html>

Cases of bovine spongiform encepalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease"
worldwide are declining, according to the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO). They have been dropping at the rate of some 50 per cent
a year over the past 3 years, the Organization said today.
Amid the current international alarm over avian flu, it is good news that
the battle against another worrying disease is being won.
In 2005, just 474 animals died of BSE around the world, compared with 878
in 2004 and 1646 in 2003, and against a peak of several tens of thousands
in 1992, according to figures collected by the Paris-based World Animal
Health Organization (OIE), with which FAO works closely.
Only 5 human deaths resulting from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(vCJD), believed to be the human form of BSE, were reported worldwide in
2005. All of them were in the United Kingdom -- the country most affected
by the disease -- where 9 deaths were registered in 2004 and 18 in 2003.
Andrew Speedy, an FAO animal production expert, commented: "It is quite
clear that BSE is declining and that the measures introduced to stop the
disease are effective. But further success depends on our continuing to
apply those measures worldwide."
FAO insists on the importance of a scientific approach to detect and
control the disease, ensuring it is eradicated in affected countries -- and
kept out of unaffected ones.
FAO, together with Swiss experts, has been running courses for specialists
from countries as far afield as Serbia, Egypt, Vietnam, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Paraguay on BSE diagnosis,
surveillance and prevention in the animal feed and meat industries.
Also vital, said Speedy, is a tracking system that allows animals to be
identified all the way from birth to shopping basket. This has been adopted
across Europe but has yet to be implemented partially or fully in a number
of other countries.

[3] Estonia, suspicion denied

Estonian authorities said on Wednesday that tests for mad cow disease had
proved negative in the case of a dead 11 year old animal earlier suspected
of being the country's 1st case of BSE [see 20060426.1211]. "There is no
case. Of course, this is a big relief for us," Ago Partel,director of the
Veterinary and Food Authority, told Reuters.
Earlier this week Agriculture Ministry officials announced that the disease
might have been detected in the cow after a routine test at a
slaughterhouse. If confirmed, it would have been the country's first case
of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), a disease that destroys the
brains of cattle. The cow was from a farm in Jogevamaa county, south
eastern Estonia.
BSE was discovered in Britain in 1986 and devastated the country's beef
industry. Individual cases of BSE have recently been found in Japan, Canada
and the United States.
More than 160 people have died from the human form of the disease, variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, believed to be contracted by eating meat from
infected cattle.

[4] Japan, contaminated MBM consumed

A cow that died in March 2006 as Japan's 22nd confirmed case of mad cow
disease had been fed meat-and-bone meal (MBM), a Japanese official has
said. This is the first known use of MBM in Japan since it was banned in
2001 due to suspicions that it causes mad cow disease, formally called
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The case also marks the first time the
feed's use has been linked to a mad cow-infected animal in Japan, Kyodo
News reported on Thursday.
The 64 month old cow, which died in January 2006 in Hokkaido, Japan's
northernmost island, was fed the meal until September 2001, while it was
less than 1 year old. In October 2001, the central government imposed a ban
on MBM.
The meal was found to be contained in a mixed ration called the CP
Supplement made from meat and bones from chickens, pigs and cows. The
Hokkaido government has designated 45 cows, fed the same meal at the same
farm where the cow died in March 2006, as suspected disease carriers and
will destroy them.
