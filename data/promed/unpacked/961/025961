Regarding the recent postings regarding tularemia in Texas, which
strain of _Francisella tularensis_ is the etiologic agent in the
current Texas "widespread epizootic"; _F. tularensis_ spp.
_tularensis_ (Type A) or _F. tularensis_ ssp. _holartica_ (Type B)?
There are significant strain-dependent differences between them in
human disease presentation/syndromes, intervention levels, treatment,
and subsequent prognosis.
Reports that do not indicate subspecies may cause confusion, leaving
the impression that reports of _F. tularensis_ is always the more
virulent Type A strain. It might be prudent to consider any report
incomplete or curious if using only _F. tularensis_ without
specifying subspecies or type.

[Dr. Lifland is correct regarding differences in virulence between the
subspecies of _F. tularensis_. Unfortunately, most reports do not
characterize the specific subspecies. As mentioned below, both
subspecies are found in the USA, whereas holarctica is the one
primarily found in Eurasia.
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/idsa/bt/tularemia/biofacts/tularemiafactsheet.html>
There are several subspecies of _F. tularensis_ with somewhat
confusing nomenclature. These subspecies can be differentiated by
biochemical tests, and the current taxonomy is as follows:
Subspecies tularensis (type A; also referred to as subspecies
nearctica by investigators in the former Soviet Union): demonstrates
citrulline ureidase activity; highly infectious and virulent; found
primarily in North America; 2 distinct genetic clades have been
identified.
Subspecies holarctica (type B; formerly referred to as palaearctica
or palearctica in some sources): less virulent; does not demonstrate
citrulline ureidase activity; three biovars have been identified:
-Biovar I: erythromycin sensitive; primarily found in North America,
Europe, Siberia, the Far East, and Kazakhstan
-Biovar II: erythromycin resistant; primarily found in Eurasia
-Biovar japonica: found in Japan
Subspecies mediasiatica: found in the Central Asian republics of the
former Soviet Union (virulence is similar to _F. tularensis_,
subspecies holarctica).
Subspecies novicida: considered to be of low virulence and generally
causes illness only in immunocompromised hosts] (_F. tularensis_ and
_F. novicida_ traditionally have been considered separate species;
however, the current approach is to consider _F. novicida_ as a
subspecies of _F. tularensis_.) - Mod.LL]
