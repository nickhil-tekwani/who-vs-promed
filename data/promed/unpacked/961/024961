Minister Peter Hauk: animals should be urgently vaccinated against bluetongue
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Owners of cattle, sheep, and goats should register their animals
immediately with the veterinary offices to get them vaccinated
against bluetongue. The detection of the 1st case in sheep underlines
the current risk of infection," said Baden-Wuerttemberg's minister
for Food and Rural Areas, Peter Hauk, on Monday (21 Jul 2008) in
Stuttgart.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute -- Federal Research Institute for
Animal Health -- has confirmed the bluetongue diagnosis, carried out
by the veterinary investigation office in Freiburg. The
bluetongue-positive sample came from diseased sheep in a herd in
Ortenaukreis [Map

The affected animals have not been vaccinated yet. The competent
Veterinary Office has reported the disease officially and taken the
necessary disease control measures, including immediate vaccination
of the healthy animals.

"Unfortunately there are still animal owners who refrain from
vaccination. They hurt not only their own animals but disturb, by
their behaviour, the long-term control of diseases," said the
minister.

Bluetongue does not affect humans.

Additional information
----------------------
Last year [2007], 1500 animals were [clinically] affected by
bluetongue in Baden-Wuerttemberg, and 40 000 in [the whole of]
Germany. Ortenaukreis was particularly badly affected. The total
number of animals which should be compulsorily vaccinated In
Baden-Wuerttemberg is some 450 000 sheep and goats and 800 000 cattle.
Since the beginning of vaccination, in May [2008], 350 000 sheep and
goats and 700 000 cattle have already been vaccinated.

[July was also the actual (retrospectively verified) 1st month of
BTV-8 activity in the Belgian/Dutch/German triangle in 2006.

During 2007, Germany reported BTV-8 outbreaks to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health); a summary of the outbreaks and a map
are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5769>.

A final report was submitted on 29 Apr 2008 in which Germany
indicated that "the event is unlikely to be contained and is now
considered to be endemic. No more follow-up reports will be made, but
instead, information about this disease will be included in the
future 6-monthly reports". In view of developments in Spain and
southwest France, European laboratories are expected to include also
BTV-1 within their diagnostic arsenal.

According to some field observations from Germany, beef cattle seem
to have been affected there more severely than what became recently
apparent from the Netherlands (for the Dutch observations, see
ProMED-mail post 20080719.2195). It will be useful to obtain from
Germany (as well as from other affected countries) detailed
observations on the BTV-8 effect on their respective sheep and cattle
(dairy, beef) populations in 2006 and 2007.

The timely vaccination, which seems to have had good coverage, will,
hopefully, prevent significant losses in 2008. It will be interesting
to see if the vaccination will adequately protect young animals,
vaccinated [only] once. - Mod.AS]
