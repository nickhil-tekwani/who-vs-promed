["Tracing investigations have found a poultry farm near Bairnsdale that has tested positive for H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus on [10 Aug 2020].

"Movement controls have been put in place in around the property, which has been quarantined. These controls prohibit, until further notice, the movement of birds, equipment and products within and out of, the designated Restricted and Control Area, except under permit issued by Agriculture Victoria."

"A 2nd egg farm near Lethbridge tested positive for H7N7 avian influenza virus on [5 Aug 2020], following confirmation of the virus at a free-range egg farm on 31 July 2020.[Note: See follow-up reports no 1 and 2 sent to the OIE at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=35345 and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35378, respectively.

"Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer issued a Housing of Livestock clause for 30 days from [7 Au 2020], legally requiring all poultry owners -- even those with just 2 or 3 chickens or birds -- to keep their birds housed enclosed.

"Movement controls have been put in place in Golden Plains Shire and the affected properties have been quarantined. These controls prohibit, until further notice, the movement of birds, equipment and products within and out of, the designated Restricted and Control Area, except under permit issued by Agriculture Victoria.

"To control the spread of avian influenza, birds on the 1st affected property have been destroyed. Agriculture Victoria has quarantined the 2nd property and is undertaking required depopulation, disposal, and decontamination.

"Agriculture Victoria has scaled up its surveillance and tracing efforts to determine other at-risk properties and contain the risk.

"Agriculture Victoria continues to sample birds throughout the expanded restricted area".
