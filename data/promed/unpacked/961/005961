The Taiwan Department of Disease Control reported on a new confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the country. The patient is a 50-year-old male in Shalu district, Taichung city.

He developed fever and vomiting on [21 Jun 2019]. He was treated on [23 Jun 2019] because the symptoms did not improve. He was admitted to the hospital. The case has recovered and been discharged.

This brings the total JE cases to 12, including one death.

The Department of Disease Control once again reminds the public that it is Japanese encephalitis season and people should try to avoid activities in high-risk environments such as paddy fields, ponds, and irrigation ditches during peak hours of dusk and dawn.

If it is unavoidable, light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and pants should be worn and anti-mosquito drugs [repellents] approved by government agencies should be used on exposed areas to avoid infection by the mosquito bites.

[The case above and previous recent cases indicate that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now underway in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2019. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, and other related _Culex_ species are efficient vectors of JEV and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
