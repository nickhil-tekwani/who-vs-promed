Viet Nam: tests from the Chau Hoa commune in Quang Binh province all negative
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st avian influenza tests carried out on several inhabitants of a
village where residents reported an epidemic of influenza were all
negative, a doctor in central Viet Nam said. The Chau Hoa commune in
central Quang Binh province, 400 km (248 miles) south of Hanoi, is under
scrutiny, after local people reported a flu epidemic. A 5-year-old boy
there tested positive for bird flu last week [4th week March 2005].
"All tests on samples sent from Quang Binh province are negative," said Bui
Trong Chien, deputy director of the Pasteur Institute in the coastal city
of Nha Trang, 500 km north of Ho Chi Minh City. "We are still making other
tests," he said on Thursday [24 Mar 2005]. The exact number of tests was
unclear, but he said both sick patients and residents without symptoms were
examined.
A local newspaper reported Monday [21 Mar 2005] that around 200 people had
flu symptoms in the commune, a figure downplayed by several sources. The
World Health Organization initially said the cases "needed to be rapidly
and thoroughly investigated." But on Thu 24 Mar 2005, Peter Horby, a WHO
epidemiologist in the capital, Hanoi, said there was "no serious
information so far to substantiate media reports." The H5N1 virus has
killed 33 Vietnamese, 2 Cambodians and 12 Thais since 2003. Health
officials have warned of a global pandemic if the virus mutates so that it
can be easily transmitted between humans.
Bui Duc Phu, deputy director of a hospital in the central city of Hue, said
on Thu 24 Mar 2005 that a 16-month-old baby from the village was
hospitalized. "His parents said he had fever. But he does not have any
fever anymore, and we don't see any symptoms of avian influenza," he said.
The most recent avian influenza patient detected in Viet Nam was 5-year-old
boy, from the same commune, who tested positive for the H5N1 virus last
week [4th week March 2005]. His 13-year-old sister, who died in Quang Binh
hospital on 9 Mar 2005, is also a serious suspected case. She was
immediately buried by her family and could not be tested.

suspected cases of avian influenza or to the rumored outbreak of human
influenza (or a similar respiratory infection) occurring in the same
region. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: 5-person family in northern Viet Nam are suspected cases
-----------------------------------------------
5 people in a family from Viet Nam's northern Hai Phong city have been
hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza H5N1 virus,
a local doctor said on Sat 26 Mar 2005. The 5-person family from the rural
district of Kien Thuy was admitted to the city-based Viet-Tiep Hospital on
Tue 22 Mar 2005, after the members of the family had breathing difficulty,
an official of the city's Department of Health said on condition of
anonymity. The family had a flock of poultry culled during a recent
outbreak of avian influenza in Hai Phong, the official said, noting that
the city has detected no new affected [outbreak foci] in its territory for
13 days. Samples from the 5 patients are being tested for H5N1. The
patients are in good health, the official said, refusing to give further
details.
Viet Nam's Health Ministry has just confirmed that a total of 28 local
people have been infected with the H5N1 virus since 26 Dec 2004, of whom 14
have died. Now, 3 local avian influenza patients are under treatment. A
5-year-old boy from central Quang Binh is receiving treatment at the
Central Hospital in central Hue city. Also, a 21-year-old man from northern
Thai Binh province and a 40-year-old woman from northern Quang Ninh
province are being treated at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi
capital. The Hanoi-based institute is treating a 21-year-old man from
northern Thai Binh province, who still needs respiratory assistance.
To prevent spread of H5N1 virus among fowl and from poultry to people, the
ministry has asked all cities and provinces nationwide to intensify
disinfection of all poultry facilities in their territory. The nationwide
hygiene campaign will be conducted for one month starting on 1 Apr 2005.
Local People's Committees must inform every household about methods of
detecting and reporting new avian influenza outbreaks and ensure that local
residents will not slaughter and use sick fowl, the Ministry said. The
campaign and preventive measures will also be disseminated widely via mass
media.
Avian influenza has stricken a total of 35 cities and provinces of Viet Nam
since January 2005. As of Fri 25 Mar 2005, 25 localities have detected no
new affected spots for 3 weeks, meeting requirements for declaration of the
end of an outbreak. The 10 remaining localities include An Giang, Bac Lieu,
Ben Tre, Can Tho, Dong Thap, Hau Giang, Tra Vinh and Vinh Long in the
southern region, and Hai Duong and Hai Phong in the northern region, said
Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health.

Viet Nam: new suspected case of avian influenza virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
A 41-year-old woman from Viet Nam's northern city of Hai Phong has been
hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus. The woman, who resides in the Kien Thuy district, was admitted to a
hospital in the city on 25 Mar 2005 after suffering cough and breathing
difficulty, according to the newspaper Youth on Mon 28 Mar 2005. She lives
in an avian influenza-affected area near a 5-person family admitted to the
city-based Viet-Tiep Hospital on 22 Mar 2005 with avian influenza symptoms.
Specimens from the family members are being tested for the presence of the
H5N1 virus. The Vietnamese Health Ministry has just confirmed that 28 local
people have been infected with H5N1 since 26 Dec 2004, of whom 14 died.
To prevent spread of H5N1 virus among fowl, and from poultry to people, the
Ministry has urged all cities and provinces nationwide to intensify
disinfection of their poultry facilities. A nationwide hygiene campaign
will be conducted for one month starting on Fri 1 Apr 2005. Avian influenza
has stricken a total of 35 cities and provinces in Viet Nam since January
