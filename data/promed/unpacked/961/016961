Red tide causes fish kill in Lee County
---------------------------------------
Dead fish are washing up on Bunche Beach because of red tide. The
latest water samples from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission show there is a large patch of red tide just south of
Sanibel Island.

"There's a lot of dead fish. It's really nasty. [There are] eels,
horseshoe crabs, it's sick," said Skippy Svitil of the Sanibel Sea
School. Red tide has caused hundreds of dead fish to wash ashore on
Bunche Beach in Lee County. "Red tide is a condition that's caused by
a microscopic phytoplankton that grows very well under certain
conditions," said Dr. Bruce Neill of the Sanibel Sea School. Those
conditions are warm temperatures and little wind -- the same
conditions Southwest Florida has been experiencing since the bloom
first appeared in October [2011].

"When there are a lot of cells in the water, there are a lot of cells
that are dying. When they die they disarm rate [sic] and decompose
releasing that chemical out into the water," said Neill. Read tide
causes marine life to suffocate. "The chemical that they make is a
neurotoxin it attacks the nerve cells of vertebrate animals," said
Neill.

The bloom has also changed, from one large 30 mile long patch to
millions of smaller ones, from southern Lee County south to Key West.
"There's a patch of water that has red tide growing in it but
surrounding it are portions of water that are perfectly clean," said
Neill.

Red tide can cause difficulty breathing in humans. If you are
experiencing difficulty breathing, head to another beach. Most are
clean.

Cold weather can kill red tide cells, but it's not cold enough to kill
the toxin yet. Right now the water temperature is about 68 degrees. It
needs to drop at least another 10 to have an impact on the red tide.

[Airborne toxins, water spray and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting
[seafood]from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged.
Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last
for several days.
