Clover Proliferation Group (16SrVI) Subgroup A (16SrVI-A) Phytoplasma
is a Probable Causal Agent of Dry Bean Phyllody Disease in Washington.

2004. Accepted for publication 6 Jan 2004.
During 2003, a new disease, dry bean phyllody (DBPh), was observed in
the Columbia Basin of Washington in dry bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_
L.) cultivars of Andean origin grown in Mattawa and Paterson, WA that
caused great reduction in dry bean production. Symptoms of DBPh
became apparent during mid-to-late pod development and were
characterized by leafy petals (phyllody) and aborted seed pods
resembling thin, twisted, and corrugated leaf-like structures.
Deformed sterile pods that were small, sickle-shaped, upright, and
leathery were also observed. The infected plants generally exhibited
chlorosis, stunting, or bud proliferation from leaf axils. Symptoms
of DBPh were indicative of possible infection by phytoplasmas.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and phylogenetic
analyses of amplified 16S rDNA sequences were used for phytoplasma
identification. 4 symptomatic bean plants were analyzed and tested
positive for phytoplasma infection on the basis of results of initial
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent nested-PCR
amplifications (2).
RFLP analyses of 16S rDNA sequences with restriction enzymes, MseI,
AluI, HhaI, RsaI, and HpaII indicated that the phytoplasma strains
associated with DBPh belonged to the clover proliferation group
(16SrVI) subgroup A (16SrVI-A) (2). This subgroup currently consists
of 3 members, clover proliferation (CP; GenBank Accession No.
AY500130), potato witches'-broom (PWB; GenBank Accession No.
AY500818), and vinca virescence (VR; GenBank Accession No. AY500817),
a strain of beet leafhopper-transmitted virescence agent (BLTVA)
phytoplasmas (1,2).
The taxonomic affiliations of the DBPh phytoplasma strains were
confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of cloned 16S rRNA gene sequences
(GenBank Accession Nos. DBPh2, AY496002; DBPh3, AY496003). Among the
existing members of subgroup 16SrVI-A, the 4 DBPh strains were
closely related to the VR strain with 99.7 percent 16S rDNA sequence
homology and to the CP strain with 99.2 percent sequence homology.
To gain further evidence on the role of 16SrVI-A phytoplasma strains
in DBPh disease, a modified test of Koch's postulates was conducted.
Infected tissue from one phytoplasma-positive dry bean sample was
grafted onto 3 Pinto UI-114 bean seedlings in the greenhouse. Within
60 days, the bean seedlings exhibited corrugated leaflike structures
from aborted seedpods, a lack of flower formation, general chlorosis,
and stunting similar to the original diseased plants. The lower
leaves of the inoculated bean plants became epinastic and leathery.
The transmitted phytoplasma was detected in each of the grafted
symptomatic seedlings, and the RFLP patterns of its 16S rRNA gene
sequences were identical to those of the phytoplasmas in the scions.
A high correlation between the presence of disease symptoms and the
presence of subgroup 16SrVI-A phytoplasmas in the bean plants
suggests that these phytoplasmas play an etiological role in DBPh
disease.
To our knowledge, these findings provide the first confirmed case of
phytoplasma-associated DBPh in the United States.

[Phyllody describes a retrograde metamorphosis of the floral organs
to the condition of leaves. Because floral tissues in
phytoplasma-infected plants revert to vegetative tissues, no seeds
are produced, and crop losses due to phyllody can be very high.
Phyllody-affected crop plants can be cured of phytoplasmas by heat
treatment or by subjecting cuttings to tissue culture.
The beet leafhopper, _Circulifer tenellus_ (Ct), is the only known vector of
BLTVA, although not much is known about other vectors. Phytoplasmas infect
and multiply in their leafhopper vectors. The BLTVA is vectored in the same
manner as other phytoplasmas are by other leafhoppers. Ct acquires BLTVA
only by feeding on infected plants.
Prophylactic use of insecticides is the only known means to prevent
transmission of BLTVA. The Washington vegetable seed industry has
been plagued with BLTVA for years, and even the prophylactic use of
insecticides has not always successfully managed it. Some vegetable
seed crops are no longer grown in the Columbia basin due to
inadequate control of BLTVA.
