Connecticut 2002: knowledge, attitudes and behaviors about West Nile virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since West Nile virus (WNV) was first recognized in the United States in
1999, the geographic distribution has widened progressively, and the
resulting human morbidity and mortality has increased (1). The cornerstones
of WNV control and prevention are surveillance with sustained and
integrated mosquito control to detect the presence of WNV in areas where
humans are at risk and public education on the use of personal protective
behaviors (PPBs) and peridomestic mosquito control to reduce the risk for
mosquito bites (2).
In Connecticut, strategies to improve public education and WNV-risk
awareness consist of issuing graded warnings after assessing local
surveillance findings during the transmission season. In 2002, 3 of the 17
Connecticut patients with confirmed WNV infection reported having used any
PPBs. To assess knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about WNV during the
transmission season, the Connecticut Department of Public Health added
questions about WNV to its Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) survey conducted during the period Aug 2002 to Nov 2002. This
report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that general
awareness of WNV and knowledge of elderly people being at risk for more
severe illness were high; however, awareness of local surveillance findings
was poor, and belief in the local presence of WNV did not predict the use
of PPBs. The findings underscore the need for continued public education
about the risk for WNV infection and the use of PPBs and the need for
regular systematic evaluations of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors to
refine and improve public health messages effectively.
BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit dialed telephone survey of the
non-institutionalized, civilian population aged >18 years. The set of WNV
questions included a question about knowledge of age groups at higher risk
for severe illness; a question about how worried a person was about getting
WNV; 2 questions about awareness of local dead bird or mosquito
surveillance findings; 4 questions about PPBs to protect against mosquito
bites during July and August, the months of peak risk in Connecticut; and a
question about how often a person spent >30 minutes outdoors in the evening
during July and August. PPB questions included avoiding outdoor areas where
mosquitoes are present, avoiding outdoor activities, wearing long-sleeved
shirts and long pants, and using insect repellent on skin or clothes.
Descriptive and analytic analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 and
SUDAAN version 7.5. Data were adjusted to account for differing
probabilities of selection and to match the state population of adults by
age and sex.
A total of 1791 interviews were completed; response rate was 61 per cent.
The median age of respondents was 47 years (range: 18 to 97 years); 21 per
cent were aged 50 to 65 years, 20 per cent were aged >65 years, 52 per cent
were female, 82 per cent were white, and 98 per cent were English-speaking.
Overall, 1617 (96 per cent) respondents believed that elderly people were
more likely than others to have severe illness from WNV infection, and 1249
(63 per cent) believed the same to be true for infants. A total of 906 (56
per cent) respondents were at least "a little" worried about getting WNV
infection (10 per cent "very" and 46 per cent "a little"). A total of 19
per cent of people living in towns with positive WNV surveillance findings
in 2002 were aware that WNV had been detected in their area.
To protect themselves from mosquitoes, 60 per cent of respondents reported
that they sometimes or always avoided outdoor areas with mosquitoes, 39 per
cent avoided outdoor activities, 51 per cent wore long-sleeved shirts and
long pants, and 57 percent used insect repellent on skin or clothes. The
majority (77 per cent) of respondents sometimes or always used at least one
PPB, and 45 per cent always used at least one PPB; 59 per cent sometimes or
always used at least 2 PPBs, and 15 per cent never used any PPBs. Of the
291 people aged >65 years who believed they were more likely to have severe
illness, 61 per cent always used at least one PPB, 68 per cent sometimes or
always used at least 2, and 17 per cent never used any.
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine 4 outcome
variables, including sometimes or always using insect repellent, always
using at least one PPB, sometimes or always using at least 2 PPBs, and
never using any of the 4 PPBs. Using insect repellent was significantly
associated with being aged <50 years, being a little or very worried about
getting WNV, and more often spending >30 minutes outdoors in the evenings.
Always using at least one PPB was significantly associated with being
female, being aged >65 years, having a lower annual income (USD 25 000 to
USD 75 000), and being a little or very worried about getting WNV.
Sometimes or always using 2 or more PPBs also was significantly associated
with being female and being a little or very worried about getting WNV.
Never using PPBs was significantly associated with being male and not being
worried about getting WNV.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The findings in this report show that awareness of local WNV surveillance
findings was poor, and, in contrast to concern about getting WNV infection,
belief in the local presence of WNV was not a predictor of use of PPBs.
Although public announcements of local surveillance findings should
continue, additional methods of communicating the changing levels of risk
and appropriate levels of concern should be explored.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First,
BRFSS relies on the use of self-reporting, which does not allow for
validation of responses. Second, extensive public health outreach and
education on the use of PPBs has occurred in Connecticut during the
preceding 15 years, primarily because of the emergence and recognition of
Lyme disease. Therefore, Connecticut residents might have a higher reported
baseline use of and/or might be more responsive to public health messages
concerning PPBs. Third, questions about the use of PPBs were asked
specifically about behaviors during July and August; therefore, behaviors
during September and October and how behaviors might have changed during
the transmission season were not evaluated. Finally, because BRFSS is a
telephone survey, data were not collected from people who use cellular
phones exclusively or who do not have a telephone.
The use of PPBs is the most effective means of controlling exposure to WNV
infection and might depend on several factors, including an understanding
of the disease and how exposure occurs, personal perception of risk, and
acceptability of using available measures. The WNV epidemics of 2002 and
2003 underscore the need for continued public education, especially
regarding personal protection. Additional efforts should be made to
evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and behavior and to use this information to
refine and improve public health messages and the effectiveness with which
they are delivered. In Connecticut in 2003, questions about WNV were again
added to BRFSS to monitor the use of PPBs and the effectiveness of
health-education efforts.
