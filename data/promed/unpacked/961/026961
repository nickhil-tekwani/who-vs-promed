Hundreds of people have fallen ill after eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Ohio, and now the fast food chain is facing several lawsuits because of it. Authorities have yet to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but Chipotle closed the said branch on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] "out of an abundance of caution," a spokesperson said. As of writing, nearly 700 people have reported getting sick or seeking medical care after eating at the Chipotle branch in question. Initial stool samples tested negative for _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _E. coli_, and norovirus, according to Traci Whittaker, spokesperson for the Delaware County Health District. The stool samples are poised to undergo more tests for other pathogens. Food samples will also be tested for _Bacillus cereus_, _Clostridium perfringens_, plus all the above-mentioned agents.

Affected customers have been reporting symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and food poisoning to the Delaware County Health District and <www.iwaspoisoned.com>, a website dedicated to food-safety surveillance. The reports come from customers who ate at the branch between 26 and 30 Jul 2018.

The store reopened on Tue 31 Jul 2018 after an inspection from the health district said it saw no reason for the chain not to reopen, according to Whittaker.

[The incubation period between eating at the restaurant and becoming ill can be helpful in suggesting a cause. Using a GI pathogen panel that tests using PCR technology to look for specific target genes can be useful. As an example, available technologies can test for an array such as the following:

- _Campylobacter_ species (_Campylobacter jejuni_, _Campylobacter coli_, _Campylobacter upsaliensis_)
- _Clostridium difficile_ toxin A/B
- _Plesiomonas shigelloides_
- _Salmonella_ species
- _Vibrio_ species (_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Vibrio cholerae_)
- _Yersinia_ species
- Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
- Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
- Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
- Shiga toxin
- _E. coli_ O157
- _Shigella_/Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)
- _Cryptosporidium_ species
- _Cyclospora cayetanensis_
- _Entamoeba histolytica_
- _Giardia_
- Adenovirus F 40/41
- Astrovirus
- Norovirus GI/GII
- Rotavirus A
- Sapovirus

ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this rather large outbreak. - Mod.LL
