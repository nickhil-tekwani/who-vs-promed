Mute swan mortalities -- St. Clair River, Ontario, November 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------
In mid-November [2007}, dead mute swans were reported along the St.
Clair River in the vicinity of Sombra, Ontario, and news reports at
the time speculated about avian influenza infection. A total of 7
dead swans were submitted by the Wildlife Enforcement Division of
Environment Canada to the Ontario/Nunavut Region of the Canadian
Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre (CCWHC), Ontario Veterinary
College, University of Guelph.

All 7 swans tested negative for avian influenza virus infection. 3 of
the swans were unsuitable for necropsy, but the other 4 died due to
hemorrhage into their small intestine caused by the trematode (fluke)
_Sphaeridiotrema globulus_, which has a life cycle involving an
aquatic snail as an intermediate host. The swans would have become
infected while feeding, by accidentally ingesting snails, which
contained immature stages of the fluke. _Sphaeridiotrema_ attach to
the intestinal lining and mature in 7 to 10 days. Despite their small
size (about 1.0 mm / 0.04 in. diameter) relatively few flukes (around
100-200) can cause fatal blood loss in a swan. Affected birds become
anemic and/or die of hemorrhagic shock. They may show signs of
weakness and bloody diarrhea prior to death.

Mute Swans, an alien invasive species that is spreading in the wild
in southern Ontario, are highly susceptible to infection with
_Sphaeridiotrema_. Without knowing their movements in the week or so
previous to the mortality, it is not possible to speculate where they
acquired the infection. However, the same parasite killed tundra
swans on nearby Lake St. Clair in April 1996. We have also documented
_Sphaeridiotrema_ as a cause of death in diving ducks on the lower
Great Lakes, and in dabbling ducks on Lake Superior over the past 40
years. The parasite is specific to waterfowl (ducks, geese, and
swans), and apparently poses no risk to people.

Over 730 wild birds have been tested for infection with avian
influenza infection in Ontario in 2007, and no highly pathogenic
strains have been detected. The current status of national scanning
surveillance for avian influenza virus infection in dead wild birds
in Canada can be accessed on the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health
Centre web site at
