["Each year, on 28 Sep, the international community comes together to promote the fight against rabies. World Rabies Day is a day of action and awareness-raising" (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/rabies-portal/).

"More than 95% of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies therefore means combatting it at its animal source.

"Mass vaccination of dogs is the method of choice, because it is the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans.

"Some countries have already managed to eradicate the disease by applying strict prophylactic measures. But it remains endemic in other countries, mainly affecting wild host species.

"In countries where rabies is endemic, measures are in place to control and reduce the risk of infection in vulnerable populations (wildlife, stray and domestic animals) and create a barrier between the animal source and humans.

"To achieve this, there needs to be mass dog vaccination campaigns combined with public information campaigns and the improvement of access to human medical care (anti-rabies vaccines and sera).

"The effective control of stray dog populations and responsible behaviour by dog owners."
