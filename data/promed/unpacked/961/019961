A boy in Chautauqua County was bitten by a rabid raccoon while turkey hunting, according to the Environmental Health Unit of the Chautauqua County Department of Health and Humans Services.

Officials say this is the 1st known rabid animal in the county this year [2019].

According to the Department of Health and Humans Services, the boy was turkey hunting with his father near Open Meadows Road in the Town of North Harmony over the weekend when the raccoon latched onto his jacket, biting him.

"This incident should serve as a reminder to residents, particularly outdoor enthusiasts (hikers, hunters, etc.), animal rabies is a serious public health concern and continues to be present in Chautauqua County," said Mark Stow, County Director of Environmental Health Services. "Raccoons are, by far, the animal most likely to be rabid in the state."

The Department of Health and Humans Services is reminding the public that about one in 10 animals infected by the rabies virus will become aggressive and attack with no incitement, while other rabid animals may appear tame.

There are free rabies vaccination clinics available to the public in Chautauqua County throughout the year. [This must be a rabies clinic for the purpose of vaccinating your pet. A vaccinated pet is one of the best ways to protect your pet and yourself. - Mod.TG]

A man is being treated after being exposed to a fox with rabies.

The Cochise County Sheriff's Department said a man found a fox on his property in the Mule Mountains, west of Bisbee, on 15 Apr 2019. The man's dog was attacked by the fox, and when he was checking on the dog's injuries, he came into contact with the fox. The fox was located, and it tested positive for rabies.

The man is now working with animal control to process his dog and begin the rabies treatment. [This is a confusing sentence. Post exposure prophylaxis is available to the man but not to the dog. However, if the dog is vaccinated, it may be treated for the wounds and revaccinated, depending upon the precise rules of the state. - Mod.TG]

[While there are procedures for human beings having been bitten by a rabid animal, or a suspected rabid animal who cannot be tested, these same protocols are slightly different for exposed animals.

Human beings need to have the wound cleaned and dressed. This individual will likely receive post exposure prophylaxis.

For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine. The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process; https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html.

However, animals who have been vaccinated will need their wounds cleaned and cared for. They will be re-vaccinated and, depending upon the specific state, are likely to be quarantined for a period of time.

If the bitten animal has not been vaccinated, the animal is likely to be euthanized, as it presents a risk of rabies to its owners.

The lesson is to keep your animals vaccinated. Check with your veterinarian regarding your state and county law on frequency of vaccination for your pets. Pets includes dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and other animals you have contact with. - Mod.TG
