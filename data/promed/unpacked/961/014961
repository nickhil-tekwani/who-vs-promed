Health authorities in Panama reported the detection of 3 more cases
of equine encephalitis in humans, raising to 11 the number of
positive cases to date. According to the Ministry of Health, the
affected individuals were admitted to a [health] assistance center in
the capital and are currently in stable condition. Of the total
infected individuals, 7 continue to be hospitalized (2 of which are
in serious condition), 3 were discharged, and a 2-year-old girl died
of the disease.

The disease is located in the province of Darien (on the border with
Colombia), and in eastern areas of the province of Panama.

Preliminary investigations show that the variety [of virus
responsible for these infections is] the one denominated as eastern
[equine] encephalitis, which has a [case] fatality of 65 percent in
humans and up to 90 percent in equine [infections]. As a preventive
measure, fumigation activities against breeding areas of the
mosquitoes that are vectors of the disease [virus] have been
intensified. Also, the Ministry of Agricultural Development decreed
an animal health alert for the entire country and prohibited the
movement of equine animals out of areas where equine encephalitis is located.

[It appears from this report that a definite diagnosis of eastern
equine encephalitis has been made for these cases. A previous
ProMED-mail post indicated that Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE)
virus was responsible for the equine cases, as the government of
Panama had reported to OIE (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100609.1934). If the Panama Ministry of Health officially confirms
these as EEE virus infections, then transmission of both viruses in
the Darien area may be occurring.
