Agriculture officials say 6 horses have died in North Carolina after eating hay containing blister beetles.

The Rocky Mount Telegram reports (http://bit.ly/1iYsMPo) that state Department of Agriculture investigators have linked the deaths to a load of alfalfa hay delivered from Kansas last month [August 2015] to feed stores in Louisburg and Middlesex. The 2 stores sold the hay from 11 Aug 2015 until Mon 14 Sep 2015, when the state issued a stop-sale order.

Officials say a poison in the blister beetle can be fatal to horses and can also sicken cattle, goats, and sheep.

The D&B Acres' owner says 4 of the Nashville farm's horses died within 12 hours of eating the contaminated hay. 3 of her other horses are recovering and [a family member] says they probably didn't eat as much as the others.

[Blister beetles contain the toxic agent cantharidin. Cantharidin produces painful lesions in the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, and even the bladder.

Horses are more often affected as they are fed alfalfa hay, one of the beetle favorites. However, these beetles also like certain flowering weeds and can be found in other hays, especially clover or mixes. Therefore cattle, goats and sheep may also be affected, with similar clinical signs and outcomes as those of the horse. Emus and ostriches will eat the beetles and suffer the same fate.

Cantharidin is odorless and colorless, so it is important to monitor alfalfa hay for early detection of the blister beetles or their parts, as a preventive measure. If gone unnoticed within the alfalfa hay, once ingested it is highly irritating, causing acantholysis [loss of intercellular connections] of the gastrointestinal tract, especially of the esophagus and nonglandular portion of the stomach, and of vesicles in skin or mucous membranes of horses. Cantharidin acts by altering mitochondrial metabolism via its inhibition of protein phosphatase, which is involved in the control of cell proliferation, activity of membrane-associated channels and receptors, and modulation of protein kinases and phosphatases. The inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A causes an increase in permeability of endothelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion by enhancing the phosphorylation of endothelial regulating proteins.

Clinical signs begin to appear 6-8 hours after ingestion of cantharidin. The affected horse may experience colic due to the irritation and vesicle formation in the gastrointestinal tract or because of decreased contractility, hypomotility, and ileus. Also, it may be restless, irritable, sweating, have diarrhea, and/or submerge its muzzle in water, (a common sign of cantharidin toxicosis). Cantharidin toxicosis also causes mucosal hemorrhage and inflammation of the urinary tract, which may manifest itself as signs of hematuria, stranguria [difficultly urinating] and/or dysuria [painful urination]. The cardiovascular system is less frequently affected but, clinically, a horse may present with synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF) [thumps, hiccup-like contractions of the diaphragm]. This is caused by alteration in membrane potential of the phrenic nerve and its discharge in response to electrical impulses generated during myocardial depolarization. The nervous system is less commonly affected, but an affected horse may present with aggressive behavior, seizure-like muscle activity secondary to colic, or muscle fasciculations. Most commonly, the horse presents with colic, depression, fever, dehydration, gastritis, esophagitis, and oral ulcers.

Laboratory findings can also be helpful in diagnosing cantharidin toxicosis. Serum calcium is usually markedly decreased and may remain low for prolonged periods. This hypocalcemia may be manifested clinically as SDF, tremors, or abnormal facial expressions, such as clamped jaws with lips drawn back. The serum magnesium concentration is also usually low, while creatinine kinase can increase markedly within the first 24 hours after ingestion. In acutely affected horses, urinalysis reveals markedly decreased specific gravity, often less than 1.101, and hematuria with or without myoglobinuria. Also, in acute cases, horses are frequently hyperglycemic and analysis of peritoneal fluid may reveal increased protein, greater than 4 g/dl, with normal numbers of white blood cells and fibrinogen levels. If the toxin has caused renal tubular necrosis and/or hypoproteinemia, there may be increases in serum urea nitrogen, approximately 50-70 mg/dl, and increases in creatinine, approximately 2-10 mg/dl. Total protein may be normal or increased during the first 24 hours, but then drops dramatically. Most commonly, the horse's laboratory findings include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and azotemia.

Cantharidin toxicosis can be confirmed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect and quantify cantharidin in the urine of live or dead horses, and in the gastric contents, liver, or kidneys of dead horses. It is best to submit at least one pint of stomach contents or 20 ml of urine on ice for analysis.

At necropsy. erosions in the oral cavity, esophagus, and stomach may be seen, as well as ulcerated to pseudomembranous enteritis. The most commonly reported gross pathologic lesions include necrosis and ulceration of the squamous lining of the distal esophagus, forestomach, and urinary bladder.

There is no specific antidote for cantharidin toxicosis, so the treatment is usually directed at cantharidin removal, reduction, and immediate symptomatic therapy. The fatality rate can be as high as 65 percent, but with aggressive therapy, can be reduced to 20 percent. Horses with a toxic dose can die within 3-18 hours of onset, but, if they survive for 72 hours, recovery is more likely. Calcium and magnesium supplementation for prolonged periods of time is almost always indicated, but their administration should be carefully monitored and linked to serum chemistries. If the horse is exhibiting signs of gastritis, often indicated by submerging the muzzle in water repeatedly, sucralfate can be administered as a protectant. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can alleviate pain and protect against endotoxemia, but should be used with caution because NSAIDs are toxic to the kidney if the horse is dehydrated and if renal damage has occurred. The horse should also be stall rested for 5-10 days.

Prevention is the most effective way to avoid cantharidin toxicosis. The 1st cutting of hay is often free from blister beetles because the adults do not emerge until late May or June (in the southwest and southern plains, if cut before mid-May). Also, it is important not to crimp the hay during cutting so that the beetles can escape rather than get trapped and incorporated into the hay. Cutting the alfalfa at 10 percent or less can decrease the chance of poisoning because beetles are attracted to flowering plants. Scouting the fields for beetles and treating with a short residual insecticide before cutting helps to prevent blister beetle infestation. Sevin XLR has been has been used for prevention of infestation by blister beetles and other toxic insects. Carbaryl and parathion have also been commonly used to kill blister beetles, but have a pre-harvest waiting period that does not give them adequate residual activity to kill blister beetles that enter the field from spray time until just before harvest.

Blister beetle, or cantharidin, toxicosis is an important disease that should be considered when horses present with colic or acute death soon after ingestion of alfalfa. A definitive diagnosis may be determined if there is a history of feeding alfalfa or alfalfa-containing products, laboratory findings of hypocalcemia with or without hypomagnesemia, identification of blister beetles in hay or GI contents, and gross identification of ulcers in the distal esophagus, stomach and urinary bladder on necropsy. Confirmation using HPLC to determine the presence and amount of cantharidin in stomach contents or urine can be used. In order to prevent cantharidin toxicosis, proper cutting of alfalfa, surveying of fields and use of an insecticide, if necessary, are recommended.
