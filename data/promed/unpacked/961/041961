3 additional cases of polio virus infection have now been
identified in central Minnesota, according to officials at
the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH).
3 children -- all members of the same family -- have now
been found to be infected with the virus. MDH disease
investigators say there are direct links between the family
of the 3 children and the family of an infant found to be
infected with the virus at the end of September [2005]. The
2 families are not related by blood.
Like the infant, the 3 children do not have any symptoms of
paralytic polio -- and like the infant, they had not been
vaccinated against the illness.
MDH officials are not providing any additional information
about the cases because the information could be used to
identify the children involved, in violation of the state
Data Practices Law.
Both of the affected families are members of the Amish
community in central Minnesota. Health officials are working
with the Amish community to identify people who may have
been exposed to the virus -- and make sure people who may be
at risk have been immunized against polio.
The 3 new cases were identified through efforts by local,
state and federal public health officials to follow up with
people who may have been exposed to the virus -- either
through direct contact with the infant, or through contact
with individuals who had contact with the infant and became
infected.
"These cases do not represent a generalized outbreak of
polio virus infection," said Minnesota health commissioner
Dianne Mandernach. "You are not at risk of infection unless
you have had close contact with an infected person, and you
have not been immunized against polio. The general public is
not at risk."
An estimated 93 per cent of Minnesota infants have been
immunized against polio, and 98 per cent of Minnesota
children have been immunized by the time they start school,
Mandernach said.
MDH has been focusing its disease investigation on the Amish
community, and on health care workers who may have provided
care to the infected infant, according to Dr Harry Hull,
Minnesota state epidemiologist.
"We will continue to follow up directly with people who may
have been exposed to the virus," Dr Hull said. "Unless you
are contacted directly by a health care or public health
worker, you are not at any risk of infection in connection
with these cases."
"However, these cases do serve to underscore the importance
of making sure your immunizations are up to date for polio
and other vaccine-preventable diseases," Dr Hull added.
"Because members of the central Minnesota Amish community
have links with Amish groups in other parts of the country,
it's possible that cases of infection may eventually be
identified outside Minnesota," Dr Hull said.
MDH officials say the virus strain found in the 4 central
Minnesota cases appears to be a variant of the strain used
in oral polio vaccine, which is still used in some parts of
the world -- but not in the US.
Use of the live-virus oral vaccine [OPV - Mod.MPP] was
discontinued in the US in 2000. All polio vaccinations in
the US are now done with an injected, killed-virus vaccine
[IPV - Mod.MPP].
Before use of the live-virus vaccine was discontinued, it
caused about 8 cases of paralytic polio a year in the US, on
average. The last case of naturally occurring polio in the
US was reported in 1979. Naturally occurring polio is
considered to be eradicated in the western hemisphere.
Paralytic disease is relatively uncommon in people who are
infected with the polio virus, occurring in only about one
of every 200 people infected.

4 children in 2 Amish families in Minnesota have been
infected with polio after not being vaccinated against the
disease, probably for religious reasons, state health
officials said on Thursday [13 Oct 2005].
Genetic testing shows the polio involved likely originated
overseas in an infant who had been vaccinated with a live
poliovirus, state epidemiologist Dr Harry Hull said. That
kind of vaccine has not been used in the United States for 5
years.
He said a Minnesota Amish infant who was first diagnosed
with polio [sic. poliovirus infection, not paralytic
poliomyelitis - Mod.MPP] in September [2005] would have had
direct contact with someone exposed to the imported virus,
perhaps through a chain of people.
3 other children, all members of a 2nd Amish family, have
now been found to be infected with the virus. None of the 4
has shown signs of paralysis, the Minnesota Department of
Health said.
"Disease investigators say there are direct links between
the family of the 3 children and the family of an infant
found to be infected with the virus at the end of September
[2005]. The 2 families are not related by blood," the
department said.
Hull said in an interview that the Amish community in
Minnesota, like others spread across the United States, is
insular, operating its own schools and often refusing
vaccinations for religious reasons.
"This is very unusual," he said. "Our concern is that since
the virus has started to spread there is the potential for
it to spread to other Amish communities across the country,"
he added. The Amish are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptists
who eschew modern devices such as motorized vehicles and
live in rural areas.

[Borrowing from this moderator's comment that accompanied
the 1st report of a case of vaccine-derived poliovirus in
the immunodeficient child in Minnesota, from the information
presently available, it appears as though the polioviruses
identified in these children are genetically related to the
viruses used in the preparation of the oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV). OPV has been associated with rare cases of
vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in
individuals who have directly received the vaccine and in
those who have had contact with recently vaccinated
individuals. In addition, there have been reports of cases
of paralytic poliomyelitis associated with circulating
vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) where there has been a
reversion to neurovirulence of the involved circulating
vaccine-derived virus. (see Poliovirus isolation, vaccine
strain - USA (MN): RFI 20051002.2884 for more background on
the occurrence of VAPP in the USA before cessation of use of
OPV for routine vaccinations.)
Since the USA changed vaccination policy to use IPV rather
than OPV, there have been no further cases of VAPP reported
in the USA (see ref. below). That decision was based on the
observation that the majority of cases of paralytic disease
in the USA after the outbreak in 1978 were VAPP, and were
related to exposure to the OPV. Somewhat ironic, since that
very same trait of the vaccine (OPV) -- spread to other
non-vaccinated individuals -- is a positive trait in
countries where wild poliovirus is circulating, as it helps
to increase the overall "vaccination coverage" by spreading
the vaccine virus in the community and infecting (and
thereby protecting) other children who had not received the
vaccine.
The above 4 "cases" mentioned are not cases of VAPP, as
there is no paralytic disease associated with these
infections. One of the serious concerns in the current
incident is the possibility of reversion of neurovirulence
of the vaccine virus after continued passage in polio-naive
individuals (with no pre-existing immunity, either through
adequate vaccination or through prior exposure to
poliovirus), especially in the immunocompromised infant
mentioned as the 1st case, as chronic infection with
vaccine-derived poliovirus has been reported in
immunocompromised hosts (see ref below).
The identification of 4 infections (involving 2 families
that seem to have had contact with each other) suggests that
there has been at least 2 and possibly 3 generations of
passage of this vaccine poliovirus (the 1st generation being
the original vaccinated individual -- the "index infection",
the 2nd the immunocompromised infant identified on 1 Oct
2005, and now the 3 children in a contact family, although
they may have been infected at the same time as the infant
with a common exposure to the "index" infection). However,
the news release does not mention identification of the
"index" infected individual as yet, somewhat suggesting that
there is cVDPV in the above community.
Again, borrowing from the earlier moderator comment: "as the
above articles clearly state, if one has been adequately
vaccinated, the risk of paralytic disease from contact with
a cVDPV is very low, and with a 93 per cent vaccination
coverage rate with IPV in Minnesota, unless the virus
"enters" a pocket of susceptibles, the risk of further cases
associated with this event is low." That being said, it
appears as though the virus has entered a pocket of
susceptibles (a community that rejects vaccination based on
religious grounds), and as stated by Dr Harry Hull of
Minnesota (and formerly of the Polio Eradication Program at
WHO in Geneva), the possibility of spread to other similar
religious communities in the USA is a real concern. We do
not know the actual risk of paralytic disease from cVDPV,
but we do know it has occurred (see ProMED-mail postings on
Poliomyelitis, vaccine-derived in Haiti and the Dominican
Republic, Madagascar, the Philippines and Egypt -- Polio,
circulation of vaccine-derived virus).
This moderator has not forgotten the last outbreak of wild
poliovirus in the USA in 1978, among a similar community
that rejected vaccination based on religious beliefs. The
"itinerary" of the wild poliovirus involved in that outbreak
probably began in Kuwait, as the virus identified was
genetically similar to a strain of poliovirus that was in
circulation in Kuwait in 1977. It then went to the
Netherlands, where it circulated among a religious group
that shunned vaccinations (and still shuns vaccines today),
in which there were about 80 cases; it then traveled to
Canada and circulated among Canadian members of this same
religious group, resulting in 11 cases, and then traveled to
a different religious group that also rejects vaccination in
the USA and resulted in 15 cases.
More information on the findings of further investigations
would be very much appreciated. This moderator suspects
that through this incident and investigation, we are now
being given the opportunity to study more closely the
"natural history" of cVDPV and perhaps learn more about the
true risks of neurovirulence reversion, and perhaps further
data to feed into the "endgame" strategy for
poliovaccination once eradication has been achieved.
