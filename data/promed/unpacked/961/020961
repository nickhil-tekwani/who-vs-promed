Certain news broadcasts from Radio France Internationale on 23 Apr 2005
contained a report that one individual in Bata in Equatorial Guinea had
died from a disease believed to be Ebola hemorrhagic fever.
Does anyone have further information concerning this case?

Equatorial Guinea: Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever Alert in Bata
---------------------------------------------------
The Minister of Health of Equatorial Guinea announced an "urgent alert" on
Friday [22 Apr 2005?] for the general population of the country following
the death of a man presenting with the symptoms of Ebola haemorragic fever
in Bata, the 2nd largest city of the continental part of the country,
according to a report on Sat 23 Apr 2005 on national radio.
"Any patient with a very high fever and hemorrhaging from mouth, ears, nose
and eyes, must be taken immediately to the nearest health centre" declared
the Minister in a communique read on the national radio.
The local heath authorities recommended also that: "Deceased individuals
with the above symptoms should be buried immediately" in order to prevent
spread of this virus [infection], which is fatal in the majority of cases.
The text stated also warned against: "Handling a cadaver for washing or
dressing, (....) and to avoid eating meat from monkeys or animals found
dead in the forest."
Bata, the economic capital, is situated in the continental part of
Equatorial Guinea, bordering Gabon, a country that has had [outbreaks] of
Ebola [fever] several times in previous years. Precautionary measures have
been taken in several other central African countries, including Gabon, to
prevent transmission of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, [which is caused by a
virus] closely related to Ebola virus, and which, since October 2004, has
been affecting Angola, where more than 240 persons have died [as a result
of Marburg fever].

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Christiana Coyle for the information on the
Radio France Internationale report. The Afrique Central report reproduced
above indicates that so far there has been no confirmation of the diagnosis
of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Other possibilities, such as yellow fever --
which has been active in the area -- have yet to be excluded. Further
information is awaited. - Mods.MPP/CP]
