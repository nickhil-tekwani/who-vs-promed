[2] Scottish nurse in serious condition with relapse
Date: Fri 9 Oct 2015

A Scottish nurse who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone last year [2014] is in a "serious condition" after being readmitted to an isolation unit in London.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed that the virus is still present in PC's body after being left over from the original infection. She is not thought to be contagious. The 39-year-old has been flown back to the isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Bodily tissues can harbour the Ebola infection months after the person appears to have fully recovered. PC, from Cambuslang in South Lanarkshire, spent almost a month in the unit at the beginning of the year after contracting the virus in December 2014. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said she had been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow on Tue [6 Oct 2015] after feeling unwell and was treated in its infectious diseases unit. She was then transferred [by air] to the Royal Free Hospital in the early hours of Fri [9 Oct 2015] morning due to an "unusual late complication" in her illness.

Dr Emilia Crighton, NHSGGC director of public health, said: "PC's condition is a complication of a previous infection with the Ebola virus. The risk to the public is very low. In line with normal procedures in cases such as this, we have identified a small number of close contacts of PC's that we will be following up as a precaution." Government sources have described her transfer to the specialist unit as a "highly precautionary process."

Fri 9 Oct 2015 Fears of "post-Ebola syndrome" as persistence in survivors fuels concerns

Case of Scottish nurse, back in hospital after recovering from disease, adds to evidence that virus can hide in body
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A growing awareness of how the Ebola virus can hide in parts of the body, such as eyes, breasts and testicles, long after leaving the bloodstream raises questions about whether the disease can ever be beaten. Virologists said Friday's [9 Oct 2015] case of a Scottish nurse, PC, who had recovered from Ebola but is now suffering complications adds to signs that the virus is a long-term health risk and can lead to a "post-Ebola syndrome."

"Over the past few years, there has been mounting evidence of mental and physical health problems in Ebola survivors that can last for years after the virus is cleared from the bloodstream," said Ben Neuman, an Ebola expert and lecturer in virology at Britain's University of Reading.

"The newly discovered twist on this post-Ebola syndrome is that in some cases, the health problems -- often including damage to the eyes and joints -- are caused by live Ebola virus growing in fluids in some of the less accessible compartments of the body."

Ebola, one of the deadliest viruses known in humans, infected 28 000 people and killed more than 11 300 of them in an unprecedented outbreak in West Africa, which was declared in March 2014 and is only now coming under control. The World Health Organization announced on Wed [7 Oct 2015] that it had recorded its 1st entire week without any new confirmed Ebola patients since the devastating outbreak began. Still, more than 500 people are being tracked in Guinea for symptoms of the disease, and WHO said there is "considerable risk" of further spread.

Ebola experts said in August [2015] that around half of Ebola survivors in West Africa were already reporting suffering from chronic problems, including serious joint pain and eye inflammation that can lead to blindness. "Due to the sheer scale of this outbreak compared to previous ones, we are going to see aspects of Ebola virus infection that we have not observed before," said Julian Hiscox, a professor of infection and global health at Britain's Liverpool University. He was concerned that Ebola's persistence in survivors, who have no obvious symptoms of Ebola infection and so are often living and working normally and not kept in isolation as a symptomatic patient would be, means they are "a potential reservoir of the virus. It's why men who have had Ebola and recovered are advised to abstain or wear condoms," he noted.

WHO's advice is that all male survivors should be tested 3 months after the onset of symptoms and then monthly until they know they have no risk of passing on the virus through their semen.

John Edmunds, an expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that while the risk of transmission from survivors harboring the virus in their eye fluids and other organs "appears to be very low," it still warrants attention. "With so many survivors in West Africa now, there is a risk that further outbreaks can be triggered, which is why authorities have to remain very vigilant," he said.

PC, a 39-year-old nurse, was back in hospital in London on Fri [9 Oct 2015] with doctors saying she would be treated in isolation as a precautionary measure. The hospital said in a statement that it had "identified a small number of close contacts ... that we will be following up as a precaution," but added: "The risk to the general public remains low."

PC was the 1st person to be diagnosed with Ebola on British soil and was originally discharged in January [2015] after seemingly making a full recovery. Neuman said the likelihood of survivors spreading Ebola depends on how much of the virus is present in the blood. In PC's case, he said: "If her body was able to control the virus once, the chances are she can do it twice."

Sat 10 Oct 2015 Nurse with Ebola visited school day before being readmitted to hospital
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/nurse-ebola-visited-school-hospital-readmitted-pauline-cafferkey

[...PC visited Mossneuk primary school in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on Mon 5 Oct 2015 to thank children for their fundraising efforts. Jim Gilhooly, the council's executive director of education resources, said: "Having returned to work as a nurse some time ago, PC gave a presentation at an assembly to pupils in the upper school, P4-P7. She wanted to thank them for their fundraising earlier in the year as well as share her experiences as a nurse. We have been assured that her illness cannot be spread through ordinary social contact, and we have reassured parents and carers of this [fact]. NHS Lanarkshire staff attended the school on Fri [9 Oct 2015] to reassure anyone with concerns."

[See ProMED-mail Ebola update (96): WHO update, post-Ebola syndrome, vaccine, research 20150809.3567970 for a discussion on the sequelae that people who have had Ebola are encountering. It would be helpful if more details were provided on this case, e.g., has live virus been isolated or only RNA? If the former, then why do the doctors consider infectiousness low? What symptoms was PC experiencing that suddenly led to alarm? PC has said that she has never fully recovered from her ordeal. She has contended with her hair falling out as well as problems with her thyroid (http://www.digitaljournal.com/life/health/ebola-virus-reactivates-in-uk-nurse-condition-is-serious/article/446191).

The only other known case of an individual who ostensibly recovered from disease was Dr. Ian Crozier. In his case, Ebola was found to live undetected inside one of his eyeballs, even though the rest of his body appeared to be clear of virus. Samples from tears and the outer eye membrane tested negative, which meant that the patient was not at risk of spreading the disease during casual contact. This individual also experienced mental and physical sequelae. - Mod.LK]

This is a long and detailed expert review of the PC case as far as is known to date, with 17 pertinent links. New to me is the information from the family that she had been having hair loss, thyroid problems, and meningitis symptoms previous to this relapse.

ProMED thanks the many subscribers who have sent in dozens of reports on the case. - Mod.JW]

[The Federal Government has dispatched a medical team to Calabar, Cross River state to ascertain the suspected Ebola scare. The accident and emergency ward of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital has been shut down following an Ebola virus scare. However, the Federal Ministry of Health has ruled out the case [as] Ebola, saying that it suspected that the patient could have died of haemorrhagic fever.]

9 Oct 2015 WHO: Nigerian at centre of Ebola scare did not have the virus

["The dead person tested negative for Ebola. So this person is not going to be the source of an Ebola event," [WHO spokesperson] Hartl wrote. "A laboratory investigation showed the dead person did not have Ebola or Lassa fever," Hartl said.

It is not clear which hemorrhagic fever virus is suspect at this time. A number of other viruses endemic to the region besides Lassa present with hemorrhagic fever, including those causing Marburg, CCHF (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever), Rift Valley fever and yellow fever. It is important to know which one, because if it was yellow fever, vaccination is urgently needed. Any further information would be greatly appreciated; Nigeria has the diagnostic capability. - Mod.LK/JW]

[In a clinical trial of the compound GS-5374, which is currently being conducted by Gilead Sciences, it blocks the ability of the Ebola virus to replicate in the body, successfully preventing rhesus monkeys from succumbing to Ebola virus disease (EVD). Gilead Sciences worked with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to develop the vaccine. GS-5374 was also effective in the lab against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Marburg virus, and several variants of Ebola virus, including the strain responsible for the current outbreak in West Africa. The compound works by blocking the viral RNA replication process.]
