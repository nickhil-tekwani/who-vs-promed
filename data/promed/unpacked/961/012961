Whooping Cough Makes Global Comeback
--------------------------------------------------------------
MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Whooping cough, largely regarded as an infant
disease, is making a global comeback in all age groups, experts said
Sat 27 Apr 2002. Scientists don't know why but suspect that
protection from immunization wears off after a few years and that the
bug has outsmarted vaccines used to control it for decades.
Infectious disease specialists meeting in Milan this week said
growing numbers of teens, adults, and elderly people are carrying the
disease unknowingly and spreading it to babies who have not yet been
vaccinated.
Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria _Bordetella pertussis_. It
is usually mild in adults but has a high death rate in infants. Until
immunization was introduced in the 1940s, whooping cough was one of
the most frequent and severe illnesses for infants in many countries.
In nations where the vaccine is not used, whooping cough is still a
major cause of death in children, with an estimated 51 million cases
and 600 000 deaths annually. The germ had been well controlled for
decades in the industrialized world, but over the last few years the
bacteria has begun to strike back in almost all developed countries.
In the United States there were 7796 cases in 1996, the highest
annual number reported since 1967.
Scientists say that although vaccination works well for young
children, the protection doesn't last for life, and no vaccine has
been developed for older people. ``We found that after something
like 15 years, you may be fully susceptible again, but it may be even
shorter,'' said Dr. Carl Heinz Wirsing von Konig, director of the
Institute for Hygiene and Medical Laboratories at the University of
Dusseldorf in Germany.
In France, no cases are seen in children between 2 and 8 years old,
which indicates that immunity wears off by the time a child is 8.
After discovering that, France introduced booster shots at age 11,
said Nicole Guiso, director of the National Reference Center for
Bordetella at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Part of the problem is
that much of the rise is being seen among teens and adults. ``The
disease is around and it is vastly underreported,'' von Konig said at
the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases.
``What proportion of coughing is pertussis? Irrespective of the
country, mostly between 20 and 30 percent of all coughing adults
actually have pertussis,'' he said. Dr. Joop Schellekens, of the
Netherlands National Institute of Public Health, proposed that
expectant parents get booster shots in the third trimester of
pregnancy to protect babies until they are vaccinated. In most
countries, infants get their first pertussis shot at one month old.
They are immunized again at 2 months, then 3 months, and given a
booster at 15 months.
Whooping cough is more difficult to detect in adults than in
children, but von Konig estimated that 80 to 90 percent of people
with the disease have a cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. It is
also characterized by night coughing that disturbs sleep, vomiting,
30-second sweating attacks and complications such as hernias or rib
fractures, von Konig said.
In many countries, such as the Netherlands and Canada, outbreaks have
occurred despite high vaccination rates. Recent studies have
suggested that the varieties of the pertussis bacteria in circulation
today are different than they were in the past. In a Netherlands
outbreak in 1996-1997, strains of the bug analyzed were different
from the strains used to produce the vaccine in that country. The
same problem has been observed in Canada. One theory for the
resurgence of the disease is that new strains of _Bordetella
pertussis_ may have evolved that are resistant to the vaccines used
in some countries.

[There is increasing evidence supporting the concern re: waning
immunity and the role of adults in persistent transmission of
pertussis (ref 3). Health care workers have been identified as
carriers/transmitters in nosocomial outbreaks of pertussis (ref 2).
The recent presentation of the epidemiology of pertussis in the USA
(ref 4) showed a shift in the age distribution of cases with 29
percent aged 10-19 years and 20 percent aged greater than or equal to
20 years old. Therefore almost half of the reported cases were
adolescent or older. This probably is an underestimate of the true
proportions, as pertussis in older age groups is milder and probably
misdiagnosed as other sub-acute persistent cough illnesses. Current
vaccine recommendations do not support booster doses of pertussis in
adults, but with this continuing trend of the importance of adults in
continued transmission and probable waning immunity, this is clearly
an area under research.

More Whooping Cough Cases Reported (edited)
-----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 1046 cases of whooping cough have been reported in
Arkansas since September [2001, with 98 of those cases occurring in
the past month [April. The outbreak is centered in Lonoke, Pike,
Pulaski, and Saline counties in the state, but the disease is present
in about 46 of the state's 75 counties, according to data. The
outbreak is primarily affecting adolescents between the ages of 15
and 18 years; however, health officials note that in Lonoke, Pulaski,
and Saline counties, the patients are generally between the ages of 4
and 6 years. This is the largest outbreak in Arkansas since the
vaccine was launched in the 1940s.

[This outbreak of pertussis, which began in the fall of 2001, is
continuing and seems to have spread quickly through much of the
state. In October, the Arkansas State Health Department was
investigating cases of the disease in 11 counties. By November,
cases were being investigated in 32 counties. In a report from 9 Nov
2001, a high school in Arkansas County was reported to have closed
due to so many students (114) affected by the disease. To protect
infants in areas with higher rates of infection, it was recommended
to speed up the primary sequence of vaccination (starting at 6 weeks
instead of 2 months and with shorter intervals between the subsequent
3 doses).
The reported ages of the cases seems to be biphasic in distribution
and involving children beginning school/pre-school and those in high
school. The younger cohort may be among those with an incomplete
primary series, and the older cohort may be those who, in addition,
may be manifesting some waning immunity. Control of such outbreaks
is related to aggressive immunization programs to complete the
recommended series. With the use of the acellular vaccine, more use
of the vaccine in adults may be needed, since adults with waned
immunity often serve as a reservoir to infect susceptible children. -
