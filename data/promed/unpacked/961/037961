Malaria resurfaces in Palm Beach County
---------------------------------------
The Palm Beach County Health Department released this information on Friday
afternoon after identifying a person with malaria: the Department has
identified a person with malaria who may have infected mosquitoes. This
occurrence leaves [could leave. - Mod.SH] other residents at risk at this time.
Residents are being asked to protect against mosquito bites and report to a
medical provider any symptoms of high fever and teeth-chattering chills.
The Health Department has launched a full-scare awareness campaign in the
hopes of identifying other potential cases, creating awareness of the
situation, and contacted mosquito control to increase spraying and trapping
of mosquitoes. The incident is similar to the malaria outbreak of 8 cases
in 2003.
The current case had active malaria in early June. The cycle to infect
another person is about 30 days. Given this time frame, the potential for
infection is very high, according to health director, Jean Malecki, MD.
Malecki added, "We know last year's carrier had the disease in June and the
first 2 local cases were exposed around the 4 July holiday. The potential
exists for this cycle to begin now."
Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by the anopheles mosquitoes and
can be treated. The symptoms vary depending on which of the 4 human malaria
strains has been contracted. Symptoms include; headache, aching in the
bones, anorexia, vomiting, teeth-chattering chills coupled with sensations
of heat and high fever and sweating. The onset of symptoms can be as early
as 7 days and as long as several months.
People exhibiting any signs or symptoms of the disease should report to
their nearest hospital. Information can be obtained by calling the Health
Department, Epidemiology Department at 561-840-4566.

Officials: mosquitos with malaria likely
----------------------------------------
Health department officials warned Friday there is a "very high" chance
that mosquitoes with malaria are flying around, after an infected Lake
Worth man was bitten.
The man, in his 20s, represents the first case of malaria in Palm Beach
County since last year's outbreak that infected 8 people -- the most in
nearly half a century. No one died during last year's outbreak, but it
lasted more than 3 months and was finally controlled in October.
The recently infected man, whose name was not released, lives west of Dixie
Highway and works outdoors, according to the health department. He
contracted the disease in the fall of 2003 while he was in Central America.
Although the man was treated at that time, he was not cured and returned to
Palm Beach County in January still carrying the parasite, Palm Beach County
Health Department spokesman Tim O'Connor said. His symptoms returned in
late May and he was infectious for about 2 weeks. He was hospitalized at
Delray Beach Medical Center from June 4 to 7 and is now cured, O'Connor said.
"He was outdoors and very active and bitten by mosquitoes during that time
he was highly infectious," O'Connor said. There are some promising
indicators that the disease won't spread. The overall mosquito population
is at its lowest level in 10 years because of the dry weather, said Ed
Bradford, director of mosquito control for the county. And the type of
mosquito that transmits malaria, anopheles, is uncommon in Lake Worth,
according to Bradford. "Where this gentleman lives, there just aren't the
canals or that type of environment where many of these (mosquitos) live.
But it only takes one," he said.
If the man was bitten by that species, the mosquito would have about two
weeks to infect another person and that person would start to see symptoms
in about 2 weeks -- which is about now.
A truck was expected to spray the man's neighborhood on Friday after dark
and traps will be set up on Tuesday to begin collecting mosquitos for
testing, Bradford said. Unrelated to the malaria case, an airplane sprayed
246 000 acres of the county Thursday night, including this man's
neighborhood, Bradford said.
During last year's outbreak, investigators never identified the "index
case", or first person to bring malaria to the area. This time, the "index
case" would be the Lake Worth man from Central America. Last year's
outbreak is unrelated to this case, although both are the mild strain of
the virus.

[ProMED-mail reported extensively on the Florida outbreak of _Plasmodium
vivax_ malaria in 2003 [See also: MMWR 2003; 52(38): 908-11, 26 Sep]. It
sounds as if this case is also infected with _P. vivax_. He had acquired
the infection abroad. It had been treated but not totally eradicated. When
it recurred his blood would be infectious. If bitten by an anopheline
mosquito that went on to bite someone else that peson could become infected
too. Molecular typing of the cases in 2003 showed that all had been
infected from the same source, but the source was never identified.
Molecular typing of the parasites in this patient will show whether they
are closely related to last year's patients or whether there is another
source. - Mod.EP]
