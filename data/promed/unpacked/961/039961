[According to information published by the Pirbright Institute World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, FMD serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage Iran-05 was identified in Saudi Arabia in Jan 2006. This serotype was also identified in the years 1973, 1976, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1995, 2005 and 2011. See information at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm.

Unless a new topotype was identified, serotype A is not a new strain reported by Saudi Arabia. Based on historical detections of serotype A, it appears to re-occur periodically. - Mod.CRD
