Palestine: outbreak of anthrax in Nablus
----------------------------------------
The ag [agriculture] authorities of the Palestinian Auton.
Territories reported the death of one sheep due to anthrax.

Ten days prior to that, 7 sheep were introduced in the herd of 300
sheep, 33 goats, and 39 cows. Treatment of affected animals with
penicillin and vaccination are part of the measures.

The last occurrence of anthrax in Palestine was in 2004.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A Robertson

[Outbreaks of anthrax in the Palestinian Autonomous Territories are
truly sporadic and frequently hard to explain. In this case the
history of a recent intake of animals raises the possibility of an
activation of a latent infection acquired elsewhere, possibly
facilitated by the stress of transportation. - Mod.MHJ]

[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the maps included in
both reports above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the
Palestinian Autonomous Territories is available at
