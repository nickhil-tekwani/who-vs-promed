COXIELLA BURNETTI (Q FEVER): PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
=======================================================

A local medical practitioner (Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal, South
Africa) has enquired as to whether the consumption of milk from cows
serologically positive for Q fever (Coxiella burnetti) presents any
danger to human health. It is known that this organism has a
predeliction for the placenta and udder and that it is shed in milk,
and that it is very resistant to dessication, extremes of temperature
and various disinfectants.
The following questions are without clear answers. Any comment or
suggestions will be appreciated.
1. Does the human consumption of raw or pasteurised milk from dairy
herds which are serologically positive for Q fever pose a
significant hazard to human health?

2. What are the chances of humans becoming clinically infected with
Coxiella burnetti as a result of drinking milk from serologically
positive herds?

3. Do any countries in the world enforce specific regulations
regarding the suitability of milk from such herds for human
consumption either as raw milk or after pasteurisation or other
forms of processing?

4. What (if any) action is taken in serologically positive herds in
any countries which do have regulations in this regard?
5. Is this organism shed continously in the milk of a serologically
positive cow?
6. Is the chance of contracting Q fever by the inhalation of
contaminated dust or as a result of tick bites any greater than by
drinking milk from serologically positive cows or handling an
infected placenta or foetus?
7. Does Q fever infection persist in an infected animal and will an
animal abort more than once as a result of the Q fever infection?
8. How significant is Q fever as a cause of abortion in cattle,
sheep and goats in your country and is there, in your experience,
any indication that Q fever is otherwise associated with
infertility in cattle (low conception rates and early
resorptions)?
Thank you
