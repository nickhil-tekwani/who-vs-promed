CJD (NEW VARIANT) RISK? DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS - USA

I recently went to the store to purchase a glucosamine supplement which the
Arthritis Foundation has endorsed as being as effective as non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications. There was a variety of
glucosamine/chondroitin products available. Supplements of this type have
not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- a fact which
is printed on all the labels.
Some of the labels footnoted that the chondroitin was of "bovine origin."
None of the labels indicated the products were manufactured in the United
States -- rather they were "manufactured for distribution by" XYZ Company in
the USA. One indicated the manufacture was in Asia.
We have seen an exponential growth in demand in this country for various
dietary supplements. As the "baby-boomers" reach retirement and become more
"arthritic", one might predict increased consumption of those products which
are advertised to "help maintain healthy mobile joints and cartilage" --
such as chondroitin which comes from animal cartilage.
[In view of] the fact that these products are not regulated by the FDA, and
are being produced in countries which may or may not have adequate animal
disease control regulations and production quality controls, are we facing a
risk for an increase in diseases such as nvCJD (new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) which are contracted as a result of animal
processing practices?

[Several years ago (almost 4 years?), Dr. David Kessler, former commissioner
of FDA, wanted to know where these manufacturers were acquiring their source
material. The manufacturers responded they were using TSE (transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy)-free materials. The manufacturers must provide
some statement/assurance to FDA if the product is brought into the USA.
However, according to sources at FDA, if a dietary supplement is
manufactured in a BSE-contaminated country, then supplements are rejected
and not allowed entry into this country (USA). The manufacturer must provide
some assurance the products used in manufacturing were from BSE-free
countries. Some companies ship the bovine trachea and other cartilaginous
parts to Spain for processing and the product is shipped back.
However, cartilage does not have nerves innervating it, so the risk is
lower. Therefore, if the processing/manufacturing company is cautious with
cleaning of the product and exercises caution in the selection of anatomical
location of the cartilage (knee joints versus spinal column) then the risk
is even lower. - Mod.TG]
