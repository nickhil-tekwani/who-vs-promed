A nasty fungal infection that can spread to the lungs or brain and cause lifetime symptoms is on the rise in the southwestern U.S., federal health officials reported on Thursday [28 Mar 2013]. Cases of valley fever, known medically as coccidioidomycosis, have increased nearly 10-fold between 1998 and 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.

"Cases in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah rose from 2265 in 1998 to more than 22 000 in 2011," CDC said in a statement. "Health-care providers should be aware of this increasingly common infection when treating persons with influenza-like illness or pneumonia who live in or have traveled to endemic areas," the agency says in its weekly report on death and disease.

Valley fever causes mild, flu-like symptoms in most healthy people, but the fungus can spread and take hold in unlucky victims, requiring a lifetime of antifungal drugs and sometimes even surgery to removed growths of fungus.

"More than 40 percent of patients who get ill from valley fever may require hospitalization at some point, with an average cost of nearly USD 50 000 per hospital visit," CDC says.

The infection is caused by a fungus called _Coccidioides_. It lives naturally in the soil and becomes airborne when dirt or sand is disturbed. Winds can carry the spores far aloft, and people breathe them in unknowingly. "Because fungus particles spread through the air, it's nearly impossible to completely avoid exposure to this fungus in these hardest-hit states," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. "It's important that people be aware of valley fever if they live in or have travelled to the southwest United States." Antibiotics or antiviral drugs will do nothing to help treat a fungal infection.

CDC and state health officials checked disease surveillance data to see whether cases were on the rise. They found that cases of valley fever went up 16 percent a year between 1998 and 2011 in Arizona and rose 13 percent a year in California. More than 90 percent of cases are reported these 2 states.

"It's difficult to say what's causing the increase," said Dr. Benjamin Park, chief epidemiologist at CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch. "This is a serious and costly disease, and more research is needed on how to reduce its effects." It might be that people are just noticing and reporting it more, or perhaps weather changes are helping to stir up the spores, CDC said.

CDC says 30-60 percent of people who live in a region where the fungus is entrenched will breathe it in at some point. An estimated 150 000 people are infected every year, but many don't know they have anything other than a cold, and they get better on their own. The elderly and other people with weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, are especially vulnerable.

According to the University of Arizona, 60 percent of those infected don't suffer any symptoms, and another 30 percent have just mild to moderate infections. But 5 percent to 10 percent suffer complications, and one percent of victims die. If it does spread, it's usually to the skin, where it can cause purplish bumps that turn brown. In people who develop pneumonia, the fungus can form nodules that cause no symptoms but which can look like lung cancer on an x-ray. A very few patients can also develop what are called cavities in the lung, which can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. They require surgery to fix. If it spreads to the brain or spinal cord, it can cause meningitis, a potentially deadly condition that requires immediate treatment.

Coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever, is an infection caused by inhalation of _Coccidioides_ spp. spores. This soil-dwelling fungus is endemic to arid regions of Mexico, Central and South America, and the southwestern United States (1). Symptomatic patients typically experience a self-limited influenza-like illness, but some develop severe or chronic pulmonary disease, and less than one percent of patients experience disseminated disease (1).

Coccidioidomycosis can be costly and debilitating, with nearly 75 percent of patients missing work or school because of their illness and more than 40 percent requiring hospitalization (2).

Previous publications have reported state-specific increases in coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California during 1998-2001 and 2000-2007, respectively (3,4). To characterize long-term national trends, CDC analyzed data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) for the period 1998-2011. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the incidence of reported coccidioidomycosis increased substantially during this period, from 5.3 per 100 000 population in the endemic area (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) in 1998 to 42.6 per 100 000 in 2011. Health-care providers should be aware of this increasingly common infection when treating persons with influenza-like illness or pneumonia who live in or have traveled to endemic areas.

During 1998-2011, a total of 111 717 coccidioidomycosis cases were reported to CDC from 28 states and the District of Columbia: 66 percent from Arizona, 31 percent from California, one percent from other endemic states, and under one percent from nonendemic states. In Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah combined, the number of cases increased from 2265 in 1998 (aIR: 5.3 per 100 000 population) to 8806 in 2006 (18.0 per 100 000); a decrease occurred in 2007 and 2008 before an increase in 2009 (12 868 cases; 25.3 per 100 000), which continued into 2010 and 2011 (42.6 per 100 000) (Table 1).

Incidence in endemic states increased among all age groups during 1998-2011 (Figure). During this period, incidence typically was highest among the 40-59 year age group in California but was consistently highest among persons aged 60 years and older in Arizona and other endemic states. Incidence during 2011 was 381.1 per 100 000 among persons aged 60-79 years and 385.2 per 100 000 among persons aged 80 years and older in Arizona (Table 2).

During 1999-2008, most (56 percent) Arizona cases occurred among males, but beginning in 2009, a higher proportion (55 percent) of cases occurred among females. Incidence in 2011 in Arizona was substantially higher among females (286.9 per 100 000) than males (215.7 per 100 000). In contrast, only 35 percent of California cases occurred among females during 1998-2011, and 2011 incidence among California males (20.5 per 100 000) was more than double that among females (9.7 per 100 000).

The increase in the number of Arizona cases, from 1474 in 1998 to 16 467 in 2011, was statistically significant by negative binomial regression (aIR: 30.5 per 100 000 in 1998; 247.7 per 100 000 in 2011, p under 0.001). Adjusting for changes in population demographics, this corresponds to an increase in coccidioidomycosis incidence of approximately 16 percent each year during the study period. The number of California cases increased from 719 in 1998 (aIR: 2.1 per 100 000) to 5697 in 2011 (aIR: 14.9 per 100 000) (average annual increase of 13 percent, p under 0.001). The number of cases reported in Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah combined increased from 72 in 1998 (aIR: 1.4 per 100 000) to 237 in 2011 (aIR: 3.1 per 100 000) (p under 0.001). Cases reported in nonendemic states increased from 6 in 1998 to 240 in 2011.

[Coccidioidomycosis is an infection that results from inhalation of dimorphic fungus _Coccidioides_ spp. fungal spores. _Coccidioides_, which lives as mycelia in soil of desert areas of the western hemisphere, mainly in the southwestern United States (the central San Joaquin valley of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and the western half of Texas), with the highest number of cases occurring in Arizona and California, constitutes a substantial public health burden in these areas, particularly among older persons. Other endemic areas are the regions of Mexico that border the southwestern United States, some Central American countries, and desert regions of South America (Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela).

As the soil becomes dryer, the septated hyphae develop into arthroconidia, which disarticulate as single fungal cells and become airborne when disturbed by wind or soil excavation. Arthroconidia measure 3-5 microns and remain viable for long periods of time. When inhaled, arthroconidia convert in the lung into thick-walled spherules filled with endospores. Once released, each endospore can start the development of a new spherule and extend the infection.

Coccidioidomycosis is not transmitted from person to person. Risk of infection is highest in dry summer months. A 2nd period of risk usually occurs in the late fall, terminating with winter rains. Dust exposure is critical for acquiring an infection. Indeed, an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis followed exposure to a dust cloud that was blown downwind from the January 1994 6.7 magnitude Northridge California earthquake and its after shocks (CDC. Coccidioidomycosis following the Northridge earthquake -- California, 1994. JAMA. Jun 8 1994; 271(22): 1735). Because the incubation period for this infection usually ranges from 1-4 weeks, persons who may have become infected while visiting areas where coccidioidomycosis is endemic may not become ill until after they return home, and the diagnosis may not be considered by clinicians in areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (See prior ProMED-mail posts on coccidioidomycosis in travelers: Coccidioidomycosis - Taiwan ex USA 20090610.2140 and Coccidioidomycosis - Europe ex USA (Calif.): Alert 20011214.3026.).

Approximately 60 percent of infected persons are asymptomatic; the remainder can develop manifestations that range from mild to moderate influenza-like illness to pneumonia that may be associated with erythema nodosum, especially in females. Progressive pulmonary disease may occur, or the infection may spread from the primary respiratory focus outside the lung. Overall, less than 5 percent of infected persons have progressive pulmonary infection or extrapulmonary dissemination of the disease. Extra-pulmonary spread of the infection tends to occur more commonly in the immunocompromised host, such as organ transplant patients and patients with HIV/AIDS, in pregnant women, and in certain ethic groups (persons of African, Asian, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent). Sites that are associated with extra-pulmonary spread include the skin, the skeletal system, and the meninges.

Acute coccidioidomycosis can be diagnosed by culture of clinical specimens and by serologic tests. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies appear within the 1st 3 weeks after onset of symptoms, while IgG antibodies appear 1-2 months after onset of symptoms. IgG antibodies usually outlast the IgM, persisting in chronic coccidioidomycosis, and its quantitation provides an indicator of disease progression (increasing titer) or regression (decreasing titer). Detection of IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid is important for the diagnosis coccidioidal meningitis.

Reasons for the increases in reported coccidioidomycosis are not fully understood but may include climatic change (drought and increasing temperatures in southwestern United States (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), dust storms, soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and immigration of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
