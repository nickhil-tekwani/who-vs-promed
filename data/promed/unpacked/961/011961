31 laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile-like virus (including 4
deaths); 165 case reports are under investigation
CDC and DOH to perform study in Northern Queens to better
understand extent of the outbreak
At a press conference held today at City Hall, health officials
provided an update on the outbreak of a West Nile-like virus in
New York City. Specimens from 31 individuals have now been
classified as laboratory positive cases of a West Nile-like virus in
New York City, including 4 deaths in New York City, all of whom
were Queens residents. The fourth death confirmed to be
associated with a West Nike-like virus is of a 79 year-old female
from Queens who died on 11 Sep 1999. 165 reported cases
are now under investigation.
It was also announced that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), with the assistance of the New York City
Department of Health (DOH), will conduct a community-based
research study in northern Queens to help officials better
understand the nature of this outbreak and prevent future
recurrences of this virus.
Of the 31 laboratory positive cases of West Nile-like virus, 21 were
discharged from hospitals, 6 are hospitalized, and 4 are deceased.
Of the 31 laboratory positive cases, 25 are age 60 or over, and 3
are in their 50s. The other 3 cases include a 15 year-old, a 38
year-old, and a 40 year-old. Of the 31 laboratory positive cases,
23 are from Queens, 6 are from the Bronx, 1 is from Brooklyn, and
1 is from Manhattan.
Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., was joined by the
Mayor's Office of Emergency Management Director Jerome
Hauer; and Ned Hayes, M.D., of the CDC, to provide an update of
the ongoing investigation of this outbreak.
Dr. Cohen said, "As we continue to learn more about this outbreak
of a West Nile-like virus, which has never before been seen in the
United States, it is helpful to keep in mind that the additional cases
confirmed today do not represent new illnesses, but rather cases
which were previously investigated and have been reclassified. We
are continuing to work closely with the CDC, the State, and with
other local governments to implement effective, coordinated
responses, including our ongoing mosquito surveillance and
spraying strategies. In addition, New Yorkers are reminded
to take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to
mosquitoes."
Spraying
------------
The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management Director Jerome
Hauer said, "The CDC's positive test results of infected
mosquitoes collected after the first round of spraying show that our
decision to perform additional rounds of aerial and ground spraying
of pesticides throughout the City was a prudent course of action.
As a precaution, we will take the same proactive efforts we have
taken over the past three weeks to control the mosquito population,
and to reduce the likelihood of new infections. Tonight, we will
conduct targeted spraying in Powell's Cove Park, Queens, where
we have found evidence of an upsurge in the mosquito population.
Additionally, in the coming days, weather permitting, additional
targeted spraying efforts may be undertaken to continue to reduce
the number of mosquitoes that are potential carriers of this virus."
Community survey
-----------------------
Dr. Ned Hayes, CDC Medical Epidemiologist and a coordinator of
the study, described the community-based research study to be
conducted in northern Queens this weekend. "Over the next two to
three weeks, public health investigators from the CDC and DOH
will conduct door-to-door surveys of households in several
neighborhoods in northern Queens to help determine the proportion
of individuals in this area who may have been infected with a West
Nile-like virus. Households will be selected at random, and
participation in the study is voluntary and anonymous. A small
amount of blood will be collected from those who agree to
participate in the study.
"The study aims to determine the infection rate in the area where
the virus was first identified and to determine the infection rate in
different age groups. Blood samples will be tested for antibodies to
the virus. The presence of antibodies would indicate that a person
was infected by the virus, but did not necessarily become sick and
will not now become sick from the virus. We hope to get a better
understanding of the symptoms caused by West Nile virus, as well
as possible risk factors for infection.
This understanding will improve the effectiveness of prevention and
control strategies for the future," Dr. Hayes concluded.
The study will begin this Friday evening, October 1, and will be
conducted by Health Department teams over the next two to three
weeks in parts of the northern Queens neighborhoods of
Auburndale, Linden Hill, Murray Hill, and Whitestone (parts of
areas with zipcodes 11354, 11357, and 11358). The DOH
and CDC will distribute information about West Nile-like virus and
the study, prepared in English, Chinese, French, Hindi, Korean,
Russian, Spanish, and Urdu languages; place ads in community
newspapers; and work with local elected officials to inform
neighborhood residents about the study. Queens residents with
questions about the study can call the Mayor's Office of
Emergency Management Hotline at 1-888-663-6692.
Birds
-------
In addition, the State of New York and the CDC are conducting
tests on dead birds from New York City and surrounding states and
counties to discern the extent to which a West Nile-like virus may
have spread. As such, City health officials are collecting
information about bird deaths reported to the Mayor's Office of
Emergency Management Hotline at 1-888-663-6692.
Samples of the reported birds are being collected and submitted to
the State Health Department and the CDC for testing.
Although there is no risk of directly contracting viruses from dead
birds, individuals are advised that, in general, when handling dead
animals including dead birds, barehand contact should be avoided.
Birds should be placed in garbage cans or double plastic bags,
using gloves.
The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management Hotline, 1-888-
663-6692, will address questions from the public on the CDC
study, as well as continue to provide information on spraying
schedules, bird collection recommendations, and on precautions to
reduce the risk of exposure to mosquitoes.
Individuals with questions from outside of New York City should
contact their local health agencies. Since 3 Sep 1999 at 4:00 p.m.,
when the Hotline was established, the Hotline has received over
136 000 calls.
