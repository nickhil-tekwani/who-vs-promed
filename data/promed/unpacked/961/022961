1st report of Citrus viroid V in Japan
--------------------------------------
We tested citrus samples from Japan using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and for the 1st
time, Citrus viroid V (CVd-V) was detected in Japan. Using nucleotide
sequence analysis, we identified 2 new CVd-V variants, which shared
91-96 percent nucleotide sequence identities with those reported
previously and 89 percent with each other. The RT-PCR detected CVd-V
from 44 of 275 citrus trees tested, showing that CVd-V can be spread
to some extent within commercial orchards in Japan.

[A new member of the genus _Apscaviroid_ (family _Pospiviroidae_) was
reported in 2008 from _Atalantia citroides_, a citrus relative, in
Spain and was tentatively named Citrus viroid V (CVd-V). Since then
it has also been reported from Nepal, Oman, Iran, and the US. It is
suspected to be widespread but previously overlooked amongst other
citrus viroids. CVd-V is characterised by its unusual ability to
replicate in _A. citroides_ and mild but characteristic symptoms on
the Etrog cultivar of citron (_Citrus medica_, widely used as a
virus/viroid indicator species).

Many citrus viroids, especially apscaviroids, do not induce easily
recognisable symptoms in citrus varieties used commercially (as
scions or rootstocks), but may cause reduction in tree size and
yield. Pathogenic effects may be compounded when several viroids are
present, and CVd-V was shown to have strong synergistic (symbiotic
enhancement) effects in co-infection with _Citrus bent leaf viroid_
or _Citrus viroid III_ (both also genus _Apscaviroid_) leading to
stronger leaf symptoms and very pronounced dwarfing.

Citrus viroids are transmitted by grafting and mechanical means and
are widespread in citrus that has been propagated from symptomless
viroid-infected budwood. The use of viroid-free rootstock and
grafting material is essential in citrus cultivation and dramatic
yield increases are frequently observed in viroid-free cultivars. In
some instances, however, deliberate infection with viroids may be
used as a dwarfing agent (see link below).
