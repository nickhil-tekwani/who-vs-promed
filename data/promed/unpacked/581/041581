The Health Protection Agency (HPA) can confirm that the patient being
treated for anthrax infection in a Kent hospital died this afternoon
[3 Nov 2010].

Dr Mathi Chandrakumar, Director of Kent Health Protection Unit, said:
"This is a sad outcome, but I would like to repeat that there is no
risk to the general population, including close family members of the
patient. It is extremely unlikely that this form of anthrax can
spread from person to person."

He added that this was a serious infection which now numbered among
risks to drug users. "We continue to see occasional cases among
injecting drug users, following a cluster of cases earlier this year
[2010]. Exposure to anthrax is now one of a number of risks that drug
users are exposed to. All heroin users should seek urgent medical
advice if they experience signs of infection such as redness or
excessive swelling at or near an injection site, or other symptoms of
general illness such as high temperature, chills or a severe headache
or breathing difficulties, as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving."

[Until now, there had been 4 cases this year [2010] in England: 2 in
London (February and March 2010; one died), and 2 cases in the
Northwest (August 2010, Leicestershire) and in the East Midlands
(February 2010, Blackpool); both died.

Though this report states it is an "Update," it is in a very
different part of the UK and near the Channel ports. Logically, it
would appear to be a newly imported batch of heroin. Though Dr.
Chandrakumar does not directly state that the deceased was a heroin
user, it is implied. It will be interesting to see whether it is the
same or a different strain from those seen earlier this year [2010].
There have been 47 heroin associated cases in Scotland with 13
deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
