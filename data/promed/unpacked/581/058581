Exotic Newcastle disease (END) has been found to be the cause of death of
wild birds in Pinellas County. The Florida Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services (FDOACS) is thanking the Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary for
detecting a deadly disease in birds, reports WTSP.

The sanctuary says some of its rescuers were on their usual searches for
injured birds in the wild when they came across some sick cormorants last
Friday [7 Jan 2011]. Native to Florida, the cormorant is a small black bird
[70-90cm in length, so really quite large. - Mod.SH]. They can be seen
diving under water or drying their wings.

The cormorants the rescuers recently found suffered from signs of
neurological problems, including muscular issues like twitching. It turned
out those are signs of the exotic Newcastle disease. For birds, the disease
is deadly.

The sanctuary quarantined the cormorants and alerted the state of Florida's
1st case of the disease since 2002. Fortunately, none of the sanctuary's
birds were infected. "Our sanctuary is safe and healthy," said Michelle
Simoneau.

There are more than 300 birds being rehabilitated at the sanctuary and
normally they release some of those birds on a weekly basis. Since the
detection of the disease, the sanctuary has a self-imposed quarantine of
the rest of its birds will not release any birds any time soon. "Just to be
on the safe side," said Ms Simoneau.

While the staff at the sanctuary should be careful since they handle birds
for a living, health experts say the general public does not need to worry.

In a statement, the Pinellas County Health Department told 10 News that the
disease is "not really harmful to humans although those who come into
contact with infected birds experience 'pink eye' and some minor irritations."

The FDOACS says its concerned for all other birds, including the poultry
industry. "It is such a serious disease that if it did become established
in our domestic birds, there would be an agricultural emergency declared,"
said Dr Thomas Holt, the director of the Animal Industry Division of the
FDOACS.

So far, there are 5 confirmed cases of this disease and FDOACS is still
testing, according to WTSP. The state urges anyone with birds, to
constantly wash their hands and disinfect their shoes and clothing. That
includes people with pet birds. Keep an eye on your pet for any signs,
including muscular tremors and coughing.

[Newcastle disease is an acute viral disease of domestic poultry and many
other bird species. It is a worldwide problem that presents primarily as a
respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea
may be the predominant clinical form. Mortality is variable. Occurrence of
a virulent form of the disease is reportable and may result in trade
restrictions.

Virulent NDV (Newcastle disease virus) strains are endemic in poultry in
most of Asia, Africa, and some countries of North, Central, and South
America. Other countries, including the USA and Canada, are free of those
strains and maintain that status with import restrictions and eradication
by destroying diseased poultry. Cormorants, pigeons, and imported
psittacine species have also been sources of virulent NDV infections of
poultry. Low virulence NDV is prevalent in poultry and wild birds,
especially waterfowl. Infection of domestic poultry with low virulence NDV
contributes to lower productivity.

Infected birds shed virus in exhaled air, respiratory discharges, and
feces. Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical stage, and for
a varying but limited period during convalescence. Virus may also be
present in eggs laid during clinical disease and in all parts of the
carcass during acute virulent infections. Chickens are readily infected by
aerosols and by ingesting contaminated water or food. Infected chickens are
the primary source of virus, but other domestic and wild birds may be
sources of NDV. Transfer of virus, especially in infective feces, by the
movement of people and contaminated equipment is the main method of spread
between poultry flocks.

Onset is rapid, and signs appear throughout the flock within 2-12 days
(average 5) after aerosol exposure. Spread is slower if the fecal-oral
route is the primary means of transmission, particularly for caged birds.
Young birds are the most susceptible. Observed signs depend on whether the
infecting virus has a predilection for respiratory, digestive, or nervous
systems. Respiratory signs of gasping, coughing, sneezing, and rales
predominate in low virulence infections. Nervous signs of tremors,
paralyzed wings and legs, twisted necks, circling, clonic spasms, and
complete paralysis may accompany, but usually follow, the respiratory signs
in neurotropic velogenic disease.

Nervous signs with diarrhea are typical in pigeons, and nervous signs are
frequently seen in cormorants and exotic bird species. Respiratory signs
with depression, watery-greenish diarrhea, and swelling of the tissues of
the head and neck are typical of the most virulent form of the disease,
viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease (VVND, also called exotic
Newcastle disease), although nervous signs may also be seen. Varying
degrees of depression and inappetence are observed.
