On [28 Oct 2019] the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that SENASA (the national institute responsible for animal health in Argentina) issued a news release that 2 cases of anthrax had been confirmed in the province of La Pampa. The laboratory responsible for this confirmation, Laboratorio Santa Rosa, informed him that there had been 2 bovine outbreaks in the provincial departments of Loventue and Toay, where outbreaks had been reported in previous years. The affected herds had not been vaccinated, an all too frequent negligence.

[For a map of Argentina showing the province of Buenos Aires, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/argentina_pol96.jpg. The province is to the immediate west of Buenos Aires province and its western border abuts the hill country of the Andes foothills. For the departments of Loventue and Toay, go to: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departamento_Loventu%C3%A9 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toay_Department. They are adjoining departments.

Unfortunately, however much one fosters annual vaccination in areas of significant anthrax risk, some ranchers will put it off and then their procrastination becomes public when their animals succumb to this disease. But the only way to rid a region of anthrax is regular vaccination so that remaining spores in the soil can die and not be replaced by blood spillage from new cases. In spite of the literature, anthrax spores are not immortal and in spite of any regeneration will eventually die off. It takes anything from 3 to 8 years, plus there is a natural loss of phages so that remaining spores are apathogenic. Effective anthrax control equals anthrax eradication. Our deep thanks to Ramon for his report. - Mod.MHJ
