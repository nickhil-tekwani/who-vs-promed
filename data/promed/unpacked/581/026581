More studies find no XMRV in chronic fatigue syndrome, HIV, or hepatitis C
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Another US study has failed to detect xenotropic murine leukemia
virus-related virus (XMRV) in the blood of patients with chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) or others with immune dysfunction, and
investigators of a separate European study also found no evidence of
this retrovirus in patients infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency
virus] or hepatitis C virus. Both studies were published online 11
Oct 2010 and will appear in the 15 Nov 2010 print issue of the
Journal of Infectious Diseases.

The negative findings come just weeks after publication of a study
that was the 2nd to find a murine leukemia-type virus in patients
with CFS (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010; 107(36):15874-9;
<http://www.pnas.org/content/107/36/15874.full>) [see also

20100825.2986]. That work used the same primers for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification as used in the current US study, write
the authors, led by Athe Tsibris, MD, from the Division of Infectious
Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. Dr Tsibris' group
also reportedly used the same sensitive PCR methods as those of
Lombardi and colleagues, who first reported XMRV in patients with CFS
a year ago (Science. 2009; 326:585-9;
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1179052>).

"[Our finding] suggests that differences in PCR techniques from study
to study do not explain the disparate results seen in XMRV studies of
chronic fatigue syndrome," Dr Tsibris said in a press release from
the Infectious Diseases Society of America, publisher of the Journal
of Infectious Diseases.

Dr Tsibris and colleagues suggested that "geographical clustering of
XMRV infection" could explain why other investigators found XMRV in
patients with CFS. Their group, from Boston, tested peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of 293 patients from academic hospitals. Of the
participants, 23 met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
revised case definition of CFS, and 95 were from a general cohort of
patients who received medical care, which could have included healthy
individuals seeking routine care, according to the authors.

All other participants had chronic conditions with altered immune
function: 43 with HIV, 97 with rheumatoid arthritis, and 26 who had
undergone solid-organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The authors reported that they did not detect XMRV DNA in any
samples. They did detect a mouse endogenous retroviral sequence in
one participant's blood, but because they could not replicate that
finding, the authors attributed it to contamination from an
unidentified source.

Despite the number of studies that have been unable to find an
association between XMRV and CFS, Dr Tsibris told Medscape Medical
News that it is too early to discount an association. "Additional
next steps that would be helpful would be a standardized,
cross-validated assay for XMRV detection in clinical samples," he
said, "so that we can all at least agree on what a positive XMRV test
actually is, and a blinded multilaboratory comparison of XMRV testing
from CFS and control samples." The National Institutes of Health has
plans for a study like this, according to Dr Tsibris.

In the other study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases
[<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/657167>], UK and
Swiss researchers aimed to determine whether patients with HIV type 1
or hepatitis C virus infection were at increased risk for XMRV
infection. Led by Eleanor Barnes, MD, from Oxford University's
Department of Clinical Medicine, United Kingdom, the authors tested
230 patients: 84 with chronic HIV infection, 79 with acute HIV
infection, and 67 with hepatitis C virus infection.

After being unable to detect XMRV in plasma or peripheral blood
mononuclear cells using PCR in any of the patients, the researchers
retested 64 patients using a T-cell enzyme-linked immunospot
(ELISPOT) assay. Of the 49 patients with acute HIV infection and 14
patients infected with hepatitis C virus whose peripheral blood
samples were assayed, none were positive for XMRV, the authors report.

"Although [they are] widely used to detect T cells targeting
retroviral peptides, this is the 1st time ELISPOT assays have been
applied for the detection of responses to XMRV," the authors write.
"Patient cells were responsive to other antigens, suggesting that the
lack of responses simply reflects an absence of XMRV Gag-specific T
cells in our cohort."

Given their findings, Dr Barnes said in a press release that "if XMRV
is a human pathogen, it is not enriched in the blood of patients with
HIV or hepatitis C virus, and by implication it is unlikely to be
spread through sexual or blood-borne routes in the United Kingdom and
Western Europe."

The possibility that XMRV can be transmitted through blood arose
after Lombardi and coworkers reported that they could secondarily
transmit the virus from the blood cells and plasma of infected
patients with CFS. This led the transfusion medicine organization
AABB to recommend earlier this year [2010] that blood collection
centers discourage people with a diagnosis of CFS or related disorder
from donating blood or blood components.

A 3rd study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases
[<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656146>] reported
finding XMRV in patients with prostate cancer, as some other
researchers have found.

The conflicting results of the 3 studies led authors of an
accompanying editorial
[<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/657169>] to
subtitle their commentary "Reach for a Scorecard, Not a Prescription
Pad." Mary Kearney, PhD, and Frank Maldarelli, PhD, MD, from the HIV
Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, point out in the editorial
that valid detection of XMRV remains an ongoing problem.

[In the accompanying editorial Mary Kearney and Frank Maldarelli
suggest that the following steps will be necessary to resolve this
controversy: (1) standardization of detection assays, (2) prospective
epidemiologic surveys, (3) sharing of reagents and samples, (4)
design of "comprehensive and rigorous" phylogenetic sequence
analyses, and (5) development of "tractable animal models," such as
macaques. Such models will be necessary to dissect XMRV pathogenesis.
"Only when this is done in a rigorous fashion will it become clear
what role XMRV or related viruses have in human disease."

ProMED-mail will await resolution of this controversy before
reporting further developments in this field.
