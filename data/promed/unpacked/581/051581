Elk Herd with Disease Similar to Mad Cow Found in Oklahoma
--------------------------------------------
A fatal brain ailment similar to mad cow disease (BSE, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) has been found in a captive Oklahoma County elk herd,
forcing officials to put 140 of the animals under quarantine. State
Department of Agriculture veterinarian Gene Eskew said "chronic wasting
disease" (CWD) has been found in 5 elk that died, and a few others in the
herd are suspected to have the disease. The agriculture department is
watching for additional deaths so the tissues can be sent for testing to
the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. The tests
must be performed on carcasses because there are no live tests for the disease.
The herd, which came from Montana, may have to be killed. "The options are
not very good," Eskew said. "There is no money from the state available to
purchase them and put the herd down." The elk will not be used for human
consumption and the state is convinced [that no infected elk have been
killed for human consumption. In 1997 and 1999, 3 hunters were reported as
suspected victims of CWD (one in Miami, Oklahyoma), [but those cases have
never been confirmed. Colorado passed a law 3 years ago designed to curb
the disease. Whenever a deer or elk dies in that state, the hunter or owner
must take in the animal's head for testing. In previous hunting seasons, up
to 15 per cent of deer killed in an area north of Fort Collins, Colorado
tested positive for the disease.
