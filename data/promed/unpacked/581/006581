Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The pig from an animal shelter in the Canton of Neuchatel had been sent to the Clinic for Swine, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, on Saturday [2 May 2020] because of the following symptoms: 3 weeks of lameness, swollen carpal joints, increased body temperature, inappetence and vomiting. At the clinic, the pig developed fever, respiratory symptoms and petechiae on ears and trunk. On Monday [4 May 2020] blood samples were taken, the animal was euthanised and sent to pathology. It had been kept in the isolation unit of the clinic during the whole period of hospitalization. Blood samples were directly sent to the national reference laboratory, Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), and tests yielded negative results for African swine fever and classical swine fever. However, the samples tested positive for antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as well as for viral RNA of the genotype 1 (EU genotype). The animal shelter where the positive pig came from is keeping another approximately 6-month-old pig that tested positive for antibodies against PRRSV today [8 May 2020]. These 2 pigs arrived together at the shelter. The movement history of these 2 pigs needs to be clarified. Two Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs already kept in the shelter before the arrival of the piglets tested negative for antibodies and viral RNA. Movement of these animals has been prohibited. Within the coming days, holdings keeping pigs in a range of 5 km (3.1 mi) around the animal shelter will be tested as well.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection, vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) (national laboratory) / Swine / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 6 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_."

"Two major antigenically different types of the virus exist: Type 1 (previously described as European -- EU) and Type 2 (previously North American -- NA). Historically, Type 1 was restricted to Europe and Type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally. The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faces, urine, semen and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances has also been confirmed. PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterized by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. In 2006, a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain emerged in China (People's Rep. of) causing high fever (40-42 deg C) [104-107 deg F] in all age-groups, abortions in sows and high mortality in sucking piglets, weaners and growers."
