The Ministry of Health has reported 22 suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever in Kassala in eastern Sudan.

In a press statement, the director of emergencies and epidemics, Emtiaz Ata, told reporters that the ministry is examining suspected cases to make sure of the suspicion and to find out more about the disease.

The director-general of the Ministry of Health, Nureldin Hussein, said that the health situation in Kassala is not reassuring, and there must be measures and considerable precautions to adequately address the health issue and avoid epidemics.

[It is not clear what is the cause of these suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever or whether epidemiological investigations have been carried out, laboratory tests conducted, the clinical course of the illness determined, or any specific response measures taken. Any updates from the public health personnel and physicians on the ground will be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA]

Detection of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever cases in a severe undifferentiated febrile illness outbreak in the Federal Republic of Sudan: A retrospective epidemiological and diagnostic cohort study.

Abstract
Background. Undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) is one of the most common reasons for people seeking healthcare in low-income countries. While illness and death due to specific infections such as malaria are often well quantified, others are frequently uncounted and their impact underappreciated. A number of high-consequence infectious diseases, including Ebola virus, are endemic or epidemic in the Federal Republic of Sudan, which has, since 2012, experienced at least 12 UFI outbreaks, frequently associated with haemorrhage and high case fatality rates (CFR). One of these occurred in Darfur in 2015/2016 with 594 cases and 108 deaths (CFR 18.2%). The aetiology of these outbreaks remains unknown.

Methodology/principal findings
We report a retrospective cohort study of the 2015/2016 Darfur outbreak using a subset of 65 of 263 outbreak samples received by the National Public Health Laboratory, which met selection criteria of sufficient sample volume and epidemiological data. Clinical features included fever (95.8%), bleeding (95.7%), headache (51.6%), and arthralgia (42.2%). No epidemiological patterns indicative of person-to-person transmission or health-worker cases were reported. Samples were tested at the Public Health England Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory using a bespoke panel of likely pathogens including haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, and _Rickettsia_, _Leptospira_, and Borrelia_ spp. Seven (11%) were positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The remaining samples tested negative on all assays.

Conclusions/significance
CCHFV is an important cause of fever and haemorrhage in Darfur, but not the sole major source of UFI outbreaks in Sudan. Prospective studies are needed to explore other aetiologies, including novel pathogens. The presence of CCHFV has critical infection, prevention and control, as well as clinical implications for future response. Our study reinforces the need to boost surveillance, lab, and investigative capacity to underpin effective response and for local and international health security.

Author summary
The Federal Republic of Sudan has had at least 12 outbreaks of febrile illness of unknown cause associated with symptoms of haemorrhage and high case fatality rates since 2012. Outbreaks without clear diagnosis are concerning, particularly in countries such as Sudan, where a range of high-consequence diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers, are endemic or epidemic, and local laboratory capacity is limited. We transferred historical samples stored in the National Public Health Authority from one of these outbreaks that occurred in Darfur 2015-2016 to the Public Health England Laboratory at Porton, UK, and tested them against a wide range of infectious diseases to try to identify the cause, and to help the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health to develop and target their limited laboratory capacity. We found that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever was an important cause, but not the only source, of cases in this outbreak. This has implications for prevention and control as well as for treating cases. Our study also highlighted the need for future studies to explore other possible causes, including new pathogens, and reinforced the need to boost surveillance, lab, and investigative capacity for more timely and complete outbreak response.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in _Hyalomma impeltatum_ ticks from North Kordofan, the Sudan

Abstract
An evidence for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was found in _Hyalomma impeltatum_ ticks collected from sheep in North Kordofan in the Sudan. Based on sequencing of the partial segment S, the detected virus belongs to lineage I with closest similarity to CCHFV strains from Senegal. So far, this lineage is unknown in the Sudan.

[The above article by Bower et al. highlights many important issues regarding the diagnosis of diseases that present with hemorrhagic symptoms, ranging from dengue hemorrhagic fever to CCHF and Marburg/Ebola viruses. The article by Chitimia-Dobler et al. complements that human study by demonstrating the 1st detection of CCHF virus in ticks collected from animals in Sudan. There is definitely a need to build strong disease-surveillance systems that are supported by robust laboratory diagnostic capacity to guide immediate response activities as well as long-term planning. - Mod.UBA
