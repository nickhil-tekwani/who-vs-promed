[According to preliminary unofficial information, the FMD virus involved is serotype O. Final lab results are expected to be completed after the termination of the Sukkot (Jewish Feast of Tabernacles) holidays (24 Sep to 1 Oct 2018), during which government offices are closed or operate only for urgent/emergency issues.

For the location of Moshav Shaal, see map at https://tinyurl.com/ycr2ndff. In view of the proximity of the outbreak to Israel's borders with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, a new introduction is not excluded, requiring genotyping. This should also include the virus strain from a recent outbreak in Maghar, northern Israel, reported 11 Sep 2018 (archive no. 20180911.6021871).

The earlier FMD event (April-July 2018, 10 outbreaks) in Israel was caused by FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia-2, sublineage QOM-15; a summary and map are available at https://tinyurl.com/ybzprpur. Synchronically, an FMD event was reported from the West Bank, Palestinian Authority, which is "continuing." - Mod.AS
