Outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using standardized laboratory and data analysis techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 2 Jul 2019, a total of 45 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- have been reported from 13 states.

State / Ill people
California / 1
Illinois / 3
Indiana / 3
Iowa / 12
Kansas / 3
Massachusetts / 2
Michigan / 7
Missouri / 3
New York / 6
North Dakota / 1
Pennsylvania / 2
South Carolina / 1
Wisconsin / 1
--------------
Total / 45

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 18 Nov 2018, to 13 Jun 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 81 years, with a median age of 23. Half (50%) of ill people are female. Of 39 ill people with information available, 12 (31%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of _Salmonella_ isolates from 30 ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance or decreased susceptibility to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results. These antimicrobial -resistant infections may be difficult to treat with commonly recommended antimicrobials and may require a different choice.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. 34 (89%) of 38 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 24 people with available information, 17 (71%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats, such as pig ears (16%), in the week before interview.

Officials from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development gathered pig ear dog treats at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products. They sampled pig ears for _Salmonella_. Although the outbreak strain was not identified, other strains of _Salmonella_ were. Investigators are checking to see if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Retail locations where sampling occurred have removed pig ears from shelves.

A common supplier of pig ear dog treats has not been identified. Pet owners can take steps to keep their families healthy while feeding pets (https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/pet-food-safety.html).

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5] 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.
