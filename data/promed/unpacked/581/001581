[This report presents the laboratory confirmation of 3 new CSF
outbreaks, initially reported by the Spanish authorities as suspected
outbreaks in the Weekly Disease Information of OIE of 7 Dec 2001. The
disease has been smoldering in Catalonian farms since Jun 2001,
counting 32 outbreaks so far. During the first semester of 2001, CSF
in farmed pigs was reported to the OIE, within Europe, by Romania and
Slovakia, and in wild boars -- which are the reservoir of the virus in
Europe -- by Austria, Luxembourg, and Ukraine. Germany has reported
outbreaks in breeding and fattening farms in October 2001. Earlier,
the UK reported in Jan 2001 that controls had been lifted on 30 Dec
2000, following the final eradication of the CSF outbreak which had
taken place between 4 Aug and 3 Nov 2000. - Mod.AS
