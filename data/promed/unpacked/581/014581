I have also read the information sent by Clyde Markon.
Our centre always keeps all the records of JE outbreaks in the country. Up
to 1997 outbreaks reports are now in computer process very soon we will be
publishing it.
Regarding 1998 outbreaks of JE in different parts of the country are as
follows:
1. In eastern part of Nepal first case of JE was recorded and admitted in
Koshi Zonal Hospital in the month of May 8,1998. This hospital is a big,
well equipped hospital for the treatment of JE and other communicable
diseases like V.L., Kala-azar, rabies, JE, dengue, malaria etc. So far up
to today the total cases were 40 out of which 7 died, 22 recovered and sent
home, 11 are still under treatment.
2. In mid western Nepal first case of JE was admitted and recorded in July
8, 1998 in Bheri zonal Hospital Nepalganj up till now today total 23 cases
,out of which 5 patients died, and rest are under treatment in the hospital.
