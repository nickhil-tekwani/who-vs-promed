About 118 people have died [due to] a yellow fever outbreak in Angola, where the capital [Luanda] leads that list with 82, and 434 cases, according to the recent epidemiological bulletin.

According to the report, in addition to Luanda, where the 1st case of the disease in a citizen of Eritrea was notified in the municipality of Viana on [5 Dec 2015], the ailment is affecting the provinces of Bie, Benguela, Cunene, Cabinda, Huila Huambo, Malange, Kwanza Sul, Uige, Zaire and Kwanza Norte.

Huambo follows this capital with 18 deaths and 55 cases, and then Huila (12/49).

According to reports, about 1.9 million people have been vaccinated in Luanda since [2 Feb 2016], 1.7 million of which were in Viana.

Amid the inoculation campaign, the General Health Inspectorate alerted the population about the falsification of the yellow fever vaccine and communicated the ban on importation, marketing, distribution and use of lot number 2265.

A note from the institution indicates that, according to a notice from the World Health Organization, the circulation of counterfeit lot number 2265 Amaril vaccine, manufactured and validated in the laboratory Pasteur Institute of Dakar was established in the international market.

[The yellow fever death toll has risen from 99 on 22 Feb 2016 to about 118 just 4 days later. The Luanda area has the most cases and deaths as noted above, and the vaccination campaign there moves ahead quickly. One hopes that the campaign can get ahead of the spread quickly.

The general inspector for health, Miguel de Oliveira, on Friday [26 Feb 2016] in Luanda said that fortunately in Angola there is no fake yellow fever vaccine.

Considering that there are warnings about fake yellow fever vaccines from the Pasteur Institute of Senegal, the technician said this counterfeit amount of vaccines, issued on July 2012 and which is set to expire on July 2017, did not enter the country [Angola].

He said that this information was released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which also revealed that the counterfeit vaccines were found in some countries of Asia and west Africa.

"The population has to be vaccinated because it is very important, but the health authorities and partners are attentive to a possible entry of fake vaccines or medicines in the country," he stressed.

An outbreak of yellow fever has been hitting some parts of the country -- the reason why the authorities are implementing a vaccination campaign against this disease.
