CDC officials reported Mon 16 Sep 2013 that at least 2 million Americans fall ill from antimicrobial-resistant bacteria every year and that at least 23 000 die from those infections, putting a hard number on a growing public health threat. It was the 1st time that federal authorities quantified the effects of organisms that many antimicrobials are powerless to fight.

The number of deaths is substantially lower than previous estimates, in part because researchers from the CDC stripped out cases in which a drug-resistant infection was present but not necessarily the cause of death. Infectious disease doctors have long warned that antimicrobial resistance, in which bacteria develop defenses against antimicrobials used to kill them, threatens to return society to a time when people died from ordinary infections.

"They have come up with hard numbers where it has been only guesswork," said Dr. Stuart B. Levy, a professor of microbiology at Tufts University and the president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics. "This sets a baseline we can all believe in."

In 2007, the CDC estimated that about 100 000 people died every year of infections they developed while in hospitals. Most of those infections were believed to be resistant to some antimicrobials but not necessarily the most widely used ones. And it was unclear how many of the deaths were caused by the drug-resistant infections. The new report quantifies that.

Dr. Steven L. Solomon, the director of the CDC's office of antimicrobial resistance, acknowledged that the report underestimated the numbers but said that was by design. Researchers were instructed to be conservative and to base their calculations only on deaths that were a direct result of a drug-resistant bacterial infection. "This is a floor," Dr. Solomon said. "We wanted the cleanest number, the least subjective number."

One point of contention has been the extent to which industrial-scale animal farming contributes to the problem of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. The government has estimated that more than 70 percent of antibiotics in the United States are given to animals. Companies use them to prevent sickness when animals are packed together in ways that breed infection. They also use them to make animals grow faster, though federal authorities are trying to stop that.

The report said that "much of antibiotic use in animals is unnecessary and inappropriate and makes everyone less safe." It also said that about half of antibiotic use in people is inappropriate.

The 114-page report counts infections from 17 drug-resistant bacteria and one fungus, pathogens that Dr. Solomon said caused an overwhelming majority of drug-resistant bacterial infections in the country. It drew on data from 5 disease-tracking systems, including a major count of bacterial infections reported in hospitals in 10 different areas across the country. The count of deaths was based on mathematical models, one for each resistant organism.

One particularly lethal type of drug-resistant bacteria, known as CRE [carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriacea - Mod.LL], has become resistant to nearly all antimicrobials on the market. It is still relatively rare, causing just 600 deaths a year, but researchers have identified it in health care facilities in 44 states. "We are getting closer and closer to the cliff," said Dr. Michael Bell, a CDC official who presented the data.

Infections from one of the most pervasive types of drug-resistant bacteria tracked in the report, MRSA [methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ - Mod.LL], have been declining. Invasive MRSA infections in hospitals went down by more than half from 2005 to 2011, according to a paper published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. However, the number of invasive MRSA infections picked up outside health care settings has not changed much, and researchers pointed out that the number of those types of infections has for the 1st time outstripped the number acquired in hospitals. "This is a really big switch," said Eli Perencevich, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Iowa.

Hospitals have taken steps to prevent drug-resistant infections, but less is known about preventing infections outside hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. There has been little research, for example, on the extent to which antimicrobial use on industrial farms contributes to resistant germs in people. The farm animal industry has been reluctant to allow data collection, and very few studies of the link have been done.

In a separate study in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health sifted through health records of more than 440 000 people in the Geisinger Health System, which operates a network of clinics and hospitals in Pennsylvania, and found that patients who lived near farms and areas where manure was dumped were 38 percent more likely to develop a MRSA infection, particularly of soft tissue or skin, researchers found.

Some researchers not involved in the study said it offered evidence that living near farms increased one's chances of developing a MRSA infection. But the study did not test farm animals or soil for MRSA, nor did it find evidence of the type of MRSA that is typically associated with farm animals, and others said the infections might have been caused by something other than antibiotics on farms.

[Formally, an antibiotic is a substance produced by one microorganism that inhibits the growth of, or kills, another microorganism. Since anti-infectives are no longer produced directly from microorganisms, the term antimicrobial or antimicrobial agent is more proper.

Although the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry likely contributes to the problem, the amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA no doubt serves as an efficient multiplier of these multidrug-resistant isolates just as intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly related to the lack of control of antimicrobial usage, especially in intensive care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER physicians who often react without wisdom and with "cookbook" protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, the physicians do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures, not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is recognized, that is, using these agents only when rational, in combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and meaningful improvement in a patient's life, the medical community will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic options will exist.
