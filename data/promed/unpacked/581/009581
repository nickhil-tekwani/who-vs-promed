Experts say new tick to blame for sickness
-------------------------------------------
A type of tick not seen in Montana before, and a special variety of
bacteria it carries, are to blame for the state's first cases of relapsing
fever, health officials said Wednesday. They also said the state should
expect to see more cases of the potentially deadly disease, which is found
in high-altitude areas stretching from British Columbia to southern
Arizona, where the soft tick can be found.
An article published in the September 2003 issue of Emerging Infectious
Diseases clarifies the mystery surrounding the sickness of 5 people who had
visited a Flathead Lake island cabin a year ago.

Investigators at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton said patients
ranging in age from 5 to 54 years old all came down with similar symptoms:
high fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.
After they were hospitalized, investigators diagnosed relapsing fever and
traced it to ticks in the attic of the cabin where they stayed. State
health officials have since gone back and exterminated ticks in the cabin
and warned area residents of the disease.
"What we have here in some ways is a range extension, but a significant
range extension, because it has never been found in Montana before," said
Tom Schwan, lead investigator on the study.
Although related to the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, the version new
to Montana has a different "lifestyle," the researchers said. Lyme disease
is usually passed from ticks in an outdoor setting. But most people who
develop relapsing fever become infected while sleeping in rodent- and
tick-infested cabins. Additionally, the researchers said people often don't
know they've been bitten.
"If I had to put money on it, I would say we'll see more cases," Schwan
said. "I would suspect that we could think this would be present on the
west side of the Continental Divide."
Health officials said cases may have gone undiagnosed in the past because
it was not thought to exist in Montana. Todd Damrow, the state's
epidemiologist, said patients who receive antibiotic treatment can start
recovering within a week. "Our message for doctors is to be on the lookout
for other cases," he said.
Rocky Mountain Laboratories began decades ago as a research facility into
the study of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is also spread by ticks.
The agent that causes Lyme disease, another disorder transmitted by ticks,
was identified at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in 1982 [although the disease
is not very endemic there - Mod.LL].
"Given the 100-year history of research into ticks and tick-borne diseases
in Montana, we are gratified to have helped solve the mystery of this
outbreak and to have identified a focus of this disease as well as the
bacterium and tick in our back yard," said Schwan. He said the disease can
be deadly for infants and the elderly, and can cause serious complications
in pregnancy.

[Relapsing fever is tick-borne in the United States but may also be
louse-borne. Louse-borne disease remains endemic in parts of central and
east Africa and the South American Andes. Although the clinical illnesses
can be quite similar, the tick-borne form is associated with more relapses
(as many as 13, but averaging about 3, as compared with the louse-borne
form, with as many as 5 but usually only one) and a much lower mortality
rate if left untreated (2-5 percent versus as high as 40 percent). In the
USA, a majority of the reported cases are from California and Washington.
As stated in the Emerging Infectious Diseases paper, a 1927 case of
relapsing fever diagnosed in Washington state was thought to have been
acquired in Montana (1), and soft ticks collected in 1936 in southwestern
Montana were found to be able to transmit _B. parkeri_ to mice in the
laboratory (2).
Although various species of _Borrelia_ (at least 15) can transmit
tick-borne disease, it is not entirely clear that in 1936, they could be
readily differentiated. More specific serologic identification is now
possible (3). It is important to note that only one species, _B.
recurrentis_, is associated with the louse-borne form.
Unlike hard ticks such as _Dermacentor_ (one of the vectors for Rocky
Mountain spotted fever) and _Ixodes_ (Lyme disease), _Ornithodoros_ soft
ticks are night feeders, feeding quite quickly (5-20 minutes) and
painlessly. Outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever, like this one, are
often associated with sleeping in cabins, as also noted in a new report in
the Emerging Infectious Diseases' older sister journal, Mortality and
Morbidity Weekly Report, from New Mexico:
.
The diagnosis can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright's
stain of the peripheral blood. Without any concentration of blood, as
shown in the Emerging Infectious Diseases case above, spirochetes can be
seen extracellularly. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism readily
picks up the Wright stain. The relapses appear to be caused by changes in
the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the
manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 3 and 4 are useful.
Louse-borne relapsing fever has been imported into the USA. In 1976, a
case of a woman from Ethiopia was reported from Dayton, Ohio in which the
organism was detected in her blood and in lice. It was claimed to have
been the first case of louse-borne relapsing fever in the USA in the 20th
century (5).
