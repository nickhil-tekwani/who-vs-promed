Bacterial blight affects pomegranate
------------------------------------
Pomegranates in Maharashtra have been affected by bacterial blight (oily spot) disease, causing damage to the fruit's quality by up to 70 per cent. For [the] last 2 to 3 years, pomegranate crops have been badly affected by bacterial blight on a large scale. The disease may cause up to 90 per cent yield reduction.

Prabhakar Chandane, Maharashtra Pomegranate Growers Research Association, [said that] the crop has been affected in Nashik [district], Indapur [Pune district], and some regions of Marathwada [Aurangabad district]. While meagre exports to West Asia continue, farmers are finding it difficult to meet the requirement of residue- free fruit for European markets. The association has decided to form a research team with Mahatma Phule Krishi University on how to control the disease.

Maharashtra contributes 90 per cent of the country's total pomegranate production [and] exported 40 000 tonnes of pomegranates in the 2014-15 season.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (Xa) pv. _punicae_. The disease was first described in India in 1952 and was only known from that country, until it was recently reported also from South Africa. The main damage occurs on fruits which develop black spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. Disease development and spread are favoured by cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall, and heavy rains are thought to be a triggering factor for epidemics.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit, twigs, and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and wind-splashed rain. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures and bactericidal sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead to rejection of exported fruit by some countries (such as within the European Union, as referred to above). No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

The disease has become an increasingly serious problem for Indian pomegranate growers in several states (see previous ProMED-mail posts below). In Maharashtra, it is the main disease of the crop with 100 percent infection in some orchards. In Karnataka, it is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry with up to 85 percent incidence in the north.

Other pathovars of Xa affect a range of crops, for example: pv.s _citri_ and _aurantifolii_ cause citrus canker which poses a serious threat to citrus industries worldwide; pv. _allii_ causes bacterial blight of onion, a serious disease emerging in several tropical and subtropical areas; pv. _vesicatoria_ causes bacterial spot of tomato and capsicum.
