The deadly Ebola disease has killed 2 people so far following an
outbreak announced last week in Nakisamata village, Zirobwe, in Luwero
district. Though official reports from the Ministry of Health indicate
2 deaths and at least 25 traced cases, unofficial figures put the
number of deaths at 4 so far.

The Sudan ebolavirus that struck the remote village in Luwero, killed
a 12-year-old girl. The 2nd victim was the Bombo Military Hospital
mortuary attendant who, health experts say, had close contact with the
1st victim. Ministry of Health officials have however pointed out that
he was diagnosed with malaria prior to his death.

Dr Monica Musenero, an epidemiologist attached to the African Field
Epidemiology Network (AFENET), pointed out that so far 25 listed
contacts had been identified in Luwero district alone. "The new
suspected [victim of ebolavirus infection] is that of a 5-year-old boy
from Nakisamata in Zirobwe, Luwero, where the 1st victim was reported.
The suspect is currently under surveillance at the Bombo Military
Hospital," she said yesterday [23 May 2011]. Musenero said 4 suspected
cases had been detected in Luwero and Bugiri districts. "3 contacts in
Luwero have already developed symptoms; 2 cumulative alert cases have
been detected in Luwero and one in Kampala," she said.

The National Task Force situation report (Sitrep no 4) issued by the
Ministry of Health stated that so far 6 inpatients were being
monitored in Luwero, Kampala, and Bugiri. "No new alert cases, deaths,
or discharges have been reported by yesterday [23 May 2011]," stated
the report posted on the AFENET website.

The 5-year-old Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] suspect from Ngalonkalu had
a 2-day history of high grade fever associated with headache,
vomiting, general body pains, and bloody diarrhoea. "The patient has
been isolated and a sample retrieved for laboratory investigations.
There are 4 suspected cases admitted at Bombo Military Hospital, and
they are responding well to treatment," said the report. Luwero
District health officer Dr Joseph Okware said 3 of the 4 cases have
tested negative for ebolavirus infection by PCR and ELISA antigen
testing. He said 3 of the contacts to the 'putative index' patient had
developed fever and 2 of them had been isolated.

Dr Musenero said there was no Ebola [disease] in Bugiri. "The Bugiri
case was confirmed to be malaria and the young man is recovering," she
said.

Ebolavirus is highly contagious and causes a range of symptoms
including fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, generalised pain or malaise, and
in many cases internal and external bleeding. The Ministry of Health
issued a statement yesterday [23 May 2011] urging locals to desist
from eating game meat, which it described as 'dangerous' in this era
of ebolavirus.

[The situation in Uganda is becoming more confused. There appear to
be at least 2 confirmed cases of ebolavirus infection and several
suspected cases in the Luwero district of Central Uganda, a few of
whom now have tested negative by laboratory diagnosis. The putative
suspected cases in Western Uganda, described in the preceding post in
this thread are not mentioned in this report. An authoritative
statement on the current situation is overdue. Clarification is
awaited.
