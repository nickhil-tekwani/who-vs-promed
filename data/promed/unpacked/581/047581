New begomoviruses
-----------------
Many new begomoviruses have been described recently from various parts of
the world, on _Cucurbitaceae_, _Malvaceae_, or _Solanaceae_. For
convenience, they have been gathered here. The main difficulty in assessing
their importance is the lack of information on the extent and severity of
the diseases they may cause on crops.
Cucurbit leaf crumple begomovirus in California (US)
In 1998, a new bipartite begomovirus tentatively called Cucurbit leaf
crumple begomovirus was observed in cucurbits in the Imperial Valley of
California, US (Hernandez et al., 2000).
Cucurbit leaf curl begomovirus in USA (Arizona, Texas) and Mexico
In 1998-1999, signs of virus infection were observed on pumpkin (_Cucurbita
pepo_) in Arizona (US), and on melons (_Cucumis melo_) in Texas (US) and
Coahuila (Mexico). The features were similar to those caused by squash leaf
curl begomovirus (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) described in Arizona in 1981.
Cucurbit plants were also infested by whiteflies. Molecular studies
(polmerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence comparisons)
revealed the presence of a new begomovirus, tentatively called Cucurbit
leaf curl begomovirus (Brown et al., 2000).
Cotton leaf curl begomovirus - Sudan
In Sudan, cotton leaf curl disease was first reported in 1931. The signs on
cotton plants were vein thickening and leaf curling. _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO
A2 quarantine pest) transmitted the [pathogen to cotton, okra, and several
weeds. Begomovirus was not shown to be the cause. During 1994-1996, 4
cotton samples showing typical symptoms of the disease were collected form
different fields in the region of Gezira, in Central Sudan. Molecular
studies (PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis) showed that the 4 isolates
corresponded to a new single monopartite begomovirus. Its closest relatives
were Althaea rosea enation begomovirus from Egypt (79 per cent similarity)
and Cotton leaf curl begomovirus - Pakistan (66 per cent). This new virus
was tentatively called cotton leaf curl begomovirus - Sudan (Idris & Brown,
2000).
Pepper yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Thailand
In 1995, pepper plants (_Capsicum annuum_) showing signs of yellow leaf
curl were observed at Kanchanaburi in central Thailand. Three naturally
infected pepper plants were collected and virus cultures were maintained on
pepper plants. The virus was transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2
quarantine pest). Molecular studies (PCR, nucleotide sequence comparisons
with 28 well known begomoviruses) [showed it to be a new begomovirus. Its
closest relative was tomato leaf curl virus from Taiwan (85 per cent
sequence similarity). This new virus was tentatively called pepper yellow
leaf curl begomovirus (Samretwanich et al, 2000).
Tomato curly stunt begomovirus - South Africa
In South Africa, preliminary reports in 1997 suggested that tomato yellow
leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was present. In
1998, 140 ha of tomato fields in the region of Onderberg (Mpumalanga) were
studied for the possible presence of TYLCV-Israel. [The disease incidence
ranged from less than 1 per cent to 50 per cent. Yield losses in individual
plants ranged from negligible to 100 per cent. Molecular studies (PCR,
nucleotide sequence comparisons) of 2 isolates were indistinguishable,
showing that the virus present was a distinct begomovirus (less than 78 per
cent sequence identity with other well-studied begomoviruses). This virus
was tentatively called tomato curly stunt begomovirus - South Africa
(Pietersen et al, 2000).
Tomato leaf curl begomovirus - Barbados
In September 1998, tomato plants showing signs of severe leaf curling
without marginal chlorosis were observed in Barbados. The signs were often
associated with populations of _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
Molecular studies [showed it to be a new begomovirus, which was
tentatively called tomato leaf curl begomovirus - Barbados (Roye et al, 2000).

[These reports are indicative of the plethora of new whitefly-transmitted
viral pathogens that infect major food crops in warmer regions of the
world. Of particular interest is tomato curly stunt begomovirus which,
depending upon the age of the plant when infected, is lethal in tomato. -
