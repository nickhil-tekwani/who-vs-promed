Aphids most responsible for spreading _Barley yellow dwarf virus_ [BYDV]
are increasing this season [2007] with mild conditions and the high
proportion of early sown crops increasing the risk of disease spreading.
Although populations of the bird cherry aphid and grain aphid have hitherto
been relatively low, results of the latest national aphid monitoring
surveys revealed a 40 per cent increase in numbers of these 2 key aphid
species caught over recent weeks.

"The risk of BYDV infection appears to be shifting ever later. Cereal crops
emerging before the 2nd week of October [2007] must now be considered as
most susceptible to BYDV infection," said Syngenta technical manager, Iain
Hamilton. The earlier crops are infected, the higher the disease's severity
and yield loss.

Where mild conditions continue, there is also the chance for secondary
infection through aphids feeding on infected crops and spreading it across
the field to surrounding crops right through the autumn and early winter,
he adds. "Growers need to weigh up the risk, based on crop emergence timing
and the historic legacy of BYDV on their farm, allied to current aphid
activity levels," said Mr Hamilton.

[_Barley yellow dwarf virus_ (BYDV; genus _Luteovirus_) occurs worldwide
and is the most destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be
reduced by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species
(_Gramineae_) including wheat, oats, rice, maize, rye, and barley. Oats are
usually considered more susceptible than wheat. Symptoms include leaf
discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species),
stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in
autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth
resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the field,
which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors. The virus can
be transmitted by more than 20 species of aphids and is retained when the
insect moults. It cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical
means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Disease management
includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.

The virus occurs in several strains, which are differentiated by their
ability to be transmitted by various aphid species and their virulence on a
selected variety of oats. Some strains of BYDV are transmitted equally well
by several aphids, whereas other strains can be transmitted by only one or
2 aphid species. The bird cherry aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain
aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe PAV strain and this may
be the strain causing concern in the report above.
