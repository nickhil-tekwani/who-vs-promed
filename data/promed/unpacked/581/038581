Studies have been carried out in Angola and Sao Tome e Principe to assess
the possible presence of _Citrus tristeza virus_ (_Closterovirus_, CTV -
EPPO A2 List). In Sao Tome e Principe, young twigs were collected from 20
trees in different places and from different citrus varieties. In Angola,
samples were collected from 7 old orange trees (_Citrus sinensis_) of
unknown varieties in an orchard at Sumbe, in the province of Kwanza Sul.
Two samples from Sao Tome e Principe and all of the 7 samples from Angola
were found infected by CTV (by Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay). These
are the 1st reports of CTV in Angola and Sao Tome e Principe.

[There are more than 30 citrus diseases that are caused by viruses and
virus-like organisms. Of these, _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus
_Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive. It is
killing millions of trees every year worldwide and appears to be spreading
wherever citrus is grown. CTV causes severe leaf and bark symptoms such as
yellowing and stem-pitting, as well as dieback and stunting on a number of
citrus species. The virus is spread by several aphid species and can also
be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means.

Different strains of CTV may vary in severity of symptoms induced in the
host. Introduction of more severe strains, for example the "orange stem
pitting" strain, is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas. Strains
inducing mild symptoms in some citrus varieties may lead to serious
problems when transmitted to other more susceptible host varieties. Disease
management includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of
inoculum, and vector control.
