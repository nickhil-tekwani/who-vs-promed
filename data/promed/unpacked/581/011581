VRE, NOT from swine in Sweden
Researchers from the Karoliska Intitutet have in two cases isolated
enterococci of the vanA type (VRE) in environmental samples taken in
Sweden. One of the samples was from hospital sewage, the other was from pig
manure outside a pig farm. Animals on the farm where the manure was
collected have not been sampled. In the same study, other animals (pig,
poultry and calves) have been sampled and no VRE have been found. The
origin of the isolated strain therefore still remains to be elucidated.
Avoparcin, a glycopeptide related to vancomycin, has not been used in
Swedish animal production since the beginning of the 80s. The negative
findings in Swedish animals in the above study are confirmed by several
other, previous, studies where no VRE have been found in Swedish animals
[1-4. In a multi-center, nationwide study of non-hospitalized persons in
Sweden, no VRE could be detected [5. This is in contrast to the situation
in other European countries. In Swedish hospitals, only a couple of
isolated outbreaks have been reported.
In view of the above, we agree with the comment from the moderator. The
finding is likely to be an isolated incident.
