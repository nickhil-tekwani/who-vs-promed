AVIAN INFLUENZA (140): GERMANY (BAVARIA), WILD DUCK

In ProMED-mail posting "Avian influenza (138): Germany (Bavaria), duck"
[20070811.2622], "wild ducks" were reported to have been found infected in
Germany. In the absence of more details on the species involved, the
moderator assumed that the birds were mallards, _Anas platyrhynchos_. While
this is plausible, since the mallard is the most common wild duck in the
world, one should keep in mind that there are many tens of other wild duck
species. Providing the scientific (Latin) name of wild birds by genus and
species -- when mentioned in ProMED-mail postings -- is indeed a necessity,
particularly when discussing the potential role of disease transmission by
migrating birds.

[A similarly justified commentary was received from investigators of
Rotterdam's Erasmus Medical Centre in October 2005 (see 20051031.3181).
We wholeheartedly endorse Alan's comment, and hereby repeat our request for
detailed reports regarding the species of tested birds, positive or
otherwise. This may require closer cooperation with and active involvement
of zoologists and ornithologists. Veterinary authorities should include the
acquired data in their official notifications to the international
organizations; ProMED-mail would appreciate such information, if available,
from subscribers. - Mod.AS]
