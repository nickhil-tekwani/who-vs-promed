As quoted by a journalist of the Focus Agency, the national
consultant on epidemiology, Mira Kozhuharova, said in the town of
Plovdiv that as of 2 Mar 2007, 500 people had fallen ill with mumps
in Bulgaria.
The most susceptible group [includes those] who were born in the
period 1982-1988 because they were not vaccinated. The 1st case
appeared in western Bulgaria. Now there are affected people in the
localities of Varna, Burgas, Sofia, and Plovdiv. Additional vaccines
will be [made available] for those who have not been vaccinated.

[Outbreaks of mumps still occur sporadically throughout Europe as a
result of incomplete vaccine coverage in the past, the inclusion of
sub-optimal (or no) mump component in triple MMR vaccine, or presence
of migrant populations.
Plovdiv is located in south-central Bulgaria. A map of Bulgaria
showing the location of Plovdiv and the other cities mentioned can be
