Monday 2 children in Yogyakarta died of dengue fever, raising to 12 the
number of deaths caused by the disease in the last 4 months. The 2
children, aged 4 and 6, passed away at Sardjito Hospital, where they had
been treated for a day.
"They were very ill when they arrived. We did our best but could not save
them," the head of the hospital's pediatric ward, Ida Safitri, said Tuesday.
Sardjito spokesman Trisno Heru Nugroho said there had been a significant
increase in the number of dengue fever patients at the hospital in recent
months. In January 2006, 69 patients were treated at the hospital, 88 in
February and 102 in March.
"Compared to the same period last year [2005], the number of dengue fever
patients is higher this year. Last year we treated 160 dengue fever
patients from January to April," Trisno said.

"Nearly 500 persons have been infected with the dengue fever virus in
Paraguay", pointed out Dr. Wilma Basualdo.
Dr. Basualdo said that up to this morning there are 112 persons reported
with classic dengue fever. She indicated that many of them presented with
hemorrhagic manifestations, and it has not been completely ruled out that a
case of hemorrhagic dengue fever -- the most severe form of the disease,
sometimes fatal -- may occur at any time.
Meanwhile, there are continuous efforts to eliminate mosquito larvae
breeding sites, and constant publicity urging people to participate in
keeping their households clean.

Dengue fever cases in Paraguay have markedly increased over the past week.
This week, 81 infected persons have been reported, according to the
Paraguayan Health Ministry.
The main infectious area was the neighborhood of La Encarnacion in downtown
Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital, where there is a significant
concentration of public and private offices and apartment buildings.
"We are facing an epidemic because of the fast advance of dengue fever in
the different Asuncion neighborhoods as well as in the city suburbs",
pointed out Dr. Vilma Basualdo, head of Sanitary Surveillance.
The officer announced the mobilization of teams of healthcare workers to
detect and destroy all mosquito vector breeding sites .
