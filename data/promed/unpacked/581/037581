[Below are 3 messages which show that ProMED-mail and others don't get it
right every time. However, more importantly, it also shows we and others do
try to get the right information to our subscribers when it becomes known
to us.
We appreciate the comments from Gundula Floegel and Marcus Doherr
pointing out errors. Likewise, we admire OIE for updating a version of
the OIE report we posted on 9 Oct 2001. It is the first piece below. As far
as mixing up east and west when I looked up exactly where Brandenburg is on
the map, I can only say my directional arrows got crossed. - Mod.PC

We were very surprised when we received the report below.
The EU Reference Laboratory for CSF at the School of Veterinary
Medicine in Hannover, Germany has not done the diagnosis on the
CSF outbreak mentioned below, nor have we received any samples
from the case.

Correction to the statement made by the moderator regarding location of this
CSF outbreak:
The Spree-Neisse region is in the south-eastern part of the state of
Brandenburg / GE, and is approx. 470 km south-EAST of Hannover, not "far
west of Hannover" as stated by moderator PC.
