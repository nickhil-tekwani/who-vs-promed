In relation to the report of breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_ in some
Havana city municipalities, I wish to inform you that it is possible to
have foci in a city of 2 million inhabitants, considering that we have not
eradicated the vector, although the premises index in the city (beginning
of October 2002) was 0.06 [i.e., 6 per 10 000 premises. - Mod.JW]. As any
person can realize the possibility of transmission in Havana in this moment
is practically nil.
What I am sure of is that there is not a single autochthonous case of
dengue in Cuba in this moment. The struggle against the vector continues,
but it is very difficult to eradicate it.

[ProMED is grateful to Prof. Kouri for this official response to our
Request for Information. I agree that it is extremely difficult to
eradicate the vector, although it was done by Cuba and Brazil -- and other
countries -- in past eras when international trade and travel were not as
intense as it is nowadays.
It should be noted, however, that in 1998 Singapore had a premises index of
1.24 percent, well below the classic threshold of 5.0 percent, but
nevertheless suffered a dengue epidemic due to foci of the vector being
concentrated in certain parts of the city (see refs. below). A premise
index of 6/10 000 seems low, but that is a rate of 600 per million, and
supposing there are a half million premises in Havana, that means 300
foci. Our previous post mentions that those are concentrated in just a few
locations. There they could raise the local premise index above the
threshold for a local outbreak sparked by an imported case. - Mod.JW]
