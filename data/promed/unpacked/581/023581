Gap grows between diagnosis and killing
----------------------------------------------
The time lag between the diagnosis of animals with foot and mouth disease
(FMD)and their slaughter is getting longer every day despite a pledge by
Tony Blair to cut it to 24 hours. There is a discrepancy between the
figures issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
and those given out by Downing Street -- and yesterday charts and tables
describing the progress of the disease were removed from MAFF's website.
Fewer than 610 000 animals have been slaughtered, of which 178 000 are
lying in fields and barns waiting to be disposed of. Crucially, there were
345 000 animals awaiting slaughter yesterday -- almost 53 000 more than 3
days before. This figure was posted on the MAFF website yesterday, but all
the comparative figures for the 6 weeks of the outbreak were removed.
With the number of new cases continuing to rise sharply -- 933 by yesterday
afternoon -- the number of animals to be slaughtered was expected to pass
one million today. In addition, 3657 farmers have applied to have 1.3
million healthy sheep, pigs, and cows slaughtered under the animal welfare
scheme. Added to those already in the slaughter schemes, this is 5% of all
farm animals in Britain.
The first sign the government was avoiding questioning came last week with
the suspension of daily press conferences by Nick Brown, the agriculture
minister, and Jim Scudamore, the chief vet.
The MAFF website gave the figures of the number of animals actually
slaughtered, carcasses disposed of and those waiting to be killed. Update
No. 10 last week indicated this last figure was falling, but MAFF's
statistics showed it was rising. By Friday the discrepancy had become an
embarrassment.
MAFF figures showed 788 956 animals were marked for slaughter, of which 496
821 had already been killed and 349 379 carcasses disposed of. There were
still 292 125 animals waiting to be killed. It was this delay
epidemiologists said had to be reduced to 24 hours to stop the epidemic
worsening.

[While an effort to control the news and the data is not unexpected, it
unfortunately has an immediate result in feeding a widening perception of
lack of transparency. This can engender both doubt and suspicion of the
reliability of any figures produced, and then even of competence. The
sooner this is corrected the better. - Mod.MHJ
