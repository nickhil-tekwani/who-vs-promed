Bulowayo's Tshabalala Extension suburb has reportedly been hit by a dysentery outbreak at a time when residents are being tormented by diarrhea. The diarrhea outbreak recently claimed the life of a resident of the suburb and infected hundred others. The outbreak has been blamed on contaminated water after the local authority implemented a 72-hour water-shedding regime on 1 Dec 2021.

A resident told Southern Eye yesterday [20 Dec 2021] that he had diarrhea for the 2nd time in days and was told by nurses that he was suffering from dysentery. "I am still feeling dizzy and have a running stomach. I am passing stool with blood. I was told that I have dysentery. My son was also having the same problem. My neighbour was also complaining of the same problem," he said.

Tshabalala Residents Association chairperson Webster Tsondayi urged council to provide answers to the recurrent outbreaks of water-borne diseases. "We appeal for effective communication from the city council. We hear that it's water contamination," Tsondayi said. "They should do like they did last time when there were water shortages in the city where they explained to residents the challenges they were facing. We will understand if they explain to us rather than remaining mum."

Bulawayo City Council health services director Edwin Sibanda could neither deny nor confirm the outbreak. He, however, said that samples sent to internal and external laboratories came back positive for _Shigella flexneri_, a bacterium that causes diarrhea. "I cannot confirm the outbreak of dysentery since I am not aware of the case. Dysentery has so many thresholds unless we analyze case by case. I cannot say we no longer have cases of diarrhea now since we are still counting the incubation period from the last case, but as of the past 3 or 4 days, there were zero cases recorded," Sibanda said.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given the relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
