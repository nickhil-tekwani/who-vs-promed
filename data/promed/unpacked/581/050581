Since 1 May 2007, a number of 10-year-old-plus children have died
from serious illness of unknown origin at several health care
institutions in Linyi City, Shandong Province.
According to Qingdao news media, a doctor at Linyi People's Hospital
reported that the hospital has recently admitted some pediatric
patients and acknowledges that there are children who have died, but
did not confirm that their deaths have a direct connection to this
[undiagnosed] illness. The doctor did not explain what illness the
patients had and just said that it might be a gastrointestinal tract infection.
The Linyi Municipal epidemic prevention agency acknowledged that mass
illness has occurred in the recent period, but cannot confirm the
name of the specific virus at this time.
Sources say this illness is spread through routine body contact.
Clinical manifestations are pustules in the mouth and throat, red
spots on face, palms, and backs of hands, and high fever.

The Public Health Department in east China's Shandong Province has
issued a statement denying media reports claiming that several
children died from an unknown disease in Linyi city, on 11 May 2007.
It posted a clarification on its official website, saying a
2-year-old girl had died from an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease
(HFMD) in Linyi.
The girl was taken to hospital after she developed a fever and
started vomiting on 27 Apr 2007. She was hospitalized 2 days later,
after her condition worsened. Doctors confirmed a diagnosis of HFMD
but say they were too late to save her life. After the girl died, the
local health bureau took emergency action to contain the spread of
the disease, quarantining anyone infected with the disease, and
informing kindergartens and schools of the threat.
The Public Health Department said there have been no further deaths,
and urged the public not to believe the rumors.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness with symptoms
that include mouth ulcers, sores, fever, and a skin rash. The disease
is highly contagious and transmitted through saliva, air, or skin
contact. It can be fatal if complications occur. The Public Health
Department said the disease can be cured with proper treatment.
The Ministry of Health said it has not received any reports of an
epidemic from its subordinate in Shandong province. Ministry
spokesman, Mao Anqun, said the news released by authorized
institutions is the most credible.
The Ministry of Health has declared the rumors that several children
died from an unknown disease on 11 May untrue. It has asked the
Shandong Province Public Health Department to refute the rumors.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver
[The official account of the outbreak unequivocally identifies the
disease as Hand-foot-mouth disease, a common disease of childhood,
particularly prevalent in East Asia. The anomalously high mortality
cited in the early newspaper reports is not confirmed and there is no
longer reason to question the accuracy of the diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
