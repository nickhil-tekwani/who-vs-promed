[These 2 reports (below) describe a fatal disease outbreak in the Chepang
community of Makwanpur District, Central Nepal, about 180 kilometers south
southwest of Kathmandu. Members of the isolated Chepang ethnolinguistic
group traditionally engage in a semi-nomadic, hunter-gatherer mode of
subsistence along the steep mountainsides and jungles of the Mahabharat
range in southern Nepal.]

Unknown disease kills 32 in Makwanpur
--------------------------------
An unknown disease has claimed 32 lives at remote Khairang VDC in the west
of Makwanpur district in central Nepal. The disease characterised by
headache, nausea, fever, and giddiness started showing up from the
third week of this month, said Raj Kumar Malla, the outgoing chairman at
the VDC (Village Development Committee).
The victims of the disease die after 4 to 5 days of infection and it has
affected children the most, according to locals. The VDC is devoid of any
health facilities and the innocent locals are resorting to shamans for
treatment.
The area's main people are the Chepangs, an ethnic community. The VDC is a
10-hour walk from Manahari bazaar along the Narayangadh-Hetauda
road. "Since we received the belated information on Tuesday, a medical
team will be dispatched to the site on Wednesday," said Dr. Kalyan Basnet,
the chief at the District Public Health Office.

[The differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses with nausea, headache,
and possible neurologic signs with a preponderance of cases seen in
children is rather extensive. Hence, prudence is dictating that we request
more information on this outbreak from authoritative sources. - Mod.MPP]
