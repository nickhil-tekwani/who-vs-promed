A reported outbreak of hepatitis A in Chuuk [Micronesia] prompted
Sen. Frank Blas Jr. yesterday [6 Aug 2008] to introduce a bill that
would implement entry restrictions on individuals coming to Guam from
affected islands. "There should be no questions when a jurisdiction
with flight links to Guam has an outbreak," said Blas, chairman of
the health committee.

"No one from that jurisdiction who has been infected should be
allowed into our island. We must safeguard our people from such an
outbreak. Our 1st priority should be to the health and safety of the
people of Guam," he added. Bill 351 mandates that travelers who have
been in an affected jurisdiction for more than one week who wish to
enter the island will have to obtain a clean bill of health from a
certified and recognized medical provider within a week of their
arrival on Guam.

"We can't allow an outbreak to occur here," said Sen. Eddie B. Calvo,
co-author of Bill 351. "We have a duty to protect the community, and
we will do everything we can to ensure Guam is insulated from
outbreaks occurring elsewhere."

Under the bill, individuals from the affected jurisdictions who try
to enter Guam without proper medical clearance will be quarantined,
and the resulting costs accrued from the quarantine and/or treatment
will be the responsibility of both the traveler and the airline
carrier that transported that individual.

The hepatitis A outbreak is believed to be caused by heavy rains that
resulted in the overflow of raw sewage and incomplete municipal water
treatment. The cases peaked in June 2008 and have since declined.
Current information as to the safety of drinking water on Chuuk was
not available.

A vaccination for hepatitis A is available and would be appropriate
for those planning on an extended stay in Chuuk and who have not been
previously vaccinated, public health officials said. The reports
about the hepatitis A outbreak in Chuuk came over a week after the
local health agency disclosed the tuberculosis epidemic in the same
island, where 4 patients died of the disease.

[Hepatitis A is a preventable virus infection, and travelers to the
Pacific Islands should ensure that they have been vaccinated to avoid
infection and facilitate free access.

and Micronesia is available at:

[From a public health standpoint, permitting individuals to spend one
week in Guam while obtaining a "clean bill of health" from a
physician in Guam will only impact the potential transmission of the
disease in Guam if the traveller had a prior history of documented
hepatitis A infection, had a history of adequate vaccination against
hepatitis A, or if the traveller was lucky not to get infected with
the hepatitis A virus while in the infected area. The average
incubation period for hepatitis A is 4 weeks with a range of
approximately 15 to 45 days. Hence, if a traveller was infected in
the week prior to arrival in Guam, they would be in the incubation
period for the disease, would be clinically well, and in 2 to 4 weeks
would begin excreting the hepatitis A virus potentially putting
others at risk of contagion. Perhaps a better approach might be to
encourage vaccination with the hepatitis A vaccine prior to travel to
known infected areas. - Mod.MPP]
