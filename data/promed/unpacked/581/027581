Viruses from bird flu cases traced to 'wet' markets; study urges clean
up
--------
A new study draws a strong link between the live animal markets of
China and human cases of A/(H5N1) avian influenza virus infection,
often known as bird flu. Chinese scientists looked for evidence of the
dangerous flu virus in live-bird food markets that six people who came
down with the infection in 2008-2009 had reported visiting in the two
weeks before they became sick.

The researchers collected samples from the markets and the
individuals' homes, swabbing the bottom of chicken cages, floors in
the markets and nearby ditches, then testing the swabs for molecular
traces of flu viruses.

A surprisingly large portion of the samples taken were positive for
influenza A viruses, the broad family into which the avian A (H5N1)
viruses. Of 69 samples, 31 were positive for influenza A viruses and
further testing showed 17 of the 31 were positive for the A?(H5N1)
virus. Genetic analysis of these viruses showed they were closely
related to the viruses isolated from the human cases, suggesting
strongly the markets were the source of their infections.

The study is published in the December issue of the Journal of
Virology [see comment below]. The findings have important public
health implications, corresponding author Yuelong Shu warned in a
release. A key concern: that the H5N1 viruses and the H1N1 viruses
that caused the 2009 pandemic might simultaneously transmit in these
markets, giving the two viruses the chance to reassort. One of the
ways pandemic viruses emerge is when different flu viruses
simultaneously infect a person or an animal such as a pig, giving the
viruses a chance to swap genes. The 2009 H1N1 virus is a particular
concern in this regard because it has an internal gene, known as the M
gene [coding for the matrix protein[, that seems easily able to move
into new gene constellations. Studies of this M gene suggest it makes
flu viruses more transmissible in guinea pigs, which are considered a
good model for what happens with flu viruses in humans.

"Enhanced infection control measures are warranted in these markets,
not only to reduce human H5N1 infection, but also to minimize the
likelihood of co-infection with H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 viruses," the
researchers wrote in the article. "The sporadic cases of human H5N1
highly pathogenic avian influenza infection, the H5N1 outbreaks in
birds, and the simultaneous circulation of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
virus raise concern that a deadly reassortant virus may emerge."

Concern has long focused on the crowded live animal markets of Asia as
a potential point of transmission between animal viruses and people.
For instance, severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS was caused by
a coronavirus that probably passed to humans from civet cats and
raccoon dogs sold in the so-called wet markets.

In 1997 in Hong Kong, when H5N1 viruses first began infecting humans,
director of health Dr. Margaret Chan -- now Director General of the
World Health Organization -- ordered the destruction of all live
chickens in the city in an effort to try to eliminate the threat.
There were no more cases at the time, but the virus was clearly
spreading among birds elsewhere and in 2003 it roared back with a
vengeance. Over the next several years, millions of poultry were
culled in Southeast Asia and
beyond.

[Helen Bransewel's article is based on the Journal of Virology paper
entitled: "Indications that Live Poultry Markets Are a Major Source of
Human H5N1 Influenza Virus Infection in China", by
Xiu-Feng Wan, and 28 collaborators. (J. Virol. December 2011
85:13432-13438
http://jvi.asm.org/gca?gca=jvi%3B85%2F24%2F13432&submit=Get+All+Checked+Abstracts).


The Abstract reads: "Human infections of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus have continued to occur in China without corresponding
outbreaks in poultry, and there is little conclusive evidence of the
source of these infections. Seeking to identify the source of the
human infections, we sequenced 31 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in
China (2005 to 2010). [There were 40 cases and 26 deaths in China
during this period - Mod.CP]. We found a number of viral genotypes,
not all of which have similar known avian virus counterparts. Guided
by patient questionnaire data, we also obtained environmental samples
from live poultry markets and dwellings frequented by six individuals
prior to disease onset (2008 and 2009). H5N1 viruses were isolated
from 4 of the 6 live poultry markets sampled. In each case, the
genetic sequences of the environmental and corresponding human
isolates were highly similar, demonstrating a link between human
infection and live poultry markets. Therefore, infection control
measures in live poultry markets are likely to reduce human H5N1
infection in China".

The results of this research identify live poultry markets as the
likely source of infection of some human cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus
infection, but they do establish that this route of infection is more
likely to generate a virus transmissible among humans. An interesting
observation is that the authors also found "a number of viral
genotypes, not all of which have similar known avian virus
counterparts."

There have been no confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1)
virus infection in China so far in 2011.- Mod.CP]
