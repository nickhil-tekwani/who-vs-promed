[According to the summarized information available in the OIE/WAHID archive, the total number of EHD outbreaks in Israel, since the start of the current event (16 Sep 2015), is 39. The immediate notification, which reported the 3 1st outbreaks, mentioned 170 clinical cases out of 1400 susceptible animals. These cases reportedly involved "dairy cows showing drop in milk production, swollen feet, and limping". Such information is not available in relation to the 36 new outbreaks reported in the current follow-up report, but it may be assumed that the disease picture is, most probably, similar, and that the disease has not been fatal.

The disease is mainly concentrated in the northern parts of Israel, but cases have been recorded elsewhere: see map at the bottom of the archived summary at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019063_20151112_132330.pdf.

It may be reasonable to assume that this orbivirus infection, spread by culicoids, has not affected Israel's territory selectively but may have been circulating, during the same period, in other countries in the region, particularly those bordering northern Israel (Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan).

Information on the serotype involved will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
