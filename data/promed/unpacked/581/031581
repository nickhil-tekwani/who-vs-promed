Alabama: First Fatal Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 2002
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health announces 2 new cases of West Nile
infection in humans, including the first fatal case of the infection in an
Alabama resident this year. The fatal case occurred in an elderly Montgomery
County woman. The only other death occurred last year in a Jefferson County
resident.
West Nile infection has also been identified in a 71-year-old Chambers
County man. West Nile infection has been identified in 21 Alabama residents
to date in 2002.
Thirty-four horses, 429 birds and 63 mosquito pools have been confirmed with
West Nile virus. The virus has been detected in 59 of Alabama's 67 counties.
The department continues to believe that the virus is likely present in
every Alabama community.
These counts far exceed the level of virus activity reported in 2001, when
59 positive birds in 13 counties were detected, and none earlier than the
end of August. In 2001 Alabama experienced 2 human cases of West Nile virus
infection, one of which was fatal.
The Department of Public Health will continue its efforts to inform the
public about the importance of personal protection measures individuals can
take to reduce their risks of being bitten by infected mosquitoes. In
addition, the department will distribute additional information to hospitals
and clinics about this disease and the availability of tests for human cases.
