A recent case of anthrax in a cow southwest of San Angelo confirmed by the Texas Animal Health Commission should serve as a reminder to those in areas with a history of the disease to vaccinate their animals, said a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service official.

[The rest of this extension report is advice to ranchers and their veterinarians.

I contacted various folk to find out what had happened. The 1st cow died around 26 Oct 2013. The herd was corralled. The owner called her vet when the 3rd cow had died on 30 Oct 2013, and a sample was sent to the diagnostic laboratory TxVMDL at College Station. As soon as they had a diagnosis, vaccine was ordered from Colorado Serum Co., and the herd was vaccinated on 8 Nov 2013. The 6th and last cow died on 9 Nov 2013.

The herd was not on hay. It had been grazing. It had been very dry all year up until mid-September 2013, when there were heavy rains over a week or so. Dry since, but the grazing is now more than adequate, so we can presume the source was local. There is no known history of anthrax on this ranch near Knickerbocker, but, in the absence of any other information, it would be logical that at some point the index cow grazed a forgotten cattle grave in this area of Texas with a history of sporadic outbreaks. An additional problem is that we rarely see any anthrax outbreaks in Texas after, say, the 1st week in October. Why so late in this instance? This brings us back to the current climate and a hypothetical cattle grave.

The owner burned the carcasses using brush.

My usual advice in circumstances like this is that, as the vaccine takes 8 days to kick in with adequate protection, it is wise to inject the high risk, apparently healthy animals with La-200/Oxytetracycline [http://www.drugs.com/vet/liquamycin-la-200.html] to abort any incubating infections, then wait 7-10 days, and then vaccinate with Sterne when the antibiotic titre is low enough to allow successful germination of the vaccine spores.

Where working the cattle is a problem, Sam Holland, one-time CVO South Dakota, used to treat and vaccinate at the same time and claimed success. One should use penicillin-streptomycin with horses given over 3 days. After any outbreak, one should annually vaccinate for a minimum of 3 years. In this part of Texas with a persistent history of sporadic outbreaks, it is probably worth vaccinating annually, considering the replacement costs of any dead cows and of dealing properly with an outbreak.

My heartfelt thanks to Rusty Raleigh, Josh Blanek, Pete Fincher, and Roger Parker for finding the time to talk with me and share what they knew.
