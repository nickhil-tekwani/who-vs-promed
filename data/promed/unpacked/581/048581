The anthrax case: from spores to a suspect
------------------------------------------
[Byline: Martin Enserink]

[This report contains some ancillary genomic information of interest
-- who did what, where -- beyond that which has been posted already.
I suggest that anyone interested read the full article on the Science
web site at the source URL.

It also raises the subject of exactly how much was known about the
physical and chemical characteristics of the product. Idem: "The
[October 2007] affidavit is very unclear about whether the spore
preparations might have undergone physical or chemical treatments to
make them disperse more easily -- still a point of major confusion,
says Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a bioweapons specialist at Purchase
College in New York. Scientists at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology reported in October 2001 that the spores sent to US Senator
Tom Daschle's office had been mixed with silica to make them more
easily dispersible. However, in congressional briefings and in a
paper published in the August 2006 issue of Applied and Environmental
Microbiology, FBI officials described the powder as a simple spore
preparation without additives." Unfortunately the AFIP (Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology) website indicates that the relevant AFIP
document -- Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington DC, The
AFIP Letter, Vol. 160, No. 4, August/October, 2002 -- is no longer
available on the web; see: <http://www.afip.org/images/public/nl081002.pdf>.

Hopefully this dichotomy in the scientific evidence will be clarified
in the forthcoming FBI press briefing. - Mod.MHJ]

FBI will present scientific evidence in anthrax case to counter doubts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Growing doubts from scientists about the strength of the government's
case against the late Bruce E Ivins, the military researcher named as
the anthrax killer, are forcing the Justice Department to begin
disclosing more fully the scientific evidence it used to implicate
him. In the face of the questions, Federal Bureau of Investigation
[FBI] officials have decided to make their 1st detailed public
presentation next week on the forensic science used to trace the
anthrax used in the 2001 attacks to a flask kept in a refrigerator in
Dr Ivins's laboratory at Fort Detrick, in Maryland. Many scientists
are awaiting those details because so far, they say, the FBI has
failed to make a conclusive case.

"That is going to be critically important, because right now there is
really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other,"
Brad Smith, a molecular biologist at the Center for Biosecurity at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "The information that
has been put out, there is really very little scientific information in there."

FBI officials say they are confident that their scientific evidence
against Dr Ivins, who killed himself last month [29 Jul 2008] as the
Justice Department was preparing an indictment against him, will
withstand scrutiny, and they plan to present their findings for
review by leading scientists. But the scrutiny may only raise fresh
questions. The bureau presented forensics information to
Congressional and government officials this week in a closed-door
briefing, but a number of listeners said the briefing left them less
convinced that the FBI had the right man, and they said some of the
government's public statements appeared incomplete or misleading.

For instance, the Justice Department said earlier this month [August
2008] in unsealing court records against Dr Ivins that he had tried
to mislead investigators in 2002 by giving them an anthrax sample
that did not appear to have come from his laboratory. But FBI
officials acknowledged at the closed-door briefing, according to
people who were there, that the sample Dr Ivins gave them in 2002 did
in fact come from the same strain used in the attacks, but, because
of limitations in the bureau's testing methods and Dr Ivins's failure
to provide the sample in the format requested, the FBI did not
realize that it was a correct match until 3 years later.

In addition, people who were briefed by the FBI said a batch of
misprinted envelopes used in the anthrax attacks -- another piece of
evidence used to link Dr Ivins to the attacks -- could have been much
more widely available than bureau officials had initially led them to believe.

[The FBI is due to have an open press conference today [Mon 18 Aug
2008]. However it seems as though much of their ancillary supportive
evidence is falling away.

In that context Ivins was prescribed Celexa (citalopram) for his
depression. Antidepressants have side effects, which can make the
situation dramatically worse. For a discussion on this see
