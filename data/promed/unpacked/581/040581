Egypt began slaughtering the roughly 300 000 pigs in the country
Wednesday [29 Apr 2009] as a precautionary measure against the spread
of swine flu, even though no cases have been reported here yet, the
Health Ministry said.

The move immediately provoked resistance from pig farmers. At one
large pig farming center just north of Cairo, farmers refused to
cooperate with Health Ministry workers who came to slaughter the
animals, and the workers left without carrying out the government
order.

"It has been decided to immediately start slaughtering all the pigs
in Egypt using the full capacity of the country's slaughterhouses,"
Health Minister Hatem el-Gabaly told reporters after a Cabinet
meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.

Egypt's overwhelmingly Muslim population does not eat pork due to
religious restrictions. But the animals are raised and consumed by
the Christian minority, which some estimates put at 10 percent of the
population.

Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman estimated there were between
300 000-350 000 pigs in Egypt.

Agriculture Minister Amin Abaza told reporters that farmers would be
allowed to sell the pork meat, so there would be no need for
compensation.

In 2008, following fears over diseases spread by animals, Mubarak
ordered all pig and chicken farms moved out of population areas. But
the order was never implemented.

Pigs can be found in many places around the Muslim world, often
raised by religious minorities who can eat pork. But they are banned
entirely in some Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Libya.

In Jordan, the government decided Wednesday [29 Apr 2009] to shut
down the country's 5 pig farms, involving 800 animals, for violating
public health safety regulations.

[The decision of the Egyptian authorities to cull the country's
entire pig population, apparently as a prevention measure of the
so-called "swine flu" A (H1N1) influenza in humans, is highly
exceptional and rather controversial. It will be interesting to
obtain information about the logic and arguments behind such an
extreme decision. Has it been influenced by the accumulated Egyptian
experience in handling H5N1 avian influenza, which has caused already
68 confirmed human cases (and 25 fatalities) there, Egypt becoming
the world's 3rd most affected country (following Indonesia and Viet
Nam)? Are there any data on the role played by backyard pigs in the
epidemiology of avian influenza in Egypt that we are not aware of?

In this context, it is interesting to note that the Japanese daily
Yomiuri Shimbun published, on Wed 29 Apr 2009, the findings of the
Center for Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, Kobe University,
Japan, according to which, 52 out of 402 pigs tested in 4 Indonesian
states were found infected by an H5N1 virus strain (thanks to
Kunihiko Iizuka for translating and submitting the said article,
available in Japanese at
<http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20090429-OYT1T00073.htm>).
In fact, this information has already been covered in posting
20090403.1289, which cited the original paper, Takano R, Nidom CA,
Kiso M, et al: A comparison of the pathogenicity of avian and swine
H5N1 influenza viruses in Indonesia. Arch Virol 2009 (early online
publication 14 Mar 2009; abstract available at
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/x28968q677027254/?p=63832bf7dd6f48b59a02cfeb644f01ea&pi=14>).

The authors report that they found H5N1 infections in pigs in
Indonesia in 2005, 2006, and 2007. They determined that the swine
viruses were closely related to viruses in chickens found nearby,
indicating H5N1 spread from chickens to pigs at least 3 different
times. Subscribers are referred to further details and to Mod.CP's
commentary at the said posting. - Mod.AS]
