The major city of Guangzhou in southern China closes its live poultry markets on Saturday [16 Feb 2014] for 2 weeks to halt the spread of the H7N9 strain of bird flu.

The closure lasts through 28 Feb 2014 "to strengthen work to control the spread of the H7N9 flu," the city government said in a one-sentence announcement on its microblog account.

Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, one of the hardest-hit areas in China's latest bird flu outbreak. Some 65 cases and 13 deaths have been reported by the provincial health bureau. The latest was a 78-year-old man who died 14 Feb 2014 in Guangzhou.

The virus is hard to catch and most cases have been linked to contact with poultry.

Nationwide, there have been at least 32 deaths, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The health ministry said 127 cases were reported nationwide in January [2014].

One market in Guangzhou, Jiangcun, is one of China's busiest, with more than 60 000 birds per day sold there last year [2013], according to Xinhua.

The market closures add to disease-control measures that have included the mass slaughter of chickens and other poultry on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong.

Shanghai in China's east imposed a 3-month moratorium on live poultry sales in January [2014]. Zhejiang province south of Shanghai has suspended poultry trading. Also in January, Hong Kong suspended sales of live poultry and imports from the mainland.

The World Health Organization says there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission but has recommended close monitoring due to the unpredictable behavior of flu viruses.

Avian unfluenza A H10N8
---------------------------------
In January [2014], authorities confirmed a 2nd human case of H10N8, a separate bird flu strain known to affect humans. In the 1st case, a 73-year-old woman died in December [2013]. [A 3rd case, in east China's Jiangxi province, has been reported in ProMED-mail post 20140214.2277024].

Chinese live poultry suppliers are losing more than 1 billion yuan (USD 150 million) per month, Xinhua said, citing Chen Yingfeng, president of the Guangdong Poultry Industry Association.

[On 12 Feb 2014, Hong Kong confirmed a new human case of A/H7N9 avian flu, the 5th to be discovered in the city. The 65-year-old hospitalised on Tue 11 Feb 2014 and in critical condition, was an "imported case": he had travelled to the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong from 24 Jan to 9 Feb 2014, and had purchased a slaughtered chicken in the village near his residence. Hong Kong has applied severe measures to prevent the introduction of the agent from the mainland, including requirement for tests in bird consignments prior to their import.

Since its start in early 2013 and as of 14 Feb 2014, the LPAI H7N9 epidemic has reportedly caused, in eastern China, 338 cases of human disease, of which 66 died. The source of infection, by the aerogenic route, is suspected to be poultry (mainly sub-clinically infected chickens). So far, no infection has been demonstrated on poultry farms and the control efforts are concentrated on live bird markets. The closure of live bird markets is meant to protect public health; will it prevent the circulation of the virus in birds? Serological tests on poultry farms may be required to elucidate the definite epidemiology of this virus.

The source of infection of the 3 human cases caused by another avian influenza virus, namely A/H10N8, is yet to be investigated. H10 viruses are regarded to always be of low pathogenicity in avians. - Mod.AS
