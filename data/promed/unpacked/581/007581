Two weeks ago [on 14 Oct 2015], the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan received a serum sample collected from a heifer which had aborted during the 3rd semester of pregnancy. The serum was found to be brucellosis positive by the applied complement and agglutination tests. On 26 Oct 2015, _Brucella melitensis_ was isolated from the placenta of the said heifer and identified as field strain biotype 1.

In view of these findings, the herd was put under quarantine. During the following 2 days, milk samples were collected for the milk ring test (MRT): this included a pooled bulk milk sample from the milk tank and individual samples from all lactating cows (in 52 batches). The bulk milk sample and 24 out of the 52 batches were found positive by the MRT. The marketing of milk from the plant was banned.

During the same and the following day, blood samples were collected from all lactating cows as well as from pregnant heifers and non-lactating ("dry") cows. A total of 135 of them were found positive by the complement fixation test [CFT] and subsequently separated, put to sleep, transported to the country's central animal/animal products destruction plant in Ein Hamifratz, and incinerated.

The plant is being maintained under quarantine and will be retested (blood and milk) to enable eventually recovering its freedom from brucellosis status. The milk produced by the CFT-negative animals is allowed transportation to a prescribed, selected dairy factory where it undergoes an enhanced pasteurization process in line with the Ministry of Health requirements and under its supervision.

The veterinary services call upon all cattle holders/breeders who have purchased, during the recent 6 months, animals from Kibbutz Revivim to contact their respective district veterinary offices in order to obtain the required guidance and instructions.

[The above communication does not provide the total numbers of cows (lactating and dry) and of heifers and other bovines in the affected plant. According to a previous posting (20151031.3757610), the number of cows in lactation is 1300. It may be assumed that the total number of animals on the infected premises includes several hundreds more. This plant, in Kibbutz Revivim (map at http://tinyurl.com/pgxlcye), is one of the largest and most advanced dairy operations in Israel. During the years 1999-2007, Israel's dairy cattle industry underwent a successful reform, during which the total number of dairy farms was reduced from 1453 to 1010, more than a 30 percent reduction, accompanied by upgraded sanitary and operational conditions. The Revivim plant tripled its size and united with 2 other farms, which moved their cows to a common, newly built facility in Revivim. This process was accomplished in 2006. For additional information on the reform, see http://www.milk.org.il/info/env/docs/english.pdf.

A previous statement, which said that the attending veterinary practitioner in Revivimon was infected, has since been denied. At present, no human cases related to the event are known to have occurred; it would be interesting to note whether the vet and the personnel of this farm have been serologically tested. Hopefully, no raw milk from the plant has been marketed or consumed. Although this is prohibited in Israel, exceptions may have (and have) occurred elsewhere and in the past; clinical cases of Malta fever among the personnel of infected dairy operations were recorded in several similar events. On at least one occasion, the entire bovine population of the (large) farm had to be culled.

Vaccination of female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine has been compulsorily applied in Israel for decades; this vaccination was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014. It would be interesting to check, during the current event, whether there is a difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals concerning their infection and their respective shedding of the pathogen in milk.

In a previous posting, the significance/value of the milk ring test (MRT) when performed in a single (and thus diluted) sample from the (bulk) milk tank of large dairy operations was questioned (see 20151102.3760110). In the current case, the 1300 lactating cows were reportedly sampled individually, with the samples divided into 52 batches, allowing MRT testing to be performed effectively. Notably, the single bulk sample was, reportedly, found positive as well. This deserves explanation.

As we noted, the application of periodic MRT in Israel's dairy farms was discontinued altogether on 1 Mar 2015. In the relevant notification, dated 26 Feb 2015 and distributed 5 Mar 2015 (in Hebrew; available at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/A51D5662-DB7D-4D6D-AAD4-F1FA700DA379/0/mivhan__mrt.pdf), it was stated that this decision, obtained following a risk assessment, would be subject to evaluation/review every 2 years or when there is a new brucellosis outbreak on a dairy farm.

How long the pathogen has been circulating within the affected herd is not known at present. Is the 6-month period in relation to past purchases of animals from the affected farm related to the date of the last MRT performed in this plant? - Mod.AS
