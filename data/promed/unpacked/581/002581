At the start of the new millennium, it looked like syphilis might become a thing of the past.

The sexually transmitted infection, thought to be eradicated because of penicillin and safe sex education campaigns, has been making a comeback, though, and Lehigh Valley public health officials are becoming increasingly concerned.

Allentown had 76 confirmed cases of syphilis last year [2021] -- a 65% increase from 2018â€²s 46 confirmed cases, which concerned health officials at the time. Last year's cases were spread throughout the city, according to a news release from the Allentown Health Bureau.

Syphilis cases have steadily become more prevalent in Pennsylvania over the last two decades, data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health states. In 2003, there were 159 confirmed cases but in 2019, that number jumped to almost 1,000. Cases have also ballooned across the United States during the same time-frame.

In 2021, Planned Parenthood Keystone [Pennsylvania] had more syphilis cases than in all three prior years -- an increase of about 158%, Samantha Bobila, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Keystone said.

[Officials in the nearby Pennsylvania city of] Bethlehem are concerned about syphilis, too. Kristen Wenrich, director of the Bethlehem Health Bureau, said officials saw an increase in cases in 2019 and it has remained steady since then; 21 cases were reported in both 2020 and '21. It's a significant increase from the seven cases reported in 2016 in the city. Wenrich said a majority of these cases are in men who have sex with other men but the health bureau is also seeing a rise of infected pregnant women. Syphilis, like HIV, can be transferred by a pregnant mother to her child.

[An increase in incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, reported above in Allentown, a city in eastern part of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, has also been reported nationally (see also's below), as well as other urban areas in this state.

Although Pennsylvania overall reported only a small 2.5% increase in P&S syphilis in 2020, from 522 cases in 2019 to 535 (https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/HAN/2021-590-8-23-ADV-GonorrheaSyphillis.pdf), this number of cases of P&S syphilis in 2020 was the highest in about 30 years. These numbers exclude Philadelphia, a city in the southeastern part of the state.

While cases in Pennsylvania increased by just 2.5% in 2020, officials in Allegheny County (which includes the city of Pittsburgh) in the southwestern part of the state reported a 97% rise in P&S syphilis in 2020, with 71 cases in 2019 to 140 syphilis cases in 2020 (https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2021-09-06/syphilis-on-the-rise-in-allegheny-county).

Then, during the first half of 2021, Delaware County in southeastern Pennsylvania bordering Philadelphia, reported 104 cases of early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis), which exceeded the total number of early syphilis in all of 2020, and women were projected to report 50 cases of early syphilis by the end of 2021, which would represent a 178 percent increase over the 18 cases reported in 2020; in particular, women of child-bearing age represented 84 percent of the cases (https://patch.com/pennsylvania/across-pa/syphilis-cases-rise-eastern-pa-officials-warn).

P&S syphilis in Philadelphia had begun to increase in about 2011, initially among men who have sex with men; but around 2018, Philadelphia began to see an increase in syphilis also in women; this increase was noted to have occurred coincident with increases in illicit injection drug use (https://www.witf.org/2021/11/08/rates-of-syphilis-passed-onto-infants-are-the-highest-pennsylvania-cities-have-seen-in-decades/).

In Nov 2021, Philadelphia recorded 9 cases of congenital syphilis, the highest number of cases recorded in more than 20 years, up from 6 total in each of the prior two years (2019 and 2020) (https://www.witf.org/2021/11/08/rates-of-syphilis-passed-onto-infants-are-the-highest-pennsylvania-cities-have-seen-in-decades/).

Allentown is the largest of three adjacent cities (Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton) in Lehigh and Northampton counties that join with Carbon County to make up the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Allentown (pop., 125 845 residents in 2020) is the third-largest city in population in Pennsylvania, behind Philadelphia (pop., 1.6 million residents in 2020) in the southeastern and Pittsburgh (pop., 302 971 residents in 2020) in the southwestern part of the state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown,_Pennsylvania). Allentown is approximately 55mi (89 km) north of Philadelphia. Delaware County (pop., 566 747 residents in 2020) is located immediately southwest of Philadelphia.
