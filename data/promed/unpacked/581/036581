Migratory birds do not cause bird flu: experts
----------------------------------------------
Migratory birds cannot be declared responsible for the outbreak of
bird flu in any part of the world, including Pakistan, as recent
foreign scientific studies revealed that there is no solid evidence,
which shows correlation between migratory birds and bird flu in any
part of the world.

The FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation] collected samples from
300 000 to 350 000 wild birds across the world. None of these were
found H5N1 positive. After a comprehensive critical review of recent
scientific literature it has been concluded that poultry trade,
rather bird migration, is the main mechanism of global dispersal of
the virus. Talking to The Nation, wildlife expert and coordinator
Natural Resources Management Rabnawaz on Sunday [16 Nov 2008] said
that such migratory birds (more than 150 bird species) come from
Russia and Africa during November and December, and return in
February and March.

"After the last outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza and
the subsequent allegations that migratory birds are responsible for
the spread of the disease to local poultry farms, WWF [World Wildlife
Fund] Pakistan showed its concerns that such statements could have
serious repercussions against wild bird populations and their
habitats. Such statements may prompt mass culling of wild birds and
seriously endanger the efforts of conservation organisations and
relevant government departments. Since the last outbreak in Sindh,
WWF Pakistan has been in close contact with Bird Life International,
the world's authority on birds, which has already carried out
significant research and literature review on the role of wild birds,
including migratory species in the spread of HPAI [highly pathogenic
avian influenza] H5N1."

"I would like to highlight some of the scientific facts that though
there is some evidence to back the case that migratory wild birds can
spread the H5N1 virus, they are not the main source of the virus
spread. Sampling of 5000 water birds after the outbreak in Nigeria
during 2006 found no traces of the virus (AIWEB) [Avian Influenza,
Wildlife and the Environment web]. Mapping of the outbreaks across
the world have shown that they follow trade routes of poultry rather
than migratory flyway of wild birds. After a critical review of
recent scientific literature it has been concluded that poultry
trade, rather than bird migration, is the main mechanism of global
dispersal of the virus," he added.

Rabnawaz said that the widespread illegal trade of cage birds had
transported H5N1 infected birds over large distances. The most likely
source of infection in cage birds is at animal 'wet' markets in Asia,
where domestic and wild-caught birds were kept in close proximity,
posing a high-risk of cross-contamination. There was a healthy bird
trade in the cities of Pakistan and yet there had been no study to
determine whether this was a factor in the spread of the disease or
not. "Avian influenza viruses are readily transmitted from farm to
farm by the movement of live birds, people (especially when shoes and
other clothing are contaminated), and contaminated vehicles,
equipment, feed, and cages. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for
long periods in the environment, especially when temperatures are
low. For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can survive in
bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperature (4 deg C/39.2 deg
F). At a much higher temperature (37 deg C/98.6 deg F), H5N1 viruses
[have been shown to] survive, in fecal samples for 6 days (WHO/World
Health Organisation)."

Media should play a responsible role in the dissemination of
information based on facts and scientific research, especially
pertaining to the role of wild migratory birds in spreading the H5N1
disease. The disease spreads through the faces, tears, nasal
[secretions], saliva, or droppings of sick birds or chickens and
their contaminated features, he urged. It is pertinent to mention
here that the risk of the spread of bird flu, which is a highly
contagious viral disease, has been overestimated in the metropolis
especially by the media.

Keeping this information in mind WWF Pakistan calls for the following
actions and approaches to be adopted in the best interest of the
environment and the poultry industry that is being directly affected:

1. Media should play a responsible role in the dissemination of
information based on facts and scientific research, especially to
that pertaining to the role of wild migratory birds in spreading the
H5N1 disease;
2. Relevant academia should work alongside the concerned government
departments to test for the H5N1 strain in wild birds and caged birds
traded in the major cities of Pakistan;
3. Relevant authorities should establish a mechanism to monitor any
suspicious mortality of bird species in the wild;
4. All government departments, private, and public sectors should
share information and data related to the outbreak of avian influenza
freely and transparently;
5. Help in mobilisation of resources of surveillance;
6. Vaccination of birds housed in zoos;
7. Humane culling of birds should be adopted in case of an outbreak
and proper disposal;
8. It should be made mandatory for poultry to have a tracking number,
because once they are in shops, they cannot be tracked back to a poultry farm;
9. Strict hygiene and bio-security measures at poultry farms and zoos
are needed. People and vehicle coming into these places should be
disinfected, caretakers should meticulously clean utensils and of
course their hands and feet. The main risks of virus entry are:
bringing in live birds, bringing in objects such as animal and bird
cages or feed that have been contaminated by birds, bringing in dirty
(faeces contaminated) footwear, vehicles, clothing, that has recently
passed through animal markets or chicken or duck farms.

In conclusion, WWF Pakistan does not support any mass culling of wild
birds or the destruction of their habitats. On the contrary, WWF
Pakistan advises that wild birds and their associated habitats be
left undisturbed so that wild birds can inhabit them in safety and
not seek out refuges near human settlements, therefore not coming
into contact with the virus.
