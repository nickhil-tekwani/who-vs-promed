The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) received notification yesterday [Sat 1 Feb 2014] of 2 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhejiang from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). The 2 cases involve 2 men aged 54 and 80. They are now hospitalised for treatment.

As of yesterday [Sat 1 Feb 2014], a total of 275 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland, including Zhejiang (113 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Jiangsu (36 cases), Guangdong (43 cases), Fujian (16 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Hunan (4 cases), Beijing (3 cases), Shandong (2 cases), Hebei (one case), Guizhou (one case, imported from Zhejiang), and Guangxi (one case).

Additionally, the CHP received notification of a confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Guangxi from the NHFPC. The patient is a 75-year-old man who had poultry exposure. He was admitted to a hospital for severe pneumonia on 29 Jan 2014. His specimen tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) virus by the relevant Guangxi health authorities. He is currently in critical condition.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said. "In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong and multiple cases reported in the mainland, the activity of the virus is expected to be higher in the winter season.

Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged. "All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding. The spokesman advised travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:

* Do not visit live poultry markets. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region reported a human case of H7N9 on Sunday [2 Feb 2014], its 1st this year [2014].

The patient is a 75-year-old man from the city of Liuzhou. He is in critical condition, the regional health department said in a statement. The man had been in contact with live poultry before he fell sick on 27 Jan 2014, the department said. Medical workers have disinfected his home and neighborhood, while 16 people who had close contact with him are under observation. Local health authorities are investigating the source of the infection. They will not rule out the possibility of suspending live poultry trading. It is the 2nd case in Guangxi since 2009.

China has reported more than 100 human H7N9 cases, including over 20 deaths, this year [2014], with Zhejiang and Guangdong most affected.

Health authorities have strengthened H7N9 prevention and control measures including the closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities.

[Both the H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza viruses are circulating in mainland China at the present time but retaining their characteristic features. H5N1 avian influenza virus remains dispersed, although potentially transmissible from person to person. In contrast, the H7N9 virus is more abundant although still without the potential to spread from person to person. There is no indication yet that the H7N9 outbreak is in decline. - Mod.CP
