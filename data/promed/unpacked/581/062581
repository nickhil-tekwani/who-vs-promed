At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog prices for February delivery closed
0.475 cent higher at 37.200 cents a pound, while February pork bellies rose
0.325 cent to 49.225 cents a pound.
On Friday, while visiting Iowa, the top-hog producing state, Vice President
Al Gore, said the government would give distressed pork farmers $50 million
in direct cash payments and another $80 million in compensation for some 1.7
million hogs to be destroyed to eradicate the swine disease pseudorabies.

[Pseudorabies is also known as Aujeszky's disease, Mad itch, and Infectious
bulbar paralysis. It is an acute viral infection of the central nervous
system of nearly all subhuman mammals, although it is primarily associated
with swine. The virus affects the central nervous system and can cause a
variety of clinical signs, including convulsions and persistent pruritus
(itching). This has resulted in the pigs appearing to "go mad" in attempts
to relieve the intense itching. Consequently the common name of the virus is
Mad itch. Animals with rabies have been said to be "mad", thus, this virus
became known as Pseudo or false rabies based upon the activity of the
affected animals. The disease in species other than swine is almost
invariably fatal and is often marked by the same intense pruritis. The virus
has been found in several species of non-human primates. Human infection is
possible, but the records before 1970 are unclear - Mod.TG
