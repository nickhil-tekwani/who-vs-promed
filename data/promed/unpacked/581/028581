Second bovine TB case detected in Emmet County
----------------------------------------------
The Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) is holding an meeting for
Emmet County cow producers, after the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) classified a farm as being infected with bovine
tuberculosis (TB). Previous routine bovine TB surveillance testing
conducted by the MDA found a bovine TB positive herd in Emmet County in
March 2010. During the depopulation of the herd, a breeding bull was found
to be infected. During MDA's outbreak investigation of the herd it was
discovered the bull was leased to another producer in Emmet County.

On 13 Aug 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
classified the farm as being infected with bovine TB. This is the 2nd
infected herd in Northern Lower Michigan's Modified Accredited Advanced
Zone (MAAZ). The meeting for Emmet County producers is scheduled for Thu 16
Sep 2010 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the West Traverse Township Hall at
8001 M-119 in Harbor Springs. At this meeting, Dr James Averill (MDA's
bovine TB project coordinator) will discuss herd investigation, impact to
producers and the community, and answer questions.

"We have tested or scheduled all the cattle herds within a 10 mile [16 km]
radius circle around the positive herd that was identified last March
[2010], and they have been negative so far," said Dr Averill. "The trace
investigation is almost complete and only this herd was found to be exposed
to a lesioned animal. With this additional herd designation, the status of
the MAAZ is a concern as 4 positive cattle herds in a year may cause a drop
in our status. We've tested 67 farms in the special surveillance circle test."

On 4 Jan 2010, MDA, in coordination with USDA, expanded the MAAZ to include
Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, and Otsego counties. The
goal is to return bovine TB Free status to the entire state and testing is
an effective way to prevent bovine TB from spreading to other herds. MDA is
working to move a majority of the MAAZ to TB Free status while maintaining
MAAZ status for the above listed counties along with Presque Isle County.

"With the continued presence of bovine TB in the wild white-tailed deer
population in Northern Lower Michigan, Emmet County herd producers need to
utilize wildlife risk mitigation systems to protect their investments,"
said Averill. "As a reminder, producers should use such tools as disease
control permits, fencing, and sound livestock management practices to
reduce the risk of disease."

While infection can occur by nose-to-nose direct contact, infection is much
more likely to occur through indirect transmission through contaminated
feed. Beef and dairy farmers can decrease the risk of exposing their cattle
to bovine TB by limiting cattle-to-deer contact and protecting cattle feed
from deer.

This Emmet County herd is the 4th TB affected herd identified in Michigan
in 2010 -- a beef herd in Alcona County, and another in Alpena County are
in the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ) where the disease is most prevalent.
The current bovine TB eradication effort began in 1998, and all of
Michigan's one million cattle were tested by the end of 2003. Testing
continues in the state for movement from one farm to another. Since 1998,
MDA and USDA have detected 50 cattle herds and 4 privately owned cervid
operations. These premises either have been depopulated or the herds were
quarantined and placed under a test-and-remove program.

[ProMED-mail post 20100325.0948 contains comments from Dr James Averill the
MDA bovine TB coordinator:

"If we test all the cattle herds within a 10-mile radius circle around the
positive herd, and they are negative, the status of the MAAZ will not be
impacted, as there would have to be at least 3 positive cattle herds in the
zone in a year, for the status to drop," said Dr James Averill, MDA's
bovine TB project coordinator.

Sadly these addition infected herds could affect the Modified Accredited
Advance Zone's status and may drop the status to Modified Accredited, which
would mean the entire state is in the same zone. A drop in status could
mean more testing for the state, and more testing for producers wishing to
move their animals. A map of the split state status may be found at
