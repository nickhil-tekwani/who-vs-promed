[Due to the expanding number of Strep. cases globally, we have elected to consolidate all reports into a single thread moving forward rather than try to maintain the previous regional case threads. As such, this thread begins as 1 with the See Also list below reflecting the other reports that have been published in 2022. - Mod.JH]

At least 2 children in the U.S. and 15 in the U.K. have died from infections with _Streptococcus A_, a bacterium that normally causes mild disease but can be extremely dangerous when it invades tissues outside of where it normally resides.

Hospitals in several states -- Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and Washington -- have told NBC News that they are seeing higher numbers of invasive Group A strep than is typical. In Colorado, the invasive disease has led to the deaths of 2 children since November [2022]. The last _Streptococcus A_ deaths in the state were in 2018. The increasing reports of invasive disease have spurred the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to mount an investigation.

Each year, several million Americans contract Group A strep, but only a small fraction -- 14 000 to 25 000 -- develop invasive disease with 1200 to 2500 dying from it. Most at risk are children and older adults. This year [2022], one hospital in Texas has already seen a 4-fold rise in cases of invasive Group A strep, NBC News reported. Since [1 Nov 2022], the Denver Health Department has reported 11 cases -- much higher than its typical rate of about one to 2 a month. All 11 kids were between 10 months and 6 years old. The 2 children who died were too young to go to school.

There are several hundred strains of Group A strep, and it's possible that "a particularly nasty strain" has become more prominent in the parts of the country reporting increases, Green says, adding that until all the information on the strains from those places has been analyzed we won't know. [Dr. Michael Green is the medical director of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and a professor of pediatrics and surgery at the University of Pittsburgh.]

Unlike COVID-19, where one variant can become dominant, "different areas of the country can have different strains of Group A in circulation," Green says. "You can have a nasty Group A strep in Ohio, but not in Pittsburgh. But you worry that it might get here from people who are traveling."

Green says the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh has not seen a bump in the number of cases this year [2022] as compared to those from 2014 to 2017, but there may be an increase in the severity of this year's cases.

It's likely that the rise in cases in some locations is tied to the increase in viral illnesses -- the flu, RSV, and possibly COVID-19, Green says. Viruses like the flu can damage the small airways and make them more vulnerable to bacterial infections, he explains. "Whenever we see a huge amount of respiratory viruses, we know we are going to see a bump up in bacterial infections," Green says.

A factor that has confused the issue is that viruses such as RSV and influenza have sparked early this year [2022], says Dr. Jason Zucker, an assistant professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. "We're seeing a lot of things in different seasons this year [2022] than we normally would," Zucker tells TODAY.com. "So it's not clear if there's a change in the epidemiological pattern."

Currently, there doesn't seem to be an increase in invasive Group A strep in New York City hospitals, Dr. Ethan Wiener, chief of emergency medicine at NYU Langone Health Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, tells TODAY.com. "In speaking to people locally, there have been only sporadic cases that I am aware of."

Because a viral infection can make a bacterial infection more likely, parents of kids who recently had a viral illness should be vigilant about possible Group A strep infections, Dr. Ishminder Kaur, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the UCLA, David Geffen School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com.

Early signs of necrotizing fasciitis, which, per the CDC, include: a red, warm or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly; severe pain, including pain beyond the area of the skin that is red, warm, or swollen; fever. Later-stage signs are: ulcers, blisters, or black spots on the skin; changes in the color of the skin; pus or oozing from the infected area; dizziness; fatigue; diarrhea or nausea.

Early signs of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which, per the CDC, include: fever and chills, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting. Later signs, which usually develop 24 to 48 hours after the first symptoms, include low blood pressure; faster than normal heart rate; rapid breathing; signs of organ failure, such as inability to produce urine or yellowing eyes.

While both necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome are rare, their symptoms can get worse quickly. So, in light of the strep A investigation, the CDC is urging parents to know the symptoms of both diseases and seek medical care quickly if they think their child has either.

Parents should also contact a healthcare provider right away if their child develops new or worsening symptoms during a viral infection, the Colorado health department advised.

The CDC is also urging parents to make sure their children get chickenpox vaccines and flu shots, as a strep A infection can be a complication of both viruses. Group A strep infections had been going down since 1995, when the chickenpox vaccine became available, Wiener says. Some children might need 2 flu shots this year, and it's not too late in the season to get them, TODAY.com previously reported.

There has been a major increase in the past month in the number of invasive group A _Streptococcus_ infections in Montreal, and 2 children have died. Montreal public health officials issued a warning to doctors on Friday [16 Dec 2022] to be extremely vigilant regarding invasive group A _Streptococcus_ infections following the death of 2 Montreal children from the illness in recent weeks.

There have been 4 cases of kids age 2 and under with the contagious bacterial infection since mid-November [2022] and 2 of the children died. This is a major increase in the number of strep cases in Montreal. For the same period from 2017 to 2021, there were between zero and one case among children in Montreal. This comes at a time when 5 European countries -- France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom -- have reported significant increases in cases, according to the World Health Organization.

"It's part of a global epidemiological trend that we're seeing," said Genevi√®ve Bergeron, who is the medical chief for communicable diseases for Montreal public health. "A number of European countries are also reporting an increase and it's not clear exactly what is causing this. The current hypothesis has to do with increased transmission after the pandemic period. So a little bit of catching up for children who have not been exposed to this bacterium up to now and also potentially a relationship with the early flu season we're seeing, given the relationship between influenza (flu) and group A strep."

The usual risk factors are being immuno-suppressed, being elderly or recently having the flu or varicella (chickenpox). Bergeron notes it's important to differentiate between benign and more severe group A strep. In the benign form, you have things like strep throat and scarlet fever. The more severe forms exhibit pneumonia, respiratory symptoms, meningitis, high fever and muscle aches. Bergeron said a key way for parents to protect their children is to make sure they're vaccinated for the flu and varicella.

Earl Rubin, division director for paediatric infectious diseases at the Montreal Children's Hospital, was involved with the treatment of 2 of the 4 cases of invasive group A strep. Both children survived the illness. "When it's a serious case, it's very worrisome," Rubin said. "Here, you have the death of 2 kids in the last month. There's nothing benign about that, and the other ones are kids who are sick, but who will survive."

Rubin noted the illness can cause toxic shock syndrome and flesh-eating disease. Most of the cases follow the person having the flu or another viral illness, "and that allows the bacteria sitting in the nose or throat to invade into the bloodstream and go throughout the body," Rubin said. "It's likely related to the increased viral season that we're seeing. The 2 kids who died, I understand it was following a flu-like illness." Rubin said the upswing in flu is likely because of people returning to pre-pandemic behaviours. "Perhaps it can go along the same lines now that there is no masking and no distancing and everybody is business as usual ... strep is transmissible from person to person, so the more people in contact, the greater the chance of that transmission. The reason why some have the invasive disease starts with that flu-like illness."

[Fatal invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections (e.g., bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) are being reported in the USA, Canada, the UK and the EU in the midst of increasing cases of localized GAS infections (e.g., pharyngitis, scarlet fever) mainly in children in these countries.

Group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) commonly causes scarlet fever, pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections (impetigo, cellulitis), but can also cause invasive infections (iGAS), including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in schools and in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak.

ProMED has posted several reports of outbreaks of invasive GAS infection (iGAS) in the past in the UK and in Canada among homeless people and people who inject drugs, due to particular emm types (see the See Also section below). There is a current outbreak in the UK of iGAS (see Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918; Streptococcus, group A - UK (03): scarlet fever, iGAS, fatal, RFI 20221209.8707158; and Streptococcus, group A - UK (02): (England) children, fatal, RFI 20221206.8707105), in Spain (see ProMED post Streptococcus, group A - Spain: (MD) invasive, children, fatal, RFI 20221210.8707189), and the USA (Streptococcus, group A - USA: (MN) invasive, children, elderly, RFI 20221212.8707237). Molecular emm typing would be important to document the relatedness of the outbreaks in the USA, Canada, Spain, and the UK.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates.

More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
