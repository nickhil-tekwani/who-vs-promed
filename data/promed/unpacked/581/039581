Since 20 Jun 2006 the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Laboratory of Enteric
Pathogens (LEP) has received and provisionally confirmed 75 non
travel-associated human cases of fully sensitive _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Ajiobo infection in residents of England and Wales. This compares
with an average of 7 cases reported a year from 1990 to 2005.
Cases range from 2 to 81 years of age (median 40 years) and 63 percent are
female. Cases are distributed across all NHS regions in England and in
Wales, with the greatest concentration of cases in London (43 percent) and
the southeast of England (20 percent) (figure 1). Available onset dates
(N=30) range from 12 to 22 June 2006 and suggest a continuous source
outbreak (figure 2) [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL].
Historically the LEP has confirmed the contamination of certain food items
with _S._ Ajiobo. The organism was isolated from dried Ugu leaves in 2005
and has also been identified in isolates from cattle, and a reptile.
Information from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency has also suggested an
association with badger and fox feces.
The HPA is continuing its epidemiological and microbiological investigation
into this increase. Hospital microbiologists are requested to refer
putative _S._ Ajiobo isolates to the LEP for confirmation and subtyping.
_S._ Ajiobo is a group G1 and G2 salmonella with the antigenic structure
13, 23: z4, z23.

this uncommon subtype of salmonella has not yet been determined.
