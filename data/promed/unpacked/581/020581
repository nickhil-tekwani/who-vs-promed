Bluetongue demonstrated in midges
-----------------------------------------
The Central Institute for Animal Disease Control [CIDC] has demonstrated
the bluetongue virus [BTV] in midges trapped in Limburg.
According to CIDC, it can be determined with a high degree of certainty
that the midge involved in the spread of BTV in the Netherlands is
_Culicoides obsoletus_, subspecies Dewulfi.
The midges were trapped in Limburg by the entomology research group of the
Wageningen University and Research Centre cooperatively with Italian
entomologists of the IZS Caporale Institute [Teramo]. The Netherlands
cooperates with the Italian researchers due to their experience regarding
_Culicoides_ and bluetongue.

[The expansion of BTV into and its spread within areas where _Culicoides
imicola_, its traditional vector, is rare or absent is explained by the
involvement of novel vector species. Two widespread and abundant palearctic
species groups, namely the _C. obsoletus_ and _C. pulicaris_ groups, have
been shown to comprise large proportions of trapped _Culicoides_
populations in such areas in southern Europe, and BTV has been isolated
from wild-caught individuals of both groups during the recent outbreaks.
The role of these groups in the transmission of BTV is of real concern, as
they are common and widespread across the whole of central and northern
Europe; experimentally, the prevalence of infection in the most susceptible
populations of both the _C. obsoletus_ and _C. pulicaris_ complexes was
recently found to be comparable with that of _C. imicola_ when using the
same virus and (recently described) feeding technique (ref. 1).
The identification of _C. obsoletus_, subspecies Dewulfi, by the Dutch and
Italian groups as a vector of the BTV in northwestern Europe is of
significance. This subspecies, the taxonomy of which seems still subject to
discussions (see Ref. 2), has been mentioned as abundant in central Italy
during the BT outbreak there, between July and September 2002 (Ref 3).
Previously, _C. Dewulfi_ had been described (ref. 4) as one of the main
_Culicoides_ species causing sweet itch in horses in Ireland. This finding
might be indicative of its potential as vector of another orbivirus
disease, namely African horse sickness, should viremic equines reach
Europe, including northern regions.
The origin of BTV-8 in northwestern Europe remains yet to be explained; its
extensive spread, following its introduction, begins to be unveiled.
For further reading on the recent developments of bluetongue in Europe,
subscribers might consider referring to the extensive, richly referenced
review by Purse et al (ref. 5), which includes useful maps on _Culicoides_
distribution. In view of the current spread of BTV-8 into and within
northwestern Europe, updates are anticipated.
