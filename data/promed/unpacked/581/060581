Rats may transmit hepatitis E virus in US
-----------------------------------------
NEW YORK: Rats roaming the streets of some United States cities appear to
be infected with a virus that is similar to the human hepatitis E virus
(HEV), California researchers report. The investigators believe that rats
might be the elusive source of this disease among urban residents who show
signs of past exposure. In general, infection with HEV is not life
threatening and lasts for one to 4 weeks. Other types of liver-infecting
viruses, including hepatitis B and C viruses, can linger in the body for
years and cause serious damage to the liver. HEV is relatively common in
central Asia, but it is rare in the US and other developed nations.
"Although (full-blown) HEV [infection is very, very rare in the US,
there's a fair amount of antibodies for the disease among the derelict,
inner city population and this research suggests that rats may be a
source," said study co-author Robert Purcell, head of the Hepatitis Viruses
Section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A
study of homeless people living in Los Angeles showed that 15 per cent had
antibodies to HEV, which indicates they had been exposed to hepatitis E
virus at some point in the past. "It certainly doesn't prove a connection,
but if you're dealing with someone who's living in a region who might have
contact with wild rats, it's something that doctors have to keep in mind,"
Purcell told Reuters Health.
Purcell and his colleagues worked with public health agencies in Los
Angeles and Orange County, California, as well as in Baltimore and Hawaii
to round up and test 80 rats. After identifying rats with signs of current
HEV infection, the researchers injected several lab rats with sera [blood?
from the wild rats. Three of the lab rats developed signs of infection,
although they have not completely characterized the virus responsible for
the infection, the researchers reported recently at the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting in Atlanta. The next step is to
clarify whether the rat-borne virus can be passed to humans, potentially
through bites, Purcell said. Despite extremely low numbers of HEV cases in
the US, concern about the human virus has been raised in recent years by
antibody screenings that suggest that 1 per cent to 5 per cent of all
healthy American blood donors have been infected.
Purcell pointed out that in many parts of the world the virus has developed
into a long standing and serious problem. The infection can be life
threatening in pregnant women. "HEV has become the single most important
cause of acute clinical hepatitis among adults in much of Central Asia and
South East Asia," he noted. "So although right now you can count American
HEV cases on the fingers of one hand, the virus has risen from the exotic
to the topical."

[Hepatitis E virus is now recognized taxonomically as the type species of
the genus "Hepatitis E-like viruses". Hepatitis E virus (HEV) exhibits
similarity in structure and genome organization with the caliciviruses, and
low amino acid similarity with rubella virus and the alphaviruses of the
family _Togaviridae_, as well as the plat furoviruses. It is unrelated to
the other hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, and G). HEV is associated with
sporadic cases of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. HEV is
considered to be endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia,
Africa, and Central America. Antibody prevalence suggests global
distribution of strains of low pathogenicity. Previous to the above report,
antibodies have been detected in primates and swine to the same or closely
related viruses. - Mod.CP
