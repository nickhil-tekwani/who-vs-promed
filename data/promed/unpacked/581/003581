Important Technical Considerations in Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Fevers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine has forwarded us a plasma sample
from a 47-year-old Belgian woman on Sunday 10 PM [11 Oct 2001. She had
been travelling
in Gambia. The sample was tested positive for Yellow fever virus by RT-PCR
in our laboratory on Monday 4 am. Clinical/epidemiological information will
be provided by Belgian health officials (see: Yellow fever, imported -
Belgium ex Gambia 20011112.2789).
We would like to provide ProMED-mail with the following details concerning
molecular diagnosis, which we consider of importance for similar future cases.
The diagnosis was made by LightCycler RT-PCR with 5Â´-nuclease probe
detection, 95 percent sensitivity limit 1545 copies/ml of plasma. We found
strong PCR-inhibiting activity in the sample, i.e., the material was
negative in all replicates upon initial testing, although the sample
contained a high concentration of viral RNA (see below). PCR-inhibition was
detected because we routinely perform inhibition control reactions for all
samples. Inhibition could be reversed by diluting the sample 1 in 100 prior
to nucleic acid extraction (1 in 10 was not sufficient). The virus was
still detectable at this dilution. Quantitative PCR yielded >10e6 copies
per ml of the undiluted plasma sample. We use the Qiagen Viral RNA Kit for
extraction, a system that is widely used and that is known to be extremely
reliable in the removal of inhibiting substances. The concentration of
inhibiting substances seemed to be extraordinarily high in this case.
Interestingly, we have observed the same inhibition phenomenon in a sample
from a patient with Ebola hemorrhagic fever from Gulu, Uganda. Viral
concentration in this case was 6.9X10e8/ml. In both cases, the patients
were suffering from severe organ manifestation of their disease (AST in
diagnostic sample from Belgium 15000 IU, ALT 6000 IU).
There are 2 important consequences of these observations:
1. False negative PCR results can occur in patients with severe viral
hemorrhagic fevers, because their plasma may contain large amounts of
PCR-inhibitors. These inhibitors can be detected by control reactions with
spiked samples (low copy numbers of control RNA, 1 log10 above detection
limit of the PCR). Inhibition control reactions are mandatory for a safe
diagnosis.
2. When PCR is used for diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers, dilutions of
the test sample should be tested in parallel with the original sample. The
high viral RNA concentration in acute case samples is likely to facilitate
the diagnosis in spite of the dilution factor.
We hope this report will be helpful to other laboratories concerned with
this topic.

Imported case of yellow fever in Belgium - WHO Statement
--------------------------------------------------------
The Belgian Ministry of Health has confirmed a case of yellow fever
imported into Belgium. The patient had returned from a holiday in The
Gambia where she initially became ill. She returned to Belgium on 8
November. Tests on clinical samples performed at the Bernhard Nocht
Institute, Hamburg, Germany, have confirmed the diagnosis. She is currently
stable and receiving treatment in a Belgian hospital. It has been reported
that she had not previously been vaccinated against yellow fever.
