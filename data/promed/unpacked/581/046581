Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in conjunction with the New Mexico Livestock Board is conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of the event. As of 30 Apr 2012, the summary of events is as follows:
- 18 Apr 2012: a foreign animal disease investigation was initiated due to the observed presence of vesicular lesions on 2 horses. Laboratory samples were submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for diagnosis. Quarantine of the premises was implemented.
- 25 Apr 2012: horses were re-bled on the premises for paired sample testing.
- 30 Apr 2012: confirmatory diagnosis of vesicular stomatitis was made based on clinical signs and positive laboratory results.
- 30 Apr 2012: state Animal Health Officials have implemented enhanced surveillance within a 1.6 km radius of the index premises.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; quarantine; vaccination prohibited; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) affects cattle, swine, and horses primarily and is particularly worrisome when found 1st in cattle or swine because it is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease. Fortunately, this time VS was initially diagnosed in horses and therefore, since FMD does not affect horses, we know this is not FMD based on the clinical epidemiology. Furthermore, the diagnostic tests indicate it is indeed VS.

We have had intermittent outbreaks of VS over the past decade. Some have been limited and isolated such as the one in 2009, which only involved 7 horses and only in New Mexico (3 premises and 4 horses total) and Texas (2 premises and 3 horses total). On the other hand, in 2005 VS was relentless, infecting 445 premises in 69 counties spanning the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming; that is, large portions of the Rocky Mountains areas in the western United States.

For very thorough and informative reports on the epidemiology and occurrence of previous VS outbreaks in the US see the USDA APHIS Animal Health Monitoring and Surveillance reports at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/vsv/index.htm. - Mod.PC]
