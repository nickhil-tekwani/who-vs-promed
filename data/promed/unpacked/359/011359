The number of rabid animals has sharply increased during this year in
the Moscow region. According to the sanitary authorities, the current
year's indexes are the highest for the last 25 years. During the 11
months of 2008, 173 rabies cases in animals have been officially
recorded, exceeding the previous record of 1984 (134 cases).

The Raccoon dog [Family: Canidae, Genus: Nyctereutes, Species: _N.
procyonoides_; see picture at
<http://www.all-creatures.org/anex/raccdog-01.jpg>. - Mod. AS] has
become the main vector of rabies in the region, replacing the fox.
This animal was introduced into central Russia from the Far East in
the middle of the previous century for fur farming purposes. It has
become an invading species during the last several tens of years,
rapidly multiplying, replacing foxes in the relevant habitats.

Out of 2 human deaths, caused by rabies this year, one case was
related to raccoon dog's bite, when a 50-year-old man, in Ruzskom,
found the animal inside his summer house.

According to experts, lack of fear from humans is one of the main
manifestations of rabies in wild animals. "It is abnormal when a wild
animal, such as fox or raccoon dog, approaches humans without fear in
broad daylight. Such behaviour should be an immediate and clear
warning to those approached," cautions hunting-dogs trainer Tatiana Mazunova.

[The original range of the raccoon dog is the temperate lands of
eastern Asia including China, Siberia, and Manchuria. It also
inhabits the Japanese island chain. It was introduced to the USSR for
fur farming in the 1920s and has spread widely. It is now found from
Finland to Germany and east to the Himalayas.

Oral vaccination of wildlife is the recommended mode for spatial
rabies control. Several of the vaccines which have been long
demonstrated as highly effective and safe in controlling the disease
in foxes -- in western Europe and elsewhere -- have been tested in
raccoon dogs as well, with similarly satisfactory results. - Mod.AS]
