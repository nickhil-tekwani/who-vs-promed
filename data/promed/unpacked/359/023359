6 patients from the Duran i Reynals Hospitalin L' Hospitalet de Llobregat
(Barcelona, Spain) have been infected with _Legionella_. One of the patients
died last Saturday, one day after his infection was diagnosed, the Health
Council reported. Those infected are immunocompromised persons who had been
admitted to this oncology center, located not far from Bellvitge Hospital.

The 1st patient is an 81-year-old man suffering from lung cancer who received
radiotherapy and who was deemed "clinically stable", according to the Health
Council. This case was confirmed last Fri, 25 Feb 2005, after he presented
with clinical signs suggesting pneumonia.

The 2nd case is a 41-year-old man with cancer from an unknown source,
multiple brain metastases, and very advanced disease. His infection was also
confirmed on 25 Feb 2005, and he died the next day.

The 3rd case is a 42-year-old man with bone marrow aplasia who currently
is "in stable condition," after his legionellosis diagnosis was confirmed on
Sat, 26 Feb 2005.

A 43-year-old woman has also been affected with this _Legionella_ outbreak.
This case was confirmed on 27 Feb 2005, and her condition is also stable,
according to the Health Council.

The 5th patient, whose diagnosis was confirmed on 27 Feb 2005, is a 75-year-
old woman who has a relapsing lymphoma. The last patient is a 61-year-old man
with lung cancer, whose infection was confirmed also on 27 Feb 2005. Both
patients are in stable condition.

After the 1st case of legionellosis, Duran I Reynals Hospital started water
hyperchlorination and disinfection, and they contacted all patients
discharged during 7-20 Feb 2005 to determine whether they have symptoms
suggesting _Legionella_ infection.

The admission of new patients has also been halted, except for non-
oncological patients who must receive therapy not requiring hospitalization.
The hospital also is not allowing patients to use showers until they are
considered to be safe.

The Health Council, which is currently studying the outbreak, pointed out
that the outbreak "is not community-based", consequently, they insisted
that "it is not necessary" that the general population and visitors or
relatives attending the health center "take any type of measure".

[Legionellosis is not uncommon as a hospital-acquired infection and can be
particularly relevant in patients with defects in cellular immunity, such as
those with organ transplants or HIV infection, and those undergoing cancer
chemotherapy. The containment measures taken were good, and there appears to
be no threat to the outside community. - Mods.LL, JW]
