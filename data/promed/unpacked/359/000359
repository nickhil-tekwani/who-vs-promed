Cases of malaria continue to be reported in Greece. Some new cases have occurred in areas of Greece where malaria had not been previously reported. Cases of malaria have been reported from the Attica, Karditsa, Laconia, Viotia, and Xanthi regions of Greece. Cases have occurred in the cities of Evrotas, Marathon, Markopoulo, and Selino. No cases have been reported in Athens. The Hellenic (Greek) CDC and the European CDC are improving surveillance for malaria cases. In affected areas, mosquito control has been intensified; health care providers have been educated, and the public has been informed.

[The latest issue of EpiSouth (http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_239_18_10_12.pdf) reports 11 autochthonous _P. vivax_ cases in Greece this year [2012], which are also reported by the ECDC [2]; however, 12 cases are reported by a newspaper citing the CDC (http://www.examiner.com/article/cdc-issues-malaria-outbreak-update-for-greece), and the number of cases are not mentioned in the CDC news posing cited above [1].

The CDC recommends that travelers to the agricultural areas of Evrotas take prescription medicine to prevent malaria, but the European authorities (ECDC] do not recommend malaria prophylaxis to any parts of Greece at present.

As ProMED-mail has pointed out before, the incubation time of temperate climate _P. vivax_ can be 8 to 9 months or even longer, and a _P. vivax_ case in some part of Greece does not, therefore, necessarily indicate local transmission this year (2012). This has been thoroughly discussed in our previous postings on the subject, but as far as we know, genotyping has not yet been performed.
