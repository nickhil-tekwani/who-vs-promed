Two people died on Friday [22 May 2009] after being bitten by ticks
in central Anatolia, news agencies reported, while a scientific study
of ticks has identified 3 species in Tokat that carry Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus [CCHFV]. A 38-year-old man died after he was
bitten by a tick in the Zile district of the central Anatolian
province of Tokat, reported the Dogan news agency. Last week, he had
been bitted by a tick and removed the tick himself, the Dogan news
agency reported. A couple of days later, he became sick and was
hospitalized and suspected to have contracted CCHFV infection

A 59-year-old woman living in a village of Yozgat [province] also
died on Friday [22 May 2009] after she was hospitalized as a
suspected case of CCHFV infection. Blood samples from both the man
and the woman were sent to Ankara for a conclusive diagnosis,
reported the private news channel NTV.

The investigation that aimed to examine the different types of ticks
in Turkey identified that 3 among 25 tick species carried the virus,
the Anatolia news agency reported. The study was initiated with the
support of the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey
(TUBITAK) in 2006 in the Kelkit basin. The project in the long run
aims to examine all tick species throughout the whole of Turkey.

[In 2008, 55 people died in Turkey from CCHFV infection, bringing the
total number of CCHFV infection deaths to 147 since the 1st case in 2002.

The 2 deaths reported above are assumed to be the 3rd and 4th fatal
cases of CCHFV infection reported in Turkey this year [2009]. The
number of cases can be expected to increase from now on, with the
onset of warmer weather and proliferation of the tick vector.
