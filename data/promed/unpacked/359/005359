Vaccinate [North Dakota] livestock against anthrax now
------------------------------------------------------
"Cattle should be vaccinated before they're turned out into the
pasture," says Charlie Stoltenow, North Dakota State University
Extension Service veterinarian. "Producers will be working their
cattle in the next several weeks, so this is the perfect time to get
their livestock protected against this disease." Vaccination is
especially important for livestock in areas with a history of anthrax,
he adds.

While the disease mainly has been reported in north eastern, south
eastern, and south central North Dakota, it has been found in almost
every part of the state, according to state animal health officials.
Cases of the disease occur in the region almost every year. Anthrax is
a concern because spores of the bacteria that cause it can survive in
the soil for decades. Favorable conditions, such as the flooding and
heavy rainfall some parts of North Dakota have experienced in the last
few years, may make it more widespread.

Vaccines are effective, but they take about a week to establish
immunity, and they must be administered annually because immunity
appears to wane after about 6 months, Stoltenow says. He recommends
producers check with their veterinarian to make sure their livestock's
vaccination schedule is adequate and the vaccination is up to date.

Livestock in areas where anthrax has been found should be vaccinated
about 4 weeks before the disease usually appears. Herds within 6 miles
[10 km] of a prior case of anthrax also should be vaccinated,
especially in years with wet spring weather and/or flooding. [As in
this year. - Mod.MHJ]

If anthrax is detected in a herd, producers should move the herd
immediately to a new pasture away from where dead animals were found
to prevent other animals from getting infected, Stoltenow says.

During severe outbreak conditions, animals that haven't been
vaccinated and are exposed to anthrax may have to be treated with
antibiotics and then vaccinated. Producers thinking about treating
with antibiotics should contact their veterinarian because antibiotics
decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine, Stoltenow says.

Producers also should monitor their herds for unexpected deaths and
report those losses to their veterinarian.

Because anthrax also is a risk to humans, people should not move a
carcass. The carcasses of animals that died from anthrax should be
disposed of, preferably through burning, as close as possible to where
they died. Any contaminated soil should be piled on top of the
carcasses for burning, Stoltenow says.

[Adding to what Charlie has written, epidemics follow from when the
initial affected animals in the index herd are ignored. When there are
some 4-6 moribund and dead animals the female horseflies have plenty
to feed on and then will infect neighbouring herds with their
contaminated mouthparts. A slow response by a farmer will ensure his
neighbours' stock will come down with anthrax. Therefore spring
vaccination protects not just the farmer and rancher's cattle but is
also an insurance against one's neighbour's lawyer claiming
compensation for his client's losses. The lawyers have yet to
appreciate this source of money but it is just a matter of time until
they do. And lawyers are very expensive, especially theirs. -

Flooding in state brings concern about anthrax
----------------------------------------------
[South Dakota] State veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven is reminding
livestock producers to remain diligent in vaccinating livestock
against anthrax.

Flooding across the state has created conditions favorable for
anthrax. Anthrax spores can lie dormant in soil for years only to
surface after flooding.

The most effective way to manage the disease is through annual
preventive vaccination because unvaccinated animals tend to die
suddenly after exposure leaving little opportunity for treatment.

Grazing livestock in north western Minnesota at risk for anthrax
----------------------------------------------------------------
Producers in north western Minnesota are urged to vaccinate their
cattle soon against naturally occurring anthrax.

"Before producers turn their cattle out on pasture this summer [2011]
they should consider vaccinating for anthrax," said Minnesota Board of
Animal Health executive director and state veterinarian Dr Bill
Hartmann. "Cattle that graze can be exposed to anthrax spores in the
soil. Vaccination is an inexpensive way to protect your cattle."

As an added precaution, Hartmann recommends producers assume that any
unexpected death among their herd is due to anthrax until the disease
can be ruled out. Suspect carcasses should not be cut open, because
that can allow anthrax to spread. If you suspect anthrax contact your
veterinarian immediately.

Fortunately, the risk of humans developing anthrax from naturally
occurring bacteria is extremely low. Minnesota has recorded no human
cases of anthrax since 1953.

[There is extensive flooding of the Red River in eastern North and
South Dakota and adjoining areas, including south east Manitoba and
north west Minnesota. It is all one ecological area with common soils
and farming habits. So we can confidently expect there to be a high
anthrax risk for livestock and wildlife in this area this coming
summer [2011]. Farmers and ranchers should add Sterne vaccine to their
spring vaccination list. Waiting until one's neighbour's stock has
gone down is frankly too late. In Minnesota farmers also need to keep
an eye open for dead whitetail deer and elk. Their carcasses need to
be burnt too. Human cases come about usually from skinning anthrax
carcasses and there are always idiots out there wanting a trophy head
they didn't earn even if it is in velvet, as they will be during the
summer anthrax season.

Anyone wanting to sample a found carcass should snip out 1-2+ sq cm
of turbinate bone and submit it for laboratory confirmation. We have
found positive turbinates in animals dead for over 2 years so it is a
very sensitive sample to take and doesn't involve opening up the
carcass. - Mod.MHJ]
