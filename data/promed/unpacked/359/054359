Hendra virus horse death in NSW
-------------------------------
The New South Wales Government has confirmed a horse has died from
the Hendra virus at a property near Wollongbar on the state's north
coast. The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says the horse was
put down by a veterinarian early yesterday morning [30 June 2011] and
lab tests have since shown it was suffering from the virus.

The vet and 8 other people who came into contact with the horse are
now being closely monitored for signs of infection.

NSW chief veterinary officer Ian Roth says there is only one other
horse on the property, but it has been placed in quarantine. He says
there is nothing to suggest the incident is linked to a recent
outbreak of Hendra [virus] at Beaudesert in Queensland or that
neighboring properties are at risk.

"It's spread from flying foxes to horses, but it wouldn't necessarily
be those flying foxes from Beaudesert," he said. "We do know that with
flying foxes there is a percentage, 20 to 30 per cent, that have got
antibodies. The virus moves around in those flying foxes. So it's
related to those flying foxes but there's no connection between those
2 properties."

A total of 8 people, including a vet, were exposed to a horse with
Hendra virus on 2 properties near Beaudesert, south of Brisbane [see
ProMED refs. below].

Initial blood tests for the 8 people have come back negative, but it
will take several weeks and more tests until the all clear can be
given.

[There have thus far been no human deaths from this outbreak of
Hendra virus. I do not believe there have been any human deaths in New
South Wales (NSW). However this is the 2nd horse to die from the virus
in NSW. Wollongbar is very close to the border between NSW and
Queensland. The previous horse death was also in that area.

This article leaves me slightly confused. It seems there are 8 people
exposed in Queensland, and an additional 8 people at this site in NSW.
Therefore is the initial all clear test on those people from
Queensland or those from NSW?

Since Wollongbar is close to the border between NSW and Queensland,
is this possibly from the same infected flying foxes? They have a
range approximately 40-60 miles. - Mod.TG
