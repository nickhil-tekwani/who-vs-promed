[B] Update 89  What happens if SARS returns? 26 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_26/en/>

Earlier this week, WHO removed Hong Kong and Beijing  the worlds 2 most
severely affected cities  from its list of areas with recent local
transmission of SARS. Only Toronto and Taiwan continue to experience chains
of local transmission, and these outbreaks are likewise being brought close
to containment.
After almost 4 months, the global public health emergency caused by the
sudden appearance and rapid spread of SARS is coming to an end.
The SARS virus, a new and unique member of the coronavirus family, first
emerged in mid-November [2002] in southern China. One of the key questions
now is whether SARS  pushed out of its new human host as chains of
transmission are broken  will return.
The question arises because of the behaviour of other comparatively new and
poorly understood viruses, including those that cause the Ebola and Marburg
haemorrhagic fevers. These viruses periodically surface to cause outbreaks,
usually limited to a defined geographical area, and then fade away to hide
in some animal or environmental reservoir until conditions again become
ripe for spread to humans.
The question of whether SARS will likewise resurface must remain open
pending better understanding of the circumstances that allowed the new
disease to emerge. The SARS virus is thought to have jumped to humans from
some animal or environmental source.
Many new viruses that jump from animals to humans, including the Nipah,
Hendra, and hanta viruses, do not spread efficiently from one person to
another and thus do not cause large and sustained outbreaks with a
potential for rapid international spread. The SARS virus, however, spreads
readily from person to person. Factors in the hospital environment have
worked to amplify this efficient transmission considerably. In addition,
though SARS has a high case fatality (around 15 percent), it allows enough
of its victims to survive long enough to spread the disease to others  an
effective survival strategy for a new virus.
The WHO scientific coordinator for SARS, Dr Klaus Stohr, is presently in
China working together with scientists there to develop and prioritize a
SARS research agenda. Research on the origins of the SARS virus is expected
to top the agenda.
In the meantime, WHO has good reason to believe that, should SARS resurface
later this year, the global impact will be milder than experienced during
the initial global emergency. 5 reasons support this view.
First, the worlds public health systems have demonstrated their capacity
to move quickly into a phase of high alert. The prompt detection and
isolation of imported cases in African and India are good examples of both
the level of vigilance and its effectiveness in preventing further spread.
Some of the former SARS hotspots, including Hong Kong and Singapore, plan
to maintain a high level of vigilance, supported by measures for screening
and detection, until at least the end of the year.
Second, the world knows what to do. Control measures, though centuries old,
have demonstrated their capacity to completely halt outbreaks, as most
recently seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
Third, the intensive research effort currently under way can be expected to
improve scientific understanding of SARS and yield better control tools,
most notably a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test.
Fourth, resolutions adopted during the May World Health Assembly have
strengthened WHOs capacity to respond to outbreaks in important ways. In
effect, these resolutions allow WHO to move from a passive reliance on
official government notifications to a proactive role in warning the world
as soon as evidence indicates that an outbreak poses a threat to
international public health.
Finally and perhaps most importantly, SARS has underscored the importance
of immediately and fully disclosing cases of any disease with the potential
for international spread. In the present climate of opinion, influenced by
the lessons learned from SARS, it appears unlikely that any country would
choose to conceal cases, should SARS resurface. In addition, SARS is simply
too big a disease to hide for long.
For these reasons, WHO is optimistic that, should SARS return, it will not
do so with a vengeance.

The cumulative number of probable and suspected cases reported by Health
Canada has not changed from yesterday's posting. In the past 24 hours
there have been no new probable or suspected cases reported.
The most recent date of onset of illness for a probable case is June 12,
2003, and this person was quarantined on June 4, 2003. The most recent date
of isolation for a probable case is June 12, 2003, and this person had
onset of illness on 8 Jun 2003.

No new probable cases have been reported since 15 Jun 2003. As of 26 Jun
2003 there have been a cumulative total of 682 probable cases and 84 deaths
reported. Since yesterday's report 4 previously reported probable cases
were excluded by the reporting physicians. There are an additional 1451
suspected cases reported, and 882 previously reported suspected
and probable cases have been excluded. There are graphic representations
of locations of reported cases and deaths available at the daily SARS
website update using the above given weblink address.

[As of 26 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8456 probable
cases of SARs with 809 deaths reported worldwide. In the past 24 hours
there has been one newly reported probable case from Canada. This case had
previously been reported as suspected case and was officially reported on
25 Jun 2003 -- as of today, 26 Jun 2003 there were no newly reported
suspected or probable cases in Canada. Thus, in reality, for today, 26 Jun
2003 there were no new reports of probable cases of SARS worldwide. In the
past 24 hours, the worldwide total has had a net decrease of 4 reported
probable cases as a result of exclusion of cases previously reported as
probable.
As the WHO update discussion section mentions, there are significant
unknowns as to if, where and when the SARS coronavirus will re-appear. The
conclusions that the public health infrastructure worldwide responded
appropriately with rapid intervention, and therefore there is reason for
optimism should this virus reappear are reasonable. It is noteworthy that
the person-to-person transmission was significantly enhanced in the health
care setting, and that widespread community transmission did not appear as
a major component of this outbreak. The majority of cases were in urban
areas with a strong association with the health care environment. Major
outbreaks in rural areas were not observed. Further food for thought re:
the impact of urbanization on emerging infectious diseases. - Mod.MPP]
