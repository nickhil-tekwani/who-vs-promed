[C] Update 72 - Situation in China 3 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_03/en/>
[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com

The daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS in mainland
China has declined considerably in recent weeks, from an average of
166 cases during the first week of May [2003], to 90 cases during the
second week, 27 cases in the third week, and 16 in the fourth week.
Over the past 6 days, the daily number of reported new cases has
dropped to an average of 2.5.
As in other areas with large and challenging SARS outbreaks, this
progress over the past month demonstrates the decisive importance of
high-level political commitment and determined application of control
measures that have proven their effectiveness. At the same time,
experiences elsewhere demonstrate the need for maintaining a vigilant
and cautious approach to SARS, particularly in a country as large and
diverse as China.
The resurgence of cases in Toronto demonstrates how difficult it can
be to maintain control over a new disease characterized by many
puzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued
alertness of Singapore, which has most recently broken the chain of
SARS transmission, demonstrates the importance of staying on guard,
with a high level of vigilance and preparedness, to ensure that a
single imported case does not reignite an outbreak.
Based on recent experiences and the many uncertainties about the
behaviour of SARS, WHO sees a need for caution in interpreting the
downward trend in the number of reported new cases in China.
"SARS is still present in China, and WHO continues to regard China as
the epicentre of SARS," said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for
Communicable Diseases at WHO. "It is our job, together with Chinese
authorities, to try to prevent this disease from becoming permanently
established in such a vast country."
The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS
worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be
controlled in China. Otherwise, cases in China -- with its long
porous borders and large migrant populations -- could seed outbreaks
elsewhere and would thus make SARS a continuing threat for the rest
of the world.
Dr Heymann believes that the international community has much to
learn from Chinese experiences in controlling SARS, initially in
Guangdong Province and increasingly in other parts of China. "It is
also our job to work with the government to determine the factors
that have led to such a rapid fall in SARS cases compared to other
sites where outbreaks have occurred."
WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has stressed the
importance, for the security of all populations, of fully
understanding the situation within any country experiencing an
outbreak of a disease that can threaten neighbouring countries or be
spread internationally by the travelling public. "This allows, within
a country, for WHO to do what needs to be done to help the rest of
the world," she said, speaking on a SARS-related issue during last
weekÂ’s World Health Assembly.
Although great improvements in surveillance, reporting, infection
control, and public awareness have occurred in China in recent weeks,
WHO remains concerned about the sensitivity of case detection in some
provinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to
cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS. A particular problem is
the large number of new cases reported (approximately half) without
information on the source or setting of exposure. The absence of this
information makes it difficult for WHO to assess the extent of local
transmission.
Local transmission of SARS, especially when it occurs outside a
confined setting, such as the health care environment, is one measure
of the risk of infection for both residents and international
travellers. The pattern of local transmission is also an important
consideration when WHO issues travel advice designed to prevent
further international spread of SARS.

Update on SARS - 3 Jun 2003
Phased lifting of restrictions on inter-hospital movement for
healthcare workers
As the last probable SARS case in Singapore was isolated on 11 May
2003, the restriction of inter-hospital movement of healthcare
workers (HCW) will be lifted in phases. The categories of HCW include
doctors, nurses, therapists, hospital aides, as well as nurses who
are self-employed or from private nursing agencies, and locum doctors.
Private sector Healthcare Institutions (HCIs)
- Effective today, HCWs in the private sector will be allowed to move
freely across private HCIs without restriction.
- HCWs in the private sector will be allowed to practise or work in
public HCIs effective 16 Jun 2003.
Public sector Healthcare Institutions (HCIs)
The lifting of the restrictions on HCWs in the public HCIs will be
done in several phases:
- The first group of HCWs allowed to move across the public HCIs were
Medical Officers who were rotated to new postings in public HCIs on 2
Jun 2003.
- On 9 Jun 2003, advanced specialist trainees will move to their new
postings in public HCIs.
- Effective 16 Jun 2003, all other HCWs in the public HCIs will be
allowed to work in other public HCIs. In addition, HCWs in public
HCIs will also be allowed to work in the private HCIs from 16 Jun
2003.
Systems for monitoring HCWs in public and private sector hospitals
As a safeguard against cross-institutional spread of infection, all
HCIs will be required to closely monitor all HCWs working in their
HCI who were practising within the last 10 days in another HCI, to
ensure that they are afebrile and well.
Need to maintain a high level of vigilance
The Ministry has reminded all HCIs of the need to maintain the
current high level of vigilance and infection control. Surveillance
for clusters of patients and staff with fever in hospitals and
nursing homes will also continue.
Situation Update
Since the last MOH press update on 31 May 2003, there have been no
new probable cases, no discharges, and no deaths.
Suspect cases
Since 31 May 2003, there are no new suspect cases admitted to TTSH.
The 47-year-old man reported as a suspect case on 31 May 2003 has
since been diagnosed to have a non-SARS illness and discharged well.
Observation cases
From 31 May 2003 to 3 June 2003, a total of 14 cases were admitted
for observation for fever. Of these, 9 have since been diagnosed as
non-SARS cases, while 5 are still under observation. Of the 5 cases
under observation, 2 had travelled to China and Hong Kong. The other
3 do not have any contact history at this point in time.
Quarantine Figures*
**Discharged patients under home quarantine = 61
Contacts under home quarantine = 0
Total under home quarantine orders = 61
*Quarantine cases refer to those who are required to stay at home for
precautionary reasons as they may have had contact with a SARS
patient. These are healthy individuals.
** This is an added precautionary measure for discharged SARS
patients as well as those with co-morbidities.
A summary of SARS cases is as follows:
Discharged: 165
Hospitalised: 9 (including 4 in ICU)
Deaths: 31
Probable cases: 206*
Suspect cases: 0
Observation cases: 5
*Includes 1 case who died from non-SARS causes

[As of 3 Jun 2003, there have been a cumulative total of 8398
probable cases of SARS with 772 deaths reported to WHO from 29
countries. In the past 24 hours since the last WHO update, there
have been 22 new probable cases of SARS reported, of which 15 were
from Canada, 3 from China, 2 from the United States, and 1 each from
Hong Kong and Taiwan. According to the Health Canada update, in the
24-hour period since the last update, there have been 4 new probable
and 4 new suspected cases reported with most recent dates of onset 31
May 2003 and 28 May 2003, respectively.
The WHO update today mentions that caution should be exercised in
interpreting the decrease in reported cases from China. There are
concerns about the "the sensitivity of case detection in some
provinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to
cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS." There is a strong
statement in the update that China is considered to be the epicenter
of this outbreak, and that unless transmission in China is
interrupted, there may be continued seeding of outbreaks outside of
China due to high population flow/movement. - Mod.MPP]
