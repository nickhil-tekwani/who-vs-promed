A total of 68 cases of typhoid fever were recorded in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon) Region from 1 Jan 2021 to 19 May 2021 as the Department of Health (DoH) regional office continued to remind residents to practise personal hygiene. The province of Laguna recorded the highest incidence of typhoid fever with 30 cases, followed by Cavite with 26, Rizal with 6, and Batangas with 1. Although there is a significant decrease in cases for the same period last year [2020], with 191 cases recorded by the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, the surveillance unit cited the need to be cautious to avoid the life-threatening illness.

Kimberly Cu, DoH-Calabarzon regional medical technologist, said typhoid fever is common in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation and lack of a safe drinking water source. "If you are unsure of the quality of the water, especially those taken from deep wells, which are untreated, it is best to boil it for at least 2 minutes to kill bacteria," she said. "Also avoid eating unsanitary street-vended food, as they are commonly exposed to insects and various environmental elements. When eating raw fruit and vegetables, wash them thoroughly with clean water. Essentially, wash hands properly with soap and water before and after eating and also after using the toilet as it is the best way to control infection."

Typhoid is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria _Salmonella_ Typhi and is transmitted by fecal oral route or by consuming food and/or water contaminated by the bacterium. A person with typhoid fever usually suffers from sustained high fever, headache, malaise (weakness), loss of appetite, and diarrhea or constipation.

"If a member of the family is suffering from any of the symptoms mentioned, you must bring the person immediately to the nearest hospital for immediate treatment," Cu said. "The only effective treatment for the illness is antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin (for non-pregnant adults) and ceftriaxone for pregnant patients. Give them plenty of water to rehydrate."

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to See Also section below). - Mod.LL
