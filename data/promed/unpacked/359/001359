=======================================
[- See previous postings ... archive.960521 & archive.960528. MHJ]
Following my initial communication and the added information provided
by Dr. Suarez, the following listed articles may be of interest.
Gonda MA et al, Bovine immunodeficiency virus: molecular biology and
virus-host interactions. Virus Res. 32:155-181 (1994)
This article is an excellent review of BIV and illustrates the
encephalitis in an experimentally infected cow.
Snider TG ,et al, Bovine immunodeficiency virus associated with encephalitis
and secondary infections in cattle (Abst.203) Vet Pathol. 30(5):478 (1993)
This was for a poster presentation of natural infections bith BIV
in cows with encephalitis and multiple secondary disease problems
with a focus on high disease & death rates in 1991.
Snider, Ron, A natural outbreak of bovine immunodeficiency virus infection
in Holstein dairy cows. Summary of oral presentation to the US Animal
Health Association, Committee on Bluetongue and bovine retroviruses,
Proceedings 99th Annual meeting, Grand Rapids, MI, 51-52 (1994)
This is a summary of a platform presentation on the occurrence of
brain and lymphoid tissue alterations in naturally infected cows with
multiple secondary conditions as occurred in 1991 in over 30 cattle
of a 100 head dairy herd.
Snider TG, et al, Encephalitis, lymphoid tissue depletion and secondary
diseases associated with bovine immunodeficiency virus in a dairy herd.
Comp Immun Microbiol Infect Dis 19:117-131 (1996)
This is a report of BIV-associated disease leading to immunodeficiency
and susceptibility to secondary infection in 59 cows over a five year
period. It is illustrated with photomicrographs of brain and lymphoid
tissue lesions.
