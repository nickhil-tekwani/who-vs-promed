[Ref: E Palanga et al (2017): First report of Maize yellow mosaic virus infecting maize in Burkina Faso. New Disease Reports 35, 26; DOI: 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2017.035.026]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV) is a new polerovirus discovered recently in China in maize (_Zea mays_) displaying foliar yellowing and mosaic. Interestingly, a few months later, MaYMV was reported from Ecuador in maize (A Bernreiter, pers. comm) and Nigeria [see item 2], suggesting that this new polerovirus is broadly distributed and is potentially emerging worldwide.

During a survey by the Agricultural Research Centre of Kamboins√© (ARCK), maize leaves showing yellow stripes, yellowing and yellow mosaic were collected from 5 fields surrounding ARCK, from which 15 to 20 per cent of the plants appeared diseased. 14 diseased plants were tested by RT-PCR for poleroviruses and MaYMV. 7 samples tested positive. Amplicons of 263 to 2700 bp generated were sequenced. The 7 consensus sequences from Burkina Faso shared 98-98.7 per cent identity with the Chinese MaYMV isolates. Moreover, nucleotide identities between the Burkina Faso isolates were 99-100 per cent.

A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the coat protein (CP) sequences of the Burkina Faso isolates, the MaYMV CP sequences from China and Ecuador, and 8 other representative polerovirus and luteovirus [both family Luteoviridae - Mod.DHA] CP sequences. Sequences from the Burkina Faso isolates clearly cluster with MaYMV CP sequences from China and Ecuador.

Altogether, these results support the conclusion that MaYMV is present in Burkina Faso, indicating a global distribution of this recently discovered virus including Africa, Asia and South America.

[2] Sugar cane, _Rottboellia_ grass - Nigeria

[Ref: A Yahaya et al (2017): First Report of Maize yellow mosaic virus Infecting Sugarcane (_Saccharum_ spp.) and Itch Grass (_Rottboellia cochinchinensis_) in Nigeria. Plant Disease 101, 1335; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-03-17-0315-PDN]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During surveys in the northern region of Nigeria, sugarcane and itch grass (_Rottboellia cochinchinensis_) showing virus-like mosaic symptoms were encountered. [Nucleic acids from] symptomatic leaves from 5 randomly selected plants (sugarcane = 4; itch grass = 1) were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Reads mapped to Maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV; genus _Polerovirus_; family Luteoviridae), along with reads mapped to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_. Assembly of the sequences yielded [a] 5566 nt long near complete (approx. 99 per cent) genome of MaYMV that was 95 to 97 per cent identical and phylogenetically related to corresponding sequences of MaYMV isolates available in GenBank.

To further confirm the occurrence of this virus in source samples, individual samples were subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The expected approx. 1100 bp DNA was amplified from 3 samples (sugarcane = 2; itch grass = 1). The fragments from one sugarcane and the itch grass sample were sequenced. They shared 99 to 100 per cent nt identity with each other and 97 to 99 per cent identity with the corresponding MaYMV sequences in this study, and those from GenBank. They also shared 86, 79, and 61 per cent nt identities, respectively, with corresponding sequences of Barley virus G [tentative polerovirus], _Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV_, and _Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_ [both genus _Polerovirus_ - Mod.DHA]

Our results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the 1st report of MaYMV in sugarcane and itch grass worldwide. The occurrence of MaYMV in these perennial crop and weed hosts have implications for disease epidemiology since both plant species could serve as green bridges for virus perpetuation in cereal production systems.

[This novel virus, tentatively called Maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV; name not yet approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), was described in 2016 from China (see link below). Symptoms on infected maize plants were reported as yellow mosaic on leaves. The new virus was identified by deep sequencing of small RNAs and a complete 5642 nucleotide genome was assembled. MaYMV has 73 per cent sequence identity with _Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV_ and is considered to be a potential new member of the genus _Polerovirus_ (type member _Potato leafroll virus_), family Luteoviridae. More research is needed on its epidemiology, including potential vectors.

In addition to its presence in Asia (China), South America (Ecuador, see item 1), and West Africa (Burkina Faso, Nigeria), preliminary results also suggest its occurrence in eastern Africa in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Sudan (unpublished, see link below) where it was reported as the most prevalent virus after _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_; synergistic partner in maize lethal necrosis disease, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and links below).

Known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens. Many are spread by aphids and consequently difficult to control. It appears that this potential new luteovirus may be wide spread and may pose a threat to maize production in the affected regions.
