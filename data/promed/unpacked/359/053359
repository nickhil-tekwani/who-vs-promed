Canker found in McArthur Farms grove in western St. Lucie
---------------------------------
12 grapefruit trees in a grove in western St. Lucie County owned by
McArthur Farms Inc. were reported to be infected with citrus canker,
a Florida Department of Agriculture spokeswoman said Friday. The
330-acre grove is the 1st among McArthur's 1700 acres of groves in
St. Lucie and Okeechobee counties where canker has been detected,
said Stan Carter, McArthur's Citrus Division manager.
"It looks like they are finding it wherever they look," Carter said.
The grove is in the mid-county area, surrounded by groves where the
bacterial disease was detected earlier this year [2005], said Denise
Feiber, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department.
Carter said 260 acres of the 330-acre grove at the corner of State
Road 70 and Header Canal Road will be destroyed. Based on 150 trees
per acre, that will mean the loss of about 39 000 trees.
The state's canker eradication effort needs more manpower, Carter said.
Since canker was first discovered in St. Lucie County in late
December [2004], the bacterial disease has been found in almost 20
commercial groves on the Treasure Coast.
More than 625 000 citrus trees are scheduled to be removed in Martin,
St. Lucie and Indian River counties by late May, state agriculture
officials said.

[Citrus canker (CC) continues to occur in southern Florida. It would
appear that continuing outbreaks of CC can be anticipated, most
likely linked to hurricane activity in late 2004. -Mod.DH]
