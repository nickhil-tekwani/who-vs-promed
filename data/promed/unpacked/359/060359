[Re the failure to report a hantavirus infection, ref. above]
I have a comment for physicians that subscribe to ProMED.
A disease like HPS is a public health concern, and not an individual
privacy concern. Sin Nombre virus has a well known rodent vector
and there are measures that can be taken to reduce the numbers
of the vector, and reduce the residual fecal and fluid contaminants
that are responsible for human infection. This reduces the
possibility of others becoming infected with this potentially fatal
agent.
None of this can happen though, unless the physicians on the front
lines report individual cases to the proper health authorities. For
this reason, I ask that all primary care physicians and others
involved with identification and treatment of reportable diseases
please remember your responsibility.
