H5N1 hits poultry in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------
Officials in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Viet Nam have reported new outbreaks
of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry this week [29 Oct-2 Nov 2007].

In Bangladesh, an official from the government's livestock department said
the H5N1 virus was detected at 3 farms in the northern part of the country,
Reuters reported today. Workers culled about 6000 chickens, which were
buried over the last 2 days, the report said. The country's last reported
H5N1 outbreak occurred in May [2007], according to an Office International
des Epizooties (OIE; World Organization for Animal Health) report.

Meanwhile, a livestock official in Pakistan said yesterday that 45 000
chicks at a breeding operation in the North West Frontier Province were
destroyed and buried after a laboratory in Islamabad identified the H5N1
virus in samples from the flock, The Post, a Pakistani newspaper, reported
today [see 1 above]. According to OIE reports, Pakistan's last poultry
outbreak occurred in July [2005].

Elsewhere, veterinary officials in Viet Nam reported 2 more H5N1 outbreaks
in ducks, according to a report from Xinhua, China's state news agency. An
outbreak that began on 29 Oct 2007 in southern Viet Nam's Tra Vinh province
struck a flock of 2-month-old ducks, killing 400 and sickening 500, the
report said.

On 28 Oct 2007, an H5N1 outbreak killed 210 of 400 ducks at a household in
northern Viet Nam's Nam Dinh province, the Xinhua report said.

According to OIE reports, Viet Nam had 6 H5N1 outbreaks in October 2007,
all involving unvaccinated ducks. Besides Tra Vinh and Nam Dinh, affected
provinces included Cao Bang in the north and Quang Tri in central Viet Nam.
