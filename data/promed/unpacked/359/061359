Scrapie in France - atypical cases
-------------------------------
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 26 Jan 2004 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Date of the report: 16 Jan 2004.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 12 Mar 2003 [10 months
ago - Mod.JW].
3 atypical cases of scrapie have been detected in ewes aged from 5 years to
17 years. Genotyping of the animals for the gene coding for the prion
protein has shown that these animals are homozygous for the allele ARR,
associated with the highest resistance to the development of clinical signs
of scrapie.
Location of the cases: departments of Haute-Vienne (2 cases) and Ain (1 case).
Diagnosis: the cases were detected within the framework of the routine
active surveillance programmes (abattoirs, downers) implemented in
accordance with Regulation No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of the European Union.
A. Laboratory where confirmatory testing was carried out: NCTA(1) Virology
Unit of the French Agency for Food Safety (AFSSA(2)), Lyon.
B. Diagnostic tests used: ELISA(3) and immunohistochemical tests.
Inoculation of samples into laboratory animals is currently under way to
determine more accurately the biological characteristics of these isolates.
(1) NCTA: non-conventional transmissible agents
(2) AFSSA: Agence francaise de securite sanitaire des aliments
(3) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

{The following comment is adapted from the 2003 ProMED reference below.]
[With new information, it appears there is potentially a new phenotype
of 'atypical' BSE/TSE in animals in Japan and France. The article below
indicates a new strain of Scrapie from Norway, the 'Nor98', which also has
negative IHC and histology. Although this article does not suggest a link to
the atypical forms seen in cattle, it does seem more than coincidence that
there are also appearing different strains, or perhaps atypical strains of
scrapie as well. It has been believed for years that there is a link between
BSE and scrapie; perhaps this is another bit of research that should be
carefully examined. Â­
