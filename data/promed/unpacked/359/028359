An outbreak of plague has killed a man in northwest China's Gansu Province. Local authorities say the man's remains have been properly disposed of and 151 people who had close contact with him are now quarantined.

The victim was said to have been hospitalized before he died on Wednesday, 16 Jul 2014. An autopsy found he died of plague, an infection which has largely died out in China.

Authorities have isolated several villages nearby and activated a 3rd-degree epidemic alert in the region.

A 38-year-old man in the northwestern province of Gansu died of pneumonic plague on Wednesday, 16 Jul 2014, state media reported. More than 150 people who were in contact with the man have been quarantined, the provincial public health authority said in a news bulletin on its website. None of the quarantined has had any symptoms so far.

The man was diagnosed with the plague on Thursday, 17 Jul 2014. He became ill after having had close contact with a dead marmot while herding [livestock], the bulletin and Xinhua reported. The patient was taken to hospital in Yumen on Tuesday afternoon, 15 Jul 2014, after developing a high fever.

Yumen city, where the patient was being treated, and the man's home village and town along with the pasture where he worked were also in quarantine. Experts have been sent to the affected area. The patient's body was cremated, according to media reports.

In August 2009, China reported an outbreak of pneumonic plague in western Qinghai province after a herdsman died of high fever and hemoptysis (coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract), according to WHO records. The source of the outbreak in 2009 was also a wild marmot, the epidemiological investigation showed.

[The following was taken from the moderator comment by JW in ProMED-mail post Plague, pneumonic, 2009 - China: (QH) follow up 20110109.0100:
"The 2009 outbreak in Qinghai Province was reported in the literature in 2011 (Hu Wang et al: A dog-associated primary pneumonic plague in Qinghai Province, China. Clin Infect Dis. 2011;52: 185-190).

The outbreak was reported by ProMED in 2009 in a thread (see ProMED archives below) that ended with the report from WHO and a comment by ProMED that no further information regarding the patient, who was in critical condition, was available. This paper reports that the patient survived and that the index patient contracted pneumonic plague after carrying his dead dog on his shoulders around his neck for 400 meters to bury it [presumably bitten by infected fleas abandoning the dead dog. - Mod.JW]

It also clarifies statements in the WHO report that could have been misunderstood to mean that plague had been transmitted from the index case's corpse. To quote WHO: 'The 1st case was a 32-year-old male herdsman who developed fever and hemoptysis on 26 Jul 2009. He was referred to a hospital but died en route and was buried the following day. On 30 Jul 2009, 11 people who had close contact with the case (mainly relatives who attended the funeral) developed fever and cough and were all hospitalized. On 1 Aug 2009, specimens taken from all these 12 people, including the 1st case, tested positive for plague. On 2 Aug 2009, both the 64-year-old father-in-law of the index case and a 37-year-old male neighbor of the 1st case (who helped to bury the corpse) also died.'

The Chinese authors defined a close contact as 'a person who lived with or had face-to-face contact (within one meter) with the patient, and a direct contact as a person who once was together with a patient in the same room or in the same car with closed windows.'

Only the 11 close contacts became infected; none of 61 direct contacts became infected, and nobody who attended the funeral but had not previously been a close contact became infected. They also reported that most of the patients (6 of 11, excluding the index case) in this outbreak developed septicemic plague complicated with shock; 2 of 11 developed multiple organ failure, and 1 of 11 developed meningitis in addition to the plague pneumonia."

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse." - Mod.LL
