Hyde Park users warned after birds found sick with rare botulism
----------------------------------------------------------------
Residents have been asked to stay away -- and to keep their furry friends away -- from lakes in Hyde Park, Perth, Western Australia, after sick birds were found. WA Seabird Rescue told the City of Vincent [a local government area of Western Australia, in metropolitan Perth] last month [January 2022] its volunteers had found 2 sick birds suspected of having botulism.

Botulism is a rare but serious condition caused by toxins from bacteria. Outbreaks occur in higher temperatures, but vary in severity.

Water testing is under way at the Perth park and the City of Vincent has hired 360 environmental [workers] to monitor the lakes amid rising temperatures.

Mayor Emma Cole said as of Monday [7 Feb 2022], the City had received 2 monitoring reports indicating the water was "good with slightly elevated nutrient levels at some sampling locations". "No pesticides or hydrocarbons were detected," Ms Cole said. She said dormant spores of the bacteria causing botulism in birds was naturally abundant in the lake sediment but towards the end of summer the spores germinated, leading to outbreaks. "The City has informed the public of the possible presence of botulism in the lakes through social media posts. On-site signage is being prepared," she said. "We are also working with WA Seabird Rescue to treat sick birds and remove dead carcasses, as quick removal of dead birds reduces the spread of botulism. We have installed lake aerators which reduces spore germination." Ms Cole said there was minimal risk of catching the disease from the water, but humans and pets were advised to keep away.

UWA professor Anas Ghadouani said with climate change leading to higher temperatures and low water levels in lakes, the "stresses" on urban lakes was greater. "We need Federal and State government help to work together because the problems are getting more complex," Dr Ghadouani said. "The question arises, 'why do we care about urban lakes?'. With the changing climate, blue and green corridors combined together are what build resilience and allow communities to sustain heatwaves and climate change."

Residents who see birds that look unwell are asked to call Seabird Rescue on 6102 8464.

["Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

"Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

"Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the third eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

"Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) are highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.

"Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Also, providing it to wild bird populations is extremely challenging and often unfeasible. Birds surviving a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin."

Please also note, the water is not safe for your pets, and please do not let your pets play with, mouth or consume one of the deceased birds. Furthermore, the maggots on any decaying carcasses may also contain botulism, so please handle carcasses with care. Consumption of the deceased birds or the maggots could sicken your pets. - Mod.TG
