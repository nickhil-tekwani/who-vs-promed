LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (2)
======================================
With regard to the query [Legionnaire's disease epidemology: RFI]:
>Would anyone be able to tell me how community acquired Legionnaire's is
>differentiated from nosocomial?
So far, you have not given any evidence that Legionella was involved in
either case. The diagnosis of Legionella infection can be established
most clearly by culture of the organism from respiratory secretion,
transbronchial biopsy, pleural fluid, or pleural tissue. It can also
sometimes be seen in those specimens by immunofluorescent microscopy.
Lacking these, the diagnosis can sometimes be made by an increase in
antibody titer to a single Legionella species comparing early and con-
valescent blood specimens, or possibly, by a single titer which is
very high. Specialized laboratories may also be able to identify the
organism by PCR.
Legionella pneumonia most often presents as a rapidly evolving dense
pulmonary process which fills the air spaces. It is accompanied by
fever, elevated WBC count, and many extrapulmonary signs and symptoms.
If someone has been in the hospital for more than 2 days, and developed
this while in the hospital, it would be termed nosocomial.
