Raw oyster eaters, beware. A new, more toxic strain of a bacterium
contaminating oysters has been found in oysters harvested from Galveston
Bay, Texas.
The bacterium, _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, causes diarrhea, usually within
24 hours of eating infected seafood, along with abdominal cramping,
nausea, and headache in most people, according to Dr. Nicholas A. Daniels
and associates. Daniels, formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is now at the University of
California, San Francisco.
"Shellfish, particularly oysters since they are filter-feeders,
concentrate the bacteria in their tissues," Daniels said. "Since cooking
kills the bacteria, humans become infected when they eat raw or
undercooked shellfish. Each year in the United States, _Vibrio_ cause an
estimated 8000 infections and 50 deaths."
The authors investigated more than 400 cases of _Vibrio_-associated
diarrhea occurring between 31 May and 10 Jul 1998.
_Vibrio_ bacteria grown from 28 people and tested by the CDC all belonged
to type O3:K6, which has never been seen in US shellfish, the researchers
report.
Oysters from the harvest sites were tested and found to contain well
below the allowed limit of bacteria counts (10 000 per gram of oyster
meat). However, according to the report in the 27 Sep 2000 issue of
The Journal of the American Medical Association, half the oysters
contained at least 15 _Vibrio_ bacteria per gram of oyster meat.
Identification of these toxic bacteria led the authors to conclude "that
current policy and regulations regarding the safety of raw oysters
require re-evaluation."
Until such changes can be made, however, Daniels and colleagues advise
consumers to "thoroughly cook oysters and avoid eating raw or undercooked
oysters, particularly in the warmer months."
"Persons who are immunocompromised or have liver disease are at
particularly high risk for severe _Vibrio_ infection (and even death) and
should be warned to avoid raw shellfish consumption," Daniels said. "The
safest oyster is a cooked oyster."

seasons, the organisms are found in the marine silt, while in warmer
seasons they are found free in coastal waters and in fish and shellfish.
