Two children from the same family have died after contracting the deadly food poisoning bug _Escherichia coli_, health officials have confirmed. The children, whose ages have not yet been released, were from the Charnwood area of Leicestershire and had been treated for the infection in the last 2 weeks. Public Health England confirmed the deaths today, [Thu 4 October 2018], and revealed it is working with environmental health officers after 2 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome were confirmed in the siblings. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious complication of _E. coli_ [infection] that affects the kidneys, eventually causing them to shut down.

Dr Lauren Ahyow, consultant in communicable disease control at PHE East Midlands, said: "E. coli can cause an infection that causes a spectrum of illness ranging from mild through to severe bloody diarrhea, mostly without fever. Sometimes the infection can cause a condition called hemolytic uraemic syndrome, which affects the kidneys and can be very serious. _E. coli_ can be acquired through a number of routes, including contaminated food, contact with farm animals, and infected water. PHE are working with partners to investigate further to try and determine a source of infection." It is not yet known how the children contracted _E. coli_.

[It is not common to see 2 deaths in one family. No information is available regarding whether the children received antimicrobials early in their presentations, which can increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Most deaths related to EHEC are linked to the central nervous system complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). - Mod.LL
