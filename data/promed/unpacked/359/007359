The Government has warned that the banana crop faces extinction as banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) rages across the country. The Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Obong Otto, said that
BBW had attacked bananas in 33 districts causing a 94 percent yield loss.
Millions of Ugandans depend on the banana as their staple food, while types
[of the fruit are also] used to brew various beverages, including tonto (a
local wine) and Kasese (local potent gin).
"Preliminary reports from households show that farmers who used to harvest 16
bunches per week are now harvesting only one bunch per week," Obong said in a
12 Aug 2005 communication signed by Simon Kimono, an official from the
Ministry. It is addressed to all persons, including district information
officers, appointed to contribute to BBW campaign. Obong said the most hit
districts were Mukono, Kayunga, Nakasongola, Kampala, Hoima, Wakiso, Masindi,
Luweero, Apac, Lira, Kaberamaido, Kumi, Pallisa and Sironko.
Other districts are Mbale, Bugiri, Mayuge, Kamuli, Jinja, Bushenyi, Gulu,
Kabarole, Kibaale, Mpigi, Masaka, Mbarara, Mubende, Nebbi Ntungamo, Soroti and
Tororo districts.
"At the national level and at this scale of loss, it implies that BBW has the
potential to cause the demise of the banana crop in Uganda," Obong said.
When BBW attacks a banana plant at fruiting stage, the bunch ripens
prematurely and there is a reddish-brown discolouration in banana fingers. The
male buds also wither off and neither humans nor animals can eat the fruits.
BBW was first reported in 2001 and confirmed in 21 districts in northern,
eastern and central Uganda. This triggered the 1st phase of the campaign
against it.

[Banana (_Musa_ sp.) is the 4th most important global food crop after rice,
wheat, and maize in terms of gross value of production. Total world _Musa_
production is currently about 97 million tons annually (FAOSTAT, 2003), of
which bananas cultivated for the export trade account for only 10 percent.
Hence, they are important for food security in the humid tropics and provide
income to farmers. It is a major staple food, supplying up to 25 percent of
the carbohydrates for approximately 70 million people in Africa's humid forest
and mid-altitude regions. The East and Central Africa sub-region alone
produces nearly 20 million tons of bananas annually.
BBW was first reported in Uganda in September 2001. By August 2004, the
disease had been confirmed in 21 of the 56 districts in Uganda, whereas by
August 2005, the disease was confirmed in 33 districts, indicating
considerable spread within the year.
BBW is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_.
Disease management strategies used include disposal and destruction of
infected plants, disinfection of tools in managing the plantation, avoidance
of planting materials from infected fields, removal of male buds, keeping
browsing animals out of infected fields, replacing bananas with another crop
for at least 2 years, and use of quarantine measures to prevent introduction
of BBW into new areas.
