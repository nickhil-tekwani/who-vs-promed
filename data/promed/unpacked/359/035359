Already 19 deaths have occurred in the Nice University Hospital Center [CHU] because of multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (OXA48) bacteria.

According to the regional health agency, more than 75 people have been affected by this bacterium, which is not transmitted by the air but by direct contact.

Formally, an antibiotic is a substance produced by one microorganism that inhibits the growth of, or kills, another microorganism. Since anti-infectives are no longer produced directly from microorganisms, the term antimicrobial or antimicrobial agent is more proper.

Although the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry likely contributes to the problem, the amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA no doubt serves as an efficient multiplier of these multidrug-resistant isolates just as intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly related to the lack of control of antimicrobial use, especially in intensive care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER physicians who often react without wisdom and with "cookbook" protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, the physicians do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures, not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is recognized, that is, using these agents only when rational, in combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and meaningful improvement in a patient's life, the medical community will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic options will exist. - Mod.LL]
