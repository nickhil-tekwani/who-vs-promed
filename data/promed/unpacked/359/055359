A mystery seasonal illness that can kill dogs has returned to the
Queen's estate at Sandringham.

11 dogs have fallen ill in the past 2 weeks within hours of being
walked in woods on the Norfolk estate, which are open to the public.
Last autumn [2010], 37 dogs contracted the so-called seasonal canine
illness after visiting Sandringham, and 6 died. The illness was 1st
identified at the estate and other woodland areas in 2009. Cases
always occur between September and November.

The queen, a well-known dog lover, was reportedly so worried that she
personally requested the Animal Health Trust (AHT) veterinary charity
to investigate.

The cause has not been pinpointed, but it is believed bacteria,
blue-green algae or fungal spores are responsible. Signs in dogs
affected include vomiting, diarrhoea and lethargy. Signs have been put
up at Sandringham warning dog owners.

Dr Richard Newton, who is leading the AHT investigation, said: "We
want to arm dog owners with as much information as we can.
Unfortunately, we are looking for a small needle in a very large
haystack. We weren't aware of any cases in 2011, then suddenly at the
start of September 2011, we had a flurry of reports. Because owners
have contacted us as soon as the dogs have been taken ill, we've been
able to identify specific areas where they have been walked. This is
helping to focus our investigation on smaller areas, meaning that
we're getting closer to the culprit."

Buckingham Palace has refused to confirm that the queen has stopped
exercising her corgis on the estate. But royal shooting parties that
use other dogs to retrieve dead and injured birds are expected to
continue as normal when the pheasant and woodcock shooting season
starts on 1 Oct 2011.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: "We would not be able to give
the queen's opinion, but it is fair to say that the Sandringham estate
is concerned and is taking the reports of the sick dogs very
seriously. The estate has been taking steps to warn people."

Charlotte Richardson, 36, of Hull, whose 11-year-old springer spaniel
Amber needed GBP 1200 [USD 1885] of veterinary treatment when she fell
ill after being walked at Sandringham last September 2010, has set up
a Facebook campaign group called "Stop our woodlands poisoning our
dogs."

[This report does not say whether the dogs were swimming in or
drinking from bodies of water (blue-green algae requires a water
source to exist and may produce a variety of signs of illness,
included those listed), nor does it say whether the dogs were eating
or tasting anything in particular or whether there were other dead
animals around. While this appears to be a seasonal issue, let us hope
the investigation can reveal something.

If weather conditions are right, there may be small mushrooms along
certain trails. Also, it might be helpful if the investigation
examines what plants are along those trails. - Mod.TG]
