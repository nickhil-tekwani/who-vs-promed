The United States sent Gilead Sciences' (GILD.O) remdesivir and Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc's experimental Ebola antibody drug MBP134 to Uganda last week [week of 10 Oct 2022] to help safeguard healthcare workers responding to an outbreak that has infected 60 people and killed 44, US government sources told Reuters.

There are currently no proven vaccines or treatments for the Sudan species of Ebola, 1 of 4 known Ebola viruses to cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. The outbreak confirmed by the Ugandan health ministry on 20 Sep 2022 is the largest of the Sudan species since 2000.

Uganda health minister Jane Ruth Aceng disclosed the US shipments at a meeting of African region health officials last week in Kampala and said remdesivir, which has been widely used as a COVID-19 treatment, and an undisclosed monoclonal antibody had been given to healthcare workers.

Providing treatment that protects the lives of healthcare workers could be central to containing the outbreak, said Joel Montgomery, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's chief of the viral special pathogens branch and incident manager for the outbreak.

"If healthcare workers start to fall ill and die, it's going to negatively impact the response," said Montgomery, who had just returned from a trip to Uganda.

For instance, healthcare workers may be reluctant to assist in the response, he said in a phone interview.

The World Health Organization said in a statement the agency is working with partners in Uganda to set up the infrastructure for a clinical trial and is supporting use of the untested antivirals and monoclonal antibodies and will collect data on their efficacy.

A large outbreak of the Zaire species of Ebola in West Africa from 2014-2016 led to effective vaccines and treatment, but there are no proven treatments or vaccines for the Sudan species.

San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical received a USD 110 million contract from the US government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) on 4 Oct 2022 for advanced development and potential purchases of MBP134, a combination of monoclonal antibodies.

Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A study [https://doi.org/10.1172%2Fjci.insight.159090] of MBP134 and remdesivir in non-human primates showed that either drug given individually rescued 20% of animals infected with the Sudan species of Ebola, but when given in combination, 80% of infected animals survived.

MBP134 is currently being tested in early safety trials in healthy human volunteers, Mapp President Larry Zeitlin said in an email. All participants have completed the study, and the data are currently being analyzed. Overall, MBP134 was well tolerated, he said.

Zeitlin said when requested, the company does provide its drug for free for compassionate use, pending regulatory and ethics approvals. He declined to say how many doses the company provided.

[2] WHO: concern over spread
Date: Thu 20 Oct 2022 9:43 AM GMT+2

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-concerned-about-ebola-spread-latest-eight-cases-not-contacts-others-infected-2022-10-19


The 8 most recent Ebola cases reported during the outbreak in Uganda have no known links with current patients, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday [19 Oct 2022], raising concerns over the spread of the deadly disease.

In a briefing, the WHO said initial investigations into the cases by Uganda's Ministry of Health had shown they were not contacts of people already known to have Ebola.

"We remain concerned that there may be more chains of transmission and more contacts than we know about in the affected communities," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.

There have been 60 confirmed and 20 probable cases since the outbreak began last month [September 2022], and 44 deaths, the WHO said.

The strain spreading in Uganda is the Sudan strain, and the existing vaccines and therapies do not work against it.

However, the Ugandan government is collaborating with WHO to set up a trial of 2 vaccines in the early stages of development which do target the Sudan strain -- one developed by Oxford University and the Serum Institute, and one made by the Sabin Institute in the United States, WHO confirmed.

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said on Saturday [15 Oct 2022] the government was implementing some lockdown measures, including restricting movement and closing places of worship and entertainment, in Mubende and Kassanda districts in central Uganda, the epicentre of the epidemic.

[3] Rise in case numbers

Uganda's Ebola cases rise amid concern over undetected spread
-------------------------------------------------------------
Uganda's health ministry today [20 Oct 2022] reported 4 more lab-confirmed Sudan Ebola cases, a day after the World Health Organization's (WHO's) top official raised concerns about undetected transmission chains and the risk to the country's capital.

On Twitter, the health ministry said there are now 64 lab-confirmed cases. Also, it reported 25 deaths among confirmed patients, 1 more than yesterday [19 Oct 2022].

Earlier in the outbreak, which began in early September [2022], the country reported 20 suspected cases, all fatal. In an earlier risk assessment of the outbreak, the WHO had said the virus may have been circulating as long as 3 weeks before the 1st suspected cases were reported.

Officials also said one confirmed Ebola patient is being treated at the Entebbe National Isolation Center.

Recent cases not among known contacts
-------------------------------------
At a WHO briefing yesterday [19 Oct 2022; https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-media-briefing---19-october-2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the WHO is still concerned about the possibility of undetected transmission chains in affected areas. "The Ministry of Health is investigating the most recent 8 cases, as initial reports indicate they were not among known contacts," he said.

Tedros also said 2 people with confirmed infections from Mubende district sought care in Kampala, increasing the transmission risks in the city. Kampala, the country's capital, has a population of 1.7 million. Last week [week of 10 Oct 2022], the ministry reported the death of a man from Ebola who had fled his village to visit a traditional healer and eventually sought care at a Kampala hospital when he was seriously ill.

The country's health minister, Ruth Jane Aceng Ocero, MBChB, MPH, has urged people to avoid seeking care for Ebola symptoms from traditional healers and to avoid taking taxis when they have symptoms of the virus.

In his comments, Tedros said he's pleased that Uganda has recognized the risks, and he said the WHO and its partners will continue to support the government's efforts to contain the outbreak and prevent it from spreading to other regions and countries.

There are no vaccines or treatments for the rarer Sudan Ebola strain, but the WHO's representative in Uganda, Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, MD, told the Associated Press [https://apnews.com/article/health-east-africa-kampala-uganda-14aa2280e5ca59db09ee4e30762a6d26] that 2 vaccines under development that target the strain will be deployed in about 2 weeks. The vaccines would be deployed as part of a clinical trial, similar to studies that took place with Zaire Ebola vaccines in West Africa's outbreak.

Virus research centre resumes Ebola testing
-------------------------------------------
The Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe has resumed Ebola testing after the Ministry of Health had blocked it 2 weeks ago.

Prof Pontiano Kaleebu, the UVRI executive director, said they had now resolved the matter with the ministry.

"There were some misunderstandings which we have sorted. We had a good meeting last week on Friday [14 Oct 2022] with the minister and other partners and we agreed on moving forward. UVRI is back to testing many samples coming from Kampala but also continues to be the reference laboratory to support the mobile lab," Prof Kaleebu said on Tuesday [18 Oct 2022].

He made the revelation while unveiling the new USD 500 000 (Shs 1.9b) National Institute of Health (NIH) laboratories supported by the US government.

The laboratories will focus on conducting research on viruses of animal origin that infect humans. The labs in partnership with NIH will also strengthen collaboration with international scientists.

"Our lab is a national and regional reference not only for Ebola. We have a plan that our team will be in Mubende this week to support the mobile labs in terms of training but also continue with quality control and assurance so that we do a good job," he added.

[The disagreement between Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and the Health Ministry over disease surveillance mandates and associated deals, had sparked confusion in Ebola virus testing. To read about the problem see https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/inside-the-uvri-moh-fight-over-ebola-testing-3980724]. It is good the problem has been resolved and testing may proceed. - Mod.LK]

[5] Comment on mortality rate

re: ProMED Ebola update (30): Uganda 20221018.8706223
-----------------------------------------------------
With 78 cases and 39 deaths, why is the mortality [case fatality] rate 63%?

On 14 Oct 2022 BNO News reported
Total cases: 78 (58 conf.)
Total deaths: 39 (19 conf.)
Total recovered: 23 (+3)
Case fatality rate: 63%

[ProMED thanks Dr Lenoir for his comment.

The numbers have been hard to pin down, as evidenced in the daily reports. The numbers from BNO News 14 Oct 2022, that is, 39 deaths/78 cases, with 63% mortality come directly from the report. There are now 2 more cases and sadly 1 additional death of a healthcare worker, so 40/80 or holding at 50% mortality of confirmed plus probable cases. I am not sure how BNO calculated 63% no matter how you work the numbers.

Helen Branswell tweeted, "Good that Uganda is posting #Ebola numbers on the Ministry of Health's site. But they have stripped out 20 probable cases -- people with Ebola-like symptoms & likely epi links who died without being tested. They would bring the total to 80 cases, 44 deaths," The CFR would thus be 55%.

The LA Times (17 Oct 2022) wrote, "There are 54 confirmed and 20 probable Ebola cases in the recent outbreak, as well as 39 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (12 Oct 2022)." That is a 72% mortality [case fatality] rate of confirmed cases (53% confirmed plus probable). But this is a little out of date now.

The Reuters report in [1] above from US government sources states 60 infected people and 44 deaths (73%). The WHO numbers are 60 confirmed and 20 probable cases since the outbreak began last month (September 2022), and 44 deaths (55% confirmed plus probable). The health ministry said there are now 64 lab-confirmed cases and 25 deaths among confirmed patients (39% confirmed only).

I don't think we'll have strong numbers on the case fatality rate until the outbreak is over, confirmatory tests are complete, and numbers are tallied. But mortality appears to be in the range of 39%-73%, both too high. Antivirals are on the way, and a vaccine trial will begin shortly. Let's hope both are successful. - Mod.LK
