More than 16 000 cases of brucellosis were diagnosed in Iran during the past Iranian calendar year (March 2018-March 2019), said Behzad Amiri, the head of the zoonotic diseases department at the Ministry of Health.

According to the WHO, brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various _Brucella_ species, which mainly infect cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals, by eating or drinking contaminated animal products, or by inhaling airborne agents. Consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairies as well as contact with an animal or animal product infected with the _Brucella_ bacterium are the main causes of brucellosis, Amiri said.

Western, northwestern, and northeastern provinces are the most affected regions in Iran, he added. "Information dissemination to animal farmers as well as vaccination of livestock have been conducted in this region," he noted.

The disease has been reported in more than a half-million people each year in 100 countries, according to the WHO.

General symptoms of brucellosis are often vague and similar to influenza. They may include fever, back pain, body-wide aches and pains, poor appetite and weight loss, headache, night sweats, weakness, abdominal pain, and cough.

[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications.

In the Maghreb and the Middle East, human brucellosis is usually contracted through consumption of raw goat/ewe's milk or local artisanal cheese made from raw milk, and _Brucella melitensis_ is responsible for the great majority of the reported cases, with a marked predominance of its biovar 3, as in other Mediterranean countries. - Mod.LL
