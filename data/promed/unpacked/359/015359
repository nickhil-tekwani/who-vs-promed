Test confirms H5N1 flu in 4th Afghan province
---------------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry in a 4th Afghan
province, a United Nations agency said on Tuesday [25 Apr 2006], adding
that the disease seemed to be slowly spreading in the country.
Results of tests on 103 samples sent to Italy earlier this month [April
2006] arrived on Monday [24 Apr 2006] and show that Kapisa province to the
north east of the capital, Kabul, is also affected by the disease.
The virus had been found already in samples from birds in Kabul, Logar and
Nangarhar provinces. No human cases have been found.
"According to the results, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
cases have been definitely confirmed in 4 provinces: Kabul, Logar,
Nangarhar and Kapisa," the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
stated. There are also strong suspicions that 2 other provinces -- Laghman
and Parwan -- are affected, but further analysis is needed, it said.
Landlocked Afghanistan, which has 34 provinces, lies at the junction of
Central and South Asia and is on the migration route for several species of
wild birds. [See maps of Afghan provinces at
<http://www.answers.com/afghanistan+provinces?gwp=11&ver=1.0.4.128&method=3>
and <http://www.world-gazetteer.com/maps/m_13.png>].
"Based on the currently available data, it seems that the disease is slowly
spreading," the statement said. The FAO was backing efforts to strengthen
surveillance systems.
Poultry has been culled and quarantine measures introduced in affected
areas, but the spread of the virus among poultry is a big worry in a
country where many farmers and traders are illiterate and have little
knowledge of the disease.

Russian official: country "epicenter" of bird flu
-------------------------------------------------
Russia's chief epidemiologist said the country is now the "epicenter" of
the bird flu virus and the nation was likely to see new cases this summer,
Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday [25 Apr 2006].
Gennady Onishchenko was quoted by Interfax and RIA-Novosti as saying
unusual winter weather patterns in southern Russia, Turkey, and Iran have
forced many migrating birds to nest in unlikely places, explaining early
outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain in the southern region of Dagestan and
other places. "The epicenter of the bird flu virus ... has shifted to
Russia," Onishchenko was quoted as saying by Interfax.
He also said that uninfected migrating birds would reach Siberia and the
Ural Mountains by the month's end [April 2006], and probably become
infected by the summer, RIA-Novosti reported.
Russia recorded its 1st cases of bird flu in Siberia in July 2005. The
virus, including the H5N1 stain, has since been found in birds in other
parts of the country. Russia has registered no cases of human infection.
Russian officials last month [March 2006] said more than 1.2 million wild
and domestic birds had been culled in February 2006 in an attempt to limit
the spread of the disease.

[3] Indonesia (Bali), ducks

Bali ducks positive for bird flu, hundreds culled
-------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of ducks have been culled on Indonesia's Bali island, after
samples tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus, a senior veterinarian
said on Wednesday [26 Apr 2006].
The birds were culled in Gianyar regency on the popular tourist island and
came from a farm and its surrounding areas.
"We burned 432 ducks yesterday; 392 of them came from that farm while the
rest were owned by surrounding residents," Dewa Nyoman Raka Jaya, head of
Gianyar's animal husbandry office, said by phone from the central Bali
town. "We assumed that all of them had the bird flu virus because all of
the samples were positive." [See comment]. "Today, we are chasing chickens
around the farm. We don't know how many but we will burn them tonight,"
Jaya said.
Indonesia has the 2nd highest bird flu human death toll of any country. But
the government has resisted mass culling of birds, citing the expense and
impracticality in a country where keeping a few chickens or ducks in
backyards is common. Culling at selected farms and their immediate
surroundings has been the preferred method.
In Indonesia, the H5N1 virus has been reported in birds in most of the
country's 33 provinces, and there have been previous cullings in Bali. No
human cases have been reported on the island. The World Health Organization
has confirmed 24 human deaths in Indonesia from the virus from a total 32
confirmed cases, the majority in and around the capital Jakarta.
A sweeping door-to-door campaign to try to control the disease in the
capital, home to 12 million people, only got under way at the end of
February 2006.

[In another newswire, 25 Apr 2006, it was said that the birds had been
smuggled to Bali from neighboring Java island and that initial tests
("South Korean-made rapid testing kits") showed that 16 of almost 400 ducks
seized at a house on Bali had the bird flu virus (see
<http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=97238>).
Details of the test performed on the duck farm would be appreciated.
Indonesia's last follow-up report was sent to the OIE on 6 Jan 2006 (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_36.HTM#Sec0>). The report included
information on an outbreak in Bandung, Bali in November 2005. - Mod.AS]
