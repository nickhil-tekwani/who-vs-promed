[ProMED-mail previously posted a report of this outbreak of Legionnaires' disease among British and Spanish nationals who stayed at the AR Diamante Beach Hotel in Calpe, Costa Blanca, Spain (see Legionellosis - Spain: (AN) hotel 20120122.1018077, Legionellosis - Spain (02): (AN) hotel 20120203.1031069, and Legionellosis - Spain (03): (AN) hotel 20120210.1037995). There were previously 16 cases (12 British and 4 Spanish nationals). Now 2 French nationals, who stayed at the AR Diamante Beach Hotel are added to the list of those with Legionnaires' disease associated with this hotel. The death toll remains at 3.

The hotel was closed at some point during the 1st week in February, 2012. As the incubation period is 10 to 12 days new cases may be expected in the coming weeks. We are not told all the countries of origin for this hotel's guests, so that citizens of other countries may be at risk.

For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post: Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142. Dr Steve Berger has noted that rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain (http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It is not known whether this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase in acquisition of this infection.
