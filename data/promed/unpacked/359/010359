Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), South Africa
------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 30 Aug 2013 from Dr Bothle Michael Modisane, Chief Director, Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Animal Production and Health, Pretoria, South Africa

Summary

Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 1 Aug 2013
Report date: 30 Aug 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 30 Aug 2013
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: May 2012
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: LPNAI_Gau2013_001, City of Tshwane, Gauteng
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Jul 2013
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 2000 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: Captive cattle egrets, umbrella cockatoo and eagle owl.

Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost (Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter)
Birds / 0.20 percent / 0.00 percent / 0.00 percent / 0.00 percent [see comment]

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: This outbreak is more than 1000 km [620 miles] away from any other reported H7N1 or H7N7 outbreaks and occurred in species other than ostriches.

There is no evidence to link this outbreak to previous outbreaks. This outbreak occurred in indigenous wild birds and an exotic parrot kept in captivity. The birds were tested for planned export. They tested positive on RT-PCR for H7. The samples did not render enough material to allow sequencing or virus isolation and the N-type could not be determined. It is highly unlikely that further information on the N-type will be obtained. For this reason, the veterinary services decided to report it as a new event.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2012).

Control measures:
Measures applied: Quarantine, Screening, No vaccination, No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Agricultural Research Council - Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (ARC - OVI) (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test / Date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 1 Aug 2013 / Positive

[This event made it eventually to the reporting system, just due to the fact that tests had to be applied to fulfill export requirements. It may be assumed that such (subclinical) infections take place elsewhere in South Africa -- and are not rare in other countries -- without being noticed, unless tests are incidentally applied.

The outbreak statistics -- duly included to fulfill the WAHIS reporting requirements -- are, as indicated, indeed "apparent". It would have helped if the number of sampled/tested birds (out of the 2000 reportedly present), from which 4 were found positive, would have been given.

According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, "Poultry" means:

"All domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose.

"Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, races, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry".

It seems that the South African Veterinary Services regard the described population ("Captive cattle egrets, umbrella cockatoo and eagle owl") as poultry.

On 30 May 2013, South Africa has also submitted follow-up report No 3 on an LPAI H5N2 outbreak in commercial ostriches which had started on 1 Jun 2012, so far causing 12 (submitted) outbreaks in the Western Cape Province (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013813_20130830_114106.pdf). - Mod.AS
