Outbreak of tularemia in central Norway, January to March 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------
>From January to March 2011, 39 cases of tularemia were diagnosed in 3
counties in central Norway: 21 cases of oropharyngeal type, 10 cases
of glandular/ulceroglandular type, 2 of respiratory, and 2 of typhoid
type. 3 cases were asymptomatic and clinical information was
unavailable for 1 case. The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89
years). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An
increased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to
contamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.

Outbreak description
--------------------
>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)
of tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28
cases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in
central Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had
clinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water
from the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella
tularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described
below. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,
involving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one
common source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from
other parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and
8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.

Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.
tularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:
_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,
the infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in
general less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is
common in North America. Several vectors may be involved in
transmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but
infection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).

Several clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and
ulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations
in Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with
contaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more
often seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or
after insect bites (3).

Outbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported
from several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable
disease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were
reported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in
areas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed
previously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia
were reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16
to 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).
This increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned
above.

Diagnosis and clinical presentation
-----------------------------------
In the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation
was fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical
lymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the
remaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as
typhoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was
unavailable for 1 case.

The diagnosis was primarily established by serology
(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),
by _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by
blood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial
isolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the
16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA
PCR (10).

Of the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private
well or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered
water from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1
municipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,
only 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.
Follow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons
exposed to some of the putative water sources.

Discussion
----------
The current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3
counties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with
oropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use
of private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the
most likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.
tularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this
assumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively
common in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are
not available.

The precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.
tularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010
were unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures
increased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of
private wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent
cadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia
may be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion
might be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.

Tularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and
'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as
transmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent
population are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in
the summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be
observed in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,
the Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical
distribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus
timidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible
to this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days
after exposure.

The use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking
water and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of
concern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of
Public Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and
inspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed
cases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the
necessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water
by carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole
where the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well
from contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of
proven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be
disinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for
persons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food
Safety Authority has recently released information to the media and to
the general public with similar advice and information in relation to
the current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality
is responsible for instituting infection control measures including
advice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water
sources.

[Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3).
