Two hundred buffaloes and numerous calves have died of a mysterious disease
in Nangli Punia dairy farm in South West Delhi, India, in the last month.
The farm has been thrown into turmoil as more and more are being affected
while the Animal Husbandry department is still clueless.
Carcasses of at least 15 adults and 20 calves were being hauled away every
day from the dairy farm located on Najafgarh Road, a little ahead of Uttam
Nagar. The Nangli dairy farm is comprised of nearly 3000 small and large
dairy units spread over an area of nearly 100 acres. They were relocated
from various parts of West Delhi on the Najafgarh Road by the Government in
1976. They are the prime suppliers of milk to the all of West Delhi.
The animals die within six hours of being given the antricicide prosalt
injection prescribed by the veterinarian, said a dairy owner, Harish
Sehgal. Unsanitary conditions prevailing in the dairy farm are suspected to
be one reason for this.
Ailing buffaloes secrete excess saliva from their mouth and breath hard. In
a shed or barn, the sick animals are being tied alongside normal buffaloes
increasing the risk to healthy animals.
Each animal is priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. The loss incurred by
the dairy owners is estimated to run into at least Rs 4 crore [Rs 400,000].
