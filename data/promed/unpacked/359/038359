Health authorities say mosquito-borne viruses have killed 4 people in Romania this week, bringing the total deaths from West Nile virus to 21.

The National Public Health Institute [Fri 14 Sep 2018] reported 30 new cases of people getting sick after being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus. It said all the deaths involved people with other health complications.

The 1st deaths were recorded in August [2018] and the virus has made 200 people ill all over Romania. The health ministry called on local authorities to take measures to prevent the spread of West Nile, adding the threat will decline as the weather gets cooler.

It also advised the public to take preventive measures such us using repellents, wearing long sleeves, and covering windows with nets.

The virus is passed through bites from infected mosquitoes.

[2] Germany ex Italy: sequence information
Date: Fri 14 Sep 2018
From: Christian Drosten <christian.drosten@charite.de> [edited]


A patient hospitalized in Berlin since [18 Aug 2018] has been confirmed to have an infection with West Nile virus (WNV). The infection was likely acquired during a holiday trip to northern Italy (Venice area). After his return, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and blood samples taken on [28 Aug 2018] tested positive for West Nile virus RNA. In light of the recent increase of human West Nile virus cases in Southern Europe (see https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc for details) and the lack of any available virus sequences we want to share the WNV genome sequence obtained from the CSF sample of this case.

The full genome sequence is highly similar to that of strain Italy/2014/Verona/35.2 (GenBank Acc no. KP789956), a strain that belongs to genetic lineage II and was obtained from a human case in the same geographic area 4 years ago. There are only 12 nucleotide exchanges across the entire genome of 10 939 nt [nucleotides].

We are making the sequences available on our homepage (https://virologie-ccm.charite.de/). The sequence has been submitted to GenBank for immediate release (GenBank Acc. pending).

Between 7 and 13 Sep 2018, EU Member States reported 150 human West Nile virus infections: Romania (66), Italy (34), Greece (24), Hungary (21), Austria (3), and Bulgaria (2). EU neighbouring countries reported 56 cases: Serbia (24) and Israel (32).

In 4 areas, human cases were reported for the 1st time: Romania (2), Hungary (1), and Serbia (1). All other human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

This week [week of 10 Sep 2018, 19 deaths were reported by Romania (7), Greece (6), Italy (3) and Serbia (3).

In the same week, 46 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (26), Hungary (16), France (2), Greece (1) and Romania (1).

In 2018, as of 13 September 2018, EU Member States have reported 948 human cases: Italy (361), Greece (192), Romania (183), Hungary (155), Croatia (25), France (16), Austria (13), Bulgaria (2), and Slovenia (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 370 human cases: Serbia (286), Israel (81) and Kosovo* (3). To date, 90 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Serbia (29), Italy (21), Greece (19), Romania (19), Hungary (1), and Kosovo* (1).

During the current transmission season, 163 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (92), Hungary (58), Greece (9), France (2), and Romania (2).

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR [United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.

[West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito borne flavivirus in the Japanese encephalitis antigenic group, has caused sporadic outbreaks in humans, horses, and birds throughout many of the warmer regions of Europe for at least 20 years. Occasional cases of West Nile encephalitis have also been associated with infected blood transfusions and organ donations.

"Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the isolates demonstrates the phylogenetic relations, with consequent grouping of the strains into 2 lineages (http://sorveglianza.izs.it/emergenze/west_nile/descrmalattia_persapernedipiu_wnd_en.html):

Lineage 1 is divided into at least 3 classes:
- class A: strains originating from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and America;
- class B: strains originating from Australia (Kunjin);
- class C: strains originating from India.
Lineage 2 contains the prototype strain B 956 and other strains isolated in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Viruses belonging to this lineage have also been identified in Europe (Hungary, Greece, and Italy).

Other lineages were recently proposed for viruses which present considerable genetic differences from the strains of the lineages described to date:
Lineage 3: comprises the viral strain isolated in the Czech Republic in 1997, near the Austrian border, from _Culex pipiens_, called Rabensburg virus.
Lineage 4: to which a single virus isolated in the Caucasus belongs.
Lineage 5: proposed for strains isolated in India and previously classified as lineage 1 class C.
Lineage 6: proposed for Sarawak Kunjin virus strains.
Lineage 7: proposed for the African Koutango virus.
Lineage 8: proposed for sequences found in Spain.

All the isolates responsible for serious epidemics are attributable to lineage 1 and recently also to Lineage 2: strains of both lineages have been shown to be able to cause severe disease in birds, horses and humans; viruses belonging to the other lineages are characterised by low pathogenicity."

"In line with the West Nile virus preparedness plan in Europe, the following terms have been defined (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/about):
- an 'affected area' is defined as an 'area with one or more autochthonous human WNV cases (neuroinvasive and non neuroinvasive), meeting laboratory criteria as per EU case definition' (Directive 2008/426/EC);
- the definition of an 'affected area' equals the definition of an 'area with ongoing transmission of WNV to humans';
- it is strongly recommended that at least the 1st case detected in an area should be confirmed according to the laboratory tests for case confirmation (Directive 2008/426/EC) and not only the laboratory tests for a probable case for the area to be determined as an 'affected area'" -Mod.UBA
