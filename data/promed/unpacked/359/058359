The Monroe County Health Department restated its
mosquito-borne health advisory on Monday [19 Apr
2010], shortly after receiving confirmation of a
new case of dengue in Key West. This is the 1st
reported case since the initial occurrence last
summer [2009]. The last confirmed cases were in mid-October [2009].

"We had hoped we'd be able to eliminate the
disease from Key West and took every effort to do
so," Administrator Bob Eadie said. "However, the
confirmed case is not totally unexpected in that
once dengue fever has been established in an
area, it is truly almost impossible to completely
eradicate it. In cooperation with the Florida
Keys Mosquito Control District, all actions that
can be taken locally are being continued and expanded."

The confirmed case was in a 41-year-old Key West
man who was initially seen at local military
medical facilities on 6 Apr [2010]. He was
referred to Lower Keys Medical Center, which then
referred him to a hospital in Miami. Dengue was
diagnosed based on symptoms and later confirmed
through lab tests. The man, who has since fully
recovered, reported no out-of-country travel within the past year.

The Monroe County Health Department has followed
up with an investigation, the results of which
strongly indicate that the infection was acquired locally.

"Given the facts at hand, the Monroe County
Health Department cannot overemphasize the
importance of Key West residents taking personal
precautions to prevent contact with mosquitoes,"
Eadie said. Recommended precautions include:
- Dumping standing water in and around homes, where mosquitoes like to breed
- Securing screens on windows and doors, ensuring
no holes or tears where mosquitoes might gain entry
- Using air conditioners whenever possible
- Wearing DEET and other mosquito repellents.

Cases of dengue thrive in our island, [Martinique
in the Caribbean], and each week between 35 and
45 people are infected by the virus. The agency
responsible for health surveillance confirms a
rapid increase in dengue cases in our department;
during the week of 3-9 May [2010] more than 340
new cases were identified. The previous week, the
increase was estimated to be 240, which is an
increase 3 times higher than normal in this period.

Health officials are to meet in the coming days
to prepare an inventory of the situation, because
between 35 and 45 new cases are reported each
week. The prevention and awareness to prevent the
development of _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue [virus] vector will be strengthened.

At least 2 people have died of DHF this weekend
in the Central American country of Guatemala.
Health officials said that an 11-year-old girl
and her 47-year-old aunt have died from DHF in
the southern Guatemalan province of Santa Rosa.
Both of them died in a Guatemala City hospital on Friday [14 May 2010].

74 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever were
recorded from Guatemala last year [2009],
prompting a donation of 1.8 million quetzales
(USD 215 600) from the European Union to fight
the fatal disease [virus] transmitted by _Aedes
aegypti_ variety [species] of mosquito.

So far this year [2010], Merida state has
reported 2500 suspected dengue cases, of which
273 resulted positive after studies carried out
by the health agencies of the state.

The information was given out by Nellys Molina,
director of the Health Corporation of Merida
state (CORPOSALUD), who said that the numbers
have been totaled since the month of January
until 24 Apr [2010]. Molina also said that of the
1237 dengue cases registered by Corposalud
through the health centers, the ambulatory and
hospital network of the corporation, 154 cases
are DHF, which have progressed satisfactorily.

According to Molina, the Directorate of
Environmental Health is carrying out pertinent
actions such as [insecticide] fogging with
house-to-house visits, according to the
respective protocols for the application of
fumigation, with the goal of eliminating the
virulence [sic; vectors] of the disease [virus].

The Director or Corposalud indicated that the
municipalities that present high indices of
dengue cases are Alberto Adriani (El Vigia),
Justo Briceno (Torondoy), Sucre (Lagunillas),
Campo Elias (Ejido) and in the jurisdiction of
the capital [Merida] and the Santos Marquina
(Tabay) municipality, and referred to the Chama
basin, "but we are working in order to reverse the numbers," she said.

As for the prevention of dengue, Nellys Molina
stressed the responsibility of the responsible
authorities for cleaning and maintenance of
sewers [and storm drains], which with the
frequent rains accumulate water, a factor that
contributes to the reproduction and increasing
reproduction of the mosquito that is the vector
of the disease [virus]. [Water catchments in and
immediately around buildings are likely to be most important. - Mod.TY]

She added that with the joint efforts of
institutions and community they can reduce the
factors that influence the appearance of outbreaks of dengue.

On San Cristobal Island, a total of 32 classical
dengue cases have been reported and another 500
people have presented similar symptoms that are
yet to be confirmed. In Santa Cruz, there are 27
cases according to news from Ecuavisa.

Brigades from the National Service for Malaria
Eradication Center (SNEM) fumigate areas where
the mosquito vector is presumed to be found.

The classical strain of the virus, transmitted by
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, appeared for the
1st time in the Galapagos in 2002, when 215 cases
were confirmed and the health authorities fought
dengue to reduce the number of infected individuals to zero by 2004.

The authorities consider that the number of
dengue [cases] increase because infected people
move from one place to another within the
archipelago. Up to now, the Isabela and Floriana
Islands have not confirmed any cases.

A total of 766 dengue cases with 2 deaths were
reported for a period of 7 days from 9 May
[2010], an increase of 6 cases or one percent
compared with the 760 cases reported in the
previous week. 6 states showed a rise in the
number of cases reported, namely Selangor (36
cases), Negeri Sembilan (9 cases), Melaka (5),
Terengganu (4), Pahang (2), and Penang (1).

"The number of accumulated cases reported for
this year [2010] was 17 981 cases compared with
20 187 cases for the corresponding period of
2009," said the director-general of health, Tan
Sri Dr Mohd Ismail Merican, in a statement
Wednesday [19 May 2010]. "Although there is a
drop of 11 percent in the number of cases this
year, the number of fatalities also increased by
11 percent from 52 deaths last year [2009] to 58
deaths in the corresponding period of this year
[2010]," he said. The 2 deaths reported last week were from Selangor, he said.

Dr Mohd Ismail said the 2 deaths, which were due
to dengue shock syndrome, occurred in an area
where the rate of _Aedes_ breeding was high,
which was between 2-3.6 percent [household
index], and one of the cases occurred in a dengue hot spot.
