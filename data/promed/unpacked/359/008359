With leptospirosis cases skyrocketing in the Philippines due to
flooding throughout the archipelago, health officials are expressing
alarm over the outbreak and warning citizens to avoid floodwaters or
take precautions if they can't avoid it.

Officials from the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila reported Tuesday [12
Jul 2011] that they have seen 6 people die due to the bacterial
disease since 1 Jul 2011. The hospital has seen 37 total cases in the
time frame.

The outbreak is large and growing. ABS-CBN News reports that Dr
Lyndon Leesuy, program director of the Department of Health (DOH)
Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said a total of 521
leptospirosis cases and 38 deaths were reported from 1 Jan to 25 Jun
2011.

The Philippines health department is warning citizens of the
bacterial dangers that lurk in the floodwaters and what can be done to
prevent potentially deadly infection. Health officials are advising
people to not to wade in floodwaters or if it cannot be avoided, to
wear protective gears like rubber boots to prevent leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by the corkscrew
shaped organism, _Leptospira interrogans_. It goes by several other
names depending on the locale; mud fever, swamp fever, sugar cane, and
Fort Bragg fever, among others. It is a disease of both humans and
animals.

The rat is the main carrier of _Leptospira_. However, other animals,
such as cattle, pigs, horses, and dogs, [can also be asymptomatic
carriers]. People become infected by direct or indirect contact with
the urine of these animals. Contact with urine-contaminated water is
extremely important. Contaminated food and soil containing animal
urine are other potential sources of infection. The bacterium enters
through contact with skin. Especially through cuts or breaks in the
skin and through mucous membranes like the eyes. Found worldwide, it
was long considered an occupational disease (miners, farming, vets,
and sugarcane harvesting and sewer workers); it is increasingly
associated with recreational water sports and camping.

The symptoms and disease, if present, appear in up to 4 weeks after
exposure. Sometimes the person will show no symptoms or mild flu-like
symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), leptospirosis may occur in 2 phases; after the 1st phase, with
fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhea, the
patient may recover for a time but become ill again. If a 2nd phase
occurs, it is more severe; the person may have kidney or liver failure
(jaundice) or meningitis. This phase is also called Weil's disease.

The infection can be treated with antibiotics (penicillin and
doxycycline), especially if started early in the disease. For very ill
patients, intensive care support and IV antibiotic may be necessary.

[Leptospirosis is a disease associated with freshwater flooding. The
Philippines is regularly battered by tropical cyclones that bring
flooding to large portions of the country
(http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/06/25/15-missing-thousands-displaced-in-philippines-flooding/).

Leptospirosis is caused by swallowing _Leptospira_ in contaminated
water or on food, or by absorbing it through cuts in the skin.
Doxycycline has been found to offer some protection against severe
illness. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is
doxycycline 200 mg, once a week for those exposed to contaminated
floodwater or soil. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7
days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist
longer than this. People exposed in flooded fields should be cautioned
against direct contact with contaminated water or mud and should be
advised to use rubber shoes or boots and gloves. Broken skin should be
protected with a waterproof dressing. All food and drinking water
should be protected against contamination. All drinking water should
be boiled unless it is known to be absolutely safe. Fresh vegetables
and fruit should be washed in clean water and then cooked or peeled.
_Leptospira_ exist in the urine of several 'reservoir' species, most
commonly rats, but also other rodents, cattle, pigs, sheep, and
horses. It is usually spread by the urine of a carrier animal that
contaminates water or food. Because rodents are the major reservoir of
_Leptospira interrogans_, rodent control measures should be
undertaken.
