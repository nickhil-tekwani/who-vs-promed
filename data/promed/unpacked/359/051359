Bathing [swimming] was banned along 15 kilometres of the Italian Riviera
yesterday when more than a 100 holidaymakers were taken to hospital after
being infected by toxic tropical algae.
Doctors at Genoa, where most of the victims were treated, said that the
poisonous micro-organisms were almost invisible. _Ostreopsis ovata_ are
single-cell algae normally found in tropical waters but they have migrated
to the Mediterranean because of rising sea temperatures.
Doctors at the San Martino Hospital in Genoa said that the symptoms
suffered by swimmers (children and adults) included nausea, breathing
difficulties, high fever, stomach cramps, irritation of the eyes, vomiting
and diarrhea.
La Stampa newspaper said: "The sea looks inviting during the heat wave. No
one suspected killer algae were lurking in it. It was like one of those
1950s science fiction films about an invasion of deadly germs from outer
space."
Paolo Moscatelli, head of the regional health authority, said that the
infected area had been identified and the situation was under control. But
neighbouring resorts are on alert. Giuseppe Pericu, the mayor of Genoa,
said that he had imposed a ban on swimming along a 15 km (9 mile) stretch
of beach on the Ligurian coast, from Genoa to Bogliasco. Police had been
instructed to impose fines of 50 Euros (ï¿½34.50) [USD 63.80] on anyone
defying the ban and entering the sea.
Silvia Uslenghi, a holidaymaker from Milan, said that people on the beach
suddenly developed headaches and coughing and felt their eyes burning.
Sunbathers who had not gone swimming were affected, suggesting that the
poison was carried in the air.
A 60 year old, who swims regularly on the beaches near the port city, said
that she had first noticed something wrong last Friday, when she went for a
swim and emerged feeling nauseous, to find her eyes puffed up. "Then it got
worse," she said.
The beaches affected include Portofino, which, with its yacht-filled harbor
and ranks of hotels set above a sparkling bay, has become one of Europe's
most exclusive and expensive resorts. It is also where Silvio Berlusconi,
the Italian prime minister, maintains a lavish holiday home.
Also closed were the beaches of the Cinque Terre, the 5 isolated clifftop
villages along the coast from Genoa where motor traffic is banned. The
villages are considered among the most unspoilt spots in Italy, if not the
whole of Europe.
Regional health officials, police chiefs and local authorities had at first
suspected a bioterrorist attack, La Repubblica newspaper reported. Tests
established, however, that the culprit was _Ostreopsis ovata_.

[_Ostreopsis ovata_ is a toxic dinoflagellate. Although the toxin of _O.
ovata_ has not been completely classified, members of this genus have
toxins similar to ciguatera toxin. _O. ovata_ is most often found in the
tropical waters of the Pacific ocean. - Mod.TG]
