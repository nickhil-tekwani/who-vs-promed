The recent illnesses associated with Coca-Cola in Belgium may have been
caused by fears over contamination rather than any impurities in the soft
drink, members of the Belgian health council have said. They said that the
actual levels of contamination found in the soft drink were not high enough
to cause the illnesses reported.
Instead, anxiety following the recent dioxins scare and high media coverage
of the issue may have caused people to react badly to small amounts of the
smell of contamination not in the drink itself.
Professor Nemery and colleagues at the University of Leuven in Belgium and
the University Catholique de Louvain in Brussels published their theory in
a letter to The Lancet medical journal http://www.thelancet.com/ : Dioxins,
Coca-Cola, and mass sociogenic illness in Belgium, Benoit Nemery, Benjamin
Fischler, Marc Boogaerts, Dominique Lison (1999), The Lancet 354 (9172).

Declaring that they have no conflicts of interest, they said the widespread
reports of Coca-Cola "poisoning" were in fact symptoms of mass sociogenic
illness (MSI) -- brought about by society's heightened sense of anxiety
over the safety of products.
"Many features of this outbreak point to MSI, described as 'a constellation
of symptoms of an organic illness, but without identifiable cause, which
occurs among two or more persons who share beliefs related to those
symptoms'," they said.
They said such outbreaks were identifiable by the kind of people reporting
symptoms -- schoolgirls. This combined with the absence of the illness in
other groups of people in the same area, and a high level of unusual
physical or mental stress.
Also characteristic was that information was spread through the media,
health professionals, family or social networks.
The situation in Belgium fitted these criteria, they said.
Outlining events, they said that after it was reported on the evening news
that 26 children from one school were taken to hospital, similar episodes
of illness after drinking Coca-Cola drinks were reported in other schools.
"Most complaints consisted of vague constitutional symptoms and were
transient," they said.
After the health authorities banned Coca-Cola products from sale, hundreds
of complaints of "poisoning" arrived at the National Poison Centre.
However, laboratory analysis showed that many of these complaints were
unsubstantiated.
What analysis of the first -- genuine -- instance revealed was the presence
in some bottles of very low, but odorous, amounts of hydrogen sulphide.
The further complaints were linked with a fungicide that was found in small
amounts on the outside of some cans.
The doctors say it is unlikely that these chemicals, in such small
concentrations, could have had any toxic effect on those who consumed them,
but may have given the drink an abnormal odour or taste.
This was enough, in the population's state of anxiety, to trigger
psychosomatic symptoms, the researchers said.
"The value of proposing this diagnosis is to recognise that victims -- in
this case the community -- need social healing and not medical cure."

[It was not previously reported that the majority of those affected were
schoolgirls. There is a long history in the medical literature of MSI
episodes involving schoolgirls, including some in the USA, and the
occasional adult is also often involved.
Re: "the actual levels of contamination found in the soft drink were not
high enough to cause the illnesses reported", this report says that only
"very low, but odorous, amounts of hydrogen sulphide" were actually found
INSIDE the bottles, allegedly originating from the carbon dioxide used to
put the fizz in the drink (see ref.(03) above). The fungicide "was found
in small amounts on the outside of some cans," not actually in the drink.
Common sense suggests that very little of the bottle or can contents was
drunk once the peculiar smell was noticed, so only very small quantities of
the "very low amounts" would have actually been consumed, making it even
more unlikely that any poisonous quantity was ingested. Those of us who
travel to work over the bridges to Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, or Ilha da
Fundao, Rio de Janeiro, probably daily inhale greater amounts of hydrogen
sulphide from the stinking estuaries than those kids experienced.
But whatever happened to the following claim?
>>>The Belgian Health Ministry said a toxicology center had found cases of
haemolysis -- a blood disorder that causes the destruction of red
corpuscles -- among people who had drunk Coca-Cola.>>> (see first ref.
above)? - Mod.JW
