The number of confirmed cases of _E. coli_ [O157] in an outbreak connected to an Aberdeenshire nursery has risen to 7. NHS Grampian said 3 adults and 4 children were now affected, and there were a further 4 suspected cases, who are all children.

The outbreak centres on the Rose Lodge Nursery School in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, where the 1st suspected case emerged last Sunday, 20 May 2012.

NHS Grampian's health protection team is investigating the source of the outbreak. Staff and parents and carers of all children who attend the nursery have been contacted.

The health board is advising parents to contact their GP or NHS24 if they are concerned about the health of their children, as well as to maintain a good standard of hand hygiene.

Three children who attend the same nursery have contracted _E. coli_. Two are being treated in hospital, while the 3rd has been discharged. Health chiefs are investigating a further 6 suspected cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection in children who attend the Rose Lodge Nursery School in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.

NHS Grampian's health protection team is investigating the source of the outbreak. The nursery remains open. Staff, parents and carers of all children who attend the nursery have been contacted, with information given about the investigation and the control measures introduced, the health board said.

"The investigation is not confined to the nursery, whose staff are co-operating fully with the investigation. The health protection team is continuing to work with Aberdeenshire Council's environmental health team on identifying potential sources of exposure," NHS Grampian said.

[The number of cases has grown from 3 to 7 (with 4 more suspected) in one week. There is no information yet available regarding the source of the outbreak, either introduced from outside with spread in the nursery school or from a food source fed in the school. With 11 cases in a week, the latter possibility seems more probable, since person-to-person spread would seem to progress slower. - Mod.LL
