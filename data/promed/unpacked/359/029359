"More than a dozen" children now have been treated at East Tennessee Children's Hospital [ETCH] for _E. coli_-related illness, officials confirmed [Thu 14 Jun 2018]. The latest patient was admitted to the hospital with a strain of _E. coli_ bacteria related to raw milk consumption, hospital spokeswoman Erica Estep told the USA Today Network-Tennessee.

On [Tue 12 Jun 2018], the Knox County Health Department confirmed that 11 children, all under the age of 4, have been treated at ETCH in the past 2 weeks. There have been no deaths related to the illness.

Officials have declined to give an exact number of children treated for the infection. Some children were treated by their physicians and not hospitalized, Knox County Health Department Director Dr Martha Buchanan said. 7 children currently remained hospitalized, including 2 in the facility's Intensive Care Unit, Estep said.

A majority of the children fell ill after drinking raw milk from a local cow-share diary, French Broad Farm, while a smaller group of children became sick after attending a Mascot day care center called Kids Place Inc., according to the health department.

[It is curious that health department officials "have declined to give an exact number of children treated for the infection." More cases may well occur since the infection has a potentially longer incubation period than many other enteric illnesses and secondary cases, especially in a household to other children, can occur.

Although not specifically stated, the _E. coli_ is certainly an enterohemorrhagic serotype such as O157:H7. Unlike most _E. coli_, these organisms are zoonotic and can be transmitted from raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products. There is some history of possible exposure to farm animals but a clear link of unpasteurized milk through "cow sharing".

In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), _Listeria_ (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _S._ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.

Feeding children unpasteurized milk is clearly inherently unsafe as seen in this cluster of cases. - Mod.LL
