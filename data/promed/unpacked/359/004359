Infections among Injecting Drug Users in the UK
----------------------------------------------
New figures published by the Health Protection Agency show that infections
among injecting drug users (IDUs) are a growing public health concern. The
second annual report, 'Shooting Up - Infections among injecting drug users
in the United Kingdom 2003', brings together information on all infections
among this group.
The data published by the Agency shows that the prevalence of hepatitis C
has doubled between 2000 and 2003 amongst those who have recently started
injecting. The research showed that in 2003 the prevalence among those who
had 1st injected in the last 3 years was 18 percent (67 of 365), double the
prevalence among this group in 2000 (9 percent, 66 of 767) and earlier
years. The report highlights various infections which are problematic in
this group.
In recent years the Agency has also seen a growing problem with injecting
site infections associated with both methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (MRSA) and severe group A streptococcus (GAS). Between Apr and Dec
2003, 18 cases of MRSA blood infection were identified among IDUs.
Laboratory tests of the MRSA isolates show they are different from those
associated with healthcare. GAS reports among IDUs have increased, from
less than 10 per annum in the early to mid-1990s to 160 in 2003.
Outbreaks caused by poor hygiene and possible environmental contaminations
of heroin have also continued. An outbreak of tetanus, which started with
11 cases reported in 2003, has continued into 2004. While during 2003 there
were also 14 reports of suspected cases of wound botulism among IDUs, 7 of
which were confirmed by laboratory tests.
HIV infection remains rare in injecting drug users, although there is
evidence of ongoing and possibly increased transmission in recent years. In
2003 HIV infection was detected in those who had begun injecting in the
last 3 years amongst this group, compared to none in 2000.
Dr Fortune Ncube, who compiled the report for the Agency, said, "This
report is a timely reminder that injecting drug users are vulnerable to a
wide range of infectious diseases. The continued sharing of injecting
equipment and the worsening injection-related hygiene are key factors in
the ongoing transmission of infections in injecting drug users, in
particular amongst those who began injecting in the last 3 years. "
The report highlights a number of priorities for service providers which
will help reduce the burden of infection. These include developing
high-quality needle-exchange services for those unable to stop injecting,
with sufficient coverage to prevent the sharing of needles and syringes,
provision of clear information, advice on safe injecting, access to regular
health checks, vaccination services and ensuring easy access to treatment
and support services for all those who wish to cease injecting, or to
reduce or stop their drug use.
Professor Pat Troop, Chief Executive of the Agency concluded, "Most of
these diseases are preventable and can be treated. It is vital that we
continue to make every effort to encourage and support injectors to protect
their health and also that of the wider population."

Although an effective needle exchange program to minimize blood-borne
infection transfer may minimize hepatitis B and C, bacterial infections due
to streptococci and staphylococci as well as toxemias from clostridrial
infection (tetanus, botulism) will likely persist, as they are related to
the contaminated drug itself or are already present on the skin of the
user. - Mod.LL]
