Below are some clarifications regarding the management of anthrax in Queen
Elizabeth National Park, Uganda.
Due to the textbook caution that carcasses suspected to have died of
anthrax should not be opened, and owing to the difficulty [of handling]
hippos, we did an extensive PM on 6 hippo carcasses, did blood smears using
both Giemsa and Methylene Blue stains, mice inoculations, brain squashes,
staining of the spleen of both the hippos and the inoculated mice, and then
culture. All these showed positive. We further confirmed using PCR from
Robert Kock-Institute, Berlin, Germany, a reference lab, and therefore
concluded the hippos are dying of mainly anthrax.
We have so far lost 287 hippos since July 2004 as follows: July 3; August
107; September 34; October 40; November 31; December 4, totaling to 219 in
2004. From 8 Jan 2005 to the present, we have lost 68 hippos. From the
trend, August was the peak of mortality, gradually declining towards
December. We initially thought it would run its course but were surprised
with the resurgence from January 2005.
So far the source of infection is unclear. Hippo mortalities occurred in
this park in the last 50 years, usually in 10-year cycles. These however
would affect at most not more that 30 hippos and were mainly associated
with "drought," as no diagnosis was made.
Carcass disposal is being done as soon as dead animals are sighted. Both
marine and terrestrial surveillance teams are sent out every morning,
6:00AM and evening, 4:00PM. Depending on the findings, the hippo carcasses
are immediately buried under lime, while other species, especially buffalo,
are burned to ash on site. Ring vaccination of livestock, coupled with
intense community awareness, continues in high-risk areas. The staff
involved have adequate protective gear but are not vaccinated against
anthrax, as the human vaccine is not yet readily available in the country.
Is it practical to vaccinate hippos? Has it been done elsewhere? What was
the success rate -- if any?
The outbreak has been confirmed only in hippos, but 60 buffalo also died
between July and December 2004, while 4 died in January 2005. A few Uganda
kobs and waterbucks (fewer than 10 each) have also died since the outbreak
started.

All cases are actually being investigated. Dr. Fabian H. Leendertz from
the Robert Kock-Institute, Berlin was here in Uganda on PACE/GTZ support 12
Nov - 31 Dec 2004 to help with further investigation. He took with him
water, soil, blood, and other tissue samples, including fish gut. [Their
report confirmed anthrax in samples from 2 hippos. - Mod.MHJ]
Additionally, the Diagnostic and Epidemiology Laboratory of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe is processing 40
samples for shipment to reference laboratories for analysis. These samples
are obtained from the dead animals before they are disposed off. The
species are mainly hippos, but there are also samples from waterbucks,
kobs, buffalo, and one warthog. We continue to investigate other cases as
and when they occur.
Our diagnostic capacity is indeed limited, and this was equally pointed out
in the ToR for Dr. Fabian, and we continue to seek further assistance in
this area. We believe that through this effort, we will be able to build
our own internal capacity.

We last registered a case on 1 Mar 2005, when 2 hippos died. Since then,
our surveillance teams -- both marine and terrestrial -- have not come
across any carcasses, but the surveillance exercise goes on daily.
According to the sample aerial count conducted in August 2004 by UWA, 2632
hippos were counted in Queen Elizabeth National Park. So far, since the
epidemic broke out, 287 hippos died, representing about 10.9 percent of the
hippo population in the park.

The data are still minimal. My concern is more on whether it is truly
persisting, as later cases have not been (are not being) rigorously
investigated, even if they are managing to bury them.
The issue of the skin and flies is an interesting one. In fact, most of the
skin's blood supply is situated in the epidermis; the relatively avascular
thick dermis is probably what you think of as skin. The hippo epidermis is
thin, so the fly hypothesis is quite attractive. I have noticed that
exposed hippos are highly favoured by biting flies, which possibly relates
to the ease of access to superficial capillaries -- and may be why hippos
love water!! I remember seeing hippos rotating continuously in water in
Ngorongoro crater during a fly epidemic some years ago to reduce the trauma
caused from massive numbers of flies.
A critical epidemiological investigation is patently needed.

[_Bacillus anthracis_ will not survive in water in its unsporulated state;
the spores will, though subject to dilution, of course. A number of very
good points have been raised. The very small proportion of deaths
confirmed as anthrax, with a presumption that all the rest are also
anthrax; how to stop the ongoing epidemic and whether hippos can be
usefully darted with Sterne vaccine; what part might biting flies be
playing in the continuing problem; and, as expected, other wildlife species
may be involved. This epidemic has lasted much longer than anyone would
normally expect for anthrax, and the reasons are unclear. Early on there
were some 4 to 7 human deaths (accounts vary) associated with persons
eating these dead hippos. - Mod.MHJ]
