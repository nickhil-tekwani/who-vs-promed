Outbreak of Tularamia in Sweden, Jul-Aug 2003
------------------------------------------------
[For figures, see original document. ­ Mod. LL] Between 1 Jul and 11 Aug,
109 cases of tularemia (_Francisella tularensis_ var _holarctica_) were
notified to the Swedish Institute of Infectious Diseases
(Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI) (figure 1). 60 per cent of cases are men and
most of the cases have been people of active working age (table 1).
Typically, most cases are clustered tightly by geography. The locations and
the total number of cases vary markedly from year to year (figure 2).

The ulceroglandular form of the disease dominates, with most cases
reporting a mosquito or tick bite at the site of the ulcer and subsequent
lymphadenopathy. This is consistent with the presentation during previous
years in Sweden (1). This year, a few clusters with respiratory disease
probably due to inhalational exposure have also been reported. These cases
are typically in farmers, with onset of disease within a few days of
working with hay. Similar inhalational exposure of farmers has been
reported in previous outbreaks in Sweden and Finland (2,3). Depending on
the route of exposure, tularemia may also present in the oculoglandular and
oropharyngeal forms (4).
In addition, _F. tularensis_ has also been diagnosed in postmortem analyses
of 2 hares from one of the affected counties by the National Veterinary
Institute (Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt, SVA) (5). Reports of dead
hares, voles, and other small rodents around the areas with human cases
have been included in many case notifications. The reservoir of _F.
tularensis_ in nature is unknown, although its survival in water and mud
together with the apparent distribution along lakes and rivers in Sweden
and eastern Europe is suggestive of a water associated reservoir (4).
Mosquito bites, owning a cat, farming, and visiting wooded areas were
identified as independent risk factors for tularemia in a recent Swedish
case control study (1). In this study, 16 per cent of the cases were
admitted to hospital. Tularemia is responsive to antibiotic treatment, if
begun within 1 week of onset of disease. With adequate treatment, mortality
due to infection with _F. tularensis var holarctica_ is very low. No deaths
due to tularemia in Sweden have been reported to SMI during this season.
The early start of tularemia notifications together with the rapid increase
in number of notifications during the first weeks suggest an epidemic year
in Sweden. Despite the proximity of some of the affected areas to the
Norwegian border, no cases had been notified in Norway by 11 Aug (6). In
Finland, dozens of cases have been reported from the areas affected during
the 2000 epidemic (7).
Tularemia continues to warrant vigilance during late summer and early
autumn in the Nordic countries. Early identification of case clusters is
useful for correct clinical management of cases. Research is needed to
identify the natural reservoir and other environmental factors contributing
to annual changes in incidence. Natural early warning signals might even
allow preventive measures in affected geographical areas.

[ProMED-mail's posting on tularemia in the Nordic countries in 1995
(Tularemia - Sweden, Finland 19950831.0779), written by one of the authors
listed above, included the following: "Tularemia occurs very seasonally in
the Scandinavian countries. Variations in numbers of rodents (lemmings,
hares, etc.) are great between years, as is availability of breeding places
for mosquitoes in late spring.
"In Sweden, human outbreaks have been registered every 5 to 10 years during
this century. In the intervening years there may be none or only a handful
of cases reported. The largest recorded outbreak happened in 1966-67 when
over 2800 people (mainly farmers) got the pneumonic form of tularemia. The
route of transmission was dust from dead rodents or rodent excrement, which
people inhaled when cleaning hay barns in late winter.
"For each of the last 10 years, there have been less than 10 reported cases
nationwide. This year, 39 cases have already been reported during the two
last weeks of August alone. There has been an unusually 'rich' mosquito
year in central Sweden this summer, which could be part of the explanation.
Few of the cases seem to have had any direct contact with rodents, and for
three of them the only possible risk factor seems to have been 'playing golf'.
"The risk for visitors to Sweden should be minimal, unless one intends to
go hunting or camping in the forests of the counties of Dalarna,
Gastrikland or Halsingland." ­ Mod.LL]
