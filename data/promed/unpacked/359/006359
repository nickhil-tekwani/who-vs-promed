[A resident] of the Ozurgeti district [of the western Georgian
province of Guria] has been admitted to hospital with symptoms of
rabies following a bite from a pet rabbit, according to Paata
Imnadze, the head of the National Center of Disease Control. [The
29-year-old was admitted to Kutaisi hospital 2 days ago,] with
symptoms of hydrophobia (rabies). The patient stated that that a pet
rabbit had bitten him. [Veterinarians are examining the rabbit for
evidence of rabies virus infection.]
According to the Ministry of Health of Georgia, last year [2006], 48
000 persons sought medical attention following animal bites, and 38
600 were vaccinated. During the 1st 3 months of the current year
[2007], 8000 persons have been bitten by animals. Paata Imnadze noted
that the majority of people had been bitten by domestic cats and
dogs, although there have been rare cases of bites by other animas
including one case of bite by a tortoise.

[It is not clear from this report whether the diagnosis of rabies in
either the human patient and/or the pet rabbit has been confirmed.
The circumstances of exposure are certainly unusual, but not without
precedent. A paper in the Journal of the American Veterinary
Association in 2005 (15; 227(6): 932-5, 918), reported
raccoon-variant rabies had been confirmed in 7 pet rabbits and one
pet guinea pig in New York State, and post-exposure treatment was
required in several adults and children. It was recommended that
bites and scratches to humans from rodents and lagomorphs should be
evaluated for potential rabies exposure on an individual basis, with
consideration of whether the animal was caged outside or permitted
outdoors unsupervised. - Mod.CP
