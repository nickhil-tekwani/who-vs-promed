The Junta [governing body] has closed a water source in the municipality of Darro (Granada) after confirming that it has been the source of infection of a serious outbreak with about 90 cases of gastroenteritis that has affected adults and children, although only 4 of them have had to spend a night in hospital. Sources from the Ministry of Health have reported that the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis initially reported by Ideal newspaper on Wed 24 Jul 2019, was detected on 17 Jul 2019 and that after confirming its waterborne origin, the source in which the causing bacteria were localized has been closed.

The Junta has carried out "exhaustive analyses" that have confirmed that the public water supply network is "in perfect condition", so it has conveyed a message of tranquility to the population, which can consume this drinking water without any risk to health. Following the suspicion that the outbreak of gastroenteritis was waterborne, the Public Health Epidemiology Unit and the Health Protection Unit of the Northeast Granada Area launched an action protocol.

After different controls of the municipality's public supply network, it is concluded that the controls of drinking water during that period had been satisfactory. In a statement, the Board has pointed out that it is "customary" among the residents of the town, about 1500 inhabitants, to drink from this source of untreated water.

[Knowing whether the patients had fever and whether the symptoms were primarily vomiting or diarrhea would be useful in speculating about a potential etiology of the cluster. It is also possible that the outbreak could be due to more than one pathogen. - Mod.LL
