The following background information on endemic typhus in the United States
were accessed from the GIDEON software program.
In this case, we might be dealing with _Rickettsia felis_ rather than
endemic typhus (_Rickettsia typhi_). The two diseases are clinically
similar, and exhibit serological cross reaction. _R. felis_ infections are
described in Texas and California (notably Los Angeles and Orange County).
Infested fleas are identified in Texas, California, Louisiana and New York
State. A history of contact with, or proximity to the reservoir (opossums)
may be helpful.
19,663 cases of endemic typhus were reported during 1944 to 1953 (5,401 in
1944); 812 during 1954 to 1963; 315 during 1964 to 1973; 588 during 1974 to
1983. 33 cases were reported from Los Angeles during 1984 to 1988 (cats and
opossums implicated as reservoirs); 50 cases nationwide in 1990; 43 in 1991
(22 in Texas); 28 in 1992 (18 in Texas); 25 in 1993. The disease is no
longer nationally notifiable as of 1994.
Two deaths were ascribed to this disease during 1982 to 1991; 0 in 1992; 0
in 1993; 0 in 1994; 0 in 1995.
The cat flea (_Ctenocephalides felis_) is an important vector in Texas and
California.
