[1] Eradication prospects
Date: Wed 26 Nov 2014
From: Steve Berger <steve@gideononline.com> [edited]


Although measles rates have declined dramatically during the past 4 decades, a recent upsurge reflects sub-optimal enforcement of vaccination in many countries. In the following graphs, I've summarized reported measles incidence and estimated vaccine uptake by region. http://www.GIDEONonline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/MeaslesSummary.png.

Note that vaccination rates remain below 80 percent in 3 WHO regions (African, Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asian), while they exceed 90 percent in the other 3 (European, American and Western Pacific) [1,2]

[2] Powder measles vaccine trial

A measles vaccine made of fine dry powder and delivered with a puff of air triggered no adverse side effects in early human testing, and it is likely effective, according to a paper to be published on 28 Nov 2014 in the journal Vaccine. The paper is now available online.

In 2013, measles killed 145 700 people, most of them children, according to the World Health Organization. That's despite the fact that the conventional injectable vaccine against the measles virus is effective.

"Delivering vaccines in the conventional way, with needle injections, poses some serious challenges, especially in resource-poor parts of the world," said Robert Sievers, co-author of the new paper and a fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and also a professor in the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

His team innovated a dry delivery technique for the measles vaccine to eliminate the need for injections, liquid storage, and other challenges, such as vaccine contamination. "You don't need to worry about needles; you don't need to worry about reconstituting vaccines with clean water; you don't need to worry about disposal of sharps waste or other vaccine wastage issues; and dry delivery is cheaper," Sievers said.

[The following is the full accompanying statement from: Natural Sciences, Research, Academics, Outreach, Global Engagement, Institutes, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science (CIRES), Natural Sciences: "Delivering vaccines in the conventional way, with needle injections, poses some serious challenges, especially in resource-poor parts of the world," said Robert Sievers, co-author of the new paper, a fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and also a professor in the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

The new paper represents the 1st successful Phase I clinical trial for a dry powder vaccine, he said. Sievers and his co-authors identified no adverse effects of the powdered and inhaled vaccine when tested in 60 healthy men who were already immune to measles. In this safety-focused clinical trial, they tested delivery with 2 [trademarked] devices -- the Aktiv-Dry PuffHaler and BD Technologies Solovent -- compared with the usual under-the-skin liquid injection method.

"Out of an abundance of caution, we test 1st in people who have already had the disease, or been injected earlier by needles with liquid vaccines," he explained. The men in all 3 groups responded similarly, with no clinically relevant side effects and some evidence of a positive immune response to vaccination. Because the men were already immune to the disease, this experiment could not yet compare effectiveness of the vaccines, measured by immune response. That will be the primary goal of follow-on Phase II/III pivotal trials. "It is very good news that we encountered no problems, and now we can move on," Sievers said. The next phase of tests could include work in people who are not yet immune to measles, including women and children.

The authors of the new paper include researchers from the Serum Institute of India, Ltd., in Pune, India, which is the largest manufacturer of childhood vaccines used in developing countries; an Indian medical college; a North Carolina medical technology company; and the Georgia-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several of the authors also are affiliated with the Boulder company Aktiv-Dry, LLC, where Sievers is president and CEO.

In preclinical research, Sievers' team has already demonstrated that the vaccine protects rhesus macaques and cotton rats from infection by the measles virus. The researchers also have shown that their dry vaccines can be safely stored for 6 months to 4 years at room temperature or in refrigerators kept at 36-46 F (2-8 C), respectively.

This work was funded in part by a USD 20 million grant from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, which was created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. CIRES is a partnership of CU-Boulder and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In the last 17 weeks, there were a total of 511 cases [of measles], and in some areas, the number of cases is rising exponentially. The outbreak is also spreading to new areas inside the country. Most of the cases (54 percent) were not vaccinated or were partially vaccinated (15 percent), mainly due to the war in the 1990s.

A measles outbreak was declared in Slovenia on Thursday [27 Nov 2014] after 5 out of 11 suspected cases had been confirmed by laboratory tests.

The patients are suspected to have contracted the virus at a recent dog show.

11 laboratory-confirmed measles infections were identified in England with onset dates in July to September 2014 compared to 16 cases in the 2nd quarter of the year [2014]. This brings the total confirmed infections for 2014 to date to 99. 10 of the 11 confirmed infections this quarter were identified in London with 5 linked to a nursery. Only one case was reported from the rest of England. Across the UK, Scotland identified 4 new infections, Northern Ireland reported one and Wales 2 in the same period.

5 of the 12 English cases in the quarter were linked to recent travel abroad; one case each to Thailand, China, Indonesia, Australia and Philippines. Measles virus sequences were obtained from 11 out of the 12 English cases, one of 4 Scottish cases, 2 of 2 Welsh cases, but no sequence from Northern Ireland.

Seven cases were in children below the age of 15 years, and the remaining 4 cases were adults aged 20 to 33 years. No case this quarter reported receiving a measles-containing vaccine.
