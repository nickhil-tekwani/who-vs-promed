The Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan today [3 Oct 2006] announced the
results of the investigation into an outbreak of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection involving children in the South Kazakhstan Region
[Oblast]. Of 10 175 children at risk, 9032 children (88.8 percent) have
been screened for HIV infection.
HIV infection has been confirmed in 72 children and in 7 mothers. Six
children among those infected have died, and one has been adopted and left
Kazakhstan. It was not possible to survey 1143 children (11.2 percent),
because some had left the region and the parents of 56 children declined to
have their children tested. It was not possible to trace the addresses of
659 children. The Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan has indicated that
further attempts are being made to identify all those at risk.
According to a Regnum News Agency correspondent, three patient samples from
South Kazakhstan are undergoing testing at the Republic Centre for HIV/AIDS
Prevention in Astana [the capital of Kazakhstan]. Previously 83 blood
samples had undergone additional testing there: 72 were confirmed positive
and 8 only were negative.

[On 20 Sep 2006 ProMED-mail reported that 55 children had been diagnosed
HIV-positive (see: HIV, nosocomial transmission - Kazakhstan
20060920.2689). According to the latest information supplied by the Kazakh
News Agency "Gazeta.kz" <http://www.gazeta.kz/art.asp?aid=81607>, the
number of infected children in the south Kazakhstan region has risen to 75
as of Thu 5 Oct 2006.
Yerbolat Dosaev, the Minister of Health of Kazakhstan, has confirmed that
the large number of pediatric cases in the South Kazakhstan Region was a
consequence of poor standards of hygiene during blood transfusion, the
re-use of disposable equipment, and shortcomings in the system for
registering blood donors.
The precise circumstances of this escalating epidemic of HIV infection in
children in the South Kazakhstan Region are not fully identified in this
and the preceding report, apart from general deficiencies in health care in
South Kazakhstan and an association with blood transfusion and injections.
It may be that the practice of transfusing red blood cells to sick children
in order to combat anaemia may have continued locally in South
Kazakhstan. If blood is transfused without adequate testing for
blood-borne pathogens, there is a risk of transmission of HIV and other
agents. Likewise the re-use of inadequately sterilised needles and
syringes could contribute to the spread of blood-borne infections.
