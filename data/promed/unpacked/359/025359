Having spread to Baden-Wurttemberg [Germany] and eastern France, the
bluetongue disease advances towards Switzerland. The arrival of the animal
illness in our country, transferred by midges, seems inevitable.
Consequently, the Federal Veterinary Office, in consultation with the
Cantonal veterinary offices, has declared the entire territory of
Switzerland as a surveillance [restriction] zone. The already countrywide
running monitoring is intensified. Bluetongue disease is harmless for humans.
Until now, only the canton Schaffhausen was declared as a surveillance
zone. Since the disease is advancing towards the national borders and in
view of the relative small size of our country, the entire country has been
declared a surveillance zone, starting on Wednesday [10 Oct 2007].
The aim of this declaration is early discovery of the disease, if it
penetrates the country. Surveillance activities have been undertaken for
several months in more than 160 sentinel cattle holdings. This will now be
extended to include insect monitoring throughout the country. Exported
ruminants will have to be tested prior their transportation.
At present, animal traffic within Switzerland is not restricted. In case
the disease is recorded, restriction zones will be applied within a 20 km
radius of the affected cases.

There are unconfirmed reports that the Bluetongue Protection Zone has been
expanded following the discovery of the disease in Essex.
If confirmed by DEFRA today [10 Oct 2007], it will be the 1st clear
indication that the disease has spread beyond the local area near Ipswich,
where it was 1st discovered [indeed, confirmed; see 3. - Mod.AS].
While this is a worrying development, particularly for those now drawn into
the zone, it will reportedly bring 2 more abattoirs into the Protection
Zone. This would help to alleviate the desperate shortage of slaughtering
capacity in the Protection Zone.

DEFRA today [10 Oct 2007] announced that the existing Bluetongue Control
and Protection Zones are being extended following confirmation of further
cases of Bluetongue in Essex.
The UK Bluetongue Control Strategy and EU legislation require that the
zones be extended due to the proximity of these cases to the boundary of
the existing Control Zone.
Fred Landeg, deputy chief veterinary officer said: "Finding further cases
is not unexpected, particularly given the nature of the disease and its
spread by midges, and we expect to see more cases before the end of the
active midge season this winter [2007-2008]. If we are to contain disease
within the Control and Protection Zone, we must have an accurate picture of
how far the disease has spread. Therefore, I continue to urge all farmers
to remain vigilant, check their animals twice daily and report any sign of
disease immediately."
Further information is available to farmers via the DEFRA helpline (0845 9
335577) and website <http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007//default.htm>.
Animal Health has also sent information letters and leaflets to all farmers
within the previous Bluetongue Control Zone and Protection Zones and have
sent voicemails to livestock keepers within these zones when the disease
was confirmed as circulating. Farmers can also call the Animal Health 24
hour recorded information line (0844 884 4600) for up-to-date information
on the latest developments.

[The EU has published an updated map of the European BT restriction zones;
on the map, all of Switzerland has now been colored red; there are red
("restriction") areas also in other countries bordering the 5 BTV-8
infected countries, namely in Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.
The rapid and massive spread of BTV-8 in Europe is amazing. Until the late
1990s, BTV activity was restricted to the areas south of latitude 42. Its
reported confirmation, in Yugoslavia, 2001, as far north as 45 degrees was
regarded as an alarming surprise (see 20011122.2864). Nobody anticipated
that a bluetongue strain, hitherto exotic to Europe, would be threatening
central Europe from the north carried by a highly efficient vector, a cause
for grave concern, indicating the need for enhanced epidemiological effort
to uncover the source and dynamics of the BTV-8 epizootic and to assess the
potential of the wide array of insectborne diseases of man and animals,
which may follow a similar route. Entomological research deserves to be
prioritized.

3rd international bluetongue symposium, held in Taormina, Sicily (Italy)
from 26-29 Oct 2003. The proceedings are included in issues 3 and 4 of
