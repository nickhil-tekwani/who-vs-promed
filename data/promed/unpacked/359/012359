The Kyoto Prefecture announced on 3 Jun 2022 that 3 men aged 22 to 23 who ate at a restaurant "Kirakuya" in Miyamaki, Kyotanabe City, complained of diarrhea and fever, and that _Campylobacter_ was detected in 2 of them. The Fuyama Castle North Health Center has determined that it is food poisoning and has suspended the store for several days.

According to the Yamashiro Kita Health Center, a group of 5 people visited the restaurant on the night of 24 May 2022 and ate chicken thigh sashimi, and yakitori. Everyone is said to have already recovered. According to the prefecture, 30-90% of chicken in the distribution stage is contaminated with _Campylobacter_, and the prefecture says to "heat chicken to the center and do not eat it raw."

[The classical reservoirs for the transmission of campylobacteriosis to man are unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked chicken.

The following is extracted from a 24 Jan 2017 article in Food and Wine magazine:

"Most often referred to as chicken sashimi or chicken tartare, raw chicken is served on many a menu, though you'd be hard-pressed to find it at any ol' neighborhood establishment. By last count, the specialty is offered at only a few select spots in the country; Ippuku in Berkeley, California, is perhaps the best known. It's more widely offered in Japan though, especially in hubs such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. But even there, people have been cautioned against taking a bite of undercooked chicken. In July [2016], Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare warned that food poisoning is a serious risk of eating raw chicken, and asked restaurants to reevaluate their preparation practices -- requesting chicken meat be cooked to a 75 deg C [167 deg F] internal temperature before it's served -- to make it safer to ingest.

"Chicken sashimi is often prepared by boiling or searing chicken for no more than 10 seconds, 'which is an insufficient treatment to kill harmful microbes such as _Campylobacter_ and _Salmonella_ ... on raw poultry,' says Michael Doyle, regents professor of food microbiology at the University of Georgia's Center for Food Safety.

"According to the ministry, _Campylobacter_, a bacterium often found in the intestines of the chickens, is the culprit behind raw-chicken-related food poisoning. The bacteria is believed responsible for 60% of all bacterial food poisoning cases in Japan, according to the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.

"And, as Doyle says, _Campylobacter_ isn't the only concern around the dish. _Salmonella_ can be a problem as well. Chicken sashimi is typically thinly sliced or cubed from the inner breast of a chicken, the part of the chicken that carries the lowest risk of _Salmonella_ contamination. However, some restaurants -- especially some more daring establishments in other countries -- cut chicken sashimi from thighs, liver, or the outer breast, where the bacteria can be more common.

"That brings us to the big question: Should you eat it? 'I would be very cautious with raw chicken, even if it is lightly cooked,' warns Claire Shorenstein, MS, RD, and CDN, who adds that the 1st step to safely eating chicken sashimi should always be to find out the chicken's origins and how it was raised. 'You need to know where it came from,' she says, unequivocally.

"Most restaurants that serve chicken sashimi work closely with small farms to ensure the chickens are raised to the highest standards, and come in as fresh as possible, as Ippuku founder Christian Geiderman told Newsweek in 2013. In other words, it's really not something you can ensure for yourself at home as a sashimi aficionado.

"At a restaurant, if it's not made clear on the menu, don't hesitate to ask your server from where the chicken was sourced and what precautions have been taken to keep any bacteria at bay, Shorenstein says. 'Raw chicken is not commonly seen on any standard menus,' she says, so servers are probably used to fielding these queries.

"And one last warning: Your chicken sashimi-salmonella risk increases if you are pregnant, very young or old, or immune-compromised. Anyone in these conditions should avoid raw chicken all together, Shorenstein says. So, consider chicken sashimi an 'eat at your own risk' kind of dish."
