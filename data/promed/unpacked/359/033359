About 800 people in Mufulira were treated at 2 hospitals for stomach
and other complications after they consumed water supplied from
Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) underground source.
Copperbelt Minister, Mwansa Mbulakulima, said yesterday [3 Jan 2008]
in an interview that 500 people were treated at Ronald Ross Hospital
while close to 300 were attended to at Malcolm Watson Mine Hospital on
Wednesday [2 Jan 2008] as the Government constituted a team to
establish the cause of the pollution.
But in a statement released yesterday [3 Jan 2008], MCM chief services
officer, Passmore Hamukoma, said "We received a number of complaints
from people living in Kantanshi Township -- abdominal pains -- after
drinking tap water. Over 350
people were attended to, 25 had genuine stomach complaints, and 5 were
hospitalized. So far, 4 have been discharged and the remaining one is
in a stable condition," he said. Mr Hamukoma said the pollution was
caused by a pump failure in the
leach section of the mine on the 520-metre (1706 ft) level.
"Irrigation from the surface was immediately reduced to restrict the
volume of raffinate entering the underground workings. As a result of
this and other emergency measurers only minor contamination of water
being pumped to surface occurred and supply to the treatment plant was
halted," he explained.
Mr Mbulakulima said, on the other hand, that he and other officials
who included provincial Permanent Secretary, Jennifer Musonda,
conducted an on-the-spot check at the 2 hospitals from late afternoon
on Wednesday [2 Jan 2008] up to 19:30 hours. The minister said at
Malcolm Watson Mine Hospital, initially 397 people were attended to
but the number rose to 500 in the evening.
At Ronald Ross Hospital, 212 people were treated up to early
afternoon but the number increased to about 300 after people who had
initially thought they had 'minor' stomach complications realised
that the problem was as a result of water pollution from the mines.
Mr Mbulakulima said sensitisation and an effective water testing and
monitoring process should be put in place now because the problem was
a serious one.
Employees interviewed yesterday [3 Jan 2008] said the acid which was
used in the InSitu Leach section spilled over after the pump failure,
and when the dewatering process started, traces of acid were also
pumped out and eventually got into the Mulonga water system.
The polluted water was pumped to the Kantanshi, Kankoyo, Butondo, and
Fairview areas of the town centre from the Mine Site water treatment
plant supplied from MCM.
Mr Mutale, who was in the company of engineers and National Water and
Sanitation Council (NWASCO) director, Oswald Chanda, indicated that
the acid had been cleared in the system and hoped that by the end of
the day yesterday [3 Jan 2008], supply could be restored.
Mr Mwandila said he had arranged a council fire tender, while MCM had
also released its machine, to distribute water to the affected areas as
an interim measure. He said he was part of the team constituted to
look into the cause of the pollution. Others were Mr Mutale, MSD
officials, Environmental Council of Zambia representatives, Mufulira
District Commissioner, Dyford Muulwa, and a representative from the
provincial administration.
On Wednesday [2 Jan 2008], residents almost rioted after some people
who had consumed polluted water were rushed to the hospital, prompting
authorities to deploy police officers in the 3 affected townships, the
town centre and other strategic areas. Police sealed off the hospital
premises as residents in panic thronged the area to check the
condition of the patients.

[According to the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition
(1997) raffinate is the phase remaining after extraction of some
specified solute(s). When necessary it should be further specified,
such as, scrub raffinate. The original meaning of raffinate as a
'refined product' has become extended and changed by common usage.
The term should normally be applied only to waste streams but the
latter may form the feed to a further extraction process for another
solute. [Extracted from: <http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05122.pdf>.]
The article seems to indicate it is part of the waste product. It
would be nice to know the exact content of the raffinate and the
concentration.
There are 2 distinct types of copper ore, the sulfide ore and the
oxide ore. The oxide ores are generally leached. First the copper ore from
an open pit mine is blasted, loaded, and transported to the primary
crushers. Then the ore is crushed and screened, with the fine sulfide
ore (about 0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of
copper. The coarser ore goes to the heap leach, where the copper is
subjected to a dilute sulfuric acid solution to dissolve the copper.
Then the leach solution containing the dissolved copper is subjected
to a process called solvent extraction. The concentrated copper solution
is dissolved in sulfuric acid and sent to the electrolytic cells for
recovery as copper plates (cathodes). [Extracted from:

If it is sulfuric acid, it could cause acute stomach upset. Other
clinical signs associated with ingestion of sulfuric acid include
breathing difficulty due to throat swelling, burns in the mouth and
throat, drooling, fever, rapid development of low blood pressure,
severe pain in the mouth and throat, speech problems, vomiting, with
blood and likely vision loss. However, we still don't know the level
of sulfuric acid in the water or how much water the patients consumed
to demonstrate clinical signs. - Mod.TG.
ProMED does not usually post reports of chemical poisoning, unless the
outbreak was initially suspected to be due to an infectious agent or
toxin. But this was a large outbreak. Fortunately, the source
appears to have been quickly found and dealt with. ? Mod.JW.
The Mopani Copper Mine, located in Mufulira, in the Copperbelt
Province of Zambia, is one of the largest in Zambia's copper belt, as
well as one of the world's largest mines. It can be seen on the
