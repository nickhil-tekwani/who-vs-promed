Mystery virus which killed 3 identified
---------------------------------------
The mystery virus that created a panic of sorts among the medical
fraternity in Ahmedabad [Gujarat] following the death of a patient,
her consulting doctor, and nurse, has been identified, state Health
Minister Jay Narayan Vyas [in Gandhinagar] Tuesday [18 Jan 2011].
According to the Minister, a sample sent to the National Institute of
Virology, Pune [Maharashtra], has been identified as Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) [virus].

A woman from Kolat village of Sanand Taluka near Ahmedabad was
admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad in the 1st week of
January [2011] after she was reported suffering from a mysterious
fever. The patient subsequently died. There was consternation in
medical circles when her consulting doctor, who had examined her,
also passed away as did the nurse, who had attended to her.

Vyas said that the state government was not taking chances and a team
of experts headed by Kamlesh Upadhyaya has been constituted to take
charge of the matter. "Survey teams have fanned out in a 5 km [3 mi]
area of the village to which the patient belonged to carry out a door
to door check," he added.

Meanwhile, a team from Delhi is expected here in the next 2 days to
conduct a study. Municipal health authorities said that random
sampling was being done in the city hospitals to check if there was
any spread of the virus.

[The previous post in this thread predicted that the undiagnosed
fever might be caused by Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. The
confirmation above becomes the 1st report in ProMED-mail of the
occurrence of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in India. It
is likely that CCHF virus is present ticks in the vicinity of Kolat
village and their eradication should be undertaken.

This report records a 3rd death. The deceased are the patient, the
attending physician, and the ICU nurse. The condition of the victim's
husband who is being treated in hospital is not revealed. - Mod.CP]
