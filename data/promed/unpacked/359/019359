The serious response level under the Government's Preparedness Plan for influenza pandemic was activated today (1 Jun [2012]) as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) investigated a case of influenza A H5 [N1?] infection affecting a 2-year-old boy.

The patient developed fever and runny nose on 23 May [2012] in Guangdong province. He came to Hong Kong on 26 May and sought medical attention from a private medical clinic in Mong Kok. Subsequently, he developed febrile convulsion and was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre on 28 May. He was admitted for suspected encephalitis. He is now in stable condition.

A spokesman for the CHP said that the nasopharyngeal aspirate taken from the boy tested positive for Influenza A (H5). Further studies on the virus were in progress.

Investigation revealed that the patient lived in Guangdong province with his parents and maternal grandmother. His exposure history during incubation period is pending.

His home contacts were asymptomatic.

"The CHP is also closely liaising with the Mainland authorities and the Hospital Authority to monitor the situation," the spokesman said.

He advised members of the public that the best way to combat influenza infection was to build up body resistance by having a proper diet with adequate exercise and rest. "Good ventilation should be maintained to avoid the spread of respiratory tract infection. Members of the public should seek medical consultation promptly if they develop influenza-like illness. Members of the public should also avoid direct contact with poultry and birds, and if contacts have been made, they should wash hands thoroughly with soap and water," the spokesman said.

[The final typing of the virus is awaited, but presumably the infection is due to influenza A H5N1. The infection was acquired in Guangdong province, but details of the circumstances there, including possible contact with poultry or wild birds, are awaited. Avian influenza virus A H5N1 has been found several times in wild birds in China and poultry and has been responsible for human fatalities this year as well. A published article cited in ProMED-mail archive stated, "Since 2003 to 06 Jan 2012, the number of laboratory confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza in China was 41 and 27 were fatal. However, the official estimate of the H5N1 case-fatality rate has been described by some as an over estimation since there may be numerous undetected asymptomatic/mild cases of H5N1 infection."
