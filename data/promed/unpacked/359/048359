BLUETONGUE IN GREECE, Confirmation of diagnosis
See also: 20 November 1998
Emergency report (cont'd)
------------------------
(see Disease Information, 11 [46], 161, dated 20 November 1998 [This was a
brief report of disease suspicion. - MHJ]
Text of a fax received on 23 November 1998 from Dr Vasilios Stylas,
Director of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
-----------------------------
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 29 October 1998.
-------------------------
Location of the outbreaks
--------------------------
- Island of Rhodes, Dodecanese prefecture (south-eastern Aegean Sea,
between 35o and 36o N)
- Island of Kos, Dodecanese prefecture (south-eastern Aegean Sea)
Background - Surveillance for bluetongue:
-----------------------------------------
The last occurrence of bluetongue in Greece was recorded in the island of
Lesbos, eastern Aegean Sea, in 1979. The main vector of bluetongue
(_Culicoides imicola_) is present all year round in several Greek islands
of the eastern Aegean Sea, including the island of Rhodes, but not in
mainland Greece.
In view of the risk of incursion, routine sero-surveillance for bluetongue
has been carried out in all Greek islands of the eastern Aegean Sea since
the early '90s within the framework of the _Brucella melitensis_
eradication programme.
The results of sero-surveillance for bluetongue obtained in the period
May-October 1998 were the following:
- Island of Rhodes: 1,560 samples, all negative;
- Island of Kos: 324 samples, all negative.
It is concluded, therefore, that until October 1998 there was no suspicion
of bluetongue in either island.

Events leading to suspicion and confirmation:
---------------------------------------------
1) Serological findings
On 29 October 1998, two blood samples collected from sheep in Rhodes tested
positive for bluetongue by ELISA, raising suspicion of disease.
>From 3 to 10 November 1998, targeted serological surveillance was carried
out in Rhodes and Kos with the following results:
- 112 blood samples out of 189 tested positive for bluetongue in both
AGID(1) and ELISA(2),
- positive samples were collected from nine sheep flocks in four villages
in Rhodes and one sheep flock in one village in Kos.
2) Virological findings
A cytopathic effect has been observed in BHK(3) and VERO(4) cells. Virus
isolation,
identification and typing is still in progress, but preliminary results
indicate bluetongue virus (BTV) type 4.
3) Pathological findings
On 3 November 1998, pathological findings compatible with bluetongue
infection were
observed in one sheep in Rhodes.
4) Clinical findings
>From 10 to 13 November 1998, an intensive clinical inspection for
bluetongue was carried out in Rhodes and Kos, with the following results:
- In Rhodes, typical signs of active bluetongue infection were observed in
21 sheep flocks from seven villages, while strong suspicions were raised in
two more villages.
- In Kos, similar clinical signs were observed in two sheep flocks in one
village.
Overall mortality, so far, was approximately 14%.

5) Epidemiological findings
---------------------------
In September-October 1998 high temperatures (> 20o C) and humidity (80%)
were recorded in Rhodes, while the prevailing winds were blowing from the
north-northeast.
All known infected villages in Rhodes are concentrated in the
northern-northeastern part of the island. The spatial distribution of
infection appears to support the hypothesis that the bluetongue incursion
was due to an invasion of infected wind-borne vectors from the
north-northeast. Two scenarios are possible:
- mass initial invasion of infected vectors causing a large number of
primary infections in many animals/flocks/villages, or
- low-level and localised initial infection with subsequent short-distance
spread by indigenous vectors, after they had become infected.
The situation may be clarified in the light of large-scale serological
surveillance and an entomological survey currently in progress.
Control measures:
-----------------
The following measures are being applied in Rhodes and Kos with a view to
controlling and eventually eradicating the disease:
1) Emergency disease control measures, applicable in the first instance:
- Suspension of movements of all susceptible animal species into and out of
the entire Dodecanese prefecture (18 islands in all).
- Slaughter and destruction of all animals infected or suspected of being
infected, on the basis of clinical signs.
- Spraying, with an approved insecticide, of all susceptible animals and
likely habitats of vectors.
- Census and clinical surveillance of all susceptible animals in the
Dodecanese prefecture and other islands of the eastern Aegean Sea.
2) Disease eradication measures, applicable in the second instance:
- Two-stage serological surveillance, as follows:
a) Stage A: sampling of 100% of susceptible animals present in the infected
villages in Rhodes and Kos.
b) Stage B: sampling of 100% of cattle and goats and of 10% of sheep
(random sample) in 100% of sheep flocks present in non-infected villages in
Rhodes and Kos.
c) In the event of positive findings during Stage B, a screening scheme as
in Stage A will be implemented.
- Slaughter and destruction of seropositive animals.
- Continuation of spraying with insecticide.
- Continuation of clinical surveillance.
- Emergency vaccination is NOT contemplated.
----------
(1) AGID: agar gel immunodiffusion.
(2) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
(3) BHK: baby hamster kidney.
(4) VERO: African green monkey kidney.

[A quick check of the atlas shows that these two islands are some 50 miles
apart and in between is the Turkish peninsula of Resadive Yarimad. If the
infected midges were blown from nearby Turkey, which I have no reason to
doubt, the Turkish area with Bluetongue/Blue Tongue must be extensive,
stretching from the NW to the SE of Mugla. Turkey has not reported this
disease to OIE, at least during the last 18 months. - Mod.MHJ]
