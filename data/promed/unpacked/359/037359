Young boy dies of rabies in Kyzylorda
-------------------------------------
A 5-year-old boy has died in hospital in Kyzylorda from rabies virus
infection. It has become clear that 2 months ago he had been bitten by
a dog. His parents decided to take him to hospital when he developed
signs of the infection. It was too late for immunization
[post-exposure prophylaxis] and it was not possible to save him.

Stray dogs are increasing in numbers in Kyzylorda city. According to
an official report since the beginning of the year 200 people have
been bitten by stray dogs, including 70 children. According to a city
official, they have no budgetary resources to enable them to
"eliminate" stray dogs. The magnitude of the problem is illustrated by
the fact that 177 homeless dogs had been collected from just 2 streets
in the course of a single day.

[Kyzylorda Oblast is a province of Kazakhstan. Its capital is the city
of Kyzylorda, which has a population of 159 000 approximately. The
whole province has a population of about 590 000. The
Russian-administered Baikonur, which houses the Baikonur Cosmodrome is
located in this province. A map of Kazakhstan, showing the location of

In designing a control strategy it will be relevant to establish the
proportion of homeless dogs transmitting rabies virus infection. -
