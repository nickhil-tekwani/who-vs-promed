A child is dead and 14 others were rushed to hospital with flu-like symptoms on [Wed 4 Apr 2018] from a First Nation west of Calgary [Canada].

The precise cause of the incident is unclear, but Emergency Medical Services [EMS] said it appears to be "some type of illness" and that the patients exhibited "influenza-like symptoms."

Paramedics responded to a residence on Stoney Nakoda First Nation, a community about 60 km [about 37 mi] west of Calgary, just before noon. Inside the house, paramedics found 2 children in "severe medical distress," according to Stuart Brideaux, a public education officer with EMS.

One child died at the scene, and the other child was rushed to hospital in serious condition, Brideaux said.

[Another] 13 patients -- 9 pediatric patients and 4 adults -- were also transported to hospital. Most are in stable condition.

A family member told CTV Calgary that the child who died was only 4 or 5 months old. CTV Calgary reports that some people in the house had been sick for days with respiratory issues.

A medical examiner is expected to arrive at the residence Wednesday night [4 Apr 2018], an investigator from Cochrane RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] said.

The patients ranged in ages from 4 months to a male in his late teens, Brideaux said. The young victims were brought to the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary via ambulance.

Throughout the day, people were seen entering the home to offer hugs and condolences. At least six RCMP vehicles were parked outside the property. The family was too upset to speak on camera, Stoney Nakoda Emergency Services Security told CTV Calgary.

Officials are now investigating the origin of the incident. Brideaux said the cause appears to be "medically based," and officials do not believe trauma or a noxious substance, such as carbon monoxide, played a role. "At this time, EMS is working to sort out the potential origin of the circumstances," he said.

The relationship between the 15 individuals, including whether they were related, has not been determined. Earlier in the day, EMS reported that 14 children and one adult were involved, but later clarified the numbers.

The Ministry of Indigenous Services has reached out the Stoney Nakoda First Nation to offer support and is in the information-gathering stage, CTV News has confirmed. Minister of Indigenous Services Jane Philpott is aware of the incident.

[The news report above describes an outbreak of an acute influenza-like respiratory illness that apparently involved 15 people whose ages range from a few months to late teen years from a single household in an Indigenous community near Calgary, Canada. The individuals in the household were said to have been sick for several days. The illness was fatal in an infant and required hospitalization in the other 14.

The severe cold, snowy weather at this time of year in Calgary would facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens for those living in crowded homes. Respiratory pathogens that are highly transmissible and have a short period of time between infection and becoming contagious, resulting in a large number of cases becoming ill over a short period of time, would include the influenza viruses A or B (incubation period of 1-2 days). Other respiratory virus, such as human adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumoviruses, have slightly longer incubation periods (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327893/). Certain types of human adenovirus cause outbreaks in closed settings, such as military barracks and college dormitories, where crowding and environmental contamination appear to facilitate transmission (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16960774&dopt=Abstract).

Community outbreaks of bacterial pneumonia, usually due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, or less commonly _Staphylococcus aureus_, occur (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/5/11-0235_article), especially following influenza. _Haemophilus influenzae_ is another bacterial pathogen that can cause pneumonia after influenza. ProMED-mail recently reported that since the introduction of the _H. influenzae_ type b vaccine in 1992 in Canada, _H. influenzae_ type a is now the most common _H. influenzae_ serotype in the North American Arctic; the highest rates are among Indigenous children (ProMED-mail post Haemophilus influenzae, type a - Canada: Indigenous populations, vaccine 20180308.5672904).

The Stoney Nakoda are an Indigenous people in Western Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakoda_(Stoney)). They live in a community about 60 km (about 37 mi) west of the city of Calgary, in the southern portion of the Canadian province of Alberta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary).

More information on this outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection in a First Nation household would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
