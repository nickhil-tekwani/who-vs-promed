A 27-year-old man succumbed to rabies at the civic-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital [Maharashtra state] [on 13 Dec 2013], taking the toll of deaths due to the infection to 15 in the city so far this year. Civic officials said the man had been bitten by a dog near his right ankle 5 months ago [July 2013] and that he had taken anti-rabies vaccines on scheduled days. However, doctors he was taking treatment from did not administer rabies immunoglobulin that can [inactivate] the virus. "The victim was not from Pune city. As per our medical records, he was a resident of Bhosari [Maharashtra state] and was admitted to Naidu Hospital when his health condition deteriorated," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

The deceased has been identified as a resident of Alandi road in Bhosari. He was walking on the roadside when a stray dog bit him 5 months ago. According to the World Health Organization [prediction], the incubation period for the infection is typically 1-3 months, but may vary from one week to one year. "It was a category III dog bite wound. As per the medical history given to our health staff by the victim's relatives, the victim received anti-rabies vaccination on the scheduled days at some hospital in Pimpri Chinchwad. However, he was not administered rabies immunoglobulin, readymade antibody and is extremely effective in inactivating the virus in category III dog bite injury," said Anjali Sabne, deputy medical officer of health, PMC. The victims are usually injected with a fast-acting readymade antibody, rabies immunoglobulin (RI), near the wound, to inactivate the rabies virus. The readymade antibodies are given to the patient for immediate protection because the vaccine generally takes 14 days to [induce] antibodies. As per WHO guidelines, rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) should be given for all category III exposures, irrespective of the interval between exposure and beginning of treatment.

The victim developed mild fever and breathlessness a few days before he was admitted to PMC-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on [12 Dec 2013]. "He had developed symptoms of rabies, like hydrophobia (fear of water), and was extremely breathless at the time of admission. He succumbed to rabies infection at 12:30 pm on [13 Dec 2013]," Sabne said. The hospital he initially sought treatment from could not be identified. He was brought to Naidu hospital by his relatives.

An 11-year-old girl from Bibvewadi [Pune, Maharashtra state] died of rabies infection on [4 Dec 2013]. Her parents had alleged that she was administered anti-rabies vaccines but not inoculated with rabies immunoglobulin in and around the wound, which is a prerequisite if the bite wound is serious. However, doctors had refuted the charge.

An average of 1000 dog-bite cases are being reported in the city [Pune] every month, with as many as 12 319 cases recorded from January to November, this year [2013]. A total of 14 people have died of rabies in Pune city in this period, 3 of whom were local residents. Densely populated areas of Gadikhana, Mandai, Shukrawar Peth, Bajirao Road in the heart of the city, Yerawada, Hadapsar, Kothrud and Sahakarnagar have reported the highest number of dog-bite cases this year. According to the Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India, greater awareness about rabies and timely treatment, combined with efforts at controlling the stray-dog population, pet-dog licensing and annual anti-rabies vaccination of animals, are necessary to control the infection.

[This account describes the unfortunate outcome of anti-rabies treatment that varied from the strict protocol advised by the WHO and other medical authorities. While this was clearly a rare event, visitors to India should avoid situations where they may be in contact with free-ranging urban dogs, and if bitten should be aware of the essential treatment response. - Mod.CP
