S. Korea begins slaughtering pigs on island after [hog] cholera outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Health authorities have begun slaughtering more than 1000 pigs after
confirming an outbreak of [hog] cholera at a local livestock farm, said
agriculture ministry official Cho Nam-Nan.
The ministry said some of 1300 pigs at a farm on Ganghwa, an island off the
western port of Incheon, were found to have the infectious disease. The
official added that the movements of animals and humans coming in and out of
the island are now strictly restricted. State-run Yonhap news agency said
the quarantine measures, including a transport ban, will affect 49 500 pigs
at farms on the island.
South Korea reported [that during] a similar [hog] cholera outbreak in April
2002 more than 92 000 pigs [were killed] to contain the disease.
