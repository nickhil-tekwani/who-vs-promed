Authorities in south China's Guangdong Province confirmed a new H7N9 bird flu case on Sunday [15 Dec 2013]. A 39 year old man has been hospitalized and is in a serious condition, the provincial health authorities said in a statement. The statement said the resident in Dongguan City tested positive for the virus on Saturday [14 Dec 2013] in a local hospital, and the result was confirmed on Sun 15 Dec 2013 by the provincial disease control centre.

No abnormality has been reported from the 53 people who had close contact with the patient, it said. The Chinese mainland has reported 141 human infections of H7N9 so far. Earlier this month [December 2013], Hong Kong also confirmed its 1st 2 H7N9 cases, including an Indonesian national and a mainland resident.

A 39 year old Dongguan man is in critical condition after being diagnosed with the deadly H7N9 bird flu strain, Guangdong health authorities announced yesterday [15 Dec 2013]. Respiratory disease specialists from the provincial disease control centre and Guangzhou Medical University's First Affiliated Hospital had been sent to treat the Fenggang town resident, Xinhua reported.

Health workers have examined 53 people identified as having had close contact with the patient. So far, none have tested positive. They were given the antiviral drug Tamiflu [oseltamivir].

Early last month [November 2013], a 3 year old Dongguan boy was confirmed to have contracted the virus. He was discharged from hospital after treatment. The new Dongguan case comes just days after health authorities closed 2 wet markets in Shenzhen's Longgang district where H7N9 had been found. Hong Kong has seen its 1st 2 confirmed cases of the bird flu strain since 2 Dec 2013.

A spokesman for the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection said the Guangdong health authorities had informed it about the new Dongguan case. The spokesman said the centre was closely monitoring the situation and was following the advice of the World Health Organization.

[Avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses that normally circulate among birds. A number of human infections of the H7N9 virus have been reported in eastern China, mostly in the Yangtze River Delta region since late March 2013. Some of the patients have died of severe pneumonia brought on by the virus. The characteristics of this new case are consistent with those of previous cases: direct infection from poultry (often traded in wet markets), no onward transmission to other humans, and frequently severe illness with fatal outcome particularly in elderly patients with co-morbidities. Recent cases in Guangdong province may have resulted from a relaxation in the marketing of poultry. - Mod.CP
