Chikungunya, a viral disease, is on the rise in the state. Deputy chief
minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan said yesterday [1 Oct 2009] that until last
year [2008], there had not been any reports. However, there were 397 cases
so far this year [2009]. He said that even though the disease was
spreading, it was not that serious.

The latest reported cases occurred in Sibu last week [week of 26 Sep 2009].
20 people, aged between 7-73, and living on the banks of the Rajang River,
opposite Sibu town, and in Selangau, were hospitalised in Sibu hospitals.
All, except 3 in the Sibu general hospital, were discharged by Monday [28
Sep 2009]. There have also been cases reported in Betong and in Kuching.

In his briefing on the latest situation on the haze, the dry spell, and the
influenza A (H1N1) in the state, he said people who contracted the
chikungunya [virus] in infected areas brought the disease into the state.
State Health Department deputy director Dr Faizul Mansor said they were
investigating the source of the spread of the disease in Sibu.

The disease is transmitted to humans by the virus-carrying _Aedes_
mosquitoes. Chikungunya [virus infection] causes an illness with symptoms
similar to dengue fever. The fever lasts only 2-5 days and is followed by
prolonged pain of the joints that can last for weeks or months.

Dr Chan also warned people in the state to brace for another 2-3 weeks of
the dry spell and poorer air quality due to the haze. He said weather
forecasters at the Meteorology Department have predicted that rain could
only be expected in the middle of October [2009].

Areas in the state with the poorest air quality yesterday [1 Oct 2009] were
Samarahan, Bintulu, Sibu, and Sri Aman.

[It would be of interest to know if these cases were laboratory confirmed
as chikungunya virus infections.
