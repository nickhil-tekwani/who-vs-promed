Bed bugs find warm reception on their return to the West
---------------------------------------------------------
Bed bugs are staging a big come-back in developed countries around
the world, including Britain, it was claimed yesterday.
Once common, the blood sucking insects were virtually driven out of
bedrooms by the 1980s. But since 1995 there has been an unexpected
increase in reports of bed bug infestation in Britain, the United
States, and other developed countries. Experts say one theory is
that the creatures may be developing resistance to pesticides.
The bed bug's return is revealed this month by the Institute of Biology.
Clive Boase, of the Haverhill-based company Pest Management
Consultancy, wrote in the Institute magazine Biologist: "Data from
some sources indicate that, since the mid-1990s, the numbers of
reported infestations has almost doubled annually, although numbers
are nowhere near those of pre-war levels."
Bed bugs, which measure up to 5 mm across, thrive in warm surroundings,
making their homes around mattress seams, in bed frames, behind headboards or
skirting boards, and within furniture and electrical fittings. Even when
deprived of blood, individual bugs can survive a year or more, allowing
infestations to persist in empty properties or stored furniture.
In heated premises with an adequate food supply, a small starting
population of bed bugs can develop into several thousand within a
year.
Various theories have been put forward to explain the return of bed
bugs in countries which had previously banished them, said Mr Boase.
It had been suggested that previously bed bugs had suffered
"collateral damage" caused by broad-spectrum insecticide sprays used
against other pests such as cockroaches and ants. Now, specific
targeting of pests using bait products was allowing the bugs to
"escape". However, Mr Boase said it was unlikely that
kitchen-focused spray treatments would have ever held bed bugs in
check.
An alternative theory was that the bugs were becoming resistant to
pesticides. Recently, a study from East Africa had shown an
association between the use of pesticide-treated mosquito nets and
the growth of resistance in bed bugs. The pesticide involved, a pyrethroid,
was a type widely used in bed bug sprays in developed countries.

[The original article by Clive Boase was published in the Biologist
(see refs below), a publication of the British Institute of Biology.
The British media picked up the story and it was aired on the BBC
News on 14 Apr 2004, and summaries printed on the same day in several
newspapers including The Times and The Independent as well as in the
The Scotsman, who incidentally misspelt throughout their report Mr
Boase's name as Bose.
The 2 common bedbug species that feed on humans are _Cimex
lectularius_, widely distributed in tropical and non-tropical
countries, and _Cimex hemipterus_, commonly called the tropical
bedbug, is essentially a species of Old and New World tropics,
although it is found in warm areas of some non-tropical countries
such as Florida in the USA.
It is true that since about 1995 bedbugs seem to have increased not
just in the UK, but elsewhere in Europe and in the USA.
Several decades ago during slum clearance in inner cities in the UK,
people who were rehoused in newly built homes were again soon
pestered by bedbugs, because they took them with them in their beds,
mattresses, and other furniture, and to a lesser extent in
hand-baggage such as suitcases.
Although hepatitis B surface antigen can exist for about 6 weeks in
bedbugs and be passed out with the feces, thereby seemingly posing
the danger that it may be scratched into skin lesions, there is no
evidence that such transmission is important, or even occurs.
Similarly HIV can survive on bedbug mouthparts for about an hour, but
there is no evidence that HIV is transmitted by the bugs.
Nevertheless, repeated feeding by large numbers of bedbugs have been
reported as causing anemia in infants, while their persistent biting
can cause sleepless nights, and in some people also severe allergic
reactions. Bedbugs also feed on pigs and poultry; _C. lectularius_
sometimes becomes a pest of commercial poultry in North America and
Europe, causing anemia in the birds
Bedbugs have developed resistance to several insecticides including,
as reported in the press releases in some areas, to pyrethroid
insecticides. For example, in Tanzania, there have been reports of
resistance to alphacypermethrin and permethrin, insecticides commonly
used for impregnating bed nets for control of anopheline vectors of
malaria.
