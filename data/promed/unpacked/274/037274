Burundi health officials act to check polio
-------------------------------------------
Following 2 reported cases of polio in Burundi's northwestern province
of Cibitoke, the Health Ministry and the World Health Organization
(WHO) have begun a 3-day immunization campaign, targeting at least 1.5
million children under 5, officials said. "By Tue 27 Oct 2009, initial
estimates indicated that at least 75 percent of the children targeted
were immunized in the 1st 2 days," Olivier Kagabo, head of the
national immunization department, said. "But we expect [to immunize]
more children on [28 Oct 2009] as parents generally come on the last
day."

Kagabo said local administration officials were assisting health
officials to mobilize parents to take their children for immunization.
Kagabo stressed that even vaccinated children should get the new
vaccine since "it is different from the routine vaccine they were
getting."

Burundi had eradicated polio for 10 years but 2 children caught the
disease in September [2009] following [importation] from neighbouring
Democratic Republic of Congo [DR Congo]. "The virus, wild poliovirus
type 1, originated from India and was imported into Angola and DR
Congo and reached Burundi last month," Kagabo said. A 2nd immunization
campaign will be held in November.

[The Republic of Burundi lies in the Great Lakes region of Eastern
Africa bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and
south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Its size
is just under 28 000 square kilometers with an estimated population of
almost 8 700 000. It is to be hoped that the prompt response of the
authorities in Burundi will prevent spread of the imported infection
and return the country to its disease-free status.

Polio outbreak in Swat
----------------------
Health officials say 13 cases of polio have been confirmed in
Pakistan's volatile Swat District over the past 4 months, mainly
because vaccinators have been unable to access children there for more
than a year. Fierce fighting between government troops and Taliban
militants, which began in May [2009], has displaced hundreds of
thousands of people from Swat. Before the army campaign in the area
which ended in July [2009], militants had prevented access for
anti-polio teams.

"The Swat District currently has a polio outbreak. However, the good
news is that we were able to immunize children who had left these
areas. Upon their return we were able to immunize a significant
proportion of children during a campaign in September [2009]," Melissa
Corkum, polio programme coordination specialist with the UN Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Islamabad, told IRIN.

She said a 3-day anti-polio campaign in Swat had begun on Mon 12 Oct
2009. "This time I will get my one-year-old daughter protected against
polio. My son, who is 5, has had drops several times before. Once I
took him to a hospital in Peshawar to get them, because the Taliban in
control here at that time said anyone vaccinating children would be
punished," Imran Gul, a Swat resident, told IRIN.

A total of 62 cases of polio have been confirmed so far this year in
Pakistan, with 35 in North West Frontier Province and the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas. "These include 12 cases in the
militancy-hit Bajuar Agency and 13 in Swat District," NWFP Health
Director-General Fazal Mahmood said. "The good thing is that most
people are conscious they have missed out on vaccinations and are keen
to get them now," said Hassan Khan, a Mingora-based physician.

According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and Afghanistan
are among 4 countries in the world where polio is still considered
endemic.

[Together with Afghanistan, India and Nigeria, Pakistan remains one of
the 4 countries where polio is considered to be endemic. Up to one
million people are now internally displaced in Pakistan due to recent
conflict in the Swat Valley and the current military campaign in
Waziristan. The prospects for the polio eradication programme remain
challenging, but the cessation of fighting in the Swat Valley together
with the return of some of the population may facilitate the
resumption of routine immunisation.
