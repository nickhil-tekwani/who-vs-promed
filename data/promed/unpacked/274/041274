There has recently been increased interest in the identification of mycotic
infections in Infant Pulmonary Hemorrhagic Syndrome. _Stachybotrys atra_ has
been associated with these findings. There have been cases in Cleveland OH
associated with _S. atra_ that came from water damaged homes / apartments.
_S. atra_ is black or green-black and has a slimy appearance. The mold
primarily grows on cellulose products that have become damp from water
damage. Environmental Health magazine (Apr. 1997) had a brief write up in
these regards. Other good sources of information might be the CDC or your
local Veterinarians. Veterinarians may be superior sources of information
about _S. atra_.
