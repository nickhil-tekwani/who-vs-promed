More than 60 hospitalized with typhoid in south Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------------------------------
More than 60 people have been hospitalized in southern Kyrgyzstan with
suspected typhoid over the past 3 weeks, according to local health officials.
Tynybek Jorobaev, director of the provincial sanitary and epidemiological
control center, told IRIN on Wed, 19 Oct 2004, that well over 60 people had
been hospitalized in the village of Burgandy in the Nooken district of the
southern Jalal-Abad province. "The diagnosis has been confirmed in almost
40 cases, and 70 percent of the infected patients are schoolchildren," he said.
According to the Kyrgyz health ministry, the outbreak takes the number of
typhoid cases reported in Jalal-Abad to 80 since the beginning of 2004.
Nurbolot Usenbaev, deputy head of the National State Sanitary and
Epidemiological Control Department (NSSECD), told IRIN from the capital,
Bishkek, that the number of typhoid cases nationwide was almost 5 times as
high as in 2003, reaching 255.
Local experts blame the consumption of contaminated water and contacts with
carriers of the disease as the root causes of the [spread of the]
infection. In an effort to mitigate the risk, health teams on the ground
are monitoring households in the area, conducting disinfection activities.
The distribution of clean potable water by special vehicles has been
organised, and local authorities have allocated additional funds to
purchase disinfectants.
The issue is aggravated by the fact that only 20 percent of Burgandy's
population of some 14 000 people have access to safe drinking water, Nooken
district administration officials said. The local inhabitants and the
authorities in Jalal-Abad hope that safe drinking water projects
co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the local communities
could be a solution. However, this programme covers only 130 villages out
of more than 420 in the area. Water supply systems have been installed in
23 settlements so far.
