News
-----
Organization of a motorized caravan in Butembo:
- On Wed 28 Aug 2019, the Sub-Coordination of the Response to Ebola Virus Disease organized, through its communication commission, a motorized caravan in the Katsya Health Area in Butembo in North Kivu Province;
- This caravan was intended to [promote] the end of Ebola in this health area. For the response teams, this is an opportunity to spread the message that it is possible to end Ebola in Katsya;
- More than 100 taximen from various associations of Butembo motorcyclists supported, by their participation, [the] caravan, which is part of the large parking of the taximen of Vubange located in the Katsya health area, passing through Base, the main artery of Butembo, the Takenga roundabout, the avenue of schools to fall by the esplanade of the office of the district of Vutetse where the population met;
- In total more than 500 people, coming from here and there in the community, rushed through the motorized caravan in the health area and went to participate in an educational comedy that embellished this mass activity;
- The comedy conveyed as the main message, the measures to be observed to avoid Ebola virus contamination. These include the importance of hand washing, denouncing and going to the nearest health facilities on time to ensure the reasons for the signs displayed, the need for vaccination and the lifting rumors about [the] ETC;
- This day ended with the game of questions and answers around messages transmitted through comedy.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 206 774 people have been vaccinated. The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points
-------------------------
- Perturbation of activities at the PoC [sanitary control point] Vulindi (Butembo): It is an attack of the incivists not otherwise identified, whose provisional report mentions 2 firearms taken from the soldiers committed in support of this PoC, and a tax collector stabbed while the daily receipts were swept away by the same assailants. The same attack also had repercussions on the activities at PoCs Kangote and Parking Victory.
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of travelers checked (temperature measurement) at the sanitary control points, until 26 Aug 2019, [is] 88 945 794.
- To date, a total of 98 entry points (PoEs) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[Note that the number of infected healthcare workers has increased by one to 156. The DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) said in an update that one of yesterday's 8 cases involved a health worker, raising the total number infected in the outbreak to 156, which includes 41 deaths. The report said the worker was vaccinated, but it's not clear how long ago he or she was immunized. See http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/news-scan-aug-27-2019. - Mod.LK]

[Washington Post, abridged, edited]

A 9-year-old Congolese girl who tested positive for Ebola in neighboring Uganda has died, officials said Friday [30 Aug 2019], as the World Health Organization said that the outbreak has neared 3000 cases.

The young girl's body will be repatriated with her mother back to Congo for a funeral, according to Dr. Eddy Kasenda, Ebola representative in the Congolese border town of Kasindi. "We are finalizing the administrative formalities so that the body is repatriated and buried here in Congo, her native country," said Kasenda. "We are collaborating with the health services of neighboring Uganda and we will strengthen the sanitary measures here in Kasindi."

A Ugandan official at the hospital where the girl had been in isolation confirmed her death overnight. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

The girl, who was traveling with her mother, was identified at a border screening Wednesday [28 Aug 2019] as a possible Ebola patient and isolated. Although cases of cross-border contamination have been rare, this case highlights the risk of Ebola spreading across the border into neighboring Uganda and Rwanda. Borders in the region are often porous, and many people traveling at night use bush paths to cross over.

In June [2019], a family of Congolese with some sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path. Two of them later died of Ebola, and the others were transferred back to Congo.

"It is critical we continue to be on high alert in high-risk areas and empower communities to be prepared in order to contain the virus," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said after a case of Ebola case was confirmed in Uganda.

[2] Summaries
- Thu 29 Aug 2019. New Ebola case confirmed in Uganda as DRC tops 3000
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/new-ebola-case-confirmed-uganda-drc-tops-3000
[Byline: Jim Wappes]

Uganda has had a 2nd incursion of Ebola from the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 2.5 months after 3 cases were imported in June (2019).

Ugandan officials confirmed Ebola in a 9-year-old DRC girl who crossed from the DRC with her mother yesterday [28 Aug 2019], Uganda's Ministry of Health said in a news release today [29 Aug 2019]. The news comes as Ebola cases in the DRC top 3000 and deaths exceed 2000.

Quick identification of symptoms: The mother and daughter crossed into Uganda through the Mpondwe border post in Kasese District, the same district that reported the 3 earlier cases. A point-of-entry screening team recognized the girl's high fever, body weakness, rash, and unexplained bleeding from her mouth and isolated her.

The girl has been transferred to Bwera Hospital's Ebola treatment unit (ETU), located in Kasese near the DRC-Uganda border. The earlier patients were also treated in that ETU. Testing by the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe on blood samples from the girl confirmed Ebola virus infection.

Ugandan health officials said she did not come into contact with anyone but her mother since entering Uganda. "The Ministry of Health re-echoes its call to the general public to cooperate with health workers, Immigration and Security officials to ensure effective screening at all entry points to prevent the spread of Ebola to other parts of the country," the agency said in the release.

Bwera is located 472 km (about 300 mi) from Kampala, Uganda's capital.

The new case represents the most recent expansion of the disease from its main hot spots in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. In addition to the previous cases in Uganda, on 14 Jul 2019 officials confirmed the 1st case in Goma, North Kivu's capital, and a 2nd case in Goma was confirmed on 30 Jul 2019.

Then on 16 Aug 2019, DRC officials reported the disease had spread to a 3rd province, South Kivu. The disease has also recently spread to the remote North Kivu area of Pinga.

DRC cases reach 3004; deaths 2006: In its update posted today [29 Aug 2019] but dated yesterday [28 Aug 2019], the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) said that, of the 14 cases confirmed yesterday, 7 were in North Kivu province, including 3 in Beni and 1 each in Mutwanga, Kalunguta, Katwa, and Mabalako. Six were in Ituri (4 in Mambasa and 2 in Mandima), and 1 was in South Kivu, in Mwenga, where all the previous South Kivu cases have been confirmed.

The CMRE also said that, of the 4 confirmed deaths yesterday [28 Aug 2019], 2 were in the community, which raises the risk of further disease spread. No new cases were confirmed in healthcare workers, so that number stands at 156, or about 5% of all cases.

The number of people vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine has climbed to 206 774, the CMRE said.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online dashboard, however, cases today [29 Aug 2019] rose by 7, to reach 3004. And deaths rose by 8, eclipsing another somber milestone and reaching 2006.

In response to the new case totals, the country director of the nonprofit group Oxfam, Corinne N'Daw, said in a news release, "This is yet another grim milestone for the Ebola outbreak in DRC and no end seems to be in sight."

She added, "Worryingly the Ebola screening process, which relies on using a thermometer to spot any potential cases, doesn't seem to be working. Several of the most recent confirmed cases are reported to have passed through a number of screening check points unnoticed. It's crucial that local health workers on the frontline get much better training and equipment."

N'Daw also said the recent geographic expansion of cases has spread responders too thin. She added, "Preventative work takes time and resources, but we know from our experience it works. Given the trends we're seeing in how the virus is spreading, we should not be waiting for places to become an Ebola hotspot before engaging with communities."

Health emergency information and risk assessment
---------------------------------------------------
Contact tracing is ongoing in 20 health zones. A total of 17 293 contacts are under follow-up as of 24 Aug 2019, of which 1568 have been seen in the past 24 hours, comprising 89% of the contacts, which is a higher percentage than during the past 7 days (85%). Alerts in the affected provinces continue to be raised and investigated. Of 2073 alerts processed (of which 1996 were new) in reporting health zones on 24 Aug 2019, 1973 were investigated and 396 (20%) were validated as suspected cases.

Public health actions
---------------------
Surveillance activities continue, including case investigations, active case finding in health facilities and communities, and identification and listing of contacts around the latest confirmed cases. Cross-border collaboration continues, particularly in Uganda and Rwanda.

As of 24 Aug 2019, a cumulative total of 204 772 people [have] been vaccinated since the start of the outbreak in August 2018. Point of Entry/Point of Control (PoE/PoC) screening continues, with over 88 million screenings to date. A total of 98 of 106 (92%) PoE/PoCs transmitted reports as of 24 Aug 2019.

There are continued community reintegration and psychosocial activities for patients discharged from ETCs, along with psychoeducation sessions to strengthen community engagement and collaboration in the response.

Teams of psychologists continue negotiations to obtain the support of relatives of 2 confirmed cases from Mutwanga Health Zone to participate in prevention activities.

The communication commission collaborated with the psychosocial care commission to overcome resistance in a suspected case validated in Goma, who had been working in a mine in Manguredjipa Health Zone and who was travelling to Bukavu. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities continue where possible, but were not possible around a confirmed case in Mandima because of insecurity.

Community awareness and mobilization messages are being updated, revised and harmonized and have been pre-tested by the commission and will subsequently be shared in coordination and sub-coordination activities.

Young members of the Catholic Parish of Beni City have made a public commitment to counter community incidents in the Kasanga health area; the coordination of Goma launched a message of community involvement in the response to Ebola virus disease (EVD) on the occasion of the inauguration of the new provincial committee of the Revival Church of the Congo and the new regional bishop; in Kayna, the Mwama of the Batangi Chiefdom facilitated a community dialogue and called on all leaders in the jurisdiction to engage resolutely in the EVD response; 30 traditional practitioners and pharmacy tenant from Mayuano were briefed on EVD risk communication and a meeting was held with school principals from Mambasa schools on the prevention of EVD in preparation for the start of the school year.

Situation interpretation
----------------------
The response to the EVD outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo remains challenged by continued insecurity and pockets of community resistance. The small declining trend seen in the past 3 weeks must be interpreted with caution, given the spread to a new health zone within North Kivu and to the previously unaffected province of South Kivu. However, the lack of further cases in the city of Goma underlines just how effective proven public health measures can be when implemented immediately and effectively. This also emphasizes how important response preparedness continues to be in both unaffected provinces and neighbouring countries. Local authorities and partners need to continue their robust response to the disease, using both novel and proven community health and public health measures, while donors need to ensure that the funding is present to enable this and ensure that the declining trend continues.

[World Health Organization, edited]
https://www.who.int/publications-detail/ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-of-congo-external-situation-report-56-2019

Data as of 25 Aug 2019: 2976 cases (2871 confirmed, 105 probable), 1990 deaths. Fatality ratio, 67%.

Situation update
----------------
In the past week, from 19 Aug to 25 Aug 2019, 77 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with an additional 54 deaths, have been reported from 9 health zones in 3 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

In the 21 days from 5 Aug to 25 Aug 2019, 60 health areas in 18 health zones reported new cases (see Table 1 and Figure 2 at the source URL). During this period, a total of 201 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (30%, n = 61), Mandima (13%, n = 26), and Kalunguta (10%, n = 20). A total of 4 confirmed cases have been reported in Mwenga, including the father of the child who was previously confirmed positive and a co-patient in a community health facility where the 1st case initially sought care.

On 19 Aug 2019, 11 additional probable cases were validated. These were cases who died in Katwa, Kyondo, Vuhovi, and Mabalako health zones during March through June 2019 with epidemiological links to the outbreak, but who could not be sampled for laboratory testing to confirm/exclude EVD.

On 22 Aug 2019, Nyiragongo Health Zone (which includes suburbs of Goma city) passed 21 days without additional confirmed cases detected, and all contacts completed the 21-day follow-up period. Surveillance and response activities within Goma city and surrounding areas will continue, as risks of further introduction of EVD from active areas remain high.

As of 25 Aug 2019, a total of 2976 EVD cases were reported, including 2871 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 1990 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 58% (1727) were female and 28% (838) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to be reported among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 155 (5% of all confirmed and probable cases).

Pillar 1 of the fourth Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is available on the WHO website. Pillar 1 covers the core public health response to the outbreak. The current estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 27 Aug 2019, USD 45.3 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019, and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found [at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding].

[Oxfam America, abridged, edited]
https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/in-reaction-to-the-ebola-outbreak-in-the-drc-reaching-3000/

In reaction to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reaching 3000 cases and nearly 2000 deaths, Oxfam's Country Director in the DRC, Corinne N'Daw, said: "This is yet another grim milestone for the Ebola outbreak in DRC and no end seems to be in sight.

"Worryingly the Ebola screening process, which relies on using a thermometer to spot any potential cases, doesn't seem to be working. Several of the most recent confirmed cases are reported to have passed through a number of screening check points unnoticed. It's crucial that local health workers on the frontline get much better training and equipment.

"It's also a huge concern that we've seen cases appearing in 2 new areas over the last few weeks. As a result the response is being spread too thin, chasing new cases at the expense of the longer-term community engagement that is crucial if we're ever to hope of being Ebola free.

"Preventative work takes time and resources, but we know from our experience it works. Given the trends we're seeing in how the virus is spreading, we should not be waiting for places to become an Ebola hotspot before engaging with communities."

- Wed 28 Aug 2019. MSF: Crisis update
[MSF (Medecins Sans Frontieres), abridged, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/08/msf-ebola-outbreak-in-dr-congo-crisis-update-august-28-2019.html

MSF currently has 10 Ebola projects and is providing care for confirmed Ebola patients in the 3 affected provinces, including an Ebola treatment center (ETC) we are currently managing in Bunia, Ituri province, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and a new 50-bed ETC in Nyiragongo health zone of Goma, North Kivu province. MSF is also currently constructing an ETC in the Mwenga area of South Kivu. Earlier this year (2019), we withdrew from our ETCs in the North Kivu cities of Butembo and Katwa following separate attacks on the facilities.

We are also helping existing healthcare facilities in the affected provinces prepare for and receive people who may have Ebola, managing transit centers where patients with suspected Ebola are tested and sent to ETCs if they test positive, and working to implement and strengthen disease surveillance and infection prevention and control activities in the region.

For example, MSF has been present in Goma for Ebola preparedness for more than 8 months now, reinforcing the disease surveillance system and ensuring there is adequate capacity to manage those who might -- or have been confirmed to -- have Ebola.

As Ebola is only one public health crisis among several others affecting people living in this region of DRC, our main priority is to give timely and appropriate medical care to patients, regardless of their illness. To do so, we're working closely with the affected communities to identify their needs and ensure that access to essential healthcare services is guaranteed for patients suffering from all major diseases affecting people in the area, such as the massive ongoing measles outbreak, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. That's why MSF teams are also present in local health structures, where we offer general healthcare services and work to increase access to health care for all patients.

As of August 2019, MSF has more than 615 staff deployed in DRC for the Ebola emergency.

Integrating care: MSF aims to integrate its Ebola response activities into the existing healthcare system to ensure such services are close to those who need them.

Integrating the Ebola response in the healthcare facilities is key to bringing the epidemic to an end since many people experiencing symptoms of Ebola continue to seek health care at facilities that they are already familiar with rather than going directly to an ETC. Working more closely with local health centers also helps identify people with Ebola earlier, which helps to ensure that they receive proper care (giving them a better chance of survival) and also prevents the spread of the infectious disease.

The results of integrating care are encouraging; in July (2019), 10% of the confirmed patients admitted to an ETC in Beni had been referred there from a health center supported by MSF. That is a higher percentage than that of patients referred from dedicated Ebola transit centers.

[The Lancet, abridged, edited]

Citation: Ververs M, Arya A. Ebola virus disease and breastfeeding: time for attention. Lancet [Epub 27 Aug 2019] https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32005-7.

This year's Global Nutrition Cluster meeting in July 2019 offered a platform on which to discuss all nutrition-related humanitarian emergencies. Ebola virus disease (EVD) and breastfeeding in DR Congo was an obvious topic. More than 2800 cases have been confirmed in the ongoing outbreak in DR Congo; most cases are adults, and 56% of cases are women.

Ample information is available on the presence of Ebola virus in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and semen, and on the prevention of transmission from these fluids. However, information on EVD and breastmilk is limited.

Ebola virus has been found in the breastmilk of mothers in acute and convalescent phases of EVD from day 7 to day 26 after symptom onset, as well as in asymptomatic mothers (see Table at source URL). Data on long-term presence in breastmilk are limited and inconclusive. There was some discordance between Ebola virus in blood and breastmilk in 2 cases (cases 3 and 4), and possibly in a 3rd case (case 5), indicating that Ebola virus blood negativity is not sufficient to ensure safe breastfeeding in asymptomatic or convalescent mothers. Similarly, the current recommendation of testing breastmilk only in mothers who are known EVD survivors might be insufficient because asymptomatic lactating mothers in households affected by EVD have also been shown to have Ebola virus-positive breastmilk.

In DR Congo, current guidance on breastfeeding issued by the Ministry of Health and supported by UNICEF recommends that in EVD-affected households, mothers and infants who have symptoms but are Ebola virus blood negative should continue breastfeeding.

We are concerned about these guidelines because Ebola virus blood negativity does not necessarily equal safe breastmilk. Health practitioners and policy makers are in desperate need of more information on EVD and breastmilk. We call for systematic research on (1) the Ebola virus appearance and duration in breastmilk; (2) the transmissibility through breastmilk, taking into account the effect of factors such as infant saliva on the virus; and (3) the provision of evidence-based advice for asymptomatic lactating mothers in EVD-affected households.

The repercussions of a lack of clarity on these questions are potentially enormous for DR Congo. If breastfeeding is wrongly discouraged, years of public health efforts to promote breastfeeding could be lost. Conversely, if breastfeeding is wrongly encouraged, many infants could be put at risk. It is time to give as much attention to Ebola virus in breastmilk as we do in semen.

[Evaluation of the length of time Ebola virus may be present in breastmilk is important to determine, considering the number of women infected. The recommendation to also study its transmissibility to infants must also be examined. These studies will inform whether the current recommendations should be changed - Mod.LK
