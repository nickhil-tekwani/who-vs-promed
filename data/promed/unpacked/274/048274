[1] Johnson & Johnson: vaccine
Date: Wed 9 Feb 2022 07:37 EST
Source: CBS News [edited]
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-production-halt/


Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson has halted production of its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, according to a New York Times report. The pharmaceutical company last year [2021] quietly shut down production at a plant in Leiden, Netherlands, which was the only facility where usable doses of the vaccine were manufactured, catching some of its customers off guard, including developing nations that prefer the single-dose J&J drug over 2-dose alternatives, the report states.

Johnson & Johnson has instead been using the plant to work on an experimental and potentially more profitable drug that could protect against an unrelated respiratory virus, according to the report. The plant is expected to resume manufacturing of the COVID-19 vaccine, but it is unclear when. J&J did not comment on the plant closure reports, but said in a statement to CBS News "we currently have millions of doses of our COVID-19 vaccine in inventory" and "we continue to fulfill our contractual obligations ... [to] the African Union."

The J&J vaccine, called the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, made by Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is the vaccine of choice for poorer countries that are depending on the drugmaker to help them fight the pandemic. Wealthier nations like the United States have favored shots from Moderna and Pfizer, because the 2 appear to be more effective against COVID-19 variants like omicron, and because the Janssen vaccine has, in the past, been linked to rare but potentially life-threatening blood clots. Given that only one dose of the J&J vaccine is required, though, it's less expensive than its double-dose counterparts and also easier to deliver, making it popular in lower-income countries.

https://www.science.org/content/article/covid-19-takes-serious-toll-heart-health-full-year-after-recovery


From very early in the pandemic, it [became] clear that SARS-CoV-2 [could] damage the heart and blood vessels while people [were] acutely ill. Patients developed clots, heart inflammation, arrhythmias, and heart failure.

Now, the 1st large study to assess cardiovascular outcomes one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection has demonstrated that the virus' impact is often lasting. In an analysis of more than 11 million US veterans' health records, researchers found the risk of 20 different heart and vessel maladies was substantially increased in veterans who had COVID-19 one year earlier, compared with those who didn't. The risk rose with severity of initial disease and extended to every outcome the team examined, including heart attacks, arrhythmias, strokes, cardiac arrest, and more. Even people who never went to the hospital had more cardiovascular disease than those who were never infected.

Abstract
--------
The cardiovascular complications of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are well described, but the post-acute cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 have not yet been comprehensively characterized. Here we used national healthcare databases from the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 153 760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5 637 647 (contemporary controls) and 5 859 411 (historical controls) individuals, to estimate risks and 1-year burdens of a set of pre-specified incident cardiovascular outcomes. We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care). Our results provide evidence that the risk and 1-year burden of cardiovascular disease in survivors of acute COVID-19 are substantial. Care pathways of those surviving the acute episode of COVID-19 should include attention to cardiovascular health and disease.

[3] Placental destruction
Date: Thu 10 Feb 2022

https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-2ac91326c0cd16f67eba01885516ef2d/gallery/87acb69526264b27a085ee7c548a1bcc


New research suggests the coronavirus can invade and destroy the placenta and lead to stillbirths in infected women. It's an uncommon outcome for any pregnancy but women with COVID-19 face an elevated risk. Authorities believe vaccination can help prevent these cases.

Researchers in 12 countries, including the United States, analyzed placental and autopsy tissue from 64 stillbirths and 4 newborns who died shortly after birth. The cases all involved unvaccinated women who had COVID-19 during their pregnancy. It was published on Thursday [10 Feb 2022] in Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine.

Previous evidence suggests the chances of stillbirth are higher than usual for pregnant women with COVID-19, particularly from the delta variant. Vaccination recommendations include pregnant women and note their higher risk for complications when infected.

Lead author Dr David Schwartz, an Atlanta pathologist, said other infections can infiltrate the placenta and cause stillbirth, typically by infecting and damaging the fetus. A recent example is Zika virus. He and his colleagues wanted to see if that was the case with stillbirths in women with COVID-19. But what they found was almost the opposite: It was the placenta that was infected and extensively destroyed. "Many of these cases had over 90% of the placenta destroyed -- very scary," said Schwartz.

Normal placenta tissue is a healthy reddish hue and spongy. The specimens they studied were stiff, with dark discolorations of dead tissue. While other infections can sometimes damage the placenta, Schwartz said he'd never seen them cause such consistent, extensive destruction.

The virus likely reached the placenta through the bloodstream, attaching to susceptible cells and causing protein deposits and an unusual form of inflammation that blocked blood flow and oxygen. That in turn led to placenta tissue death and suffocation, the researchers said. Coronavirus was also detected in some of the fetuses, but evidence of suffocation in the womb points to placenta damage as the more likely cause of death, they said.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in November [2021] found that among pregnant US women infected with COVID-19, about 1 in 80 deliveries was a stillbirth (the loss of a fetus any time after 20 weeks), compared with 1 in 155 among uninfected women. The study stillbirths occurred on average at 30 weeks; normal pregnancies last about 40 weeks.

High blood pressure, certain chronic illnesses and fetal abnormalities are among conditions that can increase chances for stillbirths, including in women with COVID-19. It is unclear whether omicron infections also increase chances for stillbirths; the study was done before that highly infectious variant emerged.

Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2022; https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2022-0029-SA
----------------------------------------------------------------

"Abstract
---------
Context: Perinatal death is an increasingly important problem as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, but the mechanism of death has been unclear.
Objective: To evaluate the role of the placenta in causing stillbirth and neonatal death following maternal infection with COVID-19 and confirmed placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2.
Design: Case-based retrospective clinico-pathological analysis by a multinational group of 44 perinatal specialists from 12 countries of placental and autopsy pathology findings from 64 stillborns and 4 neonatal deaths having placentas testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 following delivery to mothers with COVID-19.
Results: All 68 placentas had increased fibrin deposition and villous trophoblast necrosis and 66 had chronic histiocytic intervillositis, the 3 findings constituting SARS-CoV-2 placentitis. Sixty-three placentas had massive perivillous fibrin deposition. Severe destructive placental disease from SARS-CoV-2 placentitis averaged 77.7% tissue involvement. Other findings included multiple intervillous thrombi (37%; 25/68) and chronic villitis (32%; 22/68). The majority (19, 63%) of the 30 autopsies revealed no significant fetal abnormalities except for intrauterine hypoxia and asphyxia. Among all 68 cases, SARS-CoV-2 was detected from a body specimen in 16 of 28 cases tested, most frequently from nasopharyngeal swabs. Four autopsied stillborns had SARS-CoV-2 identified in internal organs.
Conclusions: The pathology abnormalities composing SARS-CoV-2 placentitis cause widespread and severe placental destruction resulting in placental malperfusion and insufficiency. In these cases, intrauterine and perinatal death likely results directly from placental insufficiency and fetal hypoxic-ischemic injury. There was no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 involvement of the fetus had a role in causing these deaths." - Mod.LK]

https://www.dawn.com/news/1674201/pakistan-administers-over-190m-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines


The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Wednesday [9 Feb 2022] announced that 190 million COVID-19 vaccines had so far been administered in the country. In a separate development, world leaders have launched a campaign to collect funds amounting to USD 16 billion that would go towards eradicating the pandemic as a global emergency in the current year [2022].

According to the NCOC data, over 2 million doses were administered for the 2nd consecutive day, taking the total number of doses of 7 different vaccines given so far to 190 001 984.

On the other hand, 50 patients lost their lives to the virus and 4253 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The number of active cases as of [9 Feb 2022] has reached 86 262 out of which 1872 are admitted to various hospitals across the country.

Although the national positivity ratio was recorded at 8.2%, 9 cities registered an infection rate of over 10%. They are Karachi, Lahore, Swabi, Peshawar, Nowshera, Mardan, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad, and Mirpur.

According to a statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), world leaders on Wednesday [9 Feb 2022] launched a call to end the pandemic as a global emergency in 2022 by funding the 'Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator' -- a partnership of leading agencies that are providing low and middle-income countries with tests, treatments, vaccines and personal protective equipment.

"With a significant proportion of the global population still unable to get vaccinated, tested, or treated, USD 16 billion in grant funding is urgently required from governments to fund the work of the ACT-Accelerator agencies. This investment will allow them to procure essential tools to fight COVID-19 and provide them to low- and middle-income countries," the statement said.

"The ACT-Accelerator is calling for the support of higher income countries, at a time when vast global disparities in access to COVID-19 tools persist. Over 4.7 billion COVID-19 tests have been administered globally since the beginning of the pandemic. However, only about 22 million tests had been conducted in low-income countries, which comes to 0.4% of the global total," it said, adding that only 10% of the people in low-income countries have received at least one dose.

It further said that the fund aimed to create a 'Pandemic Vaccine Pool' of 600 million doses, support community engagement, and cover ancillary costs for donations that would contribute to the countries' national vaccination objectives for achieving the global target of 70% coverage by mid-2022.

Other targets include purchasing 700 million testing kits, treating 120 million patients, arranging 433 million cubic metres of oxygen, protecting 1.7 million health workers with personal protective equipment, supporting clinical trials for treatments and vaccines, addressing variants of concern, and initiating the development of broadly protective coronavirus vaccines.

Meanwhile, in a statement, WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "The rapid spread of omicron makes it even more urgent to ensure tests, treatments, and vaccines are distributed equitably globally. If higher-income countries pay their fair share of the ACT-Accelerator costs, the partnership can support low- and middle-income countries to overcome low COVID-19 vaccination levels, weak testing, and medicine shortages."

Rawalpindi
----------
Six people died of COVID-19 and 104 got infected in the district on Wednesday [9 Feb 2022]. However, the positivity ratio in Rawalpindi dropped further to 5.4% while 186 patients recovered during the last 24 hours.

There are currently 1370 active patients in the district, with 107 admitted to hospitals and 1263 home isolated.

Islamabad
---------
As many as 174 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the capital with the positivity ratio traced at 3.7%.

Officials of the capital administration said during the last 24 hours 4621 tests were conducted. District health officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said a decline was seen in the number of COVID-19 cases in a single day and its positivity rate as compared to cases reported during the last couple of days.

Over 12 000 COVID-19 infections have been reported within the past 10 days in Sri Lanka. According to statistics of the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB), 1056, 1082, 1137, 1156, 1181, 1243, 1287, 1331, 1298, and 1253 active cases have been recorded since [30 Jan 2022], accumulating 12 024 cases. Notably, the number of COVID deaths is also on the rise and the number of fatalities which was around 18 in the recent past, increased to 37 on Tuesday [8 Feb 2022].

The highest number of daily cases of 1331 was reported on [6 Feb 2022] after several months. Accordingly, the total confirmed cases in Sri Lanka stands at 621 985 of which 593 602 patients have recovered from the virus.

Meanwhile, around 7500 PCR tests and 5500 RATs [rapid antigen tests] are conducted daily. However, only around 2500 RATs were conducted in the last 3 days.

The South Asia COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 11 Feb 2022 at 03:41 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 42 536 137 / 507 208 / 362
Bangladesh: 1 894 535 / 28 744 / 172
Pakistan: 1 477 573 / 29 687 / 130
Nepal: 971 475 / 11 864 / 396
Sri Lanka: 624 545 / 15 723 / 729
Afghanistan: 169 448 / 7477 / 185
Maldives: 155 917 / 287 / 516
Bhutan: 6779 / 5 / 6

Over the last 7 days, 585 636, 58 759, 35 310, 8958, and 9886 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 1 330 304, 88 445, 40 193, 23 250, and 7555 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a sharp decline in cases in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, also a decreasing trend in Pakistan, but an increasing trend in Sri Lanka.

Though the surge is in its declining phase the total numbers of deaths associated with the disease are, however, increasing, particularly in India and Bangladesh. India recorded more than 1000 deaths per day over the last 3 days since 7 Feb 2022 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-reports-67084-covid-cases-and-1242-deaths-in-last-24-hours-active-cases-at-7-90-lakh/articleshow/89469749.cms), and the total number of daily deaths in Bangladesh remained between 30 and 40 over the last few days.

The new surge being noticed in South Asian countries is now believed to be caused by massive transmission of the omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529) of the virus, as indicated by limited sequence data available from the region. A recent study finding on the samples collected between 9 Jan and 9 Feb 2022 in Bangladesh has revealed the presence of the omicron variant in 82% of the hospital admitted patients and outpatients and the delta variant in the remaining 18%. Both subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 have been detected in the cases diagnosed positive with the omicron variant (https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/health/88pc-recent-covid-infections-are-of-the-omicron-variant-1644492915).

However, the subvariant, which is currently predominating across the South Asian region, is poorly understood, although the subvariant BA.2 is reportedly becoming dominant in the Philippines, Nepal, Qatar, India and Denmark (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-subvariant-ba2-likely-have-same-severity-original-who-2022-02-01/).

The emerging BA.2 form of the omicron coronavirus variant does not seem to be more severe than the original BA.1 form, but it could be more transmissible than the more common BA.1 and more able to infect vaccinated people, according to a Danish study (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-subvariant-ba2-likely-have-same-severity-original-who-2022-02-01/).

Because the numbers of active cases are still at a threatening level in the 4 most populous South Asian countries, despite some initial signs of plateauing in India, each country should strictly adhere to common preventive guidelines, such as keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre (3.3 ft) from others; wearing a well-fitting mask; opening windows to improve ventilation; avoiding poorly ventilated or crowded spaces; keeping hands clean; coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow or tissue; and getting vaccinated.

As extracted from the last graph of the source URL in item [B], as many as 7 635 256 COVID-19 cases were detected across India from 1 Jan-10 Feb 2022, and in this window of 41 days, 25 440 people died due to the disease, suggesting a case fatality rate of 0.33%, grossly meaning that if 1000 people were confirmed with the disease by laboratory testing, 3.3 of them died eventually.

This rate of mortality is around 3.6 times lower than the overall death rate of 1.19%, recorded in India due to the disease as of today (11 Feb 2022) (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), but 4 times lower than the death rate (1.32%) recorded on 21 May 2021, 2 weeks later from the highest number of total daily cases (414 433) recorded on 6 May 2021 during the peak of the previous surge in the country believed to be caused by the delta variant (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/).

An update on the omicron variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron. Additional information can be found at https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/what-we-know-about-omicron-variant.

As of 11 Feb 2022, at 8:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 717 951 432 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 9 Feb 2022, 83.79% have received the 1st dose and 56.41% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 3.47% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 11 Feb 2022 at 9:03 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 194 492 475 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

As of 30 Jan 2022, Nepal has administered at least 31 642 503 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 36 716 685 doses of COVID vaccine so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 84.2% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

Bhutan has recorded another death due to COVID-19. With this latest fatality, a total of 5 people have died so far from the disease in the country from 6779 cases confirmed by laboratory testing. - Mod.PKB]

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20FEB10_1644607510.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB10WORLD7_1644607543.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 49 countries -- France (332 639), the USA (228 288), Germany (247 128), Russia (197 076), Brazil (185 359), UK (162 080), Japan (100 097), Turkey (98 602), Italy (76 195), Netherlands (86 779), India (60 015), South Korea (53 926), Spain (53 055), Denmark (50 542), Poland (46 872), Poland (42 095), Belgium (41 949), Ukraine (41 694), Indonesia (40 618), Ukraine (38 257), Chile (38 070), Austria (35 2507), Iran (33 681), Australia (33 137), Israel (31 422), Switzerland (26 253), Czech Republic (29 166), Portugal (27 651), Romania (27 346), Vietnam (26 032), Argentina (25 110), Mexico (24 898), Norway (24 448), Georgia (22 444), Jordan (21 460), Slovakia (20 160), Greece (19 154), Malaysia (19 090), Thailand (15 242), Peru (13 091), Hungary (12 885), Finland (12 805), Ecuador (12 321), Slovenia (12 209), Serbia (11 121), Canada (11 832), Latvia (11 599), Lithuania (10 758), and Singapore (10 686) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 13 285 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 8 Feb 2022 to late 9 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 90 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 16.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 22.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 0.48% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide, over 3.11 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the cumulative totals to over 403.65 million reported cases and over 5.79 million reported deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
