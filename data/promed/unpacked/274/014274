<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5043704/Super-C.-difficile-outbreak-linked-to-deaths-of-13-patients.html>


A new strain of 'super' _Clostridium difficile_ has been linked to
the deaths of 13 patients, and another 17 are being treated for the
infection as doctors battle to control an outbreak at Eastbourne
District Hospital.

The particularly virulent new strain of _C. difficile_ responsible
for the outbreak, known as [ribotype] 027, can produce 20 times as
much toxin as others, is known to cause a higher mortality rate, and
is resistant to several drugs used to combat the infection.

Most of the victims are frail and elderly patients and some of those
who died had only been treated for fractures and had been expected to
make a full recovery, according to sources.

Solicitor Sarah Harman, sister of Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the
Labour Party, is acting for families of the victims and said the
outbreak bears a 'striking resemblance' to Britain's worst superbug
scandal at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust, where the bug was
linked to the deaths of 331 patients over two years .

In total there have been 62 cases of _Clostridium difficile_ since the
beginning of the year [2009] at Eastbourne District General Hospital,
and the Health Protection Agency has been called in to assist in
containing the infection.

The bug, which can take hold in the gut of patients who have been
treated with antibiotics for other conditions, causes diarrhoea and in
severe cases inflammation of the bowel. It is usually spread by
healthcare workers who fail to wash their hands properly with soap and
water -- not just alcohol gel -- between patients, and its spores can
contaminate floors, bedpans, and door handles where they can survive
for days.

A spokesman for the trust said: "The recent outbreak is thought to be
due the very high number of patients admitted over the winter with
severe respiratory infections [that] have required antibiotic therapy
[that], in turn, increases peoples' susceptibility to this infection,
particularly in the frail and elderly. It has been confirmed that
many of these cases were linked to the [ribotype] 027 strain [that]
is known to have a 60 per cent mortality rate."

The Telegraph highlighted the spread of 027 last year [2008] when
experts warned the extremely infectious strain was found in a quarter
of hospitals tested in England and had caused serious outbreaks in
9 European countries including the UK.

A review of medical case notes has established 3 patients, aged 85,
89, and 91 died as a direct result of the infection on 11 Feb, 28
Feb, and 17 Mar [2009]. In a further 10 cases the bug was noted on
the death certificate as a possible contributory factor. Another 9
patients were diagnosed with _C. difficile_ and died but the doctors
concluded the infection had played no part in the death.

Patients with the bug have been moved to a dedicated isolation ward
and managers have spent GBP 100 000 [approx. USD 145 000] on new
equipment to eradicate the bacteria from contaminated surfaces within
the hospital. Eastbourne District General Hospital is run by East
Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust, which is also responsible for a number of
other hospitals, a birthing unit and a care centre. Dr Barry
Phillips, the trust's Director of Infection Prevention and Control
... is leading the response to this outbreak. Kim Hodgson, chief
executive of the trust ... said: "We called the press conference
because we closed the hospital for 3 days and used hydrogen peroxide
to clean the wards. ... .We closed the wards and sealed them up and
used the gas to kill off all the spores."

So far this financial year there have been a total of 194 cases of
_C. difficile_ at Eastbourne District General Hospital and the
expected number for a hospital of this size and the profile of the
patients there, is 200 cases in a year. The latest data from the
Health Protection Agency shows that there were 7061 cases of
_Clostridium difficile_ in patients aged over 65 in hospitals in
England between July and September last year [2008]. In the same
period in 2007 there were 10 884 cases.

[From a prior ProMED post Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 - UK:
(N. Ireland) 20080207.0498:

"_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and
antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor
associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks of
_C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high
relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the
emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North
America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces
toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1
and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic
strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use
of which is one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy D,
Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in
fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg
Infect Dis 2007; 13. Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm>).

A surveillance program for _C. difficile_, which covered all the
English health regions in 2006, determined that 26 percent of
isolates were ribotype 027.

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with
_C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms
are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene
and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(<http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF>)."

_C. difficile_ is a spore-forming microorganism. _C. difficile_
spores are more resistant than vegetative cells to commonly used
surface disinfectants. With inocula of 6 to 7 log10 CFU, most
vegetative _C. difficile_ bacteria and spores have been shown to be
inactivated within 90 min of exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapor in a
100-m3 test room even in the presence of 0.3 percent bovine serum
albumin to simulate biological soiling (Otter JA, French GL. Survival
of Nosocomial Bacteria and Spores on Surfaces and Inactivation by
Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor. J Clin Microbiol 2009; 47: 205-7. Available
at
<http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/47/1/205>).
Hydrogen peroxide vapor was used to decontaminate the hospital
environment in the Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone _C. difficile_
ribotype 027 outbreaks
(<http://www.clean-safe-care.nhs.uk/ArticleFiles/Files/061121%20Maidstone%20and%20Tunbridge%20Wells_approved_V2.pdf>).

Eastbourne is a seaside holiday resort on the southern coast of
England, with an estimated population of 94 816 as of 2007
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastbourne#Areas_and_suburbs>).
Eastbourne is south of Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone, sites of the
prior _C. difficile_ ribotype 027 outbreak
(see <http://healthmap.org/r/007L>). - Mod.ML]
