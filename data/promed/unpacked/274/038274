Chagas confirmed on the west coast of Vargas
-----------------
Ministry of Health [MINSA] reiterates the lifting of epidemiologic siege

Yesterday the Minister of Health, Jesus Mantilla, confirmed that
Chagas disease is the disease that is attacking the population of
Chichiriviche de la Costa, in the western part of the state of Vargas.

The head of the Ministry of Health was in the area and stated that it
was transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated guava juice,
producing the outbreak of illness in the area, that affected 47
students and three teachers from the morning shift of the Romulo
Monasterios state school.

Similarly, the minister reiterated the statements made yesterday [4
Apr 2009 -- see prior ProMED-mail posting Undiagnosed fatalities -
Venezuela (02): (Vargas) Chagas susp, RFI 20090404.1305 - Mod.MPP] by
the governor of Vargas, Jorge Garcia Carneiro, the epidemiologic
"fence" erected to stop the epidemic that occurred in the area,
because, as noted, there is no risk of spread.

For this disease, which for over 4 weeks was affecting the population
and increasing numbers of patients, killing 3 children ages 7, 9 and 12 years.

However, 35 other children remain hospitalized in the La Guaira
Social Security [hospital], the Pariata Periferico [health facility],
the Perez Carreno [health facility] and the University Clinic.
Doctors from this hospital reported that 15 patients from the area
have been admitted, and that the problem is present from [the events
surrounding carnaval - Mardis Gras - Mod.MPP]. It was learned that
there is a patient in serious condition.

Although the possibility of transmission in the zone was ruled out,
the residents of Chichiriviche reported that the usual vacationers to
the zone have not arrived. [The affected area is a beach resort
frequented by vacationers. The week ending in Easter Sunday is known
as Semana Santa in Latin American countries. It is a vacation week,
and locations such as Chichiriviche are usually filled with
vacationers coming for the week. - Mod.MPP]

[The above newswire is confirmation of the suspicion that the
previously undiagnosed outbreak in Venezuela (see prior ProMED-mail
postings listed below) is due to ingestion of a juice that was
contaminated with _triotoma infestans_ intestinal contents.

This is now the 7th outbreak of foodborne transmission of
trypanosomiasis in the Americas reported by ProMED-mail (see prior
postings listed below). As mentioned in the 1st report of this
current outbreak (Undiagnosed fatalities - Venezuela: (Vargas),
Chagas, susp, RFI 20090402.1279), the 1st reported outbreak of
foodborne transmission of trypanosomiasis was reported in Santa
Catarina Brazil in 2005 (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed
below). This outbreak was associated with ingestion of sugar cane
juice that was found to be contaminated with crushed _triatoma
infestans_, the vector of trypanosomiasis in Brazil. Since reporting
of outbreaks of foodborne transmitted trypanosomiasis began, there
were 6 prior documented outbreaks associated with contaminated juices
-- 4 in Brazil (involving 4 states in the country), one in Venezuela,
and one in Colombia. The prior outbreak in Venezuela involved 128
cases at a school in metropolitan Caracas, and was associated with
contaminated fruit juice. This current outbreak has involved
approximately 50 cases at a school in a small beachside town/village
outside of Caracas, and is also associated with contaminated fruit juice.

One wonders how new a phenomenon foodborne transmission of
trypanosomiasis really is, or is it just that we are now looking more
carefully as the standard of housing in these countries has improved,
and exposure to the _triatoma infestans_ in the household has
decreased. Or perhaps, there is improved recognition and
investigation of acute outbreaks in general in the region.
