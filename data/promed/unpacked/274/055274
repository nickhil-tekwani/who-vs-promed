Health Officials Studying West Nile-Transplant
-------------------------------------------
Federal health officials said on 31 Aug 2002 that 3 of 4 patients who
received organs from one donor have apparently developed encephalitis, and
tests show that one recipient is infected with the West Nile virus, raising
suspicion that the virus can be transmitted through organ transplants.
One of the 4 recipients died about 4 weeks after the transplant. Standard
pathology tests from an autopsy show that the recipient had encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain and central nervous system). Tests are planned to
determine whether the recipient was infected with West Nile virus, which
causes encephalitis. Tests have shown that another recipient, a 63-year-old
man who lives in Miami-Dade County, Florida, has West Nile fever.
Because the organ donor received a number of blood transfusions before dying
in Georgia on 1 Aug 2002, health officials are also investigating the
possibility that the virus can be transmitted through blood.
Federal health officials said they were taking the situation seriously and
were aggressively investigating the cluster of cases. The reason is that if
additional tests confirm that the 3 recipients developed West Nile
encephalitis, it would be a new route of transmission of the virus, which
was first identified in this hemisphere in 1999, in New York City.
No case of transmission of West Nile or closely related mosquito-borne virus
through blood or organ transplants has been reported in this country, said
Dr. James M. Hughes, a top official of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta.
On Friday night, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the director of the CDC, said that
"transmission of the West Nile virus through blood and organs is
biologically plausible" and that "a leading hypothesis that we are
investigating is that it is related to the organ transplant." Dr.
Gerberding's agency is responsible for protecting the public's health from
infections like West Nile fever. Scientists have performed statistical
analyses that show that transmission of West Nile virus could occur at a
very low rate through blood transfusions, Dr. Gerberding said.
The donor and the 4 recipients are from Georgia and Florida, where the virus
is known to have infected mosquitoes, birds, and humans. Health officials
said they were working to rule out a remote chance that all developed their
illness from mosquito bites.
Dr. Hughes said in an interview that "several dozen" state and federal
epidemiologists, laboratory scientists and other health workers had been
thrust into the medical investigation. Some are working to obtain additional
information about the donor's health before dying on 1 Aug 2002 from
injuries suffered in a traffic accident.
The transplants were performed on 2 and 3 Aug 2002, Dr. Hughes said. One
patient received the donor's heart, a second patient received the liver, and
2 patients each received one kidney. One of the kidney transplant recipients
died, Dr. Hughes said, and 2 of the organ recipients went home after surgery
but returned when symptoms of encephalitis developed. The man in Florida did
not leave the hospital [making it unlikely he was bitten by mosquitos. -

Meanwhile, scientists at the CDC are conducting special laboratory tests on
the brain of the kidney recipient who died for evidence of West Nile virus
or a closely related virus. The medical investigators are about to begin
tracing the individuals who gave the blood that the organ donor received
before death.
Blood banks routinely keep a small amount of a donor's blood for testing in
the event that infections or other complications develop among recipients of
a donor's blood. Such tests have not been performed yet, Dr. Hughes said.
Also, the investigators are seeking any blood from the donor that may have
been stored from before the time the donor received blood transfusions, to
determine whether the recipient was infected with West Nile [previously].
West Nile virus usually produces its most serious illness among people older
than 50 and those who immune system has been weakened by other diseases or
treatment for them. As is standard for organ transplant recipients, all 4
recipients received immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection of the
donated organ. The weakened immune status leaves such patients more
vulnerable to infections and, in such cases, to more serious illness.
One of the 4 organ transplant recipients developed a mild fever that
resolved. Tests are planned to determine whether that recipient had a mild
case of West Nile fever. Most people infected with the virus develop a mild
flu-like illness or experience no symptoms.
If blood donations are confirmed as the source of the transmission, it would
raise questions whether blood banks would need to test blood for the West
Nile virus before it is transfused. Blood banks routinely test for viruses
and bacteria that cause hepatitis, AIDS, and other infections. But, Dr.
Gerberding said, "the problem is that we do not have a rapid test for West
Nile virus," and other tests, like the PCR (for polymerase chain reaction),
are not reliable for screening blood at this time. Dr. Gerberding expressed
hope that the medical sleuths would be able to trace the source of infection
quickly.
At least 556 cases of West Nile fever, including 28 deaths, have been
reported to the CDC from 26 states and the District of Columbia this year.
