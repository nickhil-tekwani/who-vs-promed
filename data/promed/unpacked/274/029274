Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has stricken one more province of
Vietnam, raising the number of its affected localities [provinces?]
to 39, according to a local animal health agency on Monday [29 May
2006].
The latest disease outbreaks were detected in northern Bac Giang
province last week, said the Department of Animal Health under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
As of Monday, 13 out of 39 affected localities, including Cao Bang,
Bac Can, Ha Giang, Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, Hai Duong and Lai
Chau in the northern region; Nghe An and Da Nang in the central
region; and Gia Lai, Dac Lac and Lam Dong in the central highlands
region, have declared FMD outbreaks in their territories.
Vietnam is intensifying control over cattle transport and trade in
affected areas, and surveillance of the disease and vaccination of
healthy animals, the department said.
The disease has spread to 447 communes in the 39 localities, hitting
nearly 15 500 bulls and buffaloes, and about 18 300 pigs, the
department said, noting that nearly 12 000 pigs, and roughly 450
buffalos and bulls have either died or been culled due to the
outbreaks.
