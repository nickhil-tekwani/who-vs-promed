A new case of _E. coli_[O157] infection linked to a Souplantation
restaurant has been identified, bringing to 14 the total number of
people who have tested positive for the dangerous bacterium, Orange
County health officials said Mon 9 Apr 2007. The new case, involving
an adult customer who was not hospitalized, was reported late Sun 8
Apr 2007, said Orange County Health Care Agency spokesman Howard Sutter.
[The initial 13 patients] -- 3 adults and 10 children -- had eaten at
the Souplantation in Lake Forest between 23 and 25 Mar 2007. Among
them was a 12-year-old girl, who remained hospitalized in good
condition, said Denise Almazan, a Children's Hospital of Orange
County spokeswoman.
A Souplantation employee who did not report any symptoms or illness
also tested positive for the _E. coli_. Officials were trying to
determine the source of the outbreak.
Meanwhile, the serve-yourself salad-buffet restaurant remained closed
while its approximately 40 employees complete tests to determine
whether they were infected. The Health Care Agency has suspended the
restaurant's permit as a precaution.

[As of today (9 Apr 2007),] the number of _E. coli_ [O157] bacteria
cases to hit diners at a Lake Forest restaurant on 3 days in March
2007, stands at 14, including 10 children, 3 adult customers, and an
employee, health officials said.
The newest case, involving an adult in his or her 30s, was reported
Sun night, 8 Apr 2007, the Orange County Health Care Agency's (HCA)
Deanne Thompson said.
At least one case reported recently involves a teenager who ate at
the restaurant on 25 Mar 2007. The other victims said they ate there
either 23 or 24 Mar 2007, Thompson said.
Last week, health officials learned from the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) that the strain that sickened the diners
is very rare and has not been reported in California before. That
means it is a different strain than that traced to spinach last
summer, Howard Sutter of the HCA said.

[This posting identifies 3 more consumers and an employee with the
organism and increases by one day the vehicle exposure period. There
are apparently still no cases reported from the other 8 locations in
Orange County. Since the food is prepared at a central location, it
appears to be the case that contamination of the so far unidentified
vehicle occurred at the local restaurant. The finding of an employee
of the restaurant might support this although the employee may have
just as likely eaten the food rather than contaminated it.
More information regarding the specific strain of _E. coli_ O157
involved is awaited.
Lake Forest is located in Orange County in southern California, south
of Los Angeles. The county can be found on a map at
