2004/107 Annual Meeting of the American Phytopathological Society:
new data on quarantine pests
The Annual Meeting of the American Phytopathological Society was
convened in Anaheim, US, on 2004-07/31-08-04. Abstracts of submitted
papers were published in a supplement issue of Phytopathology. The
EPPO Secretariat has extracted the following information:
Citrus greening bacterium (EPPO A1 list): A PCR method has been
developed in India to detect citrus greening bacterium in commercial
citrus species (Gopal et al., 2004).
_Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 list): PCR methods were developed in
USA for the detection, differentiation and quantification of _X.
fastidiosa_ [Xf] strains. 5 PCR systems were developed based on the
currently available genomic sequences of 4 strains: Pierce's disease
of grapevine, almond leaf scorch, oleander leaf scorch and citrus
variegated chlorosis. These PCR systems were able to differentiate
each strain specifically in suspensions containing a mixture of
strains (whole bacteria or DNA) and in DNA extractions from
field-collected samples (Francis et al., 2004).

[Several versions of PCR are at the cutting edge in the development
of sensitive methods for detection of plant pathogens. Examples
include: tests for detecting inoculum, especially airborne spores, in
low concentrations; specific detection of pathogen DNA to assess
disease progress in a crop before expression of visual symptoms;
real-time PCR to provide precise estimates of disease levels in plant
tissues in advance of developing epidemics; and PCR to identify
specific mating types in fungal populations so as to predict presence
of infective spores at the start of a cropping season.
Specific examples of the use of PCR are the monitoring of the
movement of the bacterium _Xylella fastidiosa_ [Xf] in citrus trees,
detection of Xf in potential insect vectors, and development of ELISA
and monoclonal antibodies for specific diagnoses. All parts of
plants, including seeds, can be used for detection of plant pathogens.
