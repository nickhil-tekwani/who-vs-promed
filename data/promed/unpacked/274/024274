[1] Case update
Sat 17 Nov 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans. extracted, edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=d35154a642

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 16 Nov 2018:

- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 358, 311 of which are confirmed and 47 probable. In total, there have been 213 deaths (of 166 confirmed and 47 probable cases).
- 57 suspected cases under investigation.
- 6 new confirmed cases, including 4 in Beni, 1 in Katwa and 1 in Kalunguta.
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni and 1 in Katwa.

News of the response
--------------------
Security
- On the evening of Fri 16 Nov 2018, an armed group made an incursion into Boikene neighborhood, Rwenzori commune, in the city of Beni, with the intention of attacking one of the bases of MONUSCO [Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo]. The peacekeepers reacted immediately, pushing the rebel group back after several hours of clashes, a few meters from the Ebola Response Emergency Operations Center and hotels in which several teams from the response were lodged. [See reports below].

- This Sat, 17 Nov 2018, all field activities were suspended, and the Emergency Operations Center remained closed. All the teams stayed in their respective hotels.

- Health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga deplores the violence that has once again wounded the people of Beni and is slowing the efforts of the response teams to end the Ebola outbreak. The epidemic remains dangerous, especially in Beni. As a result, national and international teams continue to work alongside the population to end the epidemic.

Vaccination
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 31 713 people have been vaccinated, including 15 901 in Beni.

[2] Security
- Wed 14 Nov 2018. Lack of security is "significant impediment" to US help on Ebola

The US is facing a "significant impediment" to its overall plan to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo bring its deadly Ebola outbreak to an end, as inadequate security continues to plague the region near Beni, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Why it matters: the DRC is currently dealing with its worst-ever outbreak of Ebola, and the epicenter is in an area where there's been civil unrest for decades. There's also concern that the outbreak could last for years, due to a deadly combination of the virus, pockets of community distrust of health and government workers, and periodic violent incidents that keep forcing the need for quarantines, vaccinations and treatment regimes.

But while US officials say they are "looking at options", there are no current plans to provide military assistance like the US did for the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia.

US involvement so far: among other personnel, the US sent a disaster assistance response team (DART) to the area of the outbreak at the end of September 2018, but officials said that they had to pull out and move to the capital of Kinshasa for security reasons. Just this past weekend, there was fresh violence in the region, they said.

- DART, which is an elite team of disaster and health experts, continues to coordinate US response efforts from Kinshasa and elsewhere, with constant evaluations of Beni.

- They hired 3 doctors with experience from the West Africa Ebola outbreak to work in Beni to support international efforts.

- Due to growing concerns that Ebola will be transmitted beyond DRC borders, an official said they are increasing their response activities on the borders of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.

- Apart from providing expertise from Kinshasa and at the borders, the US has trained hundreds of African health workers who are on the ground as well as offered technical and financial assistance, the officials said.

Yes, but: there have been growing calls for the US to send experts to work directly on-the-ground. "Quick action is needed to affirm US leadership in eastern Congo, better understand the specific security threats at play, and come up with practical solutions that permit the safe deployment of a small US expert contingent into the center of the outbreak, where seasoned US talent is most needed."

Meanwhile, a World Health Organization official predicted on Tue 12 Nov 2018 that the outbreak would last at least another 6 months due to rampant security concerns and what he called "tradi-modern" health centers, makeshift places offering traditional and modern treatments where he believes many are spreading the infection, the AP reports.

- Sat 17 Nov 2018. 16 Ebola WHO staff evacuated amid DR Congo clashes
[Daily Mail, extracted, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6401529/Sixteen-Ebola-WHO-staff-evacuated-amid-DR-Congo-clashes.html


The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sat 17 Nov 2018 that 16 staff members have been temporarily evacuated from DR Congo's restive eastern city of Beni after a shell hit the building they were staying in.

The incident occurred in the Ebola-plagued region during clashes between UN peacekeepers from the MONUSCO mission and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia on Fri [16 Nov 2018] night. "It was in exchanges of fire that the house was hit by a shell," Michel Yao, WHO's coordinator for Ebola response operations in Beni, told AFP. No one was injured, he said, adding that it was not known whether the shell came from the militia, the UN peacekeepers or the Congolese army backing them.

Anti-Ebola efforts in DR Congo suspended amid violence

The violence is distressing because of the associated deaths, and because health officials in the region must suspend vaccinations and other outreach work with each episode. In this case, it appears the militia (ADF) attacked, leading to a clash with UN peacekeepers from the MONUSCO mission and the Congolese army, during which a shell hit the building the UN peacekeepers were staying in. It is particularly concerning because of its proximity to an emergency treatment center, placing the center in harm's way. - Mod.LK
