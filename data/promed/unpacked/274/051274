An elderly person and a young boy died of rabies infection at the PMC-run Naidu infectious diseases hospital on Wednesday [25 Jun 2014], taking the death toll in the city [Pune, Maharashtra state] so far to 17. Civic officials said both the victims were bitten by dogs 3 months ago and that they had not taken the anti-rabies vaccines on the scheduled days.

"65-year-old BK, a resident of Savalgaon in Mulshi taluka [Pune district, Maharashtra], was admitted to Naidu hospital on [24 Jun 2014]. He died at 4:15pm on [25 Jun 2014]. The other victim, 2-and-a-half-year-old SS, a resident of Jalungaon in Satara district [Maharashtra], was admitted at 5:40 pm on [24 Jun 2014]. He died at 12:40 am on [25 Jun 2014]," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), PMC. Both patients had developed symptoms of rabies like hydrophobia (fear of water) and aerophobia (fear of air) and were extremely breathless at the time of admission.

"They had suffered category-III dog bite wounds. As per the medical history produced by victims' relatives, they had neither taken the anti-rabies vaccination on the scheduled days, nor did they receive rabies immunoglobulin, a ready-made antibody which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in category III dog-bite injury," Pardeshi said.

As per the World Health Organization, the incubation period for the infection is typically 1-3 months, but may vary from one week to a year. WHO guidelines advise that rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) should be given for all category III exposures, irrespective of the interval between exposure and beginning of treatment.

[The rabies slaughter of humans continues, aided by tragic non-compliance -- whether it is voluntarily or involuntary is unclear. But it is clear that the Public Health Service needs to be much more aggressive.

Maharashtra is on the western coast of India, facing the Indian Ocean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra). Pune is the 7th largest metropolis in India and the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra. It is 560 metres above sea level on the Deccan plateau at the right bank of the Mutha River.
