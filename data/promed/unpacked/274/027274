Trails closed over equine virus fears
-------------------------------------
The loss of 2 horses at the Anne Springs Close Greenway has caused
officials there to temporarily suspend horseback riding on the
greenway's trails until they determine what caused the animals'
deaths. Officials are hoping to rule out equine herpes virus (EHV-1)
as the cause.

Greenway Director Bill Steele said Tuesday [8 Dec 2009] "There are no
confirmed cases of EHV1 in the state of South Carolina" and that "the
Anne Springs Close Greenway quarantine is preventative."

According to Steele, the trails are closed "to horses and to motor
bikes," the bikes because of heavy rain.

"When Charlotte region trails close due to rain, we close too," he
said, explaining that it's a safety issue and a way of protecting the
trails from damage.

In the meantime, he said, the greenway's horses that had contact with
the 2 that died are under quarantine. Steele said lab results
received Monday [7 Dec 2009] on tissue samples from the greenway
horses "were negative for West Nile, Eastern and Western encephalitis
and rabies. The results were inconclusive for herpes."

He said samples were also sent to a lab at Michigan State University
for further testing and that "we should have results Thursday. The
quarantine will continue until further notice."

The virus does not affect humans.

On 26 Nov 2009, one of the horses that boards at the greenway, Ellah,
became paralyzed in her hind quarters, a symptom of (EHV-1). The next
day, another horse in the same pasture, Scotch, had the same
symptoms. Both horses had to be euthanized, Steele said Monday.
Scotch's body was sent to a veterinary lab at Clemson University for
necropsy, Steele said.

"We're taking the proactive approach, treating as though it were
[EHV-1], to be responsible, but we're waiting for the [additional]
test results," Steele said. "We've quarantined the whole place so
that horses won't come in that have it or go out with it."

Steele oversees 92 horses at stables and pastures on the greenway. In
the 9 years that he has been director, Steele said that he has never
seen a case of EHV-1. Because EHV-1 is a virus, it can spread by nose
to nose contact between the horses and through halters, lead ropes
and tack, Steele said. As an additional precaution, greenway
officials have also sterilized feed and water troughs.

"It starts with a cold, with the sniffles," Steele said. He
recommends that anyone concerned about EHV-1 call their veterinarian
immediately.

[Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and
geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and
horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is
determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and
possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results
in abortion.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in
neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination and
posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss
of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in
the perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis
may progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity
of signs and the period of recumbency. Neurologic disease associated
with EHV-1 is thought to occur more commonly in mares after abortion
storms, but it has been reported in barren mares, stallions,
geldings, and foals after an outbreak of EHV-1 respiratory infection.

For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases,
management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New
horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated
for 3-4 weeks before commingling with resident horses, especially
pregnant mares. Management-related stress-inducing circumstances
should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant
mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings,
yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory
disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and
appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises.
No horse should leave the premises for 3 weeks after recovery of the
last clinical case.

Parenterally administered modified live vaccines are licensed in some
countries but banned in others. An inactivated vaccine is the only
product currently recommended by the manufacturer as an aid in
prevention of EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during
mo 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Humoral immunity induced by
vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 generally persists for only 2-4
months. Antigenic variation within each virus type means that
available vaccines do not cover all strains to which horses can be
exposed. Vaccination should begin when foals are 3-4 months old and,
depending on the vaccine used, a 2nd dose given 4-8 weeks later.
Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 3-6 months
through maturity. Vaccination programs against EHV-1 should include
all horses on the premises.
