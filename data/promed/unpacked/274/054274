The last several hundred chickens with avian flu have been
slaughtered at 3 poultry farms on the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine's
autonomy, a national TV channel reported Wednesday. A total of 100
000 domestic fowl have been slaughtered in Crimea's Primorskoye
village. Damage is estimated at about $400 000, the NTN channel said,
citing veterinary officials.

Ukrainian Agrarian Policy Minister Oleksandr Baranivsky said grave
violations of sanitary rules were to blame for the bird flu outbreak.
Chickens were given water from open water reservoirs that lie on
migrating birds' way. Criminal cases were opened against farm workers
who are accused of negligence.

Mass fowl deaths were reported in Primorskoye 28 Dec [2005]. Several
days later the Vektor virology center based in Siberia confirmed the
deadly H5N1 bird flu strain. The strain of bird flu found in the
Crimea is highly contagious for chickens but presents less danger for
people, an expert from the virology center said Wednesday.

Anti-bird-flu drugs should be stockpiled at the disease's frontline
in Asia, ready to be shipped to threatened populations in the
critical 1st 2 weeks of an outbreak, the World Health Organisation
said yesterday. Asia was "still the epicentre of the threat to global
health posed by this virus", said the regional director of WHO,
Shigeru Omi [at a 2-day meeting of Asian countries and international
organisations on bird flu in Tokyo.]

Stockpiles are only now being built up but are in Europe and the US,
too far away for comfort. One or 2 stockpiles should be located in
Asia, where they could be drawn on in an emergency, Dr Omi told
representatives of 27 countries, including Australia, at a meeting in Tokyo.

All countries need a rapid reaction plan or the only feasible
approach to the disease -- containment -- would fail, according to a
senior WHO official, who said a global influenza taskforce would be
set up within weeks. But the logistics of managing an outbreak in
Asia remain complex. Laos, one of the poorest countries in the
region, told the conference it had neither the pathology laboratories
to quickly confirm an outbreak nor the trucks to deliver medicine.

[3] Netherlands: vaccination

The Dutch government wants to vaccinate its huge poultry population
against bird flu in the face of growing fears of a major European
outbreak, the farm ministry said on Thursday.

Bird flu experts recommend preventive vaccination to be considered
seriously in the tiny and densely populated Netherlands, where risk
is seen higher than the rest of the European Union because of its
huge numbers of poultry. The Netherlands, where land is scarce and
canals, rivers and ditches are abundant, is home to 16 million people
and 90 million poultry.

"The Dutch government is in favour of preventive vaccination," a farm
ministry spokesman said. "The idea is to submit a vaccination plan to
the European Commission before spring. The main fear is of possible
trade barriers from third countries, which needs to be considered,"
he added. The Netherlands is Europe's 2nd biggest poultry producer,
after France and one of the world's top poultry exporters. It was hit
by a deadly outbreak of bird flu of a different strain in 2003 but
has seen no new cases since.

Last month, EU farm ministers agreed to update the bloc's existing
bird flu law to increase controls and give governments greater
flexibility to vaccinate poultry. The Dutch farm ministry said the
European Commission -- the EU's executive -- still had to approve the
vaccination. The EU usually sees vaccination as a last resort and
bans livestock and meat imports from countries which use vaccination.

The Dutch poultry industry unions have supported the government's
plans. Dutch virologist Albert Osterhaus, a leading world avian
influenza scientist, said vaccination should be accompanied with a
monitoring programme because of a 2-week period needed for a vaccine
to start working. "I would definitely recommend vaccination to be
considered seriously. If you have a large (poultry) population like
in the Netherlands and you leave them unprotected, you're running a
high risk in the future," Osterhaus told Reuters.

A study carried out by Dutch scientists concluded in November 2005
that vaccinating chickens against avian flu can arrest a major
outbreak by preventing birds from passing on the virus. The 2003 bird
flu outbreak led to the culling of nearly 1/3 of the Dutch poultry
stock. The farm ministry said it was not necessary for now to
reintroduce a ban on keeping poultry indoors to prevent them from
catching bird flu from migrating birds. It lifted the ban on 1 Jan
2006 as the peak period for birds migration was over.

The ministry told farmers this week to feed and give water to poultry
only indoors.

Osterhaus and farm ministry officials saw the biggest risk from a
bird flu spread into western Europe from people travelling out of
Turkey and smuggling chicken meat products and called for stricter EU
travel and transport controls.

[4] Iraq: preparedness

Iraq said on Thursday it was on high alert to prevent the spread of
avian flu from neighbouring Turkey, but officials conceded that poor
border controls would make it difficult to enforce a ban on importing
birds. Iraq has been trying to secure porous borders with its
neighbours, particularly Syria, since 2003 to stop the flow of
foreign insurgents but with little success. Tribes living along
border areas also make a living from smuggling goods.

Despite these difficulties, the head of a committee set up by Iraq's
health and agriculture ministries to tackle bird flu is confident
that the country can avoid being touched by the H5N1 virus that has
spread from Asia to Europe's doorstep.

But it needs help -- both money and expertise.

"We are taking the situation seriously, but we need many things. We
need funds and also we need more communication with international
health groups, in person not via letters," Abdul Jali Hassan told
Reuters. "We have been on high alert since October [2005], and now
even more so after bird flu was discovered in Turkey," he said. "We
have issued orders to border officials to check (the poultry
imports), but it is a bit difficult knowing the conditions." He said
Iraq had also banned imports of poultry from Turkey, "but in a
country like Iraq many people import on their own; it is not organised".

Iraqi authorities say they also have no complete records of
slaughterhouses in Iraq, making their job of monitoring any outbreak
even more difficult. "But we are working on locating them and
counting them, then we will monitor their work," Hassan said.

7 government ministries would hold meetings within 2 days to decide
whether further steps needed to be taken, he added.

The H5N1 bird flu virus has been found in wild birds and poultry
across large parts of Turkey, particularly in poor villages
stretching from Istanbul at the gates of Europe to Van near the
Iranian and Iraqi borders. Migrating wild birds, often seen as
carriers of the virus, are due to start arriving soon at Lake Ducan
in Kurdistan in northern Iraq.

21 countries and organizations are holding [2-day] talks in Tokyo
sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) to discuss what
measures to take should the virus mutate into a form that could be
transmitted from human to human.

Doctors need to speed up testing for bird flu and governments must
jointly stockpile supplies to prevent the deadly virus from taking a
greater toll, international experts said. Hitoshi Oshitani, a doctor
on the WHO's bird flu task force, said it takes nearly 17 days on
average for suspected bird flu cases to be confirmed locally and by
the WHO. "It would be too late for containment," Oshitani told the
conference. He called for a streamlining of procedures to verify bird
flu cases, but acknowledged that a lack of laboratory space and
specialists was an impediment.

"One of the essential requirements in rapid response and containment,
I think, is participation of all countries," said another WHO medical
expert, Keiji Fukuda. "As this kind of rapid movement requires a
great deal of resources and expertise, we see that training, working
on the development and building stockpiles both at the regional and
international level is necessary," he said.

Narongsakdi Aungkasuvapala, deputy permanent secretary at Thailand's
ministry of public health, said that "improving measures to detect
bird flu is the most important issue" facing his country. "A large
part of the population raises chickens in their households, so it is
essential for us," he told AFP, referring to anti-flu measures.

Shigeru Omi, the WHO director of the Western Pacific Regional Office,
said that early detection was key to battling bird flu. "We must try
to ensure that we will be ready to respond instantly with all the
weapons at our disposal should the early signs of influenza pandemic
appear," Omi said in an opening speech.

[Rapid diagnosis is and has always been an important veterinary need,
whatever transboundary disease one is discussing. Speed in diagnosis
has a massive impact on the efficiency of stopping any epidemic. But
vaccination depends on the national budget and veterinary services
efficiency in the field. Too often it is invoked after things have
got out of hand. And with avian influenza it merely stops the birds
demonstrating clinical signs. They still get viraemic, though at a
lower titre. The risk of disease spread is only decreased, not
eliminated. - Mod.MHJ]
