[The epizootic seems to continue its spread. Since its start, reportedly on 24 Apr 2014, 103 outbreaks have been officially reported; the initial notification, 6 follow-up reports, and an interactive map showing the accumulated 103 outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15183.

Details of the vaccine used before April 2014, and of the vaccine applied "in response to the outbreak(s)," will be appreciated, as well as the authorities' assessment of the rate of protection conferred to the vaccinated animals against the FMDV-O strain currently circulating in Tunisia (for its genotyping results, please refer to 20140613.2537011).

In addition, it will be helpful to obtain information on the number and species of animals vaccinated since the start of the outbreak and about their respective geographic distribution.

As can be seen in the interactive map, a considerable number of the outbreaks have taken place on Tunisia's west, bordering Algeria. Rumors on the presence of the virus in Algeria (see 20140522.2491636) have not been officially confirmed; ProMED-mail's relevant RFI is pending. - Mod.AS
