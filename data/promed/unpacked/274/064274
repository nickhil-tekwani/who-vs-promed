Village in Russia's Urals imposes quarantine due to anthrax
-----------------------------------------------------------
Quarantine has been declared in a village in the Russian Republic of
Bashkortostan (RB) in the south west Urals after several humans were
infected with anthrax, a spokesman for the consumer rights regulator said
on Friday [29 Aug 2008]. Rospotrebnadzor said the measures were announced
after 10 residents of the village, Ural, located in the Yanaulsky district,
were hospitalized on Wednesday [27 Aug 2008].

The spokesman said the residents fell ill after eating meat from an
infected horse that had been killed 2 weeks earlier without any veterinary
tests. The meat has been destroyed, and specialists are looking into how
the horse became infected. Livestock has been banned from entering or
leaving the village, and all local meat retail has been suspended.

[In Central Russia and Central Asia horses are eaten routinely. Equine
cases of anthrax usually follow cases in other livestock so there may be
more to this than meets the eye. - Mod.MHJ
