Eight people were admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong with cholera. Source
was traced to contaminated prepared chicken feet products from unlicensed
manufacturers, and subsequent inadequate re-heating by side-walk vendors.
[Note: the English news reports did not go so far as to pin-point chicken
feet; beef, seafood & dim sum were also suspects - Mod.JW]
