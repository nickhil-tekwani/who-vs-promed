DR Congo: Humanitarian Information Note -- Ebola virus disease epidemic in Equateur, 20 Sep 2020, report 85
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key figures and facts
- IOM [International Organization for Migration] strengthens the system for monitoring and controlling population movements in Equateur.

Statistics since the beginning of the epidemic
- 124 cases reported including 118 confirmed and 6 probable
- 40 affected health areas, spread over 12 health zones
- 59 cured
- 50 deaths including 44 confirmed and 6 probable
- 31 179 people vaccinated since the start of the response

Overview of the situation
-------------------------
The strengthening of the response in the Lotumbe health zone is necessary. health zone notified a new confirmed case of Ebola virus disease on 18 Sep 2020.

Five priority entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) are now equipped with digital tablets in the health zones of Mbandaka, Bolenge, and Wangata. This endowment from IOM strengthens data management and improves the search for contacts never seen, lost, or moved. Due to the mobility of contacts, strengthening surveillance is essential for the success of the response.

IOM also plans to carry out an analysis of population movements in active health zones and border health zones. Currently, priority is particularly given to the control of movements likely to bring the disease to neighboring countries (Republic of Congo, Central African Republic), the cities of Kinshasa and Kisangani, and also to neighboring health zones such as Bokonzi and Bangabola (province of South Ubangui), Boende (province of Tshuapa), Penjoa, and Inongo (province of Maindombe).

DR Congo: Humanitarian Information Note -- Ebola virus disease epidemic in Equateur, 18 Sep 2020, report 84
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key figures and facts
- Preparation activities in risk areas need to be strengthened.
- Payment to service providers has started in Bikoro.

Overview of the situation
--------------------
The epidemiological situation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Ecuador is marked by high mobility of contacts in the province. WHO has strengthened the follow-up of contacts with support activities which encourage them to stay in their communities.

Good preparation in high-risk health zones is also necessary.

The Preparation Commission carried out integrated training (surveillance, communication, prevention, and control of infections) in the health zones of Basankusu, Loukolela, and Irebu. It is imperative to strengthen these activities in order to allow areas not yet affected to prepare to respond in time, and to bring the epidemic under rapid control.

It is essential that the multisectoral preparation in risk areas be assumed by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP). It will strengthen the institutional and community anchoring of this activity.

The active search for the 6 contacts lost to follow-up in the Bomongo health zone is intensifying in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighboring Republic of Congo. To pool research efforts, response teams are pursuing consultations through the Ministries of Health of the 2 countries and the WHO.

Food support for sick and cured people remains a necessity. The support of partners is essential. A WFP [UN World Food Programme] delegation met with the coordination of the response and some partners (PRONANUT [National Nutrition Program], UNICEF, WHO, and OCHA) in order to specify the practical modalities to assist these people.

The payments to service providers began on Fri 18 Sep in the Bikoro health zone. Several providers in the health zone had suspended their participation in response activities, requiring the payment of their premiums in advance. This situation affected the activities of the response in Bikoro. The rise of alerts has decreased while this area is experiencing a significant number of community deaths. The payroll team plans to continue this operation in other health zones.

The province of Equateur recorded 7 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, after mass collections organized on 1 Sep 2020. These cases are asymptomatic, and now remain in self-isolation. To date, the province of Equateur has recorded 14 confirmed cases including 3 deaths from COVID-19, distributed in 3 health zones.

DR Congo: Humanitarian Information Note -- Ebola virus disease epidemic in Equateur -- 15 Sep 2020, report 81
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key figures and facts
- A new affected health area in the Bikoro health zone.
- Visit of the Swedish cooperation and ECHO in the province of Equateur.

Overview of the situation
-------------------------
Cases of infection of children aged 0-5 are back in the province of Equateur. 2 children whose Ebola virus disease (EVD) was confirmed on 14 Sep 2020 are 2 months and 5 years old. They were reported in the health areas of Ngelo Monzoi and Botende, in the Bikoro health zone. The Ngelo Monzoi health area has just notified its 1st case, bringing the number of health areas affected by Ebola in Equateur province to 40. These cases, like most, have been exposed to the disease within the community.

A delegation from Swedish cooperation and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), arrived on Tue 15 Sep 2020 in Mbandaka to follow up on projects funded through FAO, Oxfam, and Action Against Hunger (ACF) in Equateur province. The delegation met the response partners the same day to discuss the epidemiological situation as well as the multisectoral response in support of the health response against Ebola. These discussions also focused on the opportunity to strengthen the province's health system, and to set up programs aimed at increasing the resilience capacity of the populations. On Wed 16 Sep 2020, this delegation will visit the projects implemented by Oxfam and ACF in the Bikoro health zone.

DRC Ebola outbreak total grows by 1 to reach 124 cases, with 50 deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests confirmed 1 new Ebola infection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 124, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) said today [21 Sep 2020] in a situation update.

The latest case was reported from Lotumbe health zone. No new deaths were reported, keeping the total at 50.

The latest outbreak is concerning because of stretched resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide area where cases have been reported, and some sick patients remaining in the community, raising the risk of further virus spread.

[3] USD 1 Ebola and Lassa point of care test
Date: Mon 14 Sep 2020
Source: Quartz Africa [edited]
https://qz.com/africa/1902948/scientists-in-nigeria-sierra-leone-develop-1-ebola-lassa-test/


Scientists in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and US have developed a USD 1 test for Ebola and Lassa virus

While countries across the world are battling with the coronavirus pandemic, some African countries, are also battling the outbreaks of deadlier hemorrhagic fever viruses: Lassa virus and Ebola virus. With the global pandemic draining resources and attention, African countries are facing more challenges controlling outbreaks of these diseases that have been ravaging Africa countries for over 40 years.

This year [2020], Nigeria recorded the highest Lassa fever outbreak in its history with an over 35% increase in cases from the previous year. Along with other West African countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, Nigeria is again approaching another seasonal outbreak starting from December. Meanwhile, last month [August 2020], the WHO raised an alarm that the response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the west of the DR Congo is underfunded and facing logistic challenges.

Just in time, a group of scientists from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the US have developed a point-of-care test (done at the time and place of care) for both the Lassa virus and Ebola virus that is accurate, fast, and cheap. The new test was reported to have reduced the cost of testing to less than USD 1 per sample. The test can be done quickly in any environment, as it requires minimal equipment that can be powered with solar or a small generator.

The test is based on SHERLOCK a new diagnostic that uses CRISPR technology to detect genetic fingerprints that indicate the presence of pathogens in a sample. It uses saliva or urine samples that are heated after collection in a chemical mixture to make the viruses inactive to avoid healthcare workers being infected during a test. This use of saliva or urine instead of blood makes the sample collection faster and sample.

The sample is then tested for viruses using a strip and the result read using a mobile app called HandLens. The mobile app developed by the scientists enables the user to read test strips by taking a picture of the strips using any smartphone or tablet which displays the test result in a simple graphical format.

This diagnostic which has been successfully tested in Nigeria and Sierra Leone will be a game-changer in Africa if effectively deployed as it can solve some of the key problems in the fight against Ebola and Lassa virus.

Currently, logistical challenges hinder responses to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo as the affected communities are in a remote and densely-forested area of the country. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test currently being used to test for Lassa virus and Ebola virus requires advanced laboratory infrastructure, a cold chain, and expensive reagents. These are lacking in many African countries and as such the PCR-based test is not logistically viable and scalable across the continent.

Though this new diagnostic will enable countries to get Ebola and Lassa virus tests to more people, it may take a while before it can be deployed due to regulatory and production hurdles. Several point-of-care diagnostics for COVID-19 similar to the USD 1 test being developed by Senegalese scientists were found to give an unacceptable rate of false results.

Though the new Ebola and Lassa virus test is based on a different technology, the WHO and regulatory agencies are often cautious when dealing with a new point-of-care test. This may apply to the new virus tests considering that it is based on the 1st-ever CRISPR tool approved (Emergency Use Authorization) by the US Food and Drug Administration just 4 months ago for a coronavirus CRISPR test to be used during this pandemic.

But, if the Ebola and Lassa virus test is approved and mass-produced in Africa then local authorities, as well as patents, will be able to afford a test.

[Patients presenting with hemorrhagic fevers caused by Lassa and Ebola viruses have symptoms that include fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, and vomiting that cannot distinguish causation, even though symptoms tend to be more severe in Ebola cases. In severe cases, both diseases can cause bleeding from the gums, eyes, and nose, which can lead to organ failure and death.

Lassa, as opposed to Ebola, can also cause tremors, facial swelling, respiratory distress, and encephalitis in serious cases. Lassa also can cause varying degrees of deafness in mild and severe cases -- oftentimes, the hearing loss is permanent. This happens in about 1/3 of infections, according to the CDC.

Having a point of care test that can identify the 2 viruses and distinguish between them would be a big advance allowing Ebola patients to be separated from patients with other etiologies, preventing its spread. In addition the test is affordable at a cost of USD 1 and proper treatment can be started much faster without having to wait days for a diagnosis. - Mod.LK
