The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) today [27 Aug 2008]
announced a proposed rule to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations
to initiate a complete ban on the slaughter of cattle that become
non-ambulatory after initial inspection by Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) inspection program personnel.

This proposed rule follows the 20 May 2008 announcement by secretary of
agriculture Ed Schafer to remove the provision that states that the FSIS
inspection program will determine the disposition of cattle that become
non-ambulatory and disabled after they have passed ante-mortem before
slaughter inspection on a case-by-case basis. Under the proposed rule, all
cattle that are non-ambulatory and disabled at any time prior to slaughter,
including those that become non-ambulatory disabled after passing
ante-mortem inspection, will be condemned and properly disposed of.

"To maintain consumer confidence in the food supply, eliminate further
misunderstanding of the rule and, ultimately, to make a positive impact on
the humane handling of cattle, I believe it is sound policy to simplify
this matter by initiating a complete ban on the slaughter of downer
cattle," said agriculture secretary Ed Schafer.

On 13 Jul 2007, FSIS published the final rule, "Prohibition of the Use of
Specified Risk Materials for Human Food and Requirements for the
Disposition of Non-Ambulatory Disabled Cattle; Prohibition of the Use of
Certain Stunning Devices Used To Immobilize Cattle During Slaughter," (SRM
final rule). The SRM final rule allowed a case-by-case re-inspection of
cattle to address the rare situations where an animal that is deemed by
FSIS as fit for human food at ante-mortem inspection subsequently suffers
an acute injury.

Under the proposed rule, cattle that become non-ambulatory disabled from an
acute injury after ante-mortem inspection will no longer be eligible to
proceed to slaughter as "US Suspects." Instead, FSIS inspectors will tag
these cattle as "US condemned" and prohibit these animals from proceeding
to slaughter. Establishments will be required to notify FSIS personnel when
cattle become disabled after passing ante-mortem inspection.

Of the nearly 34 million cattle that were slaughtered in 2007, less than
1000 cattle that were re-inspected were actually approved by the
veterinarian for slaughter. This represents less than 0.003 per cent of
cattle slaughtered annually.

Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before 29 Sep 2008.
Comments can be sent to Docket Clerk, US Department of Agriculture, Food
Safety and Inspection Service, Room 2534 South Agriculture Building, 1400
Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20250; emailed to
<fsis.regulationscomments@fsis.usda.gov>, or submitted through the Federal
eRulemaking Portal at <http://www.regulations.gov>. All submissions
received by mail or electronic mail must reference the Food Safety and
Inspection Service and include the docket number FSIS-2008-0022.

For further technical information on the proposed rule, contact Dr Daniel
Engeljohn, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Policy and Program
Development, at (202) 205 0495 or by fax at (202) 720 2025.

["Slaughter" is used here in the specific context of killing and butchering
the animal for human consumption. Downer animals going for rendering would
of course be killed 1st. This seems to be the final action in response to
the events in Chino at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. - Mod.MHJ]
