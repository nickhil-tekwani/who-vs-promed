Mumps outbreak centered at University of Illinois
-------------------------------------------------
The Illinois Department of Public Health says the state has 73 known mumps cases right now and more than 2/3 are in Champaign County. State and local health officials say the number of cases in the Champaign area is at 50 and could climb.

Health officials tell the News-Gazette that most of the cases are linked to the University of Illinois campus. And thousands of students who are away are expected to be back on campus in the next few weeks for fall classes.

Dr Robert Palinkas is director of the McKinley Health Center. He said mumps outbreaks happen periodically on campus. But he said the current outbreak is the largest in more than a decade. Palinkas said the university is working to isolate students who have mumps.

Health officials monitoring undisclosed number of people after Mizzou [University of Missouri] mumps outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mizzou issues alert over suspected area mumps cases. Determination of mumps has yet to be confirmed through laboratory testing.

The Columbia/Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services is monitoring an undisclosed number of people following the current mumps outbreak where 6 University of Missouri-Columbia have tested positive for the disease.

In addition to the 6 confirmed cases, health officials have identified another probable case and 4 other potential mumps cases.

Health officials launched an investigation 20 Jul 2015 after they were alerted to a potential cluster of people possibly sick with mumps. Spokeswoman Andrea Waner said the department is monitoring people who have come in close and direct contact with the 6 confirmed cases.

Waner did not say how many people were being monitored. "Right now, it's really about awareness and communication," she said, adding that most mumps cases don't lead to serious complications.

Meanwhile, Mizzou has sent out a number of alerts to parents, students, prospective students, and anyone who has been on campus since late June [2015]. All current and prospective students are urged to keep updated on their university-required immunizations.

Mumps is a viral illness that can cause fever, body aches, headaches, fatigue, swelling of the salivary glands or pain with chewing and swallowing. Among men, mumps can lead to swelling of the testicles. Among women, mumps can lead to swelling of the ovaries, which may cause abdominal pain or swelling of the breasts.

The illness typically spreads when an uninfected person inhales respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes.

About 1/3 of the people who contract the mumps virus do not develop any symptoms.

[The state of Missouri can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3546295,16851. Columbia County, in north central Missouri, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/missouri-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

The mumps virus is an RNA virus belonging to the genus _Rubulavirus_ in the family _Paramyxovirus_. According to the CDC, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand per year. Before the United States mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.

Outbreaks can occur any time of the year but occur most commonly in winter and spring. Mumps virus is highly contagious, therefore a major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team, or living in a dormitory with a person who has mumps -- thus the cases reported above in 2 university settings.

MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49 percent to 92 percent) effective.

The most common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides (parotitis). Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.

Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. Complications may include infections of the coverings of the brain [meningitis] (15 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. - Mod.LK]
