Dog flown out of Baghdad had rabies
-----------------------------------
One of the 26 dogs and cats flown out of Iraq to rejoin soldiers in
the USA has tested positive for rabies. SPCA International [Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] says the rabies was
discovered this week [23-26 Jun 2008] after Crusader, a 55-pound
black Labrador mix, was euthanized for other health reasons.

The animals arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport 3 weeks
ago. SPCA officials say the organization complied with all customs
and health regulations, and that all 26 animals were cleared to enter the USA.

Health officials are recommending revaccination of the remaining dogs
and cats. In addition, people who may have had close contact with
Crusader should talk with their doctor about whether they need
treatment. The [New Jersey] state Health Department is monitoring the
situation.
