[Unfortunately, ProMED-mail is unable to post the graph, but the link in the text will bring it up. The graph clearly shows the difference in incidences of SFTS per 100 000 for Japan and the higher and increasing rate for South Korea. The reference given demonstrates how Gideon can produce comparative graphs. ProMED thanks Dr. Steve Berger for this comment and links with demonstrations.

A note in the comment on the previous post, SFTS virus is endemic in East Asia, including Korea. The virus is transmitted by the scrub or bush tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, which was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago. With no vaccine available, avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available.

Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm.
