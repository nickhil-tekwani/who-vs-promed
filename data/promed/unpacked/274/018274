COVID-19 vaccine trials should seek worthwhile efficacy [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 27]. Lancet. 2020; S0140-6736(20)31821-3. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31821-3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three issues are crucial in planning COVID-19 vaccine trials: (1) whether to demand not only proof of some vaccine efficacy but also proof of worthwhile efficacy; (2) whether the initial trials of vaccine against placebo should prioritise not only single-vaccine trials but also a multivaccine trial; and (3) whether to assess safety, protection against severe disease, and duration of protection by continuing blinded follow-up of the vaccine and placebo groups after definite evidence of short-term efficacy has emerged, but before an effective vaccine has been deployed locally in the general population.

The world needs efficient, speedy, and reliable evaluation of many candidate vaccines against COVID-19. There is a danger that political and economic pressures for rapid introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine could lead to widespread deployment of a vaccine that is in reality only weakly effective (such as, reducing COVID-19 incidence by only 10-20%), perhaps because of a misleadingly promising result from an underpowered trial. Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the COVID-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated individuals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other COVID-19 control measures. Deployment of a marginally effective vaccine could also interfere with the evaluation of other vaccines, as subsequent vaccines would then have to be compared with it rather than with a placebo. For a vaccine superior to the weakly effective vaccine, the increased sample size required could delay recognition of its efficacy. More importantly, if the weak vaccine is compared against an even weaker vaccine, the statistical criteria used to analyse non-inferiority trials could well endorse the even weaker vaccine as being non-inferior (so-called bio-creep)./1

The criteria used to define a successful vaccine in the initial clinical trials of vaccination versus placebo should therefore be strict enough to protect against the risk of a weakly effective vaccine being deployed, especially since there are already many candidate vaccines against COVID-19 to be tested,/2 providing many chances to overestimate efficacy. Hence, the initial trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines versus placebo should seek reliable evidence not only of some efficacy but of worthwhile efficacy.

WHO recommends that successful vaccines should show an estimated risk reduction of at least one-half,/3 with sufficient precision to conclude that the true vaccine efficacy is greater than 30%. This means that the 95% CI for the trial result should exclude efficacy less than 30%. Current US Food and Drug Administration guidance includes this lower limit of 30% as a criterion for vaccine licensure./4

The WHO Solidarity Vaccines Trial/9 (Figure: Selected design features of the WHO Solidarity Vaccines Trial) aims to evaluate efficiently and rapidly (within 3-6 months of each vaccine's introduction into the study) the efficacy of multiple vaccines,/10 helping to ensure that weakly effective vaccines are not deployed.

[See the source URL above for a figure depicting the WHO Solidarity Vaccines Trial plan and for all references. The danger of releasing an ineffective vaccine, especially one that has not been fully compared against a placebo, is real and could be extremely damaging to public confidence in addition to public health. Several prominent physicians and experts are calling for the creation of an independent commission to review data from coronavirus vaccine trials before a vaccine is allowed on the market.

A CNN poll this month [August 20202] shows that 40% of Americans do not want to get a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available, even if it's free and easy to access. Such a low uptake of the vaccine could hinder the ability to get the virus under control and return to normalcy.

Dr Kathryn Stephenson, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said she thought of the idea of an independent panel to increase trust in the vaccine after several colleagues told her they did not want to get a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. "I'm hearing this from my peers, from doctors and nurses. They are not anti-vaxxers. They are pro vaccine. They vaccinated their children. But they are skeptical about this vaccine," said Stephenson, director of the clinical trials unit at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Separately from Stephenson, bioethicist Arthur Caplan arrived at the same conclusion....

[However, the FDA is taking steps] to "offer reassurance that any potential vaccine will be safe and effective. First, the agency established clear recommendations  for vaccine performance prior to the initiation of phase 3 trials to provide assurance that any authorized vaccine will meet appropriate standards for safety and effectiveness. Second, FDA has committed to use an advisory committee composed of independent experts to ensure deliberations about authorization or licensure are transparent for the public," according to the blog, written by [Dr Stephen] Hahn, Dr Anand Shah, and Dr Peter Marks. Hahn assured "clinical trial data will be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee, "which will give us their guidance on any decision that we make." That committee is scheduled to meet on 22 Oct [2020]."
(partly excerpted from https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/30/health/covid-19-vaccine-fda-independent-commission/index.html)

There is such high pressure on vaccine developers, it will be difficult to take the time needed to thoroughly evaluate vaccines to protect people against infection with SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK]

[2] Comment on USA 2nd infection report

[re: ProMED COVID-19 update (380): excess mortality, 2nd infect, pediatric shedding, WHO 20200829.7727737
[2] USA (Nevada): Genomic documentation of 2nd infection]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I read with interest this possible re-infection, but do have an observation on the original testing.

The paper states the testing was done at a 'community-based testing event' which to me means that many swabs were collected that day and that possibly the original positive test MAY have been mislabeled. My thoughts on this are that the date of collection was 25 days after onset of symptoms, and was symptomatic for over 1 month (not as common in a community case). The patient subsequently tested negative by to tests, then tested positive 8 days after onset of symptoms, with a swab collected in a hospital.

As a laboratory technologist, I never like to think that a specimen could be mislabeled but from what I see of these drive-through testing clinics or community clinics where many swabs are collected in an assembly-line like situation, this possibility of mislabeling cannot be ruled out.

[Thank you Jim Gauthier for raising some interesting possibilities. I am not trying to deny there may well be 2nd infections with genetically different viruses. We are still very much on the upward slope of the learning curve about the SARS-CoV-2, with more questions than definitive answers. So far, the best evidence for a 2nd infection seems to be the 1st case report from Hong Kong, which has now been released by Clinical Infectious Diseases:

ref: To KK, Hung IF, Ip JD, et al. COVID-19 re-infection by a phylogenetically distinct SARS-coronavirus-2 strain confirmed by whole genome sequencing [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 25]. Clin Infect Dis. 2020; ciaa1275. doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa1275
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Background. Waning immunity occurs in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs.

"Methods. Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during 2 episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG, were analyzed.

"Results. The 2nd episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the 1st symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the 2nd episode, there was serological evidence of elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from 1st and 2nd episodes belong to different clades/lineages. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the 1st virus genome has a stop codon at position 64 of orf8 leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids, and was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the 2nd virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020. Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the 1st and 2nd episodes.

"Conclusions. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from 1st infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among the human populations despite herd immunity due to natural infection or vaccination. Further studies of patients with re-infection will shed light on protective correlates important for vaccine design."

[The 19th consecutive day with more than 100 newly confirmed cases. In the past 2 weeks, there has been an increase in mortality reported as well. Notices 531 and 532 (the latest analyses of the ongoing outbreak are at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030) provide details on clusters as of 00:00 hours 1 Sep 2020. These involve multiple clusters, some faith-based, some school-based, and other areas of work or communal gatherings. Faith-based congregations are the predominant groups with cases, although a hair salon and indoor fitness center have also been associated with clusters. Of the locally transmitted cases, 93 are in Seoul, 60 are in neighboring Gyeonggi province, and 22 are in Incheon. 15 of the 17 provinces have reported locally transmitted cases.

[A repetitive comment (for those who have read this before): These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. The 24-hour positivity rate in the USA is consistent with continued ongoing significant transmission in the community. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[4] WHO updates
[A] Weekly summary
Date: Mon 31 Aug 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 30 Aug 2020.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Over 1.8 million new COVID-19 cases and 38 000 new deaths were reported to WHO in the week ending [30 Aug 2020], a 1% increase in the number of cases and 3% decrease in the number of deaths compared to the previous week ([17 to 23 Aug 2020]) (Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by WHO region, [30 Dec 2019 to 30 Aug 2020]). A cumulative total of nearly 25 million cases and 800 000 deaths have been reported since the start of the outbreak.

Overall, the Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest burden of COVID-19 globally, accounting for nearly half of all new cases reported in the past 7 days, although within the region there have been slight decreases in new cases and deaths in the past week. The WHO South East Asia Region showed the highest rise in new cases in the past week, with over 500 000 new cases reported. In the European Region, new cases and new deaths have continued to increase over the past 7 days compared to the previous week. Along with the Region of the Americas, the percentage change in new cases in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific Regions have all declined compared with last week. Table 1: Newly reported and cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, by WHO Region, data as of [30 Aug 2020]

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
Several countries in the Region that were previous COVID-19 hotspots have recorded a reduction in case incidence including Ghana, Kenya, Gabon, and Madagascar. While the observed declining trends are encouraging, the figures should be interpreted cautiously as they may be affected by many factors, including the current testing capacity and strategy, and delays in reporting.

Cases in Ethiopia have continued to rise, reaching new highs this week (10 621 cases) with Addis Ababa remaining the worst affected region. In response, the Ethiopian government, with support from WHO, have launched the COVID-19 Enhanced Community Based Activities and Testing Campaign (ComBAT). ComBAT aims to reach out to over 60 million individuals in a variety of settings, conduct 200 000 tests, and treat 10 000 cases.

At 622 551 cases, South Africa has the 5th highest number of COVID-19 infections globally and the highest number in Africa. However, there has been a marked decline in new cases since they peaked on [25 Jul 2020] at 13 944 cases, and the downward trend has continued this week with new cases falling by 34% (Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, data as of [30 Aug 2020]). As a result, the government has eased public health and social measures while reminding the public to remain vigilant.

- Region of the Americas
The Americas account for approximately 13% of the world's population, but over 50% of officially reported global cases and deaths. Currently, while the biggest drivers of the case counts in the region have observed a moderate decline or stabalisation of case incidence (Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by Region of the Americas, data as of [30 Aug 2020]), increasing trends are now being seen in other parts of the region including Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Social gatherings could also have contributed to the increase in cases in the region. WHO recommends avoiding the 3 c's'-crowded places, close contact settings, and confined and enclosed settings. More advice from WHO on how to protect yourself and others from the spread COVID-19 can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public.

The United States of America has the highest number of cases in the world -- over 5.8 million cases, a quarter of the global total. However, the country has witnessed a decline in new cases from previous peaks in July [2020] of over 70 000 cases per day to an average of 41 000 new cases per day this past week. As school and university campuses have reopened, there have been news reports of students testing positive. WHO has published guidance for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19.

Although cases in Colombia have declined in the past week, they have been gradually increasing since June [2020] and continued caution is required. After 5 months of implementing public health and social measures, Colombia will begin easing the measures beginning [1 Sep 2020].

Argentina has reported new peaks in the number of cases reported weekly and an upward trajectory in cases and deaths since June [2020]. Cases in Mexico declined by 6% in the past week and have declined gradually across the month of August [2020]. Mexico is implementing remote teaching and education for children to reduce transmission.

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a fluctuating incidence of new cases in recent weeks (Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by Eastern Mediterranean Region, data as of [30 Aug 2020]). The highest number of new cases have been seen in Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. WHO, in partnership with the Iraqi Ministry of Health and its implementing partners, has concluded another round of a COVID-19 awareness-raising campaign that intensified community outreach efforts to educate people on measures to limit transmission of COVID-19. The campaign reached more than 5 million people in 4 densely populated and heavily affected areas in Basra, Wasit, Thi Qar, and Missan. Campaign teams are moving to the Kurdistan region and will be targeting 9 heavily populated, high-risk areas in Sulaymaniyah province. Over the past week WHO has also delivered 6 ambulances to the Ministry of Health of the Kurdistan region and 22 tonnes of COVID-19 equipment.

In Pakistan, cases have fallen from over 5 000 per day in mid-June [2020] to 2 871 cases in the past week. As the public health and social measures are lifted, the public is encouraged to take precautions to ensure a resurgence does not occur particularly as they celebrate the 1st 10 days of the month of Muharram, which started on [21 Aug 2020].

- European Region
Gradual increases continue to be observed in the European Region (Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by European Region, data as of [30 Aug 2020]), with Spain, Russia, France, and Ukraine reporting the highest number of new cases this week. Spain has seen a resurgence since mid-July [2020] and cases are now reaching the peaks previously seen in March and April [2020]. July and August is the holiday season in Spain, and social interactions have likely contributed to the increased number of reported cases. Spain has deployed the military to support contact tracing activities.

France has also seen a growing number of cases since the end of July [2020] with cases rising from around 500 cases per day to approximately 4 773 cases per day over the past week.

Cases in Italy have shown a marked increase in the past 7 days, up by 85% overall compared to last week.

In the European Region, many of those who died of COVID-19 have been elderly people (as of this week 88% of all deaths were in persons aged 65 years and over). WHO has published comprehensive guidance on preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services.

- South East Asia Region
South East Asia has reported the largest week-on-week increase (Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by South-East Asia Region, data as of [30 Aug 2020]), largely due to increased case detections in India. India has reported nearly 500 000 new cases in the past 7 days, a 9% increase compared to the previous 7 days and the highest numbers of new cases globally. While these trends are concerning, the increase in cases should be seen against a substantive rise in testing in recent weeks.

In Indonesia, cases have been gradually increasing while there are also concerns about transmission among family members of school children as 40% of people aged 60 years and older in Indonesia live in three-generation households, meaning that they live with their children and grandchildren. WHO has published interim guidance on considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 and a joint document with UNICEF and IFRC on key messages and actions for COVID-19 prevention and control in schools. WHO has also convened a technical advisory group on schools.

- Western Pacific Region
The Philippines and Japan are reporting the highest number of new cases in the region this week although cases in Japan have been decreasing since the end of June [2020] with a 22% decrease in overall cases reported this week [ending 30 Aug 2020], compared to last week [17 to 23 Aug 2020]. In the Philippines, a large percentage of cases have been reported from the National Capital Region.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (68 770), followed by Brazil (48 590), and the USA (38 560) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.9%). 4202 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (30-31 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Russia, Peru, Iraq, and Mexico. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3719 to 68 770. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, France, Indonesia, Israel, Bangladesh, Ukraine, South Africa, Chile, Iran, and Costa Rica, and their range of reported new cases is 1588 to 3423. A total of 27 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 3.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased 5.1%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. The global 7-day averages seem to reflect a small increase of reporting confirmed cases, although deaths are decreasing. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
