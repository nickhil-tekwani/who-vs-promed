Providence Hospital [Everett, Washington] officials say one of their own workers may have exposed hundreds of people to whooping cough, and now they're notifying employees and patients to get help immediately. Providence Regional Medical Center has been "ground zero" for the treatment of pertussis, or whooping cough. But this week it became ground zero for a new potential outbreak.

Dr Ahmet Tural is the head of infectious disease at the hospital. He said a hospital employee went to the staff clinic last week [week of 25 Jun 2012] complaining of a nasty cough. He was sent home as a precaution, and on Mon 2 Jul 2012, his test results came back positive for whooping cough. "He probably had it for about 2 weeks or slightly more, perhaps," Tural said.

That means the employee had 2 weeks of direct contact with patients and fellow employees at the hospital. Officials believe at least 53 employees have been exposed to the illness, but that number could end up being more than 300 after factoring in patients and visitors.

The hospital has been proactive. "If they had direct exposure, then we automatically require them to be put on antimicrobials," said Providence official Teresa Wenta.

The worker in question thought he had been proactive, too. He was vaccinated against pertussis, but it wasn't effective. Tural said sometimes the vaccination just doesn't work. "In 20, 25, 30 per cent of the cases it may not be fully protective," he said.

[Exposure and infection of hospital workers with pertussis can be the ultimate nightmare scenario since it can expose unprotected neonates, the major risk group, to the infection. Maternal immunization during the 2nd or 3rd trimester can protect the infant and is now part of "cocooning" in many countries.

That the hospital employee had received a booster vaccine against pertussis brings up the selection of less vaccine-preventable clones. Research regarding acellular pertussis vaccination failures by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103), has been highlighted in ProMED-mail. This phenomenon reflects antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. If so, these changes may result in a need for modifications to the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines, and without these modifications, selection and further spread of clones not as protected for by the vaccine will continue to increase. - Mod.LL
