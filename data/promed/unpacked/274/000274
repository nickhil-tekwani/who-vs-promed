Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor: Animal feed theft behind ASF epidemic
----------------------------------------------------------------
Animal feed thefts in Russia may be to blame for the latest outbreaks of African Swine Fever on industrial farms, according to Rosselkhoznadzor's website.

Hog feed stolen from 2 industrial farms located in the Tver and Krasnodar regions may be spreading the virus. The culprit could be the bags, coming from private yards, used to carry the stolen feed out, Alexei Alekseenko, spokesman for Rosselkhoznadzor, said by phone in Moscow today.

Nikolai Vlasov, deputy head of Rosselkhoznadzor, appealed to farm owners and veterinary officials to pay "extreme attention" to guards that work on farms.

About 76 000 pigs out of 800 000 in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia are infected with ASF and will be killed, the region's government said on its website yesterday.

Governor Alexander Tkachev declared a state of emergency in the area because of ASF, according to the statement.

About 500 000 pigs died or have been killed in ASF outbreaks in Russia since the virus was discovered in the country in 2007, Alekseenko said.

[The original (in Russian) appeal of Nikolai Vlasov, deputy head of Rosselkhoznadzor (Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance) to stakeholders can be accessed at http://fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/5080.html. It includes pictures taken on the sites of ASF-affected plants, exposing deficiencies in their biosecurity systems, particularly the fencing, its structure and its maintenance.

On 10 Aug 2012, a trinational meeting on ASF was held in Kiev at the initiative of the Ukrainian side. Heads of the State Veterinary Services of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine participated. The meeting was held in view of the introduction of the disease into Ukraine and the aggravation of the epizootic situation of the disease in Russia.

No vaccine against ASF is, so far, available. The disease is not zoonotic. Its economic impact can be disastrous, on top of animal suffering. - Mod.AS.]
