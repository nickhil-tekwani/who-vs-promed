The following background data on St. Louis encephalitis in the United
States were abstracted from the GIDEON software program:
The first cases were described in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1933 (1095 cases
registered); however, most cases are now reported in California, Colorado,
Florida, Kentucky, Texas, and the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Cases are
not encountered in Hawaii or Alaska.
Peak incidence occurs during July to September. The largest epidemic was
reported in 1975 (1815 cases in the Ohio-Mississippi Valley).
More than 5000 cases were registered between 1955 and 1993; 2,194 during
1975 to 1976; 247 in 1990 - 223 of these (11 fatal) in Florida.
78 cases (9 fatal) were reported in 1991; 14 (2 fatal) in 1992 (12 in Texas
and 2 in California); 18 (1 fatal) in 1993; 20 (3 fatal) in 1994; 2 in 1996
(both from Texas); 13 cases (including 9 cases, 1 fatal in Florida) were
reported in 1997; 17 cases were confirmed in Louisiana (Jefferson Parish,
Lafayette, Orleans Parish, St. Tammany Parish) during the summer of 1998.
The local vectors are _Culex tarsalis_ in the west; _Cx. nigripalpus_ in
Florida; and _Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus_ in the Ohio-Mississippi River
basins. Additional vectors include _Aedes dorsalis/melanimon_, _Ae.
scapularis_, _Ae. serratus_, _Anopheles crucians_, _Cx. peus_, _Cx.
restuans_ and _Cx. salinarius_.

[All these species may not be vectors of SLE virus to humans. Without
human experimental transmission studies (which will not be done), isolation
of an arbovirus from a mosquito does not mean anything more than that the
mosquito has picked up the virus from a vertebrate.
117 cases of SLE with 11 deaths occurred in the Delaware Valley (New Jersey
and Pennsylvania) in 1964. - Mod.CHC
