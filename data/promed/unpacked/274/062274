2 Children were taken to PHC [Primary Health Care unit] Chilakota
after vomiting. Disease symptoms were found and the children were
sent to CHC [Community Health Center] Limkheda for further treatment.
Next day they had convulsions with fever and foaming in their mouth
and died on the same day.

Serum samples of the 2 children were taken and sent to National
Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The result was Chandipura virus
positive for both samples.

Initial visit and investigation done by district level team, EMO
[emergency medical officer], DSI, QAMO, BHO Limkheda [various medical
and health officers] and MO PHC [medical officer, primary health
center] Chilakota with other health staff. 4 surveillance teams of
local health workers with 2 supervisors and MO is formed. Total

[ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for calling in this official report and
the Chandipura virus infection diagnosis. It would be of interest to
know if the identification as Chandipura virus as the etiological
agent in these 2 cases was serological (IgM), virus isolation or by
PCR. Because Chandipura virus infections were considered relatively
benign prior to the reports of encephalitis coming out of India in
2004, it would be valuable to establish a repository of Chandipura
virus isolates at a WHO reference center for arboviruses so that
comparative genetic studies can be made of these recent Indian
isolates, ones made during the previous outbreak and the prototype virus.
