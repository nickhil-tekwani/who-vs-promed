A mystery disease is turning a rural village into a community of mutants crippled and deformed by a painful condition. It has left health experts baffled as villagers complain of their hands and feet slowly twisting out of shape.

It has affected mostly men, but all are suffering as the bones in their limbs slowly deform, and, in many cases, painful pustules are also appearing on their skin.

Medics are now desperately trying to help villagers in Yalong township, on the outskirts of the city of Hechi in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Health care worker Doctor Li Wu, 41, said: "In many cases, this doesn't only just look bad, it also significantly affects the person's ability to work. For people in a rural community who have to carry out a lot of manual work, it is a disaster."

More than 20 villagers have the bizarre condition and in many cases have been suffering from it for years.

One victim, 38, can only do light work around the house now after 1st discovering she was suffering from the problem 12 years ago. She said: "Many of my neighbours have been to different health centres and hospitals, but nobody seems to know what the problem is, although it's great that the experts have now come here to try and get to the bottom of it."

They have been carrying out tests on the water and on the food that the villagers have been growing in the mountainous region.

The current most popular theory is that they are all suffering from a variation of Kaschin-Beck disease [also known as KBD], a bone infection which principally is caused by lack of selenium in water or food, which in turn leads to a susceptibility to the condition.

Although toxic in large amounts, a small amount of selenium is vital in animals, including humans, for a healthy, functioning body.

Experts say it is too early to say, although they are hoping that they will be able to prevent further outbreaks and also offer some alleviation to those already infected.

[Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a devastating bone disease without a cure. It most often affects children and affects the growth plates resulting people of short stature. It is an endemic osteochondropathy, or bone disease occurring most often in China, Tibet, North Korea and some parts of Siberia.

While a number of things have been possibly linked as a possible cause, a positive cause and treatment remain elusive. Selenium deficiency was at one time linked to this disease. Addition of selenium to the diet in some regions may help prevent the disease but it does not reverse the situation or treat an existing situation. In other regions where the disease has occurred selenium has had little to no effect in preventing KBD. Selenium in doses that are too high can be toxic to the individual, creating other difficulties. Likewise, treatment with iodine (often insufficient in the diet) has shown some benefit for treatment.

KBD has also been linked to a variety of mycotoxins, including _Fusarium_ sp. and _Alternaria_ sp. There are a number of others may be possible causes as well. It could also be a combination of these mycotoxins.

There are excellent, yet sad and heart breaking photos of the affected individuals on the original website. The difference in KBD and what is happening to these people is that most of them seem to be adults, where as KBD most commonly affects growing individuals, having a profound effect on the growth plates. Furthermore, I could not find a reference regarding KBD that point to pustules to accompany the bone deformities.

While this disease may indeed be a mycotoxin or combination of mycotoxins in the grain based food stuffs, it strikes me that it looks a bit like a parasite invasion. This article tells us that doctors are testing food and water, but it does not tell us if any cultures of pustules have been done. It does not tell us if individuals have been taken to medical facilities for bone scans or culture or any other testing. It only says that some have traveled to medical facilities.

If someone has more information on this as yet undiagnosed disease, what has been tested for and results, we would appreciate your communication.
