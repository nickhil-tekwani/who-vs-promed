Fruit trees in Nainital district are becoming afflicted with taphrina fungus. Hail experienced earlier this year [2020] had damaged the fruit trees, on top of which taphrina is threatening to severely damage the peach and plum production in the mountainous regions.

The district horticulture officer said that farmers should have sprayed in November [2019] to protect their trees from taphrina. Currently, peach trees have been afflicted by this fungus, which causes the green leaves to turn brown and at times dries the tree itself. Farmers have sprayed their trees thrice so far, but this has not had any effect.

Earlier, due to the meteorological factors, it was estimated that between 40-50% of the fruit production in the district could be damaged. However, after the fungus affliction, farmers are estimating that up to 90% of the fruit production could be damaged.

[The fungus _Taphrina deformans_ causes leaf curl disease of peach, nectarine, and cherry. The disease is common in unsprayed orchards. Symptoms include distortion, thickening, and discolouration of leaves; infected leaves and fruit drop prematurely; and infected twigs are swollen and stunted, usually with deformed leaves at their tips. Severely defoliated trees produce fewer fruit and are more vulnerable to winter damage and opportunistic diseases.

The related _T. communis_ and _T. pruni_ cause plum pocket. Symptoms include enlarging spots on fruit that eventually cover the whole fruit. Fruits become abnormally large with a hollow core and a decayed outer appearance.

Spores of the fungi are spread by wind and water and can remain dormant in bark crevices for several years. They germinate during rainy periods in spring, and only young tissue is susceptible to infection. Thus in years when rains and bud break do not coincide, the spores remain inactive, and little or no infection occurs. This may lead to a periodic pattern of the appearance of leaf curl. Disease management relies on fungicides applied at the dormant stage. If this time is missed, as in the situation reported above, fungicide applications after bud break are ineffective in controlling the disease.
