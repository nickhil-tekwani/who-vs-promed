Sick cow costs Montana its brucellosis-free status
--------------------------------------------------
A sick cow near Yellowstone National Park has Montana governor Brian
Schweitzer and cattlemen calling for measures to protect stock and
ranchers. The disease is brucellosis. The cow was in Paradise Valley. In
May 2008, it tested positive for the disease that causes cows to abort. The
case will cause Montana to lose its federal designation as brucellosis-free.

"The big unknown is what will be the impact on the marketplace here in
Montana," said Dennis McDonald, former president of the Montana Cattlemen's
Association. "None of us know for sure. It'll be a financial burden. It's a
question to what extent."

What it means is that all of Montana's livestock producers will now be
required to test bulls and cows, unspayed and 18 months old or older a
month before interstate shipment. Montana cattle ranchers who want to ship
or move their stock will have to prove to the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) that the animals do not have _Brucella abortus_ bacterium, the
causative agent of the disease.

"It's an enormous amount of work," McDonald said. Montana veterinarian
Marty Zaluski said the loss of brucellosis-free status is particularly
frustrating given efforts by livestock producers and the industry to
mitigate risks and increase disease surveillance.

"Producers in the Paradise Valley have been involved and diligent, and they
have taken it upon themselves to be proactive in regard to managing the
risk of brucellosis transmission," Zaluski said. "In this particular case,
the owner did everything right. The cow had been vaccinated twice and was
part of a herd management plan."

Officials will test to track the cause of the disease in the Paradise
Valley animal. The last case was linked to elk, Zaluski said.

About a year ago, the disease was discovered in a Bridger cattle herd. Two
herds, totaling 585 animals were killed to limit the spread of the disease.
To keep its brucellosis-free status from the USDA, the state would have had
to have no cases until July 2009. Previously, Montana livestock had been
free of the disease since 1985.

The soonest the state can apply to regain class free status is a year from
the date the last positive animal was killed, which will be 27 May next
year [2009].

All other animals in the herd where the sick cow was found have tested
negative for brucellosis. Herds with links to the herd where the infected
cow was found will be placed under quarantine unless, or until, they are
whole-herd tested. McDonald of the Cattlemen's Association said the 2nd
case does not come as a surprise. "I'm only surprised it took as long as it
did," he said. "It's obvious that park wildlife is a reservoir of brucellosis."

McDonald said the National Park Service has not made any significant
efforts to curb the spread of the disease, which he was careful not to
blame on bison. McDonald advocated for vaccination "We need funds for more
research into a better vaccine. We need a plan to vaccinate wildlife in a
manner that's least destructive to their lives and ecosystems," McDonald said.

Plus, he said, the area near Yellowstone National Park needs to be treated
differently than the rest of the state. Gov Schweitzer agreed. Montana
needs "split-state" status, he said, so cattle ranchers across the state
won't be affected by cases near Yellowstone.

Schweitzer has been advocating for a different brucellosis management
strategy near the park since taking office. He called for a small, separate
management zone -- termed "split-state status" by USDA -- for the area
immediately surrounding the park. Only about 5 per cent of the state's
cattle would have been affected by the USDA action.

"Let's not play the blame-game," McDonald said. "Let's roll up our sleeves
and figure out the next step."

[For cattle owners this becomes an economic burden. Testing of cattle
shipped from Montana can add up in dollars and time. The state will
certainly be diligent in their testing and in tracing animals. They will be
hoping there will be no other cases and they can apply for brucellosis-free
status in 2009. Other cases can push the proposed date further out. - Mod.TG]
