The following is a response obtained from Eric James, PhD, Medical
University of South Carolina, in answer to Michae Fraze's request for
information.
The symptoms mentioned in this case are all characteristic of long-term
head lice infestations. Hirschfelder (1919) was probably the first to
report a rise in body temperature (fever, sometimes leading to a febrile
condition), generalized diffuse allergic rash, headache, heaviness of the
limbs, stiffness of the muscles and general
lassitude. Adenopathy is common, principally of the cervical lymph nodes in
cases of head lice (many references). Contact reactions (e.g. edema) may
also occur in some patients anywhere on the body as a result of exposure to
louse feces. These symptoms seem to result directly from actively feeding
lice (e.g. saliva, feces) and after the lice have been removed the symptoms
subside. Secondary infection also may occur: exudative crusting, pyoderma
and impetigo, though usually limited to the scalp. It is claimed that lice
are the commonest cause of impetigo in developing countries (Taplin and
Meinking, 1988).

I am a Consultant in Communicable Disease Control in Leeds, Yorkshire,
England.
We have a serious problems with head lice in this area. Many health
professionals are involved in dealing with this problem and I get many
queries. Your niece's problem does not sound like a usual reaction to
head lice, but might be a drug reaction. Do you know how the head lice were
treated?
If you are interested the Leeds Health Authority Head lice Policy is
available on line from <http://www.schwefam.demon.co.uk/lice.htm>
NB Do not always blame school contacts ... lice require head to head contact
which is more common in social rather than school settings.

Might as well check for/rule out the presence of _Bartonella_ sp. (i.e,
_B.quintana_, atypical)...

Have Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme disease been ruled out in this
case?

Michael, you should probably have your niece checked for Trench Fever (or
Quintana Fever), a louse-borne bacterial infection caused by _Bartonella
quintana_. I am unable to identify where your niece lives, which would help
in the identification of a possible pathogen. However, the cyclic nature and
signs and symptoms are quite similar to Trench Fever, a nonfatal bacterial
infection that varies in severity.
Another likely sounding possibility, which does not involve lice, but does
involve fleas and pet house cats, is Cat Scratch Disease (CSD), another
bacterial disease caused by _Bartonella henselae_, and another similar CSD
disease caused by a newly described pathogen, _Bartonella clarridgeiae_. If
your niece has a cat, particularly kittens, or pets kittens, this would be
my bet.

From: DeBolt, Chas <Chas.DeBolt@metrokc.gov>

In reading this description of reappearance of symptoms with re exposure to
the parasite, it seems that the individual may have some type of allergic
response to the interaction between her body and the lice. Perhaps she is
being bitten and is reacting to a saliva protein? I say this based on
personal experience with an allergy to dust mites which can range from
itching and skin wheels to asthma and pneumonia, depending on the "dose" and
the way in which I am exposed. Swollen lymph nodes and URI symptoms are one
of my responses.

recommend a temporary thread-cut until he has done the necessary
