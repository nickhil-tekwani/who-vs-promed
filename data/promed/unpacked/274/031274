Save the Children in Solomon Islands says there's an outbreak of leprosy affecting 24 people living in displaced people's centres in Honiara.

The head of logistics and emergency, Graeme Kenna, says no one has died from leprosy but the situation is stretching the health services in Solomon Islands as the country struggles to recover from the severe flooding in April [2014]. 27 evacuation centres were set up after the April floods in which thousands were left homeless and at least 22 people died.

"Leprosy does happen in Pacific Island countries. But to have a sudden reporting of 24 cases, most of them in young children, is quite alarming. The government is telling us and the World Health Organization are telling us that they have the situation under control." Save the Children's Graeme Kenna says authorities are now searching to see how many other people could be affected by leprosy.

[The Solomon Islands is in the Western Pacific Region, one of the 6 regions of WHO [regional map at http://hiip.wpro.who.int/portal/portals/0/CountryProfiles/Western_Pacific_Region.png]. The development of multidrug therapy for the treatment of leprosy in the early 1980s, initially implemented in the Western Pacific Region in 1985, has allowed possible control of the disease. Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml.

The following is extracted from WHO report on Leprosy in The Western Pacific Region (http://www.wpro.who.int/leprosy/documents/leprosy_report_2008_2010.pdf):

The goal of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem at the national level, defined as a prevalence rate below one case per 10 000 population, was achieved in 34 of the 37 countries and areas in the Western Pacific region. These 34 countries and areas cover 99.9 per cent of the total population of the Western Pacific Region. In 2010, a total of 8386 cases were registered with a prevalence rate of 0.05 per 10 000 population and 34 countries have eliminated leprosy as a public health problem. The Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands never reached leprosy elimination, while Kiribati failed to maintain the elimination threshold.

A total of 5055 new cases were reported in 2010 with a new case detection rate of 0.3 per 100 000 population. In 2010, the Solomon Islands, with a population of 538 000, reported 12 cases (prevalence rate of 0.2 cases per 10 000) and 14 new cases detected (incidence rate of 2.6 per 100 000); 86 per cent of new cases of leprosy were multibacillary (the contagious forms of the disease) and 21 per cent were children under 15 years of age (Table 4, http://www.wpro.who.int/leprosy/documents/leprosy_report_2008_2010.pdf). In 2008 and 2009, the Solomon Islands also reported high rates of leprosy in children: 18 per cent in 2008 and 47 per cent in 2009. By contrast, between 1994 and 2010, on average, only 7 per cent of new leprosy cases between 1994 and 2010 were children under 15 years old (range 3-9 per cent) and 8 per cent of new cases were reported in children in 2010 in the Western Pacific Region. The high rates of leprosy in children in the Solomon Islands indicate continuing transmission of the disease in the population.

The WHO notes that the diagnosis of leprosy mainly has been through passive case-finding (http://www.wpro.who.int/leprosy/documents/leprosy_report_2008_2010.pdf). Contact investigations, monitoring of cases, and defaulter tracing are insufficient in the Western Pacific Region. Surveillance needs strengthening and health education campaigns in the community need to be supported continuously.

Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy with currently Queen Elizabeth II of the UK, as its head of state; it consists of a large number of islands in Melanesia, Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of 28 400 sq km (11 000 sq mi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands). The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.
