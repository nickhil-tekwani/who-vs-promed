[A novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N6 was detected in wild birds and commercial poultry in the Netherlands in December 2017, and since then it spread in Europe and Asia. That HPAI virus H5N6 virus was a reassortant of at least 5 different subtypes (H5N8, H7N7, H5N1, H10N7, and H3N6) from the natural gene pool in Eurasian avian influenza viruses. In far eastern Asia, novel reassortants of HPAI viruses appeared recently [2018-2019], including H5N6 circulating in poultry and present in free-living wild birds. - Mod.PMB
