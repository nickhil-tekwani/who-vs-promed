Eighty people have been hospitalised in southern Russia with
symptoms of haemorrhagic fever, officials and press reports said
Thursday.
In the Russian republic of Bashkirskaya, where the 80 people have
been hospitalised, the same haemorrhagic fever already killed 10
people in July [1999.
"Bashkirskaya is one of the natural breeding grounds for this
disease," local sanitation officials told the daily Izvestia.
Symptoms of the disease are high fever, itchiness, vomiting and
internal bleeding that can lead to death.

[Bashkirskaya is located just west of the Ural mountains and north
of the Kazakhstan border. They are presumably talking about
CCHF (Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever). We would like to hear
from anyone who has more details - Mod.JW
