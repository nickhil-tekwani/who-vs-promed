Patient's Condition Slightly Improved: Cause of Illness Still Unresolved
----------------------------------------------
HAMILTON - Doctors say chances of survival are reasonably good for the
Congolese woman with [an undiagnosed illness, on life support at Henderson
General Hospital. The 32-year old woman, a visitor from the Democratic
Republic of Congo, was close to death at the end of last week with
multi-organ failure. She is still in critical condition, sedated and
breathing with the help of a respirator.
A Health Canada laboratory in Winnipeg and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta have spent nearly a week testing every
possibility. So far both laboratories, which are equipped to handle the
most serious and highly contagious infections, have reported only negative
results. "The patient has been tested for everything under the sun that I
can think of", said Dr. Ron St. John, Executive Director of Health Canada's
Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The tests have ruled out
all of the feared viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola and
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fevers. Tests for a variety of viral infections
such as encephalitis [? have also been negative.
The patient, who was in Canada on a [single entry visitor's visa for
business, does have malaria, but at a very low level of infection. However,
Health Canada has [excluded malaria as a possibility because of the low
levels of infection in her body. St. John said severe symptoms such as
[those exhibited by the patient would normally require 20 to 30 per cent
of the red blood cells to be infected with malaria. She only has 1/10th of
1 per cent of her red blood cells infected.
