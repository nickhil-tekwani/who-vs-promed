Fungus causes loss for padi farmers
-----------------------------------
Twenty-five padi farmers in Pendang district [Kedah state] suffered
losses of about RM 150 000 [about USD 47 000] when their 30 ha [74
acres] crops were damaged by padi leaf blast disease. The farmers said
the disease was believed to have attacked their crops during the early
planting stage 2 months ago.

One farmer claimed that this was the 1st time his crops were damaged
by the disease since he started working his rice fields 50 years ago.
"I noticed symptoms of the disease after 15 days of planting the
seedlings supplied by a private company. My crops turned yellowish and
eventually died."

Deputy Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Datuk Mohd Johari
Baharum said he would ask MADA [local agricultural development
authority] to investigate. "I will ask to check the seedlings supplied
by the private company. We will also discuss types of aid that can be
given to the farmers," he said, after visiting the affected rice
fields.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously
classified as a strain of _M. grisea_, synonym _Pyricularia oryzae_).
It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with
potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include
lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle
blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection
die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling
or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50
species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens,
but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number
of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is
spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence.
