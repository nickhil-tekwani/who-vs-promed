MIT explains spread of 1918 flu pandemic
----------------------------------------
Researchers at MIT [The Massachusetts Institute of Technology] have
explained why 2 mutations in the H1N1 avian flu virus allowed the
disease to spread during the 1918 pandemic that killed at least 50
million people. The work could help scientists detect and contain a
future bird flu outbreak among humans. The team showed that the 1918
influenza strain developed 2 mutations in a surface molecule called
hemagglutinin (HA). This, in turn, allowed it to bind tightly to
receptors in the human upper respiratory tract. This new work could
aid researchers in monitoring the HA mutations in the H5N1 avian flu
strains currently circulating in Asia. Epidemiologists fear these
mutations could enable the virus to jump from birds and spread
between humans -- a possibility that could trigger millions more
deaths than the 1918 pandemic.

Ram Sasisekharan, the Underwood Prescott Professor of Biological
Engineering and Health Sciences and Technology, is the senior author
of a paper on the work published in the 18 Feb 2008 issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- PNAS [A
Srinivasan, K Viswanathan, R Raman, A Chandrasekaran, S Raguram, TM
Tumpey, V Sasisekharan, and R Sasisekharan: Quantitative biochemical
rationale for differences in transmissibility of 1918 pandemic
influenza A viruses.
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0711963105v1?etoc>].

In January [2008], Sasisekharan and colleagues reported in Nature
Biotechnology that flu viruses can only bind to human respiratory
cells if they match the shape of sugar (or glycan) receptors found on
those cells. The glycan receptors found in the human respiratory
tract are known as alpha 2-6 receptors, and they come in 2 shapes --
one resembling an open umbrella, and another resembling a cone. To
infect humans, the MIT team found that avian flu viruses must gain
the ability to bind to the umbrella-shaped alpha 2-6 receptor. In the
current study, the team discovered that 2 mutations in HA allow flu
viruses to bind tightly or with high affinity to the umbrella-shaped
glycan receptors.

"The affinity between the influenza virus HA and the glycan receptors
appears to be a critical determinant for viral transmission," said
Sasisekharan. The researchers used the 1918 influenza virus as a
model system to investigate the biochemical basis for hemagglutinin
binding to glycans, which leads to viral transmission. They compared
the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic (known as SC18) with a strain
called NY18, which differs from SC18 by only one amino acid, and also
the AV18 strain, which differs from SC18 by 2 amino acids.

Using ferrets (which are susceptible to human flu strains),
researchers had earlier found that, while SC18 transmitted
efficiently between ferrets, NY18 is only slightly infectious and
AV18 not at all infectious. These earlier findings correlate with the
viruses' ability to bind to umbrella-shaped alpha 2-6 glycan
receptors, demonstrated in the current PNAS study. NY18, which is
only slightly infectious, binds to the umbrella-shaped alpha 2-6
receptors, but not as well as SC18, which is highly infectious. AV18,
which does not infect humans, does not have any affinity for the
umbrella-shaped alpha 2-6 receptors and binds only to alpha 2-3
receptors. Another strain, TX18, binds to alpha 2-6 and alpha 2-3
but, because it binds with high affinity to the umbrella-shaped alpha
2-6 receptors, is much more infectious than NY18.

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported on the varying infectiousness of these strains last year,
but the PNAS study is the first that explains the exact biochemical
reason underlying these differences. Other authors of the PNAS paper
are Aravind Srinivasan and Karthik Viswanathan, postdoctoral
associates in MIT's Department of Biological Engineering (BE); Rahul
Raman, research scientist in BE; Aarthi Chandrasekaran, graduate
student in BE; S. Raguram, visiting scientist in BE; Viswanathan
Sasisekharan, visiting scientist in the Harvard-MIT Division of
Health Sciences and Technology; and Terrence Tumpey of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.

The research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical
Sciences and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).

[This research represents an important advance in understanding the
basis for the enhanced virulence of certain strains of influenza A
viruses and will facilitate the detection and containment of a future
bird flu outbreak among humans.

In the same issue of PNAS
(<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0711815105v1?etoc>)
Claudia Pappas and colleagues have shown that "Single gene
reassortants identify a critical role for PB1, HA, and NA in the high
virulence of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus". Their abstract
states that, "The 1918 influenza pandemic was exceptionally severe,
resulting in the death of up to 50 million people worldwide. Here, we
show which virus genes contributed to the replication and virulence
of the 1918 influenza virus. Recombinant viruses, in which genes of
the 1918 virus were replaced with genes from a contemporary human
H1N1 influenza virus, A/Texas/36/91 (Tx/91), were generated. The
exchange of most 1918 influenza virus genes with seasonal influenza
H1N1 virus genes did not alter the virulence of the 1918 virus;
however, substitution of the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA),
or polymerase subunit PB1 genes significantly affected the ability of
this virus to cause severe disease in mice. The 1918 virus virulence
observed in mice correlated with the ability of 1918 recombinant
viruses to replicate efficiently in human airway cells. In a 2nd
series of experiments, eight 1918 1:7 recombinants were generated, in
which each Tx/91 virus gene was individually replaced by a
corresponding gene from 1918 virus. Replication capacity of the
individual 1:7 reassortant viruses was assessed in mouse lungs and
human airway cells. Increased virus titers were observed among 1:7
viruses containing individual 1918 HA, NA, and PB1 genes. In
addition, the 1918 PB1:Tx/91 (1:7) virus showed a distinctly larger
plaque size phenotype than the small plaque phenotype of the 1918
PA:Tx/91 and 1918 PB2:Tx/91 1:7 reassortants. These results highlight
the importance of the 1918 HA, NA, and PB1 genes for optimal virus
replication and virulence of this pandemic strain".

These pieces of research further unravel the nature and complexity of
the determinants of the virulence of certain avian and human
influenza viruses and will assist in the prediction of the pandemic
potential of novel influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
