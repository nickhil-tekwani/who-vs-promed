News of the response
Feminization of the response
----------------------------
Women have a central place in communities in North Kivu. They are not only the pillars of households but they are also important economic actors thanks to their numerous commercial activities. Thus, in order to strengthen community engagement, it was decided to further feminize the Ebola response by directly involving women leaders in several activities of the response. Training workshops for representatives of women's associations were held in Beni and Butembo. For one month, these new communicators will accompany the teams of the response in the field to help remove some of the reluctance that still exist in some neighborhoods.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 38 353 people have been vaccinated , including 17 831 in Beni, [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

This Fri 30 Nov 2018, an awareness session on the Ebola virus disease was organized for people living with a disability in Beni. Around 50 representatives of people with disabilities, including the blind, deaf-mute, and the physically challenged, took part in this activity. The sensitization focused on the prevention, the modes of contamination, the vaccination, the dignified and safe burial, and the removal of the reluctances within the community. A 2nd session will be organized for about 50 other representatives living outside the city of Beni.

[2] Response
- Fri 30 Nov 2018. US urged to send Ebola experts in as Congo outbreak worsens
[WSPA, Associated Press (AP) report; abridged, edited]
https://www.wspa.com/news/us-urged-to-send-ebola-experts-in-as-congo-outbreak-worsens-1/1630594235
[Byline: Cara Anna]

Global health experts are urging the Trump administration to allow US government disease specialists -- "some of the world's most experienced" -- to return to northeastern Congo to help fight the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history.

The US experts have been sidelined for weeks, ordered away from the region because of State Department security concerns. 2 top medical journals this week have published commentaries calling on the US to change its mind and send them back where they are sorely needed.

This Ebola outbreak is like no other, with some health workers comparing the region to a war zone. Dozens of armed rebel groups are active, and their deadly attacks have forced responders to pause crucial Ebola containment work for days. Many new cases have been unrelated to known infections, alarming evidence that gaps in tracking the disease remain.

"It is in US national interests to control outbreaks before they escalate into a crisis," one group of global health experts wrote in a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A separate one in the New England Journal of Medicine said : "Given the worsening of the outbreak, we believe it's essential that these security concerns be addressed and that CDC staff return to the field." [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (142): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, summary, WHO, suspect, response 20181130.6172738]

It is not clear how many Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers are now trying to tackle the outbreak from Congo's capital, Kinshasa, which is nearly 1000 miles (1600 kilometers) away.

A State Department official said that CDC experts -- and those with the US Agency for International Development, who are also affected by the order -- are still working closely with international partners to stop the outbreak.

"We remain hopeful that the security situation improves so we can return to the affected communities," Kathy Harben, a CDC spokeswoman, said in a statement. The CDC supports the expertise of the State Department and Department of Defense "in determining locations where it is safe to position our staff."

Security concerns are real, Ebola responders say. Teams with the WHO and Congo's health ministry venture out on virus containment missions accompanied by UN peacekeepers or other armed security in areas where gunfire echoes daily.

- Sat 1 Dec 2018. Why the Ebola outbreak in DRC has spun out of control. The WHO's top emergency responder explains why the outbreak is now the 2nd largest in history.
[Vox; abridged, edited]
https://www.vox.com/2018/12/1/18118569/ebola-outbreak-2018-drc
[Byline: Julia Belluz]

The WHO's top emergency responder, Peter Salama, head of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, explains why the outbreak is now the 2nd largest in history.

Even though Ebola responders have never had so many tools at their disposal to fight the virus -- experimental vaccines and treatments that have shown promise -- the incidence of the disease has more than doubled since September 2018. Even worse, many of the newly diagnosed cases cannot be linked to other known cases. That means there are still people spreading the disease whom health officials have not yet identified.

Due to the ongoing conflict in the region, the US government has decided it's too dangerous to allow its top Ebola experts to work at the outbreak's epicenter. The US has maintained this stance despite outcry from public health officials who say the US isn't doing enough to help.
[see WSPA report above]

[Peter Salama describes how this outbreak is different:]
It's an outbreak I describe as a perfect storm -- a combination of this deadly disease in one of the most difficult, protracted crises we have around the world.

In North Kivu, there's a long civil conflict, the proximity to numerous international borders -- Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan -- and a population that's constantly on the move with 1 million displaced people out of the [6] million residents. It's also a population that's highly traumatized, especially in and around Beni [the outbreak epicenter]. People have been subject to an enormous number of severe attacks consistently since 2014 but dating back to even the Rwandan genocide [in 1994].

That population is so traumatized that everything for them is viewed through the lens of distrust of authority, physical insecurity, and the inability of the world to protect them. These viruses manage to exploit social vulnerabilities and fault lines. That's what we're seeing in this Ebola outbreak starkly.

[He warns that] the issue of urban outbreaks of high-threat pathogens is really an issue of our generation.

[The full interview is available at the source URL above. It is interesting to see how important sociologists and anthropologists are, in addition to the healthcare workers, in combating this outbreak. Cultural and behavioral aspects of the people affected by the outbreak must be understood in order to gain their trust, without which this outbreak will never end. - Mod.LK
