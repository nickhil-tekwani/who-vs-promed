Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infections After Cosmetic Surgery -Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic, 2003-2004
-----------------------------
Rapidly growing mycobacteria have been associated with postoperative
infections in patients undergoing cosmetic surgery procedures. In April
2004, CDC received reports of infections caused by rapidly growing
mycobacteria in patients who had undergone cosmetic surgery procedures in
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (DR). CDC, along with state and local
health departments, is investigating additional cases identified by passive
surveillance (i.e., solicitation of reports from clinicians by using
electronic networks) and, in some areas, active surveillance (i.e., review
of laboratory reports).
A total of 12 cases, all laboratory-confirmed, have been reported from
residents of New York (5), Massachusetts (2), North Carolina (2), Rhode
Island (2), and Puerto Rico (1). Definitive testing at CDC has determined
that all the cases resulted from infection with _Mycobacterium abscessus_.
The patients underwent procedures in multiple surgical centers in Santo
Domingo during May 2003-February 2004.
11 of the 12 patients were interviewed. All were women; median age was 32
years (range: 19-59 years). Surgical procedures consisted of 1 or more of
the following: abdominoplasty (i.e., "tummy tuck") (10 patients),
liposuction (5), breast lift (4), breast reduction (4), and breast implant
(1). Symptoms of infection began a median of 5 weeks after surgery (range:
1-20 weeks) and included subcutaneous or deep-tissue abscesses requiring
incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy in all patients; 9 patients were
hospitalized.
Molecular typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly
amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction confirmed that _M.
abscessus_ isolates from 7 of 12 specimens were indistinguishable.
Organisms with this common genetic pattern were recovered from patients who
had surgery performed during Oct-Dec 2003 in the same surgical center in
Santo Domingo.
The source and magnitude of this cluster are not known; public health
authorities in DR have initiated an onsite investigation. Infection with
rapidly growing, nontuberculous mycobacteria should be considered in
patients who have undergone cosmetic surgery procedures in DR and who
subsequently have surgical-site infections that fail to respond to standard
therapy. Cases of mycobacterial subcutaneous infections after cosmetic
surgery procedures undergone since May 2003 in DR should be reported
through state and local health departments to CDC, telephone 800-893-0485.
