Unexplained elk deaths in Wyo. leave wildlife officials puzzled
--------------------------------------------------
Elk are dying by the hundreds on the high, dry plains south of Rawlins,
Wyo., puzzling veterinarians who suspect some kind of poison is to blame.
In the last 3 weeks, about 275 elk, mostly breeding-age cows in prime
condition, have been found either dead or paralyzed in a 3-square-mile area
just north of the Colorado border.
"They go to lie down, and then they can't get up," Wyoming Game and Fish
Department spokesman Tom Reed said Thursday. "Their heads are up and they
bark at you when you approach. But they can't move."
State biologists are euthanizing the stricken animals and have examined
about a dozen carcasses in an attempt to find the cause of the deaths.
Whatever is killing the elk has yet to affect the horses, cows, calves, and
antelope observed in the area. Scavengers like coyotes, ravens, or magpies
that are feeding on the carcasses also appear to be immune.
"Elk are the tough guys of our big- game species, and here's something
that's targeting them and taking them out," Reed said.
State wildlife veterinarians have already ruled out diseases such as
chronic wasting disease, worms, or paralyzing bacteria sometimes carried by
ticks.
Instead, they are focusing on natural or man-made toxins as the most likely
cause of the die-off.
"There's a railroad, a coal-bed methane project, and oil and gas wells in
the area," Reed said, adding that some local plants, particularly
greasewood and Russian thistle, also contain compounds that can be toxic to
wildlife. "We're looking at everything."
But pathologists are quickly narrowing their search. Tests have ruled out
salt poisoning, insecticides, fertilizers, sulfates, and heavy metals
including arsenic, selenium, and thallium.
Reed said game officers will attempt to transport several of the ill
animals to the state wildlife research station in Sybille, Wyo., for
further study. Meanwhile, the agency is asking that people avoid the area.
Mass die-offs of wildlife are not uncommon in severe Wyoming winters, but
this one has been mild, biologists say.
In 1983, 700 antelope died in the same area after a strong snowstorm pushed
them up against an illegal, 28-mile chain-link fence erected by a local
rancher. The incident outraged wildlife lovers and led to a federal court
order banning such hazards.
This is the biggest non-winter-related wildlife die-off that anyone can
remember, Reed said.
The area's rolling plain of sagebrush and greasewood provides critical
winter range for elk and antelope, said Steve Torbit, a wildlife biologist
with the National Wildlife Federation. The conservation group successfully
sued to have the rancher's fence removed.
"It's really strange that this is happening exactly where we had that
battle," Torbit said.
