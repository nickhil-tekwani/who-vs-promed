Response to an outbreak of anthrax:
The WHO supported the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in
responding to a major outbreak of anthrax, which affected 2 districts
(Maseru and Mafeteng). A total of 650 human cases were seen in the 2
districts and 6 lost their lives. The case fatality rate in this
outbreak was 0.92 percent. All the deaths occurred prior to the
response operation. This support has had a positive impact on the
lives of the affected population. The summary of cases seen is
provided in table 1 (below) while figure 1 [see at source URL] shows
some of the cases that were seen and successfully managed during the
outbreak.

Table 1: Statistics on the anthrax outbreak in Lesotho:
District / no. of villages affected / no. of animals affected
(meat:non-meat) / human cases (cases:deaths:CFT percent)
Maseru / 17 / 528:11 / 647:6:0.93
Mafeteng / 15 / 260:0 / 3:0:0
Mohale's Hoek* / 2 / 20:0 / 0:0:0
Total / 24 / 808:11 / 650:6:0.92
*Outbreak confirmed as blackquarter
CFT = Case Fatality Rate

The health education intervention of the outbreak response focussed
on visiting villages and educating the public on the disease (what is
anthrax and its forms, signs and symptoms -- human and animal,
prevention, what to do after exposure or on suspecting infection, and
disposal of dead animals). 47 villages were reached where more 2335
people were given education (see details in the table below [Table 2;
see at source URL]). The positive change brought by the intervention
is captured in figure 2 [see at source URL] where dead animals were
being buried as opposed to been eaten (practise followed prior to the
intervention). This change of behaviour and the decontamination of
sites where animals had died and where they were buried reduced the
risk of exposure and saved public lives.

Decontamination of sites where the affected animals died or were
buried was conducted. A total of 376 out of the 383 contaminated
sites were decontaminated. In Maseru only 2 sites were not
decontaminated while in Mafeteng 5 were not.

Case detection, management, and reporting of communicable diseases:
The disease surveillance system was revitalised with the refresher
training of health centre nurses from 6 districts. This translates
into 100 percent achievement of the refresher trainings that were to
be conducted to revive the disease surveillance system. A total of
207 health centre nurses were trained. The table below [Table 3; see
at source URL] shows the distribution of integrated disease
surveillance and response trainings conducted.

Page 9:
Management of severe malnutrition:
Although the training of hospital and health centre nurses on the
management of severe malnutrition was successfully conducted in
Mafeteng and Mokhotlong districts, the comparison of the case
fatality rate before and after the training was given does not show
an improvement. The objective of a severe malnutrition ward should be
to achieve a case fatality rate of less than 5 percent. The overall
case fatality rate in the facilities monitored is more than 17.7
percent, which is poor according to the Lesotho Protocols for the
Management of Severe Malnutrition. This area needs to be followed up
to establish the possible cause of the high case fatality rates.

[Members are encouraged to read this document in full. A major reason
why such anthrax outbreaks occur is because of rural malnutrition and
the utilization of sick and dying animals to provide much needed
food, in this case biltong. As a rule of thumb one can assume that 10
people in rural Africa will be affected for every sick animal. It
says something positive for Lesotho that it is near unity there.
