[This is the 2nd rabies event in Albania in 2012. On 30 Jun 2012, Albania notified the OIE about the confirmation of rabies in a dog, similarly situated in the Kukes region, after absence of rabies cases in Albania since December 2009. The notification included the following epidemiological comments: "The index case was a house dog kept on leash during the day and released by night. Potentially, it has been exposed to infected wildlife, but this is inconclusive, since it cannot be verified. Rabies has not been reported in Kukes region for 2.5 years, and the cases in domestic animals are usually linked to wildlife. The villages with a history of rabies in most cases are located in close [proximity to] natural environment areas and nature protected areas where wildlife (foxes, wolfs, etc.) is abundant." See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=12080.

In view of the relatively short (7 days) time-gap between the deaths (and lab confirmations) of the 2 rabid dogs described in the current event, the possibility that case No. 2 was not infected from case No. 1 but from a different source (for example, wildlife) seems to deserve some consideration within the ongoing investigations.

It would be interesting to learn whether these events involved human exposure. - Mod.AS
