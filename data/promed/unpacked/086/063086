To the Editor:

After publication of our study, which examined adverse events after BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (1 [see source URL above for all references and table]), we received requests to stratify the findings according to age and sex (2), since some adverse events may be concentrated in specific groups (3). The original study did not include these results because stratification of rare events into small subgroups can result in inaccurate estimates.

In response to these requests, here we provide case counts for adverse events that were strongly associated with either vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection (1), stratified according to sex and 10-year age-group (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). These counts could potentially contribute to future meta-analyses (4). Estimates of risk ratios and risk differences are provided for male and female persons older or younger than 40 years of age. Even in the analysis of these larger subgroups, the results should be interpreted with caution, since many of the confidence intervals are wide. The statistical methods used for this analysis are identical to those used for the original analysis.

The risk of myocarditis, which is considered to be the most potentially serious vaccine-associated adverse event, was increased after both vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. After vaccination, the risk was increased mostly among young male adolescents and adults (16-39 years of age), with 8.62 excess events per 100 000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82-14.35). After infection, the risk was increased in both age categories (younger than 40 and 40 years or older) and in both male and female adolescents and adults, with 11.54 excess events per 100 000 persons (95% CI, 2.48-22.55) in young male adolescents and adults.

Abstract
--------
"Background: Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed.

"Methods: We used data from the largest healthcare organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2-infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses.

"Results: In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884 828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100 000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0-4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05-2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100 000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1-89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100 000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3-9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100 000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2-24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95-25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100 000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6-15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia.

"Conclusions: In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1-5 events per 100 000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection." - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccination timeline for children
Date: Thu 28 Oct 2021 17:22 EDT

Children as young as 5 may be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the USA as soon as next week. While some parents aren't sure how they feel about this, others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from COVID-19.

But federal agencies can't be rushed. Here's what still needs to happen before the Pfizer-BioNTech shots can start going into kids' arms.

Currently, Pfizer is the furthest along in this process, but Moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age-group, and Johnson & Johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well. Here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the Pfizer vaccine.

Step 1: Drug makers complete the clinical trial
-----------------------------------------------
Pfizer and BioNTech have completed a 3-phase clinical trial in children 5-11 years old. The companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 7 Oct 2021.

The main study included 2250 kids and found that the lower-dose version of the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. It was given as a series of 2 shots, 21 days apart, and the dose was 10 micrograms, one-third of the dose given to adults and teenagers. No serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported, although with only a few thousand children included in the research, that sort of rare problem wouldn't necessarily be detected.

Step 2: Independent scientists review the data
----------------------------------------------
This week, on 26 Oct 2021, a panel of outside scientists considered Pfizer's safety and efficacy data, along with an analysis from FDA scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios. After some lively discussion, the group overwhelmingly voted yes, that the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age-group.

Step 3: FDA officials weigh in
------------------------------
Now, the FDA -- the agency itself -- needs to consider the advisers' vote on Pfizer's smaller-dose shot for kids and decide on whether to extend the emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to this age-group.

Step 4: More independent scientists debate and vote
---------------------------------------------------
But wait, there's more. Yet another federal health agency and its advisers need to weigh in before the shots will become available -- this time, it's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). You can think of it like this: When it comes to vaccines, the FDA is in charge of the what, and the CDC is in charge of the who.

The CDC's advisory group is scheduled to meet on 2 Nov 2021. Dr. Amanda Cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the CDC's vaccine advisory group, and she's a voting member of the FDA's vaccine advisory group, so she's uniquely positioned to explain the difference between the 2:

The FDA decides whether a vaccine (or other product) is safe and effective, she explained at the FDA advisory meeting this week. The CDC's group then considers and votes on "who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated." Their deliberations include factors such as equity, feasibility and the "potential impact of recommendations on a population," she said.

When they vote, the CDC's advisers could recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5-11 age-group, or they could "make more focused or nuanced recommendations," Cohn said. For instance, they could recommend it for a certain subgroup, like children with underlying conditions or those who haven't had a prior coronavirus infection.

Step 5: CDC director makes final recommendation
-----------------------------------------------
Even then, a vote from the CDC's advisers isn't an official recommendation -- that comes from the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky. She can simply greenlight the advisers' recommendation, or -- as she did with boosters -- she can change it. There's no prescribed timeline on when her recommendation must come down, but she's widely expected to rule next week. Only after the CDC director issues an official recommendation will shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country.

Step 6: The shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies
-------------------------------------------------------------
Experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower-dose vaccine won't be a repeat of the disarray of the original COVID-19 vaccine rollout last winter. "We will be ready immediately following FDA and CDC's decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly, easily and conveniently," Jeffrey Zients, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, said at a news conference Wednesday [27 Oct 2021].

The immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time, says Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. "We have plenty of vaccine, and I think that we're very well prepared," she says.

Still, she warns that parents shouldn't expect that they'll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared. There will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand.

Experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child's pediatrician and school. Parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric COVID-19 shots in stock at https://www.vaccines.gov, a CDC website launched in February [2021] to help people who want COVID-19 vaccines figure out where to go.
