An agency in the United Kingdom has released more information about a potential new strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium in sheep behind almost 300 human illnesses and one death.

The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has been investigating 2 incidents of salmonella in sheep flocks with associated human cases. In both flocks, there were high levels of mortality in groups of cull ewes bought from various livestock markets for fattening prior to slaughter.

Cases of _S._ Typhimurium have been linked to consumption of lamb and mutton. The outbreak started in July 2017, and 283 cases had been reported as of October 2018. Control measures such as restricting movement of animals and enhanced hygiene were followed by a significant decline in cases in the latter part of 2017.

Infection is thought to be associated with eating sheep meat, not cooking meat properly, not washing hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, or cross-contamination of other foods, surfaces, and utensils in kitchens. It is also possible for farm staff to be infected through direct contact with infected animals. One animal hauler has become ill via this route.

APHA officials said scanning surveillance activities in 2017 identified a case of an unusual strain of _S._ Typhimurium following investigation into a high level of mortality in a sheep flock. However, not all infected animals on 2 affected premises displayed clinical signs. Animals and flocks without any clinical signs can carry and shed the salmonella, which can spread the bacteria.

"This new strain of _S._ Typhimurium is different to previous outbreak strains in the UK in that it does not usually conform to a recognised phage type or is untypable. It is also sensitive to all antibiotics in the APHA antimicrobial resistance surveillance panel," said the agency.

The strain was linked by whole genome sequencing (WGS) to a national outbreak causing widespread foodborne illness. In 2018, further incidents were identified by APHA with the same strain. Domestic species affected so far include sheep, cattle, and poultry.

Public Health England (PHE) has classified the outbreak cluster as _S._ Typhimurium t5. 3225 by WGS. Isolates within this cluster vary by a maximum of 5 single nucleotide polymorphism mutations (SNPs), which is considered a reliable threshold for identification of isolates epidemiologically related within a human disease outbreak.

Examination of the genetic relationship of this strain to others at PHE suggests it is unusual in the UK, and the relatively low level of genetic diversity suggests a recently emerged source of contamination.

APHA officials said salmonella can be introduced to a farm by movement of animals that may or may not be showing clinical signs of infection; equipment and machinery, such as handling/dosing equipment; vehicles, especially contaminated wheels and footwells; clothing and footwear; contaminated feed; and wild birds and pests.

"Veterinarians have a vital role to play in surveillance and to look out for cases of high mortality in ewes or sheep flocks (or cattle herds) with a high level of diarrhoea. Human illness may also be associated, but the absence of human cases is not a reason to not report such cases," added the agency.

[The above recent report does not present information on a current event; however, its zoonotic significance deserves posting. The issue was addressed in ProMED-mail archive no. 20181021.6103699. A relevant letter was published on 13 Nov 2018 in the weekly Veterinary Record. It was submitted by Amanda Carson, APHA Penrith, and Rob Davies, APHA Weybridge.

"Scanning surveillance activities in 2017 identified a potential new strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium following postmortem examination of sheep in a flock where a high level of mortality had occurred; 207 sheep had died over one month from a group of 512 sheep. In 2018, a 2nd incident was identified by the APHA with the same _S._ Typhimurium strain, and clinical signs in sheep included depression, diarrhoea, and death. This new strain of _S._ Typhimurium is different to previous outbreak strains in the UK and does not usually conform to a recognised phage type (RDNC) or is untypable (UNTY). It is sensitive to all antibiotics in the APHA panel. Public Health England (PHE) has classified this outbreak cluster as _S._ Typhimurium t5. 3225 on the basis of whole genome sequencing.

"Isolates within this cluster vary by a maximum of 5 single nucleotide polymorphism mutations (SNPs), which is considered to be a reliable threshold for identification of isolates that are epidemiologically related within the context of a human disease outbreak. Examination of the genetic relationship of these strains (phylogeny) to others on record at PHE suggests that this strain is unusual in the UK, and the relatively low level of genetic diversity also suggests that it has only recently emerged from an unknown source.

"Human cases of _S._ Typhimurium have been linked to consumption of lamb and mutton. An increase in cases of this particular type of _Salmonella_ 1st arose in July 2017. A number of control measures were put into place throughout the food chain, which were followed by a significant decline in cases from the end of that year until June 2018. A total of 118 cases were reported up until May 2018. Since June 2018, a further 165 cases have been reported (up to 19 Oct 2018).

"The Food Standard Agency (FSA) has contacted food business operators, reminding them to maintain high hygiene standards during slaughter and processing, and joint FSA/PHE advice on handling and cooking raw meat has been placed on https://www.gov.uk/, with a particular emphasis on sheep meat. Consumers are reminded to cook meat properly, wash their hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, and avoid cross-contamination of other foods, surfaces, and utensils in the kitchen (https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/advice-on-cooking-raw-meat-following-rise-in-salmonella-typhimurium).

"In the cases involving sheep, mortality was high in groups of cull various livestock markets for fattening before onward consignment for slaughter. Veterinarians have a vital role to play in surveillance and to look out for cases of high mortality in ewes or sheep flocks (or cattle herds) with a high level of diarrhoea. Human illness in farm staff or family members may also be associated, but the APHA should still be informed even in the absence of this. The APHA provides a ZO2 sample submission form when cases of Salmonella are identified, and it is vital that the information requested on this form is returned to the APHA to enable a risk assessment to be undertaken.

"Postmortem services are available at APHA veterinary investigation centres and at postmortem facilities operated by partners working on our behalf. Together, we provide a surveillance network across England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."

The above information may be of interest and significance to animal and public health institutions, veterinarians, physicians, and food safety agencies in and beyond the UK. It would be interesting to note if the causative agent of the October 2018 event in France (ProMED-mail archive no. 20181028.6112504) has been later compared to the UK t5. 3225 strain. - Mod.AS
