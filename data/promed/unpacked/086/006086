Nicaragua: rotavirus outbreak triggers epidemiological alert
------------------------------------------------------------
The epidemic that killed 4 people last week [3rd week Feb 2005] in
Nicaragua was caused by rotavirus, said the Nicaraguan Public Health
Ministry on Tue 21 Feb 2005. [rotavirus infection], which presents with
symptoms of diarrhea, has killed 4 children and affected 1000 others in
northern Nicaragua, according to the Ministry.
The government has announced an epidemiological alert. If the number of
affected people grows to 30 000, a state of emergency will be declared,
said public health minister Margarita Gurdian. But Gustavo Porras, an
opposition legislator, said that a state of emergency ought to have been
declared already, saying that the outbreak of the epidemic resulted from
pollution of drinking water and the public's lack of knowledge concerning
disease prevention.

[In "Viral gastroenteritis update 2005 (06) 20050216.0521," a serious
rotavirus epidemic was reported in El Salvador, which lies to the north of
Nicaragua. This epidemic occurred in the central region of El Salvador. The
2 epidemics are unlikely to be related, but, rather, are probably due to
independent problems in social infrastructure and the provision of clean
drinking water. - Mod.CP]

Nicaragua: rotavirus outbreak may be declared national emergency
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nicaraguan authorities may declare a state of emergency due to the
rotavirus outbreak that is causing diarrhea in the population, chiefly in
children, and has left 32 dead over the past few weeks. Presently, there
are 27 900 cases, but they may increase to 30 000, considered the trigger
for a declaration of a state of national emergency.
According to the Health Ministry, the 2005 death toll due to severe
diarrheas is 70 per cent higher than that of 2004, when 18 people died.
Provincial epidemiology director Juan Jose Amador said children dehydrate
quickly, which puts their lives at risk.
The rotavirus outbreak has largely affected the northern provinces of
Estela and Madriz, but it may spread to Managua. Health Ministry officials
have sent personnel to the affected zones to assist people and promote
preventive education. They also requested aid from international bodies.
Seeking to improve hygiene, the Police warned that citizens who throw
garbage onto the street will be fined. The Pan American Health Organization
has granted funds, and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is
committed to providing 20 chlorine producing units, financing a preventive
education drive and distributing saline solution to the population.

Indonesia: 19 deaths from diarrhea in Morowali Regency, Srawesi Tengah
----------------------------------------------
Since early February 2005, at least 19 people in Morowali Regency here have
died due to diarrhea, making the ailment a major cause of concern in the
region, a senior official said on Wed 23 Feb 2005. The 19 people were among
149 people affected by diarrhea in the regency since the start of February
2005, said Natsir Borman, the head of the Central Sulawesi Provincial
Health Office. According to Natsir, the 19 died due to a lack of medical
treatment. Instead of seeking medical attention, they consulted shamans, he
said. The office had sent medicine and a team of medical personnel to the
worst affected areas to help combat the outbreak.

[The cause of the outbreak is unknown. Further information from the region
would be welcome. This news item is included in the viral gastroenteritis
update to draw a response from the local authorities, although the high
proportion of deaths suggests a bacterial rather than a viral
gastroenteritis. - Mod.CP]
