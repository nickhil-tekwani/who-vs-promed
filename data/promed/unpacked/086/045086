The Department of Health of Parana confirmed this Wednesday [12 Mar
2008] 2 cases of autochthonous yellow fever (contracted in the state
itself). One person died.

This is the 1st record of a case (and death) due to the disease in
Parana since 1966. In that year, there were 32 deaths, according to
the government.

According to the state Secretary of Health, Gilberto Martin, the 2
patients -- who contracted the sylvan form of the disease -- were
infected in Laranjal (423 km from the state capital, Curitiba).

One man, 35 years old, died on 29 Feb 2008. The other, 27 years old,
is hospitalized in Ivaipora (392 km from the capital) and not at risk
of death. The 2 brothers were infected and worked in the rural area
of Laranjal in the logging business.

This year [2008], 2 other cases had already been recorded in the
state, but both were imported. On 8 Jan 2008, a retired banker died
in Maringa (428 km from Curitiba), but he was infected in Caldas
Novas (Goias state).

Vaccination has begun in Laranjal, where the 2 cases were confirmed.
In the municipality, 84.7 percent of the 7400 inhabitants live in the
rural area. Beyond the area of risk, some 127 municipalities of a
total of 399 in Parana have been included in areas of transition of
the disease. The government of Parana wants to achieve 100 percent
vaccination of the population that lives in the area of risk.

The distribution of the municipalities considered areas of risk is
wide in Parana, reaching the regions in the west, centre,
centre-south, southwest and northwest. As of Monday [17 Mar 2008],
house to house vaccination will be started throughout the rural area
of 157 municipalities, areas considered at risk for sylvan yellow
fever.

The urban population of the municipalities will be attended at
health posts. Vaccination in the area of risk will be massive and
will extend until 4 Apr 2008. In counties considered areas of
transition, vaccination will be held until 25 Apr 2008. In those
regions, the majority of the population is already vaccinated against
yellow fever.
