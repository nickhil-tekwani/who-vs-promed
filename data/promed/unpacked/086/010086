_Staphylococcus aureus_ resistant to vancomycin - USA, 2002
-----------------------------------------------------------
_Staphylococcus aureus_ is a cause of hospital and community acquired
infections (1,2). In 1996, the first clinical isolate of _S. aureus_ with
reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was reported from Japan (3). The
vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) result reported for this
isolate was in the intermediate range (vancomycin MIC 8 µg/mL) using
interpretive criteria defined by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (4). As of June 2002, eight patients with clinical
infections caused by vancomycin-intermediate _S. aureus_ (VISA) have been
confirmed in the United States (5,6). This report describes the first
documented case of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_
(VRSA) (vancomycin MIC >32 µg/mL) in a patient in the USA. The emergence of
VRSA underscores the need for programs to prevent the spread of
antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and control the use of antimicrobial
drugs in health care settings.
In June 2002, VRSA was isolated from a swab obtained from a catheter exit
site from a Michigan resident aged 40 years with diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient received dialysis
at an outpatient facility (dialysis center A). Since April 2001, the
patient had been treated for chronic foot ulcerations with multiple courses
of antimicrobial therapy, some of which included vancomycin. In April 2002,
the patient underwent amputation of a gangrenous toe and subsequently
developed methicillin resistant _S. aureus_ bacteremia caused by an
infected arteriovenous hemodialysis graft. The infection was treated with
vancomycin, rifampin, and removal of the infected graft. In June, the
patient developed a suspected catheter exit-site infection, and the
temporary dialysis catheter was removed; cultures of the exit site and
catheter tip subsequently grew _S. aureus_ resistant to oxacillin (MIC >16
µg/mL) and vancomycin (MIC >128 µg/mL). A week after catheter removal, the
exit site appeared healed; however, the patient's chronic foot ulcer
appeared infected. VRSA, vancomycin resistant _Enterococcus faecalis_
(VRE), and _Klebsiella oxytoca_ also were recovered from a culture of the
ulcer. Swab cultures of the patient's healed catheter exit site and
anterior nares did not grow VRSA. To date, the patient is clinically
stable, and the infection is responding to outpatient treatment consisting
of aggressive wound care and systemic antimicrobial therapy with
trimethroprim/sulfamethoxazole.
The VRSA isolate recovered from the catheter exit site was identified
initially at a local hospital laboratory using commercial MIC testing and
was confirmed by the Michigan Department of Community Health and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Identification methods
used at CDC included traditional biochemical tests and DNA sequence
analysis of gyrA and the gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA. Molecular tests
for genes unique to enterococci were negative. The MIC results for
vancomycin, teicoplaninin, and oxacillin were >128 µg/mL, 32 µg/mL, and >16
µg/mL, respectively, by the broth microdilution method. The isolate
contained the vanA vancomycin resistance gene from enterococci, which is
consistent with the glycopeptide MIC profiles. It also contained the
oxacillin-resistance gene mecA. The isolate was susceptible to
chloramphenicol, linezolid, minocycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
Epidemiological and laboratory investigations are under way to assess the
risk for transmission of VRSA to other patients, health care workers, and
close family and other contacts. To date, no VRSA transmission has been
identified. Infection control practices in dialysis center A were assessed;
all health-care workers followed standard precautions consistent with CDC
guidelines (7). After the identification of VRSA, dialysis center A
initiated special precautions on the basis of CDC recommendations (8),
including using gloves, gowns, and masks for all contacts with the patient;
performing dialysis with a dedicated dialysis machine during the last shift
of the day in an area separate from other patients; having a dialysis
technician dedicated to providing care for the patient; using dedicated,
noncritical patient care items; and enhancing education of staff members
about appropriate infection-control practices. Assessment of infection
control practices in other health-care settings in which the patient was
treated is ongoing.

[MMWR} Editorial Note:
This report describes the first clinical isolate of _S. aureus_ that is
fully resistant to vancomycin. _S. aureus_ causes a wide range of human
infections and is an important cause of health care associated infections.
The introduction of new classes of antimicrobials usually has been followed
by emergence of resistance in _S. aureus_. After the initial success of
penicillin in treating _S. aureus_ infection, penicillin resistant _S.
aureus_ became a major threat in hospitals and nurseries in the 1950s,
requiring the use of methicillin and related drugs for treatment of _S.
aureus_ infections. In the 1980s, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ emerged
[first identified in about 1960. - Mod.SH] and became endemic in many
hospitals, leading to increasing use of vancomycin.
In the late 1990s, cases of VISA were reported. Although the acquired
vancomycin resistance determinants vanA, vanB, vanD, vanE, vanF, and vanG
have been reported from VRE, these resistance determinants have not
previously been identified in clinical isolates of _S. aureus_ (9).
Conjugative transfer of the vanA gene from enterococci to _S. aureus_ has
been demonstrated in vitro (10). The presence of vanA in this VRSA suggests
that the resistance determinant might have been acquired through exchange
of genetic material from the vancomycin resistant enterococcus also
isolated from the swab culture. This VRSA isolate is susceptible in vitro
to several antimicrobial agents, including antimicrobials recently approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (linezolid and
quinupristin/dalfopristin) with activity against glycopeptide resistant
Gram positive microorganisms.
In 1997, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee
published guidelines for the prevention and control of staphylococcal
infection associated with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (8); plans
to contain VISA/VRSA on the basis of CDC recommendations have been
established in some state health departments. In the health care setting, a
patient with VISA/VRSA should be placed in a private room and have
dedicated patient care items. Health care workers providing care to such
patients should follow contact precautions (wearing gowns, masks, and
gloves and using antibacterial soap for hand washing). These control
measures were adopted by dialysis center A immediately following
confirmation of the VRSA isolate. To date, there has been no documented
spread of this microorganism to other patients or health care workers.
Strategies to improve adherence to current guidelines to prevent
transmission of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms in health care
settings should be a priority for all health care facilities in the USA.
_S. aureus_ should be tested for resistance to vancomycin using a MIC
method. The isolation of _S. aureus_ with confirmed or presumptive
vancomycin resistance should be reported immediately through state and
local health departments to the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion,
National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.

[The discovery of a clinical isolate of _S. aureus_ fully resistant to
vancomycin is unsurprising, given the progression of antimicrobial
resistance in this significant community and hospital acquired pathogen.
Since the recognition of VISA strains in 1996, attempts to modify
vancomycin use have confounded by the continued high prevalence of MRSA in
hospitals for which vancomycin has remained the treatment of choice. The
recognition of MRSA in community settings has begun to occur as well and is
likely, as the spread of beta-lactamase producing _S. aureus_ did in the
middle of the last century, to become much more entrenched in the ensuing
years. This will further contribute to the problem.
As in this VRSA case, a number of the VISA isolates occurred in chronic
renal failure patients with previous vancomycin treatment for MRSA.
However, acute and chronic care health care facilities are awash with
chronically ill, often morbidly debilitated, individuals with known or
suspected infection or colonization with MRSA. This cohort continues to
receive vancomycin as well as other broad spectrum antimicrobials and
represent a huge potential melting pot for the development of this and
other polyresistant pathogens.
It is unknown just how long it will take for VRSA to develop a beach head
in the pathogen wars or whether more controls on glycopeptide antimicrobial
use could forgo it. If VRSA proves to be a worthy pathogen, the next cycle
in antistaphylococcal wars will begin. We hope this battle will be more of
a 40 year war than a one or two year downhill struggle. The conflict will
be fought with troops that still need to be proven to be effective
warriors. The efficacy of the tetracyclines, linezolid,
quinupristin/dalfopristin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in deep seated,
life-threatening, invasive staphylococcal infections remain to be
demonstrated in large scale studies involving the 21th century health care
recipient. Mod.LL]
