Abstract
--------
Within only one year after the 1st detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), nearly 100 million infections were reported in the human population globally, with more than 2 million fatal cases [by 13 May 2021, the global figures have become 161.08 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.34 million reported deaths. - Mod.AS]. While SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from a natural wildlife reservoir, neither the immediate viral precursor nor the reservoir or intermediate hosts have been identified conclusively. Due to its zoonotic origin, SARS-CoV-2 may also be relevant to animals. Thus, to evaluate the host range of the virus and to assess the risk to act as potential animal reservoir, a large number of different animal species were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or monitored in the field in the last months. In this review, we provide an update on studies describing permissive and resistant animal species. Using a scoring system based on viral genome detection subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, seroconversion, the development of clinical signs, and transmission to conspecifics or humans, the susceptibility of diverse animal species was classified on a semi-quantitative scale. While major livestock species such as pigs, cattle, and poultry are mostly resistant, companion animals appear moderately susceptible, while several model animal species used in research, including several Cricetidae species and non-human primates, are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By natural infections, it became obvious that American minks (_Neovison vison_) in fur farms, e.g., in the Netherlands and Denmark, are highly susceptible, resulting in local epidemics in these animals.

[The authors collected evidence from the literature to establish a semi-quantitative scoring system, awarding 0 (zero) to 3 (three) points for each of 4 following categories, as related to 17 animal species:

1. the proportion of animals in which the viral genome was detectable subsequent to inoculation reflecting virus multiplication [VGD],
2. the seroconversion rate [SERCONV],
3. the ability to transmit the virus to conspecifics or humans [TRCONSP], and
4. the development of clinical signs [CSIGN].

In the category "genome detection" [VGD], 3 points were given for the detection of viral RNA in all inoculated or tested animals of a certain species, 2 points indicated a frequent detection, and one point indicated a sporadic event.

The same gradation was applied in the category "seroconversion" [SERCONV], but for the detection of antibodies instead of viral RNA.

For the "transmission" category [TRCONSP], 3 points were awarded for an efficient transmission rate to conspecifics that indicates the potential to develop an independent transmission cycle; 2 points were given for a regularly observed intraspecies transmission, and one point was given for an occasional event.

The category "clinical signs" [CSIGN] was scored as follows: 3 points meant severe pan-respiratory or systemic symptoms that might end in death, 2 points indicated moderate respiratory or vascular symptoms, and one point indicated mild, nonspecific symptoms.

The sum [SUM] of all points was taken as a parameter for the overall susceptibility of each species for SARS-CoV-2.

The said scores were presented in Table 2, which is copied as follows:

Animal / [VGD] / [SERCONV] / [TRCONSP] / [CSIGN] // SUM
----------------------------------------------------
Chicken / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 // 0
Duck / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 // 0
Pig / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0 // 1
Cattle / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 // 2
Dog / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 // 3
Rabbit / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 // 4
Fruit bat / 2 / 1 / 2 / 0 // 5
Bank vole / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 // 6
Raccoon dog / 2 / 2 / 2 / 0 // 6
Cat / 2 / 2 / 1 / 1 // 6
Deer mouse / 3 / 2 / 2 / 1 // 8
Ferret / 3 / 3 / 2 / 0 // 8
White-tailed deer / 3 / 3 / 3 / 0 // 9
Mink / 2 / 3 / 3 / 1 // 9
Non-human primate / 3 / 3 / 2 / 2 // 10
Hamster / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 // 12
hACE2 transgen mouse / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 // 12

As concluded by the authors, livestock animals that are kept in very high numbers worldwide appear not to play a noteworthy role in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Although viral replication was detectable in some of the investigated farm animal species, long-term virus shedding at relevant levels was not found, nor did transmission to contact animals occur in any of these species, which would also make animal-to-human transmission unlikely. Besides some rodents, cervids, primates, and related species, numerous Carnivora species have been found to be susceptible not only for experimental, but also for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-species transmission. In particular, minks that are farmed in large numbers for fur production are at risk, and mass outbreaks with subsequent culling measures have been seen, e.g., in the Netherlands and Denmark.

The above table does not include several other animal species that have been suggested as potential SARS-CoV-2 hosts, such as ferret-badgers, bamboo rats, and pangolins. - Mod.AS]
