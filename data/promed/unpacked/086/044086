----------------------------------------------------------------------
The above ProMED posting contains an almost subliminal suggestion that humans are not associated with African swine fever.

1. "The virus is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs and wild boar." [item 1, source 'Eyewitness News'].

The implication is humans can go about our usual and disease spreading habits without stopping to think and help control the situation. Where are the subliminal "stop signs"? A clear statement: "The disease is spread by human activities such as moving livestock, moving pork products, and feeding food leftovers to pigs, or simply walking from one area of pigs or products to another area with the virus, where the virus can contaminate another person or fomite to be taken into the next area of na√Øve swine."

2. "The batch with the sick pig had already been released to the market but posed no health risk to humans and thoroughly cooked pork is safe for consumption." [item 2, source 'South China Morning Post'].

Please bring caution to such broad statements that imply processed pork products are "safe". This emergency is not about human health but everything humans do to move pork products out of the infected area MUST be suspect unless the food is certified to have reached a certain temperature, if the fact exists that cooked pork is not infectious. Please specify the cooking requirements. Smoking and other methods of preparation are not likely to kill the ASFv.

[ProMED-mail agrees with Dr Starling's concern and observations. The fact that ASF is not pathogenic to humans should not lead to neglecting the prescribed elementary requirements to prevent the wide-scale and rapid dissemination of the disease. Recycling of ASF infected/suspected-as-infected material, including pork and its products, and uncontrolled movement of feed and fomites, such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, equipment, and packing material, are, due to the high resistance of ASF virus in the environment, potential sources for its spread. The advance of this devastating pig disease, against which no vaccine is available to date, throughout 3 continents is, at least partially, due to such neglections.

ProMED-mail has repeatedly included relevant alerts in its ASF-related commentaries; this included a link, in the moderator's commentary of posting 20190213.6314342, to an OIE item which presented the phrases "ASF kills pigs" and "Don't be the carrier of a deadly pig disease"_ (scroll down at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/african-swine-fever/). Unfortunately, as reflected in the recent responses from Hong Kong, cited by Dr Starling, these messages may have not been sufficiently received and perceived by the public, even in severely ASF-affected countries like China.

OIE's posters explaining ASF to the public, in English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, and Russian, are available at
