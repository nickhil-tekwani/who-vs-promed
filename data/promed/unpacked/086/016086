[Several cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infection were confirmed in Hong Kong last year (2012; see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below).

The black-headed gull (_Chroicocephalus ridibundus_) is a small gull, which breeds in much of Europe and Asia and also in coastal eastern Canada. Most of the population is migratory, wintering further south. Mortal infection by HPAI H5N1 has been reported repeatedly in this species. For a picture of the gull see http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Chroicocephalus_ridibundus_%28summer%29.jpg.
