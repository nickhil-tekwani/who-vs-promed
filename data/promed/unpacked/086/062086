More Cholera Cases Diagnosed in Sofala
------------------------------------------
3 new cases of cholera were diagnosed in the district of Marromeu, in the
central Mozambican province of Sofala, on 2 Mar 2005, thus bringing to 51
the total number of cases recorded in the province, reports the Fri, 4 Mar
2005 issue of the Maputo daily paper "Noticias".
Marromeu is the district where the overwhelming majority of cholera cases
have been reported. Only 4 cases have been diagnosed in Beira, the
provincial capital, since the outbreak began in late Jan 2005.
10 patients were still under medical care in the Marromeu Cholera Treatment
Centres by late Thu, 3 Mar 2005, 6 of them in the locality of Nensa, a
resettlement center for flood victims, and 4 in Marromeu town.
Nensa, where the 1st case of the disease was diagnosed, is also where the
only death from the disease occurred.
The Sofala health authorities are intensifying their prevention campaigns
among the local population, fearing that the disease may spread. Marromeu
district health director Lopes Mangate said that his sector met with the
local traditional leaders to stress the need to involve local communities
in the prevention campaigns. Mangate said that to try and reduce the risk
of new infections, the health authorities have been distributing clean and
treated drinking water to the residents in Nensa.
In Beira, Valence Simbine, of the Community Health Department, said that
prevention campaigns are also being intensified in the city's suburbs, in
coordination with the Red Cross and various other organizations. He said
that other districts in Sofala have also been put on maximum alert against
the spread of the disease.

Although media coverage of the current cholera outbreak in central
Mozambique has concentrated almost exclusively on Sofala province, the
health authorities in the neighboring province of Manica now admit to at
least 2 cholera deaths in 231 cases. This means that almost 4 times as
many cases have been reported from Manica than from Sofala.
The outbreak in Manica started in late Dec 2004, and cases have been
diagnosed in the provincial capital, Chimoio, and Manica and Barue
districts. According to the Manica provincial chief doctor, Firmino
Jaqueta, cited in the Tue, 9 Mar 2005 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias",
one of the deaths was recorded in Manica district in Jan 2005, and the 2nd
took place in late Feb 2005, in Barue district.
Jaqueta said attentions are currently concentrated on Barue, where the
disease has spread to 3 localities. As of Friday, 6 people were
hospitalized, suffering from cholera in the district, 4 in the town of
Catandica, and 2 in the administrative post of Honde.
The situation is described as "stationary" in Chimoio and in Manica
district, though the health authorities remain on maximum alert to respond
to any new cases. In Sofala, the head of the Community Health Department,
Virginia Saldanha, said that 64 cases of the disease have been diagnosed
since the onset of the outbreak.
The area worst hit remains Marromeu district, on the south bank of the
Zambezi. As of Fri, 4 Mar 2005, 12 patients were hospitalized in the 2
cholera treatment centers in the district.
