INFECTION CONTROL: METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH. AUREUS
======================================================

From: s.barrett@ic.ac.uk (Stephen P Barrett [Medicine])

The number of times MRSA has been mentioned by recent contributors suggests
it might be worth getting a world view of what people are doing about it.
Many hospitals in southern England (like mine) find 15-25% of _Staph. aureus_
are MRSA. Throughout Europe there seems to be a lot of variation (Eu. J. Clin.
Micro. Inf. Dis. 1994; 13:50-55 Voss et al.); some colleagues in France find
50%, Japan reputedly >80%. The contributions from the USA indicate the ratio
of MRSA:MSSA [methicillin susceptible _S.aureus_] varies greatly there also.
We have three infection control nurses who spend virtually their whole time
dealing with MRSA. It's management is a real headache -- closed wards, lost
bed-days, patients getting neglected whilst in isolation, staff carriers off
work long term, patients threatening to sue, loss of morale by health care
professionals etc. etc. During almost 20 years in hospital infection
control I have become quite convinced that managing MRSA is a substantial
problem. However I am not at all convinced that the morbidity suffered by
patients with MRSA is any greater than that suffered by those with MSSA.
Indeed the only population-based data I can find (no anecdotes please!)
indicate MRSA is in general no more, and no less, pathogenic than MSSA.
Given, then, that 80% of my _Staph. aureus_ are MSSA and just as virulent as the
MRSA, why on earth am I chasing the 20% that are methicillin-resistant?
The answer is, of course, that my Hospital Management won't let me do
otherwise. MRSA has entered the public consciousness and hospitals have to
be seen to be doing the politically correct thing about it. I blame
microbiologists for inventing the whole business. I can't decide whether we
have shot ourselves in our collective foot by telling the world there is a
problem to be controlled and then showing we can't control it; or else
whether we should congratulate ourselves for finding a 'problem' that will
never go away in order to justify our existence for ever more.
Isn't it time to treat the methicillin-resistant staph in the same way as we
treat the penicillin-resistant staph?
I agree with Dr. Lin that it would be useful to have an Infection Control
mailing list.
