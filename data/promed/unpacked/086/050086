According to hospital sources, the deceased were identified as a 45 year old adult and a 5 year old child of Ishwardi's Bahbani village, [an adult] from Naogoan's Tentulia village and a 20 year old adult from Natore's Bagatipara area [all in Rajshahi Division].

Hospital sources said 5 other people suffering from the same symptoms are undergoing treatment at the hospital. They were kept under observation in ward number 36 and 14 for their clinical examination.

[Although these cases are classified as suspected, they are very likely to be due to Nipah virus infections, a syndrome well known to physicians in the Nipah belt in Bangladesh. The transmission season is usually January to April. Curiously, no mention is made in the above report of the virus's reservoir host, _Pteropus_ fruit bats, that contaminate date palm sap that is consumed by local people. Local residents scarify the upper areas of palm trees to collect sap in large jars. The bats come to drink the sap, and defecate and urinate in the sap. If the bats are shedding Nipah virus, it contaminates the sap. If the sap is consumed uncooked, humans that drink it can become infected. Local people say that cooking the sap alters the flavor. However, skirts made of local bamboo can serve as a barrier preventing bats' access to the sap collecting sites.
