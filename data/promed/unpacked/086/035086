WHO confirms Ebola cases
----------------
A new outbreak of ebola fever has been confirmed in the Republic of
Congo, with six people already affected.
The latest outbreak is in the republic's northwest, on the border
with Gabon, the World Health Organisation said. It was first
detected on May 17 in the Mbomo district near the Gabonese town of
Ivindo.
Today's statement from the WHO confirms earlier information from the
Congolese health ministry.
The Republic of Congo is the western neighbour of the much larger
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
WHO official Lamine Cisse Sarr said investigators in Mbomo reported
"the epidemic returned on May 17 after the dismemberment of a
chimpanzee found dead in a forest by two hunters".
An earlier epidemic, between December and April, claimed 42 victims.
Five men and a woman have been taken to hospital in the latest
outbreak, the WHO representative said. The last outbreak of the
disease was brought under control by joint teams from WHO and the
Congolese health ministry.
Ebola is one of the most virulent diseases known to man. The disease
is spread through contact with body fluids, including saliva. Early
symptoms are similar to those of the flu. There is no known cure
once the disease has reached a developed stage. But patients can
survive if they are treated early enough.

[It appears as though most recent outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever in the Congo Republic and neighboring Gabon have been traced to
hunters preparing sick or already deceased primates for meals.
Earlier this year, the virus was definitively identified in the bone
marrow of a gorilla in the region. We await more information on this
outbreak, and results of studies on primate illness/die-off in the
affected zone. - Mod.MPP]
