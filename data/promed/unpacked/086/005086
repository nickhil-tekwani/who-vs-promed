Update (20 Apr): Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever, Angola, Central Africa:
interim guidance for travelers
------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Angola remains
localized to the north western province of Uige, where it originated.
Although cases and deaths continue to be identified, no cases have been
exported to other countries or regions of Angola. The outbreak was first
reported by the World Health Organization on 23 Mar 2005. Marburg virus was
confirmed 4 days later through laboratory testing done by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogens Branch (CDC/SPB).
Initially recognized primarily in children younger than 5 years of age,
adults, including health care workers, have also been affected. Predominant
symptoms have included fever, hemorrhage (bleeding), vomiting, cough,
diarrhea, and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). For updated outbreak case
numbers, see WHO's website <http://www.who.int/en/>.
No US travel restrictions to the affected area are recommended. However,
because the health care system in northern Angola has limited resources and
is focused on caring for patients with Marburg virus infection and other
illnesses, people with underlying medical conditions who might need
emergency medical care may wish to defer non-essential travel to Uige
Province at this time. Travelers returning to the US from Angola who are
not ill need not follow any special precautions.
Marburg virus belongs to the virus family _Filoviridae_, which includes
Ebola virus. Marburg VHF is a rare viral disease that occurs primarily in
countries in East and Central Africa. The virus has the potential to spread
from person to person, especially among health care staff and family
members who care for patients with Marburg VHF. After an incubation period
of 5-10 days, the disease usually presents with sudden fever, chills, and
muscle aches. Around the 5th day after onset of symptoms, a skin rash can
occur.
Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea
may follow. Symptoms become increasingly severe and may include jaundice,
severe weight loss, mental confusion, shock, and multi-organ failure.
As part of the public health response, CDC has sent personnel to join the
WHO-coordinated international response team to assist with the
epidemiologic investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis.
CDC in Atlanta also will continue to provide laboratory and other
scientific and logistical support to the Ministry of Health of Angola.
The likelihood of contracting any VHF, including Marburg hemorrhagic fever,
is considered extremely low unless there has been travel to the affected
area and direct contact with the blood or body fluids (such as saliva,
urine) of symptomatic infected people or animals, or objects that have been
contaminated with body fluids. The cause of fever in people who have
traveled in areas where VHF is present is more likely to be a common
infectious disease, but such person should be evaluated by a health care
provider to be sure.
Updated recommendations for travelers
-------------------------------------
Before you leave assemble a travel health kit containing basic first aid
and medical supplies. Be sure to include a thermometer, household
disinfectant, and alcohol-based hand rubs for hand hygiene. Inform yourself
and others who may be traveling with you about Marburg virus. Be sure you
are up to date with all your immunizations, and see your health care
provider at least 4-6 weeks before travel to get any additional
immunizations, medications, or information you may need. You may wish to
check your health insurance plan or get additional insurance that covers
medical evacuation in the event of illness. Information about medical
evacuation services can be found at this US Department of State page.
Identify in-country health care resources in advance of your trip. During
travel, as with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important
preventive practices is careful and frequent handwashing. Cleaning your
hands often, using soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs
when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled), removes
potentially infectious materials from your skin and helps prevent disease
transmission. When wearing disposable gloves, wash the gloves with soap and
water before removing them. Do not reuse the gloves; instead dispose of
them according to recommended infection control precautions, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual/section6.htm>. After
disposing of the gloves, wash your hands again.
Avoid contact with ill or dead animals, especially primates. Do not eat
bushmeat (wild animals, including primates, sold for consumption as food in
local markets). If you or your family members become ill with fever or
develop other symptoms such as chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, or
rash, visit a health care provider immediately. The nearest US Embassy or
Consular Office can help you find a provider in the area. You are
encouraged to identify these resources in advance. When traveling to a
health care provider, limit your contact with others. All other travel
should be avoided.
After return, people returning from the affected area should monitor their
health for 10 days. Any traveler who becomes ill, even if only a fever,
should consult a health care provider immediately and tell him or her about
their recent travel and potential contacts. Tell the provider about your
symptoms prior to going to the office or emergency room so arrangements can
be made, if necessary, to prevent transmission to others in the health care
setting. This notice will be updated as new information becomes available.

Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever discounted as global threat
-------------------------------------------------------------
Angola's killer Marburg outbreak has yet to be brought under control but
the virus is not contagious enough to make it a serious global threat, a
senior US scientist said. Spread through blood, sweat, tears and saliva,
the Marburg virus has killed 244 people across Angola, a southern African
country still struggling to recover from a 27 year civil war and
ill-equipped to tackle the health threat.
The worldwide response has been massive but US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention expert Tom Ksiazek said the fight is not yet won. "I don't
think it's under control but I don't think it's out of control either," he
told Reuters in Luanda late on Thu 21 Apr 2005. "I don't think it's that
dangerous in global terms. It doesn't have the ability to go through the
general community. The common cold is a lot more transmittable." Most of
the dead --- some treated in isolation wards by staff in full body
protective gear -- have been medical staff or relatives caring for victims
of the disease and in close contact with victims' body fluids.
The United Nations World Health Organization and local health officials are
working hard in the northern province of Uige, the centre of the outbreak,
to persuade residents to bring sick relatives to hospital instead of caring
for them at home. The 266 cases so far have been limited to Uige or to
travellers recently returned from the region. But even if the disease
jumped to Luanda -- a city of 4 million -- the number of cases would be
limited, Ksiazek said. "It's not jumping through the community by people
touching each other or sneezing in the faces of other people," said the
former US Army doctor who now heads the CDC's Special Pathogens Unit and
who arrived in Angola soon after the outbreak was identified. Even in
Luanda's slums, any Marburg outbreak would likely be limited to some
medical staff and immediate family with close contact with the sick, he said.
But while Uige markets remain open and most of the province's half a
million people have felt little direct impact from the disease, many
elsewhere in Angola still feel they must take precautions. At a military
airstrip well outside Uige city, crew on cargo planes wore surgical masks
to unload disinfectant and medical supplies even though they never set foot
on the ground, while World Food Programme drivers refuse to go to the area.
Despite the alarm that has accompanied each outbreak of Ebola and Marburg
hemorrhagic fevers -- due in part to the horrific speed with which the
viruses kill -- Ksiazek said that if either disease ever reached a Western
city like New York, London or Paris it could be easily controlled. "If a
traveller is ill with the virus and pitches up at a Western hospital with
proper infection control the risk of transmission isn't that great," he
said, noting that modern hygiene standards would prevent most of the
contact with bodily fluids that helps spread the virus in poorer countries.
The chances of either virus mutating -- for example to become airborne and
thereby much more contagious -- were low, he said. "People are always
concerned about the possibility of that, but we know from tests that there
is not a tendency for these viruses to change significantly," he said.
