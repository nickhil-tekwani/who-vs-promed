A potentially deadly mosquito that can carry viruses such as yellow fever and Zika has been spotted in Brittany, northern France, sparking fears they may soon land on British shores. Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] have been confirmed to be in the commune of Domagne in the department of Ile-et-Vilaine in western Brittany.

Health authorities are preparing an intensive campaign to rid the area of the insects with strong insecticides.

The creatures were 1st seen in France in the southeastern city of Nice in 2004, and the pests have slowly been making their way north over the past 17 years.

The French Regional Health agency said in a tweet: "It is very small! (about 5mm [0.2 in], wings and body included)

"It has black and white stripes (not yellow), on its body and legs, it lives and bites during the day (it won't prevent you from sleeping!), its bite is painful."

With each bite the mosquitos can lay up to 200 eggs, so health chiefs are keen to advise how people can avoid being bitten.

Any large containers filled with rainwater need to be emptied, as these provide the perfect breeding grounds for these mosquitoes to lay clutches of eggs. Clearing any areas of rubbish can also help reduce the chances for them to breed.

The pests can carry deadly viruses of Zika and yellow fever, as well as dengue fever and chikungunya fever.

[_Aedes albopictus_ indeed continues to spread in France. Because its eggs can survive the winter by entering into diapause, it is likely to become established in these newly colonized areas.

As noted earlier, _Aedes albopictus_ has been expanding its geographic range in southern Europe for several years. The rapid expanse northward in France is noteworthy. It has gone from 41 departments reported in April 2018 to 51 departments in 2019, 57 departments in 2020, and now 64 departments as reported 21 May 2021 (see Invasive mosquito - France: (BF) 20210523.8377065). The established mosquito surveillance system in France doubtless will detect further expansion, as indicated in the above report.

The risk of initiation of ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses following introduction from elsewhere will depend on population abundance of mosquito vectors and susceptible human population densities, as well as the amount of time that people spend outdoors in areas where there is risk of bites from these mosquitoes.

Eradication of this mosquito from France is not possible with current pest control measures. This expansion will be an interesting situation to watch over the coming months and years.
