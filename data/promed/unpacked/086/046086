Filipino Nurse Working in Britain is Suspected Rabies Case
----------------------------------------------------------
A woman believed to be a Filipino nurse brought to Britain to help fill
National Health Service (NHS) staff shortages is in a coma at the Royal
Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London. A statement issued by the Royal
Free Hampstead NHS Trust said rabies was one of several conditions being
tested for, but added that "so far all tests for it have proved negative."
The Mail on Sunday newspaper reports that the female nurse feared to be
affected was working as a staff nurse at Luton and Dunstable Hospital in
Bedfordshire. She is thought to have become affected by a mystery illness 2
weeks ago and the Public Health Laboratory Service has confirmed that tests
are being conducted. Her parents have reportedly flown from the Philippines
to be at her bedside.
A statement issued later by the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust said: "A
woman is in a coma in intensive care receiving treatment for an
unidentified condition, possibly an infection. Among the conditions being
tested for is rabies, but so far all tests for it have proved negative. The
woman, in her 20s, who came to Britain from the Philippines 3 months ago,
was admitted from Luton and Dunstable Hospital on 31 May 2001. She is being
tested for various infectious agents including viruses as well as metabolic
causes for her condition." The statement added that: "There are no recorded
cases of person-to-person transmission of rabies [This assertion has been
the subject of discussion in prior ProMED-mail postings, and will not be
discussed further in this thread. - Man. Ed. DS, so no staff or members of
the public are considered to be at risk." A spokeswoman for the Public
Health Laboratory Service said that: "The symptoms she has look possibly of
rabies but not definitely. That is quite low down on the list of
priorities, but it cannot be ruled out." She added that the woman's
symptoms could be caused by a number of illnesses, including encephalitis
[due to other causes.
A Filipino man died in London in May after contracting rabies following a
dog-bite while on holiday in the Philippines. The man, who had lived in
Britain for several years, contracted rabies during a trip to visit his
family. He was given rabies vaccine but later died in the intensive care
unit of University Hospital. Relatives and hospital staff were immunized,
although the risk of transmission is tiny.

[Rabies has a variable incubation period in human beings ranging from
relatively short to quite long. Since the womans parents are present,
perhaps some information regarding possible exposure to rabies may be
gained which may be useful for diagnosis.
The article does not indicate the clinical signs/symptoms in this case, nor
does it indicate potential exposure to a rabid animal. Consequently, this
may yet turn out to be another disease. ­ Mod.TG
