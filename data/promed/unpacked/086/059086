First Report of Tan Spot of Wheat Caused by _Pyrenophora
tritici-repentis_ in the Pacific Northwest.
-------------------------------------------------------
TL Peever and TD Murray, Department of Plant Pathology, Washington
State University, Pullman, WA 99164-6430. Plant Dis. 87:203, 2003;
published on-line as D-2002-1202-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication
15 Nov 2002.
In late May 2001, lesions resembling tan spot were observed on lower
leaves of winter wheat (_Triticum aestivum_ L.) in early boot stage
in Nez Perce County, ID.
Abundant sporulation was observed from tan lesions with chlorotic
haloes after 2 days incubation in a moist chamber at room
temperature. Conidia were multicelled, straw colored, approximately
100 x 15 micrometers, rounded at the apex, and borne singly on dark
brown conidiophores. The fungus fit the morphological description of
_Drechslera tritici-repentis_ (Died.) Shoemaker, the anamorphic state
of _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_ [Pt-r] (Died.) Drechs. (2).
3 single-conidial isolates were collected from infected plants in a 5
x 1 m area of the affected field and induced to sporulate. 2 of the
isolates were used to spray-inoculate 3-week-old susceptible wheat
(cv. Madsen) in the greenhouse (1 plant per isolate, 100 000
conidia/ml), and tan spot lesions were apparent 3 to 5 days after
inoculation with both isolates.
DNA was extracted from the 3 isolates, and the entire nuclear
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) was amplified with ITS1
and ITS4 primers (4). Similarly, 610 bp of the 5' end of the
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene (gpd) was amplified
with gpd-1and gpd-2 primers (1).
ITS and gpd amplicons were direct-sequenced on both strands, and
alignment revealed that all 3 isolates were identical for both
regions. A BLAST search of the NCBI database with the ITS sequence
revealed Pt-r accession AY004808 and AF071348 and _D.
tritici-repentis_ accession AF163060 as the closest matches with 100,
99.8, and 99.8 percent sequence similarity, respectively. A similar
search with the gpd sequence revealed Pt-r accessions AY004838 and
AF081370 and _P. bromi_ accession AY004839 as the closest matches
with 100, 100, and 99.0 percent similarity, respectively.
These results, coupled with the morphological identification and
inoculation results, confirm the identity of the fungus as Pt-r.
Although reported on other grass hosts in the region (3), to our
knowledge, this is the first report of tan spot of wheat in the
Pacific Northwest of the USA. It has been of little concern to wheat
producers in the Pacific Northwest due to low rainfall and relative
humidity during the growing season.

[Pt-r infects wheat in all the wheat-growing regions of the world.
Yield losses due to the disease range from 3-50 percent. Pt-r also
infects rye and barley but does not cause significant yield losses.
Disease management depends on planting of high-quality seed, burying
of infected wheat residues, crop rotation using canola, mustard,
peas, chick peas, or other crops, application of appropriate
fungicides, and use of resistant cultivars.
