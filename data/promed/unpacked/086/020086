Public Health authorities confirmed that between today and tomorrow
[30-31 Dec 2008] the results of laboratory tests on the 19-year-old
victim will arrive in Posadas. The Governor [of Misiones province]
asked that all citizens of Misiones be vaccinated [against yellow fever].

The young man resided in the Alta Garcia neighborhood, and was a
gatherer of firewood. He died yesterday [29 Dec 2008] in the Misiones
capital and since then Public Health reported that [the case] was one
of suspected yellow fever [YF]. It was suspected that the youth had
been collecting firewood in the Fachinal and Profundidad areas, where
dead monkeys have been discovered. He had not been vaccinated for YF.
The Governor requested that the people who had still not received [YF]
vaccine go to to health centers, where [YF vaccine] doses are available.

Additionally, a neighbor who worked in the same place died on Sunday
[28 Dec 2008] with similar symptoms, according to family members,
although there is no official confirmation that they are dealing with
the same disease.

The last yellow fever epidemic was recorded in 1966 in Obera, and
beginning in January of this year [2008] there was notification of
the 1st dead monkeys with yellow fever [virus infections] in the area
of Provincial Park Pinalito and 8 human yellow fever cases, among
them one fatality from San Vicente, have been confirmed.

To date, all the registered cases have been of the sylvatic [jungle
transmission] type, and have been in people who carry out work in
rural areas near the zone [of YF] risk. Since 2001, the year in which
massive [YF] vaccination campaigns were carried out in the entire
province, 1 210 000 doses [of YF vaccine] have been administered.

Fatal fear
----------
According to his parents, the youth had not received the yellow fever
vaccine because he was afraid of needles, said the family members and
[health] professionals who had attended this case.

"In facing this situation, sanitary measures were initiated in the
area where the youth lived, and the tasks involved environmental
clean-up and disposal of trash. The area was fumigated and an
epidemiological barrier was imposed beginning last week [week of 21
Dec 2008] when we decided to go house-to-house to vaccinate
neighbors, and we discovered that there were individuals who had not
yet been vaccinated," related the Subsecretary of Health, Carlos
Baez. Currently, public health agents are vaccinating in farms 55,
56, 76 and 77 (Alta Gracia) in Posadas. On these occasions, trash
disposal and fumigation tasks are carried out also.

Public awareness
----------------
On his part, Governor Closs promised an implacable campaign against
yellow fever. "The [YF] cases have been recurring and we are deeply
worried about that. Many Misiones residents do not want to be
vaccinated. That is when we reach the limits of our action," said Closs.

He clarified that "for now the disease is sylvatic [cycle of
transmission], but its conversion into a serious urban [cycle of
transmission] will depend on the level of public awareness of every
Misiones citizen," added the Governor.

Tourists who come to Misiones must be vaccinated against yellow fever [virus].
[This warning includes tourists visiting the Iguassu Falls on both
sides of the Argentina-Brazil frontier. - Mod.JW].

[YF has been confirmed previously in 20 dead monkeys (presumably, black
howlers (_Alouatta] caraya_) in this area of Misiones province (see
ProMED archive no. 20081220.4014). The concern that the sylvan YF
virus transmission will become an urban one is real, and the vigorous
prevention campaign (vaccination and environmental clean-up to
eliminated breeding sites for the urban YF virus vector mosquito,
_Aedes aegypti_,) is very prudent. ProMED would appreciate receiving
information about the results of the laboratory tests being done on
this unfortunate, and preventable, human case.
