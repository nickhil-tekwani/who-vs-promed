A resident of Dublin, New Hampshire, has died after testing positive for the mosquitoborne Jamestown Canyon Virus, the 1st case detected this year [2021] in New Hampshire.

According to an advisory notice posted by the Dublin Police Department with information provided by Dublin health officer Mike Borden, the person who died was bitten by a mosquito in Dublin on 28 Jun [2021]. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) announced the resident's death on 6 Aug [2021], though the press release did not specify the date of death. It seems that the adult who was infected was hospitalized with neurological symptoms and ultimately died, with the Jamestown Canyon virus infection a contributing cause.

Jamestown Canyon virus circulates widely in North America primarily between deer and mosquitoes but can also infect humans, though cases among humans are very rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC statistics reveal that an average of 15 Jamestown Canyon virus cases are reported each year in the United States, though it is believed cases are likely underdiagnosed when they are less severe in their symptoms. In 2020, 5 cases were reported in New Hampshire.

"Jamestown Canyon virus and the other mosquitoborne infections can cause serious illness," said Dr Benjamin Chan, New Hampshire state epidemiologist. "As summer progresses into fall, the risk from mosquito-transmitted infections is expected to increase. So residents and visitors to New Hampshire should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, especially as people are encouraged to spend more time outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The DHHS announced the risk level for mosquitoborne disease for Dublin has been increased to "high" as a result of the identified infection. Surrounding communities, including Harrisville, Peterborough, Jaffrey and Marlborough, have been increased to "moderate".

Borden said the immediate precautions for residents to take include using caution when outside, particularly in the early morning or late evening, and using mosquito repellant. Borden also advised residents to remove any standing water from their property at least once a week, including from buckets, flowerpots, pet bowls, birdbaths, and kiddie pools, which are mosquito breeding grounds. Tightly cover or screen water storage containers and things like tarps and tires so they do not collect rainwater.

Other mosquitoborne illnesses that are potential risks in the state include eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. People can be infected with any of those 3 illnesses and not develop any symptoms, or only develop very mild symptoms. For people who develop symptoms, the time from mosquito bite to feeling ill can range from a few days to up to 2 weeks from the bite.

Early symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some also have respiratory symptoms such as a cough, sore throat or runny nose. More serious central nervous system diseases, including meningitis or encephalitis, can occur with these diseases. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms, including fever and headache, contact your local medical provider. There are no vaccines to prevent Jamestown Canyon virus, and care consists of treating symptoms to keep the individual comfortable.

About half of patients with Jamestown Canyon virus are hospitalized, but deaths associated with the infection are rare.

Reports of Jamestown Canyon virus in humans have been increasing over the last several years as testing for this virus has increased. This is New Hampshire's 15th case since the 1st report of the disease in 2013. Many illnesses caused by the virus are mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement requiring hospitalization have been reported, including fatal infections. In New Hampshire, human cases of Jamestown Canyon virus have been recorded as early as mid-May and as late as early November.

[Although the above case of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is the 1st one in New Hampshire this year (2021), there have been a few cases in previous years. There were 5 cases last year (2020). Fatalities such as this one are rare indeed. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites as recommended above are prudent preventive measures.

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) aedes and _ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED post Jamestown Canyon virus, mosquitoes - USA (NY) (03) 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. That post provides related references.
