Strange Disease Hits Mityana
----------------------------
Experts from the Ministry of Health in Kampala are in Mityana district
to investigate a strange disease that has reportedly hit the area.

The disease that is reported to have symptoms similar to that of Ebola
[hemorrhagic fever] broke out in Mityana north last week [of March
2010]. A total of 2 people and 7 children are reportedly ill,
suffering from vomiting and diarrhea.

The Minister of State for Primary Health Care, James Kakooza, says he
cannot confirm whether the disease is Ebola until the health experts
give the Ministry of Health a report.

Some of the victims now admitted in Mityana District Hospital say they
feel pain all over their body.

[A recent [2009] report of a suspected outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever in Mityana has not been confirmed so far -- see ProMED archive
below. Likewise a recent suspected outbreak of smallpox at a different
location in Uganda is now considered to be an outbreak of chickenpox.
Further information on the outcome of the Ugandan Ministry of Health
investigation into the cause of the current outbreak would be welcomed.

Mityana is a town in central Uganda. It is the largest town in Mityana
District and the district headquarters is located there. It can be
located in the map at:

It seems that people in Uganda are prone to fear that any outbreak of
severe vomiting and diarrhea might be due to Ebola hemorrhagic fever,
when there are many other possible causes for that syndrome. No
hemorrhage or rash is mentioned in the above report. We never heard
the final diagnosis of the outbreak we reported in August 2009 in
which Ebola hemorrhagic fever was excluded by lab tests -- see ProMED
ref. below. - Mod.JW]
