All athletic contests and activities that require contact outside the Neillsville School District have been canceled until Monday [11 Dec 2017] because of several cases of whooping cough, according to school officials.

In late November [2017], a family in the district with a child in the elementary school and another child in the 7th through 12th grades tested positive for pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, said John Gaier, Neillsville School District administrator.

As of Tuesday [12 Dec 2017], the Clark County Health Department had confirmed 5 families with whooping cough, Gaier said. On the recommendation of the Health Department, the school canceled all athletic contests and other activities that would expose students in other counties or school districts to Neillsville School District students, Gaier said. Athletics are most affected, with a couple of field trips also canceled.

The Clark County Health Department also advised the school district not to cancel classes, stating students would be better off at school than congregating at home, Gaier said. The district will monitor students for symptoms of whooping cough, he said.

Whooping cough has made its way into a Vancouver high school, sending some kids home sick. There have been 6 confirmed cases of pertussis at Mountain View High School according to KATU's news partner, The Columbian.

There was an outbreak in Clark County in 2015 with several hundred reported cases. According to Clark County Public Health's website, those infected can't return to school until they complete a 5-day course of antibiotics. Public health officials strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their kids as the best defense.

The number of reported whooping cough cases in Henderson County more than doubled in the past week, rising from 21 cases on 8 Dec. 2017 to 45 cases on Friday [15 Dec 2017] according to the Department of Public Health. Henderson County has been fighting to contain the outbreak of whooping cough, known formally as pertussis, since the 1st case was reported in mid-November 2017 at Hillandale Elementary School, about 4.5 miles southeast of downtown Hendersonville.

In the month since, the respiratory infection has spread beyond the schools and is impacting the community at large. As of 8 Dec 2017, more than 1000 people in Henderson County had been in close contact with somebody with whooping cough, which is "easily spread when someone with the infection coughs or sneezes," according to a press release from Henderson County.

No cases of whooping cough have been reported in Buncombe County, according to Dr. Jennifer Mullendore, medical director at the Department of Health and Human Services. Anybody, including people who have been vaccinated, can contract whooping cough though the symptoms may be milder for those with vaccinations. The infection is particularly dangerous for infants, pregnant women and anyone with a compromised immune system.

Grand Ledge Public Schools [GLPS] has confirmed cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. In a letter released Friday [15 Dec 2017] through social media, school officials confirmed the cases.

"If there's one infection in the school and the kid is not properly been diagnosed for it, potential is there for him to go, or her to go and continue to infect other kids," says Sparrow Urgent Care Physician, Song Yu. Yu says whooping cough can be a very serious illness, especially in young children. "We recommend treatment within the 1st 7-10 days; the problem is though until you get the symptoms that are obvious, you're not going to have that until week 2 or 3," says Yu.

The administrator at Grand Ledge Public Schools released a letter stating there have been confirmed cases of the disease in the school system. That letter asked parents to get their students vaccinated before entering kindergarten and to keep children at home if they show any signs of the illness.

Although most children are given the vaccine for whooping cough during routine childhood immunizations, booster doses are required over time. GLPS is working with the Barry/Eaton Health Department, and they ask you to check your child's immunization records. If your child has not been protected against this illness, it is recommended that you go to your doctor to have them immunized. If you have any questions about the issue, you can contact the Barry/Eaton District Health Department. For more information, visit http://www.cdc.gov/feature/pertussis.
