Eight people in Denmark have been infected with _Listeria_ in the space of 2 weeks and 3 have died. The Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (FÃ¸devarestyrelsen), and DTU [National] Food Institute are investigating to try and find the source of the outbreak.

Between 13 and 29 May 2022, 5 men and 3 women became infected with the same type of _Listeria_. Patients range from 33 to 93 years old and all of them had an underlying disease or other immune system issue prior to infection that made them particularly vulnerable. 2 had meningitis, 5 had sepsis, including a pregnant woman, and 1 had a cerebral abscess.

All 8 have been hospitalized and 3 people died within 30 days of the sample being taken. 7 of them are from the Hovedstaden region of the country.

Whole genome sequencing found the strains were closely related and of the sequence type (ST) 37. The Statens Serum Institut is responsible for sequencing isolates from patients and interviewing them or their relatives to identify the possible source of infection.

There were 15 _Listeria_ cases recorded in May [2022], while Denmark usually sees an average of 4 per month.

Late last year [2021], Danish officials investigated an outbreak of _Listeria_ that affected 9 people from 2018 through 2021. All patients were hospitalized but there were no deaths. They were unable to find the source of the infection. The sequence type involved in this outbreak is different than the one in the current incident.

Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure. People should monitor themselves for food poisoning symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

[The news report above says that whole-genome sequencing (WGS) performed on _Listeria_ isolated from 8 persons in Denmark identified a cluster of cases as likely having a common source. We are not told if food histories from these patients suggested a common source or if WGS that was performed on _Listeria_ isolated from any particular food item yielded a similar genotype. Since listeriosis has a long incubation period (up to 70 days), there may yet be additional cases associated with the outbreak strain. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

In the US, as in Europe, a similar system identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on WGS of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). In the US, clinical isolates are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are then submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates having the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists look at food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a possible common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism is a Gram-positive bacillus that can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat, and poultry, raw (unpasteurized) milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises used to process contaminated meat or fish, and vegetables, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, humans, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

_L. monocytogenes_ can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

Listeria-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats, like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources of listeriosis because _Listeria_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Refrigeration allows small numbers of listeria that contaminate food at the source to grow to sufficient size to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis.

Seven of the 8 patients with listeriosis are from Hovedstaden, the Capital Region of Denmark, which is the easternmost region of Denmark; the Capital Region has 29 municipalities, including the capital city, Copenhagen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Region_of_Denmark).
