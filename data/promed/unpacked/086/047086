UK blames Spanish eggs for salmonella
------------------------------------------
The UK's Food Standards Agency has reported 'growing evidence' that the
recent outbreak of salmonellosis, which has so far caused 2 deaths and made
350 people ill, originated in Spain.
Continuing investigations into a number of outbreaks of salmonella in
England and Wales have led the Food Standards Agency to issue guidance to
importers and wholesalers of Spanish eggs, advising that they are heat
treated. Heat treatment kills bugs such as salmonella in eggs. The Agency
has also raised the issue with the European Commission and directly with
the Spanish food safety authorities. However, the agency did make it clear
that not all cases are linked with imported eggs.
"There is also some emerging evidence that suggests that not all food
businesses are following the Agency's advice on the proper handling and use
of eggs. Examples of poor practices identified so far include raw eggs
being used in uncooked products such as icing and desserts; and poor
practice around basic food hygiene," the FSA said.
Dr Roger Skinner, head of the Agency's Microbiological Safety Division,
said: "More evidence is emerging about the sources of these outbreaks that
has convinced us of the need to advise that Spanish eggs coming into the UK
are heat-treated to kill off the salmonella bug.
"However we are not complacent about UK or other imported eggs. At least
one outbreak is being linked with UK eggs. It has long been known that some
eggs may be contaminated with the salmonella food poisoning bug and they
must be handled and used properly. It is disturbing that in several of
these cases it is emerging that the Agency's advice is not being listened
to. Good practice in the kitchen, at home or in a food business, is
vital. People need to protect themselves and others by sticking to our
advice."
In a number of cases around the country, food poisoning has come from a
particular strain of _Salmonella enteritidis_ PT (phage type) 14b. Some
Spanish eggs have tested positive for this strain, as well as other strains
of salmonella, the FSA said.
These other strains of salmonella have in turn been the cause of other
outbreaks of food poisoning. Most of the outbreaks are suspected of being
egg-related. As well as Spanish eggs, other imported and UK eggs are also
under investigation.

[Once again, and it cannot be stressed enough, the adequate cooking of
potentially contaminated food products will eradicate the hazards
of transmitted bacterial infection, regardless of whether the
contamination is from Salmonella, _E. coli_ O157:H7, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, or other pathogen that needs to replicate to cause
disease. - Mod.LL]
