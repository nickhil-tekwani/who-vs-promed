A mysterious illness has killed six horses at a farm in Lawrencetown,
Nova Scotia. Horse owners are worried and investigators are baffled.
RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] have been notified of the deaths
but they are not conducting a formal investigation. Police say there
are no grounds to believe the deaths are due to a criminal act or any
act of negligence. The horses died suddenly over a period of about
two weeks in November [1998].
