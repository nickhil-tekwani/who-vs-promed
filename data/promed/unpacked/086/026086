DOC to inject kakapo with turkey vaccine
--------------------------------------------
A pilot vaccination program will start today [Thu 15 Jul 2004] in
Fiordland, for 5 young kakapo, in a bid to save all the endangered birds
from killer bacteria.
All healthy birds in New Zealand's tiny flock of endangered kakapo will be
injected with a turkey vaccine, conservation workers said today [Thu 15 Jul
2004]. "Measures that will now be adopted... will include inoculating all
healthy kakapo on Te Kakahu (Chalky Island) and Whenua Hou (Codfish Island,
off Stewart Island) against this bacterium," said Department of
Conservation's (DOC) kakapo recovery program manager, Paul Jansen. "What we
have done is decide the best strategy to prevent any further kakapo
deaths," he said.
5 of the juvenile birds most at risk of being killed by the bacterium,
_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_, have been penned for a pilot vaccination
program that will start tomorrow [Fri 16 Jul 2004], when vaccine arrives on
Chalky Island in Fiordland National Park.
The vaccine, made of dead bacteria, will 1st be tried out on Dobbie, a
22-year-old male, to check for adverse reactions, which could,
theoretically, range from none to fatal shock. The most likely reaction is
a scab developing at the site of the injection, according to Mr. Jansen.
3 juveniles -- 15 percent of the 18 2-year old birds moved to Chalky Island
earlier this month [July 2004] -- were killed by the disease outbreak last
weekend [10-11 Jul 2004], leaving 15 young birds still on the island at
serious risk.
"The plan is to dose all 15, unless there is an adverse reaction to the
vaccine," Mr. Jansen said. "We will make more pens on Friday [16 Jul 2004]
and bring more birds in."
The bacterium causes erysipelas, a disease -- also found in pigs, dogs,
dolphins, and lambs -- which can cause death from septicemia, within 24
hours, when it occurs in birds. Overseas, it has been recorded in emu,
turkeys, and commercial poultry, usually killing young birds, and, has also
been found in parrots. It is commonly found on some South Island pig farms.
The bacterium can survive for up to 35 days in soil and can kill a
susceptible juvenile bird within 24 hours. Older birds can carry the
bacterium, spreading it without showing clinical symptoms.
The vaccine has been donated by a Christchurch-based vaccine company,
Pacific Vet Ltd., which normally sells it for use in pigs and turkeys. A
company executive, immunologist Kent Deitemeyer, said today [Thu 15 Jul
2004] that the company was pleased to help a threatened species. "We sent
the vaccine down last night [Wed 14 Jul 2004] , and we've spoken with the
DOC vet on Codfish Island," Mr. Deitemeyer said. "We were quite anxious to
help them out. We use the vaccine all the time in New Zealand, mostly for
farmed pigs."
A veterinary pathologist at Massey University, Associate Professor Maurice
Alley, said, last night [Wed 14 Jul 2004], that the disease appeared to
have mainly affected juveniles, and, caused an acute septicemia. "I believe
a turkey vaccine is available overseas, but, since this has never been
tried in parrots, DOC workers will be justifiably reluctant to use it,
particularly if antibiotic treatment is effective."
But today [Thu 15 Jul 2004], Mr. Dietemeyer said his impression was that
DOC was keen to quickly use the vaccine -- a tiny injection of half a
milliliter under the skin -- because of the need to get the outbreak under
control. "They're fairly keen to get on to it, because they are faced with
quite a few unknowns. It's all kind of new for them. Nobody has done any
trials on these vaccines and kakapo, so we'll just keep our fingers crossed."
Mr. Dietemeyer said the vaccinations would need to be followed, later, by
booster shots, which would also be provided by his company, which imports
vaccines for use on pigs, poultry, and horses throughout the South Pacific.
He said it was likely that, as birds aged, they would acquire a natural
resistance to the disease.
Mr. Jansen said the vaccine would not arrive on Chalky Island until
tomorrow [Fri 16 Jul 2004], even though it had been sent south from
Christchurch on Tuesday [13 Jul 2004] night. "We have had to limit the
frequency of helicopter flights to reduce stress risks to kakapo," he said.
The juveniles that remained on Codfish, and, later, the adults there, will
be vaccinated, "once we get the field results of its effect from Chalky
Island."
Mr. Jansen said more research was being done by veterinarians, and, in the
meantime, the kakapo on Codfish Island, 4 km northwest of Stewart Island,
were being monitored, through screening samples of their feces, for the
presence of bacteria.
