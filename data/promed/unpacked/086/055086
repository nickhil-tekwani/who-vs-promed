It has been agreed with the European Commission that as from 12 Jun
2010 Great Britain (GB) will change its status from a BTV-8
Protection Zone to a BTV-8 Lower Risk Zone (LRZ). A LRZ is an option
within the bluetongue regulations which enables Member States that do
not have circulating disease to allow their livestock holders to
vaccinate against bluetongue. It also imposes tighter controls on
animals brought into the country from 'confluent zones' (zones of the
same BTV serotype) to help keep disease out.

The LRZ is an excellent step toward full eradication of this disease
and will provide Great Britain with additional protection from
imports from other countries that are currently in the same BTV zone
as us. We are monitoring the bluetongue situation in the rest of the
European Union, particularly to be aware of the risk of new
incursions from wind-borne infected midges. In the meantime we must
not be complacent and we continue to encourage livestock holders to
remain vigilant for disease and to continue vaccinating their
livestock.

The new zone will mean a change to the requirements for livestock
movements into GB. See the movement and guidance page for more
information:

Jim Paice the Minister of State for Agriculture and Food has responded:
"This is a great result that speaks volumes for the work done by
farmers and vets, who've worked with the Government to achieve this
Lower Risk Zone status for bluetongue. It will take the pressure off
livestock producers but they must remain vigilant and anyone
importing stock must realise that they are responsible for ensuring
they are not importing disease."

The Chief Veterinary Officer has responded:
"The news from the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal
Health (SCoFCAH) that Great Britain has achieved Lower Risk Zone
status is testament to the excellent cooperation between industry and
government demonstrated from the earliest days of 2007's bluetongue
outbreak. We have remained in a bluetongue Protection Zone since the
1st case was confirmed and the efforts of responsible livestock
owners and vets in vaccinating stock and the surveillance work by
Animal Health, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, and the Institute
for Animal Health has allowed us to successfully apply for this
revised status.

"But we cannot become complacent, and I'd encourage farmers and vets
to continue to vaccinate their livestock and remain vigilant for
disease while additional targeted surveillance continues in the
higher risk areas."

[A map showing the status of EU countries re BTV, namely the
bluetongue virus serotypes circulating in each restricted zone, is
available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.
The map has been updated on 4 Jun 2010.

On continental Europe, the season of BTV-vectors activity has
restarted; a table, showing the dates which have been notified to the
European Commission by the BTV-affected countries as their respective
start and end of the "vector free periods" has been updated on 1 Jun
2010. It is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/overview_seasonally_vfp.pdf>.

The bluetongue "seasonally vector free period" means "a defined
seasonal period in an epidemiological relevant geographical area,
during which, for a part of the year, there is no evidence of
bluetongue virus transmission or adult Culicoides likely to be
competent vectors." - Mod.AS]
