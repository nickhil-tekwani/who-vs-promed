As a result of the International Cocoa Congress, the Colombian National
Cocoa Growers Federation (Fedecacao) announced that in the coming days it
would sign an agreement to advise Brazil and Mexico on the transfer of
technology and provide training for the control and management of
moniliasis disease.

While the disease is not ordinarily encountered in Brazil, it has been
detected less than 50 km [31 mi] from the cocoa growing region of the state
of Para.

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis), of cocoa is caused by the
fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease originally
identified in Ecuador in 1917. It spread rapidly to other countries in
Latin America during the 1970s and reached the northern boundary of the
crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006.

FPR can cause complete loss of production and is considered a major
constraint to cocoa production in the region. It is a specialised pathogen
that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of
_Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as reservoirs.

Affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear
less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies
(shrivelled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus
produces large quantities of powdery spores giving affected pods a
'frosted' appearance. Conventional control measures, including
phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated
management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance
breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and
is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in Brazil
(Bahia) and lead to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both
pathogens have already impacted on the livelihoods of many smallholder
farmers and pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and
Asia if they are introduced there.
