The future of rice production in the Kimberley's Ord Valley has been
dealt a blow, with a fungal disease known as "rice blast" found on one
of the farms. Western Australia's Department of Agriculture and Food
has put in place quarantine measures to stop its spread, and a
decision on whether to destroy the crop is expected to be made by the
end of the week.

The department's Noel Wilson says the Ord's entire crop of 650
hectares may have to be destroyed to prevent the disease from
spreading to other parts of the country. "The Consultative Committee
on Emergency Plant Pests may say we want to eradicate this crop, but
that doesn't mean we'll never be able to grow rice here, because you
can grow tolerant varieties," he said

"But at this stage, we're not sure where we're going with this. We're
just concentrating on assessing the spread of the disease and how best
to respond to it."

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously
classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most
destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of
more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the
shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are
infected, all plant parts above the infection die, and yield losses
are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages,
plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses
and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The disease
is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence.

This is the 1st time rice blast has been detected in a commercial rice
crop in WA and the 1st occurrence of a major outbreak of the disease
in Australia. A potential source of the incursion is being
investigated. None of the rice varieties tolerant or resistant to rice
blast are currently available in Australia, and breeding programmes of
crop varieties suitable for local conditions may need to be
established.
