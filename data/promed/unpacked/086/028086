A 39-year-old drug addict has been diagnosed with anthrax and is now in hospital in Copenhagen. The state Board of Health Ritzau states that the diagnosis was confirmed by the State Serum Institute, which isolated _Bacillus anthracis_.

The 39-year-old heroin addict went to his doctor Wednesday [25 Jul 2012], and on Friday [27 Jul 2012] came the reply that the sample had demonstrated the anthrax bacteria. The infected addict is now in hospital in the capital, said Health Protection Agency Ritzau.

"It underlines the risk of the use of heroin, where it appears that it may be contaminated with the anthrax bacteria," said Arne Scheel Thomsen, Chief Medical Officer, National Board of Health Ritzau.

Previously, a 55-year-old addict had died of anthrax on 8 Jul 2012 from using "brown" heroin. Despite intensive treatment, his condition quickly deteriorated, and the doctors failed to save his life.

"It is not contagious by ordinary contact such as when people say hello to each other. But if you are a heroin addict and have a high fever or sores on the skin, then you should [immediately] seek medical attention," said the officer of Ritzau.

Doctors and health workers must also pay special attention, as there may be more cases of drug addicts with anthrax, warns the State Serum Institute. Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics.

Anthrax is transmitted between animals and humans. The bacterium can find its way into heroin during production or if the pure heroin is mixed with bone meal from animals.

[As this case is, for the moment, surviving, we can assume that he will be helping the Danish police with their inquiries. Clearly, we are going to see more of these heroin-associated anthrax cases during the coming weeks. Our heartfelt thanks to Sabine for finding this report and doing the initial translation. - Mod.MHJ
