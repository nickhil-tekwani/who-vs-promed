Since October 2006, the Spanish National
Reference Laboratory has reported a series of
isolations of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Kottbus on the island of Gran Canaria (1). The
fact that most of the cases were in infants under
one year of age and needed hospitalization caused
significant concern among the general public.
Information published in the media contributed to this alarm.
Outbreaks due to this serotype are rare in the
literature, with only 5 outbreaks published since
1959 (2-6). No cases related to serotype Kottbus
had been isolated and reported in Spain since
1996 (7,8). We decided to conduct epidemiological
and environmental studies to describe the
characteristics of the cases and to determine the possible source of infection.
Methods:
During October and November 2006, we actively
searched for and collected information on cases.
We designed a matched case-control (1:2) study
that was conducted while cases were still
occurring. A case was defined as an infant under
one year of age with gastroenteritis and with
laboratory confirmed _S._ Kottbus. Controls were
selected from among healthy children who visited
the same pediatrician as the cases for a regular
consultation and were matched by age, sex, date of consultation and address.
We interviewed parents on food and drink
consumption of the children using a trawling
questionnaire including questions about breast
feeding and consumption of vegetables, dairy
products, meat, fish, etc. To identify risk
factors, bivariate analysis and conditional
logistic regression were used to calculate crude
odds ratios (OR) and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (MH-OR).
Results:
Of 46 identified and confirmed cases, 41 were
included in the study, and the rest declined to
participate or were not found. The average age
was 5 months (95 percent CI 2.5-7.5), and 27 of
those 41 cases (66 percent) were male. 19 cases
(46 percent) had underlying diseases or were
immunocompromised (e.g. previous infectious
diseases, neurological pathologies, and newborn
pathologies such as gastric reflex, lactose
intolerance, low birth weight, premature birth,
etc.). The geographical analysis showed that the
cases were distributed along the island following
one of the main highways (Figure 1, [For figures,
see original URL. - Mod. LL]).
All cases occurred in 2006 between weeks 34 and
45. The epidemic curve suggested a continuous common source (Figure 2).
The case-control analysis identified a
statistically significant association with the
consumption of locally produced bottled water
(without gas) (OR=8.04; 95 percent CI 2.24-43.3)
and natural fruits (OR=0.04; 95 percent CI
0.005?0.44). The conditional logistic regression
showed an MH-OR of 36.3 (95 percent CI
3.18-414.4) for water consumption, adjusting for
age, sex, date of consultation, address and fruit consumption.
A carrier pigeon loft was found near a water
reservoir of the local factory, and we could
verify that pigeons frequented this reservoir.
Microbiological and environmental analysis
detected _S._ Kottbus in bottles randomly
selected from markets and also in the local
factory where the water was bottled. Moreover,
_Salmonella_ sp. was detected in the pigeons.
Discussion and conclusion:
This is the 1st published outbreak of
_Salmonella_ Kottbus associated with commercial
bottled water in Spain and Europe. A significant
proportion of patients had concomitant diseases,
which may explain why this group was so
prominently affected. The spring may have been
contaminated by pigeons that used the water deposit as a watering place.
The implicated brand of water was for local
distribution only and was sold in different
supermarkets on Gran Canaria. As a consequence of
the investigation, the factory was closed down,
all supermarkets were informed, and the bottled
water was recalled. Public Health authorities
inspected the markets over several days to verify the recall.
In future studies, we suggest the inclusion of
bottled water as a possible source of
salmonellosis, especially in certain risk groups,
and to consider including detection of _Salmonella_ in water controls.

[This posting reports an interesting vehicle for
salmonellosis. The "smoking water" is described
by isolating the same serotype from the bottled
water, but whether the organism was derived from the pigeons is not clear.
