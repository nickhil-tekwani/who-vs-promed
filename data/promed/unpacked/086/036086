The Lancet Infectious Diseases recently published the results of an observational study led by researchers on Children's Hospital Colorado Infectious Disease and Neurology teams, along with counterparts at the Centers for Disease Control and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The study was conducted from [1 Mar to 30 Nov 2018] and led to a discovery of the largest outbreak of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) in the United States [see reference below].

Since the 1990s, every 1 to 3 years, EV-A71 has caused large-scale, and sometimes deadly epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region, which has prompted the development of EV-A71 vaccines. In the United States, detections of this virus have been small-scale and sporadic. However, the unique symptoms, unusually high number of cases, and the geographic clustering of children who were observed during this study, indicated an outbreak.

"We need to watch this very closely," said Kevin Messacar, MD, pediatric infectious disease physician and researcher at Children's Hospital Colorado and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. "Enhanced surveillance is needed in order to determine whether this outbreak was an isolated event or a warning of impending cyclic outbreaks of EV-A71 neurological disease in the US."

In addition to highlighting the need to improve enterovirus surveillance, the observational study also helped identify what other medical providers should be looking for. Children with EV-A71 disease were best differentiated from children with other enteroviruses by the neurological findings of myoclonus (quick, involuntary muscle jerks), ataxia (dizziness), weakness, and autonomic instability (dysregulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and perfusion). Often times these symptoms can be misunderstood or misattributed to other diagnoses -- especially among young children.

Finally, it's important to note that these viruses tend to appear in seasonal waves. If through additional surveillance efforts, the United States continues to see enteroviruses circulating that cause neurological illness, the development of antivirals and vaccines may need to become a priority.

"Were it not for Children's Hospital Colorado's ongoing interest and commitment to the study of enteroviruses, this outbreak would probably not have been detected," noted Drs Carol Glaser and Mike Wilson in a commentary published alongside the Lancet study. "The USA has yet to have large-scale epidemics of enteroviruses as are seen in Asia and other countries, but it should take steps to become better prepared."

[Enterovirus 71 (EV71 or EV-A71) is one of a large family of viruses that multiply in the human gastrointestinal tract (gut). EV71 infection can cause illness ranging from mild through to serious with life threatening complications. Spread is from person to person through contamination of hands or objects (for example, toys) with infected faeces. The virus is then taken in by the mouth. Spread also occurs by contact with the saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum of an infected person. In people with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), direct contact with fluid from blisters on the infected person can also spread the virus.

EV71 is one of many possible viruses that cause hand-foot-mouth disease. Not all children with EV71 infections will have HFMD. In South Australia, most cases of hand-foot-mouth disease are caused by other viruses.

The symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease are fever, rash, tiredness, loss of appetite, and ulcers or blisters in the mouth and on the hands and feet. Often there is a sore mouth for a few days before the ulcers or blisters appear and affected young children may refuse to eat or drink.

EV71 infection usually causes only a mild illness in adults and children. However, children under 5 years old, especially those under 2 years, are at higher risk of developing a severe EV71 infection.

Serious infection may involve the brain (encephalitis) and the meninges (the lining of the brain and spinal cord, causing meningitis). Signs may include fever, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, cough, irritability, seizures (fits), unsteadiness, weakness, and/or paralysis.

The infection can also involve the heart, causing a fast or slow heart rate, high blood pressure, or breathing difficulties.

Most cases recover completely but some require a short stay in hospital, and a very small number may have long-term consequences.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is diagnosed on the presenting signs and symptoms. Unless laboratory tests are done, it is not possible to determine what virus is causing the hand, foot and mouth disease.

To make a definite diagnosis of EV71 infection, laboratory testing such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing or culture for the virus from samples of throat secretions, faeces, or CSF (cerebrospinal fluid: the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) is needed.
The incubation period is 3 to 5 days.

People with hand-foot-mouth disease are infectious as long as there is fluid in the blisters. The faeces can remain infectious for several weeks.

There is no specific treatment for EV71 infection. With severe infection, hospital admission is required to monitor for any complications involving the brain and heart.

Prevention
- Exclude people with hand-foot-mouth disease from childcare, preschool, school, and work until all blisters have dried;
- wash your hands properly and ensure children wash their hands properly;
- regularly clean environmental surfaces with detergent and warm water;
- cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue or your arm, not with your hand;
- dispose of used tissues immediately into a rubbish bin, then wash your hands. - Mod.UBA
