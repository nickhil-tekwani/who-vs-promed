A toxigenic strain of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ has been isolated from
a Nigerian child. The child lives in the UK but had been visiting Nigeria,
from which he returned to the UK on 27 August. He became ill 4-5 days later
with a febrile illness and was admitted to a hospital. On examination, his
throat was found inflamed and a swab was taken. _Corynebacterium
diphtheriae_ was isolated on Friday, 5 September, and confirmed as a
toxigenic strain on Sunday, 7 September.
Erythromycin was prescribed for all members of the child's family and
booster diptheria immunisation was administered where appropriate. Because
the index child had been fully immunised, this case raises the important
point that if diphtheria organisms are not specifically looked for by
appropriate culture, they may not be recognised. Doctors caring for persons
returning from areas of the world where diphtheria is actually or
potentially endemic should keep this diagnosis in mind.
[This report does not indicate the biotype; and while it does not state
that the index child was immediately given antitoxin, one assumes this was
done. -dp
