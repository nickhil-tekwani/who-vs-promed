Information on the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Bulgaria in
2011 [as of 5 Apr 2011]:

On Wed 5 Jan 2011, the Bulgarian authorities reported the
confirmation of a case of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in one of 3
wild boars shot on 30 Dec 2010 in the area of Makevtci, in Kosti
village, municipality of Malko Tarnovo, Burgas region, around 2 km
from the border with Turkey.

Bulgaria has implemented the measures provided for in Council
Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 Sep 2003 on Community Measures for the
Control of FMD. The measures provided in the directive include
epidemiological investigation, suspension of hunting and a ban on
feeding wild animals, placing under official surveillance holdings
keeping animals of susceptible species, inspection by an official
veterinarian of all wild animals shot or found dead, surveillance
programmes and prevention measures applicable to the holdings keeping
animals of susceptible species, and if necessary, their surroundings,
including the transport and movement of animals of susceptible species
within, from and to the area, etc.

The Bulgarian authorities established a protection zone of a 3km
radius and a surveillance zone of a 10km radius around Kosti and
launched a sero-epidemiological surveillance programme within the
surveillance zone and in all villages and settlements in the
municipalities of Sredets, Malko Tarnovo and Tsarevo.

As a result of the sero-epidemiological investigations, the Bulgarian
authorities on 9 Jan 2011 have detected antibody-positive cases also
in domestic animals and declared an outbreak in Kosti village, Tsarevo
municipality. According to EU legislation, the animals of susceptible
species on the outbreak holdings have been culled and buried.
[According to the EC reporting, the outbreak in Kosti was registered
as No 1; according to the OIE reporting system, this was outbreak 2,
while the case in the wild boar is regarded as outbreak No 1. In this
posting, the EU numbering is applied].

On 15 Jan 2011, mouth and feet lesions were found in cattle in Resovo
village, Tsarevo municipality, located 22km southeast of Kosti
village, and the presence of FMD was subsequently confirmed by
laboratory testing carried out on samples taken in that village.

Furthermore, on samples taken one incubation period of 21 days after
the 1st sampling from FMD-susceptible animals in the surveillance zone
around Kosti, FMD was confirmed on 31 Jan 2011 in Gramatikovo village,
Malko Tarnovo municipality, in previously antibody negative animals
[outbreak 3].

On 19 Mar 2011, Bulgaria reported a further outbreak (outbreak 4) in
the west part of Strandja Mountain (3 km from the closest village,
Kirovo) in the municipality of Sredets, in a herd of 143 beef cattle
on fenced grass; a larger number of animals displayed 4-5 days old
lesions, reacted positive in an agent identification test (PCR) and
negative in a test for the detection of antibodies.

On 23 Mar 2011, in the framework of routine clinical examinations,
clinical signs of FMD were observed in a bovine herd in one of the
villages in the 10km surveillance zone: Granichar, at a distance of 6
km from outbreak 4 in Sredets municipality. On 24 Mar 2011, the
National Reference Laboratory in Sofia confirmed the diagnosis
(outbreak 5).

On 25 Mar 2011, the Bulgarian authorities informed the commission
about the confirmation of further FMD outbreaks in domestic animals in
Sredets municipality on:

- a cattle holding located near Goliamo Bukowo village (outbreak 6);
- a cattle and pig holding located near Fakira village (outbreak 7);
- a cattle holding near Momina Tsarkva village (outbreak 8).

Moreover, on 3 Apr 2011, Bulgaria reported another outbreak (outbreak
9) in domestic animals on a holding in Bliznak village, Malko Tarnovo
municipality on:

- 8 backyard holdings in Bliznak village (outbreak 9);
- a holding located 2km from Bliznak village (outbreak 10).

All susceptible animals within 3km of the infected premises are being
culled, and those in the 3 to 10km circle have been tested.
