No new H7N9 avian influenza cases were reported in China today [20 Mar 2014], but testing for the virus showed positive results at a poultry farm and negative serology findings in Chinese veterinarians.

Since the H7N9 virus emerged last spring [2013], nearly all detections have been at live-poultry markets, though Chinese agriculture officials have done extensive testing at farms as well. The commercial farm that yielded the virus is located in the city of Zhuhai in southern Guangdong province, according to a report today [20 Mar 2014] from Xinhua, China's state news agency.

Provincial animal health authorities culled more than 80 000 chickens to control the spread of the virus. The farm -- Jinfeng Poultry Co. -- appears to be the same one that sourced a batch of H7-infected chickens found at a Macau poultry quarantine facility on 12 Mar 2014 [see item 2].

Meanwhile, a Chinese research team tested blood samples from veterinarians working in Guangdong province and found no evidence of H7N9 infection. The team reported its findings in an 18 Mar 2014 letter to the Journal of Clinical Virology [Han Zhou, Xinliang Fu, Lifang Wang et al. First Serologic Study for Influenza A (H7N9) Virus among Veterinarians in Guangdong, China. Article in Press, 20 Mar 2014].

Researchers collected single serum samples from veterinarians in 4 of the province's cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, and Zhuhai from February to August 2013. Antibody titers revealed that none of the doctors had evidence of previous H7N9 infection. A similar lack of H7N9 exposure was reported last May [2013] in serology tests of Chinese poultry workers.

The team said avian flu antibodies have been detected in veterinarians elsewhere and that an H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands resulted in the death of a veterinarian, and that the group might serve as a more sensitive sentinel.

They added that because viruses can rapidly change, it seems prudent to monitor high-risk groups such as veterinarians, poultry workers, and health workers.

The Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (IACM) and the Health Bureau (SSM) have announced that a sample taken yesterday [12 Mar 2014] from live chickens imported from the mainland has tested positive for the bird flu virus. IACM revealed that the sample was taken from birds coming from Doumen.

The Health Bureau released the news during a late night press conference held just after midnight last night [12 Mar 2014]. The authorities received the report at 10.30 p.m. yesterday [11 Mar 2014] and have implemented a contingency plan. They immediately sealed the floor of the local wholesale market that housed live poultry and have banned all live birds from leaving the market. All 7500 live chickens in the market have also been destroyed.

SSM stressed that none of the workers who were in contact with the poultry have displayed any flu-like symptoms. The authorities will assess the level of contact the workers had with the birds to determine whether they have to be monitored or isolated for 10 days. They will be given anti-viral drugs if necessary. Moreover, the government has decided to temporarily stop the import of live poultry for 21 days, which means that there will be no live birds supplied to local markets.

[While this report doesn't specify the type of "bird flu," a report in the Chinese-language Macau Daily News does say that it is an H7 virus].

[On 19 Mar 2014, the Macau Daily Times reported as follows:

"The Health Bureau (SSM) has revealed that all 53 people who are at risk of contracting H7 bird flu virus have remained clear of any flu symptoms. This includes the 5 people who are considered to have a higher risk of infection and are in medical isolation in Conde de Sao Januario Central Hospital (CHCSJ). Since 5:00 p.m. 2 days ago, the Bureau has received a further 2 cases who need to be tested for H7N9. Up until 7:00 p.m. last night [18 Mar 2014], all tests had come back negative. In the time between 2 nights ago and 6 p.m. last night, SSM received notifications from Hong Kong and Guangdong indicating that both places had one new confirmed H7N9 case. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 392, with at least 92 of the patients dying as a result" (http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/51574-briefs-poultry-workers-remain-symptom-free.html). - Mod.AS]

The H7N9 bird flu virus has been found in a poultry farm in the southern city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, the provincial agriculture department confirmed on Thursday [20 Mar 2014].

Samples from live chickens were collected from Zhuhai Jinfeng Poultry Co., Ltd. in Doumen district and tested positive for H7N9 by the provincial center for animal disease control, the department said. The department sent experts to the company and disposed of more than 80 000 live chickens. It also provided 5 tonnes of disinfectant.

The samples were then sent to the Ministry of Agriculture's national laboratory and tested positive again for the virus on Tuesday [18 Mar 2014?], according to a statement from the department.

Gong Guifen, secretary general of the China Poultry Industry Association under the China Animal Agriculture Association, said finding the H7N9 virus in a poultry farm may heavily impact the industry.

Since the H7N9 influenza outbreak in March 2013, the country's poultry industry has suffered losses worth more than 40 billion yuan [USD 6.7 billion] after the closure of poultry markets.

[Zhuhai is a prefecture-level city on the southern coast of Guandong province, bordering Macau (a Special Administrative Region -- SAR -- of the People's Republic of China). The veterinary requirements applied by both Macau and by China's other SAR, namely Hong Kong, to prevent the introduction of A/H7N9 from China's province they both border -- Guangdong -- have led to the initiated surveillance activities undertaken in exporting poultry farms prior to export, and to the additional tests undertaken in farms of origin following the discovery of infected birds upon arrival.

On top of the detection of infection in imported (from the mainland) birds in Hong Kong and Macau, the recent surveillance effort on farms in Zhuhai may have also been boosted by the occurrence of a fatal human A/H7N9 case in Zhuhai, as described in WHO's update of 5 Mar 2014 (see 20140306.2317826):

"On [4 Mar 2014], the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

The patient is a 59-year-old man from Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on [26 Feb 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [1 Mar 2014] and died on [2 Mar 2014]. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

The Chinese government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment; and
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information."

It will be interesting to note when and where the victim was exposed to "live poultry," in particular whether this refers to agricultural holding(s).

Subscribers interested in China's H7N9 surveillance on live poultry markets and farms are referred to the following links to periodic reports (in Chinese) by the Ministry of Agriculture since the beginning of 2014.

Since the start of the LPAI H7N9 event, reportedly in April 2013, 35 "outbreaks" in animals have been reported by China to the OIE; their summary, with an interactive map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225. The most recent follow-up report, No. 14, submitted on 7 Mar 2014, included 3 outbreaks, of which one was on an Agriculture Products Market in Doumen, Zhuhai, where 3 chickens were found positive (see 20140309.2323017). An update, reporting the current event on a poultry breeding farm in the city of Zhuhan, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
