A black-headed gull and a peregrine falcon [have] tested positive for H5N1 virus in Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said today [12 Mar 2012] that the carcasses of a black-headed gull and a peregrine falcon found in Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan in early March [2012] were confirmed to be H5N1-positive after a series of laboratory tests.

The black-headed gull was collected at Castle Peak Power Station Plant B, Tuen Mun, on 2 Mar 2012, while the peregrine falcon was found at Kam Kwai House, Kam Fung Court, Ma On Shan, on 3 Mar 2012.

The black-headed gull is a common winter visitor to Hong Kong, while the peregrine falcon is a rare winter visitor.

The AFCD will continue to conduct inspections of poultry farms to ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been implemented.

The spokesman reminded people to observe good personal hygiene. "They should avoid personal contact with wild birds or live poultry and clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said.

[Although the dates and exact locations of the findings do not match, the 2 species are the same as those found dead in Hong Kong in January 2012, which had tested positive to H5 virus, pending further confirmation [see ProMED-mail 20120202.1029495]. H5N1 outbreaks involving poultry and wild birds in Hong Kong have been occurring since December 2011.

The peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae (see photo at http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/PHOTO/LARGE/MJH_040302_00123Z_L.jpg).

In the region, it is usually a breeding resident, but it is not commonly seen in Hong Kong during the winter. Wintering falcons, however, might move over large regions. The black-headed gull (_Chroicocephalus[=Larus] ridibundus_) is a small gull which breeds in much of Europe and Asia, and also in coastal eastern Canada (see photo at http://www.rosscarbery.ie/userfiles/Black%20headed%20gull.jpg). Most of the population is migratory, wintering further south, but some birds in the milder westernmost areas of Europe are resident.

Because falcons and gulls are very susceptible to H5N1, it is very unlikely that they can carry the virus long distances through migration/movement. Both species reported here were found dead from H5N1 in the past.
