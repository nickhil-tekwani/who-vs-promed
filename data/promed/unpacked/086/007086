As countries in Africa, the Americas, and Europe battle fresh COVID surges, a rise in delta SARS-CoV-2 variant cases in Israel -- known for its strong vaccine rollout and COVID measures -- is raising new alarm bells.

World Health Organization (WHO) officials have characterized a "2-track" pandemic, made up of higher-income countries driving down cases as vaccination efforts gain tractions, contrasted with others struggling with new or ongoing surges, due to a host of factors, including scarce vaccine, more transmissible variants, and social mixing. And yesterday [21 Jun 2021], WHO officials warned that a steady global decline is slowing down, with some countries across all regions grappling with surges.

In its weekly health emergencies report, the WHO's African regional office said today [22 Jun 2021] that Africa's cases last week rose for the 6th week in a row and were up 31% compared to the week before. A 3rd surge underway in South Africa made up more than 58% of cases, but officials said high case numbers there and in Eritrea, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda, and Zambia are concerning. They also said health worker infections continue to rise in many countries. Deaths also rose last week.

Factors fueling the rise include poor adherence to distancing measures, cooler weather in southern Africa, and the spread of more transmissible variants, according to the WHO. So far, the delta (B1617.2) variant has been detected in 14 African countries. Though the region is making progress with vaccination, the global supply imbalance is still serious, with only 1% of the population immunized against COVID-19.

As more transmissible variants keep all countries on edge, Israel yesterday [21 Jun 2021] reported 125 cases after seeing numbers plummet to the single digits earlier this month, according to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-sees-highest-covid-daily-infections-in-two-months-as-delta-variant-spreads-1.9928700).

The head of the country's health ministry said 70% of cases involve the delta variant, and that half of those are children, and that one-third of those cases are vaccinated. The illnesses are stemming from several local outbreaks, including one involving staff at a school.

More global headlines
- Amid a surge in Russia with Moscow as the country's hot spot, city officials added new restrictions that restrict bars and restaurants to people who have been vaccinated or have had previous infections, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-moscow/moscow-restricts-visits-to-bars-restaurants-to-curb-covid-19-wave-idUSKCN2DY1BE). Also, amid worries about slow vaccine uptake, the Kremlin warned that unvaccinated people and those without immunity from natural infection will face limited employment options, due to the threat they pose to other people.

- In the Philippines, another country struggling with lukewarm vaccine uptake, President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised address yesterday [21 Jun 2021] that those who refuse to be immunized may face jail time (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-duterte-threatens-those-who-refuse-covid-19-vaccine-with-jail-2021-06-21/).

- China signaled today [22 Jun 2021] that it will keep its border restrictions for another year, due to worries over more transmissible variants, the Wall Street Journal reports (https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-keep-covid-19-border-restrictions-for-another-year-11624361777?mod= latest_ headlines).

- The global total has climbed to 178 770 932 cases, with at least 3 872 909 deaths, according to the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html).

[Cases continue to surge because of low vaccination rates in many locations, together with the spread of the d variant, which is reportedly 60% more transmissible. In Israel, 70% of cases involve the delta variant, with half of those cases being children, and most concerning, one-third of those cases are vaccinated. This gives further support to the variant being able to escape neutralization from vaccine-induced antibody. - Mod.LK]

[2] Delta plus variant

Even as nations rush to vaccinate large chunks of the population as they race against coronavirus, a new variant of the virus called Delta plus has come under the global watch. Even as they kept their guard up against the highly transmissible delta variant, first found in India, at least 9 countries have started reporting cases of the mutated delta plus variant strain. These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China, and Russia.

The delta plus variant is also called B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 strain. Of the details emerging about the delta plus variant, the most noticeable one is the fact that the new strain is resistant to the monoclonal antibodies cocktail.

India on Tuesday [22 Jun 2021] said it has at least 22 cases of the delta plus variant, which the government has classified as a variant of interest so far. The strain from which it has mutated from delta has been listed as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).

[The variant B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 is characterized by the acquisition of K417N mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. While it is being reported that the delta plus variant is resistant to monoclonal antibodies used as a therapeutic, casirivimab and imdevimab, more data from experimental studies are needed to confirm this. Blood from immunized individuals and patients who recovered from infection need to be tested to determine if the antibody is effective at neutralizing the virus.

[3] Chinese vaccines
Date: Tue 22 Jun 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/business/economy/china-vaccines-covid-outbreak.html


Mongolia promised its people a "COVID-free summer." Bahrain said there would be a "return to normal life." The tiny island nation of the Seychelles aimed to jump-start its economy. All 3 put their faith, at least in part, in easily accessible Chinese-made vaccines, which would allow them to roll out ambitious inoculation programs when much of the world was going without.

But instead of freedom from the coronavirus, all 3 countries are now battling a surge in infections. China kicked off its vaccine diplomacy campaign last year [2020] by pledging to provide a shot that would be safe and effective at preventing severe cases of COVID-19. Less certain at the time was how successful it and other vaccines would be at curbing transmission.

Now, examples from several countries suggest that the Chinese vaccines may not be very effective at preventing the spread of the virus, particularly the new variants. The experiences of those countries lay bare a harsh reality facing a postpandemic world: The degree of recovery may depend on which vaccines governments give to their people.

In the Seychelles, Chile, Bahrain and Mongolia, 50% to 68% of the populations have been fully inoculated, outpacing the United States, according to Our World in Data, a data tracking project. All 4 ranked among the top 10 countries with the worst COVID outbreaks as recently as last week, according to data from The New York Times. And all 4 are mostly using shots made by 2 Chinese vaccine makers, Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech.

"If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern," said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. "The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this."

Scientists don't know for certain why some countries with relatively high inoculation rates are suffering new outbreaks. Variants, social controls that are eased too quickly and careless behavior after only the 1st of a 2-shot regimen are possibilities. But the breakthrough infections could have lasting consequences.

In the United States, about 45% of the population is fully vaccinated, mostly with doses made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Cases have dropped 94% over 6 months.

Israel provided shots from Pfizer and has the 2nd-highest vaccination rate in the world, after the Seychelles. The number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per million in Israel is now around 4.95. In the Seychelles, which relied mostly on Sinopharm, that number is more than 716 cases per million.

Disparities such as these could create a world in which 3 types of countries emerge from the pandemic -- the wealthy nations that used their resources to secure Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, the poorer countries that are far away from immunizing a majority of citizens, and then those that are fully inoculated but only partly protected.

China, as well as the more than 90 nations that have received the Chinese shots, may end up in the 3rd group, contending with rolling lockdowns, testing and limits on day-to-day life for months or years to come. Economies could remain held back. And as more citizens question the efficacy of Chinese doses, persuading unvaccinated people to line up for shots may also become more difficult.

One month after receiving his 2nd dose of Sinopharm, [OB] fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19. [OB], a 31-year-old miner, spent 9 days in a hospital in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. He said he was now questioning the usefulness of the shot. "People were convinced that if we were vaccinated, the summer will be free of COVID," he said. "Now it turns out that it's not true."

Beijing saw its vaccine diplomacy as an opportunity to emerge from the pandemic as a more influential global power. China's top leader, Xi Jinping, pledged to deliver a Chinese shot that could be easily stored and transported to millions of people around the world. He called it a "global public good."

In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry said it did not see a link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines. It cited the World Health Organization as saying that vaccination rates in certain countries had not reached sufficient levels to prevent outbreaks, and that countries needed to continue to maintain controls.

"Relevant reports and data also show that many countries that use Chinese-made vaccines have expressed that they are safe and reliable and have played a good role in their epidemic prevention efforts," the ministry said. China has also emphasized that its vaccines target severe disease rather than transmission.

No vaccine fully prevents transmission, and people can still fall ill after being inoculated, but the relatively low efficacy rates of Chinese shots have been identified as a possible cause of the recent outbreaks. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of more than 90%. A variety of other vaccines -- including AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson -- have efficacy rates of around 70%. The Sinopharm vaccine developed with the Beijing Institute of Biological Products has an efficacy rate of 78.1%; the Sinovac vaccine has an efficacy rate of 51%.

The Chinese companies have not released much clinical data to show how their vaccines work at preventing transmission. On Monday [21 Jun 2021], Shao Yiming, an epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China needed to fully vaccinate 80% to 85% of its population to achieve herd immunity, revising a previous official estimate of 70%.

Data on breakthrough infections has not been made available, either, though a Sinovac study out of Chile showed that the vaccine was less effective than those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at preventing infection among vaccinated individuals.

A representative from Sinopharm hung up the phone when reached for comment. Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment.

William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University, said the efficacy rates of Chinese shots could be low enough "to sustain some transmission, as well as create illness of a substantial amount in the highly vaccinated population, even though it keeps people largely out of the hospital."

Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in Australia, said that with all of the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume the Sinopharm vaccine had minimal effect on curbing transmission. A major risk with the Chinese inoculation is that vaccinated people may have few or no symptoms and still spread the virus to others, he said. "I think that this complexity has been lost on most decision makers around the world."

In Indonesia, where a new variant is spreading, more than 350 doctors and healthcare workers recently came down with COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated with Sinovac, according to the risk mitigation team of the Indonesian Medical Association. Across the country, 61 doctors died between February and 7 Jun 2021. Ten of them had taken the Chinese-made vaccine, the association said.

The numbers were enough to make Kenneth Mak, Singapore's director of medical services, question the use of Sinovac. "It's not a problem associated with Pfizer," Mr. Mak said at a news conference on Friday [18 Jun 2021]. "This is actually a problem associated with the Sinovac vaccine."

Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first 2 countries to approve the Sinopharm shot, even before late-stage clinical trial data [were] released. Since then, there have been extensive reports of vaccinated people falling ill in both countries. In a statement, the Bahraini government's media office said the kingdom's vaccine rollout had been "efficient and successful to date."

Still, last month [May 2021] officials from Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates announced that they would offer a 3rd booster shot. The choices: Pfizer or more Sinopharm.
