Suspected avian influenza in Chile
----------------------------------
This report, dated 29 May 2002, was received on 30 May 2002 from Dr Hernan
Rojas Olavarria, head of the Livestock Protection Department, Agriculture
and Livestock Service (SAG), Ministry of Agriculture, Santiago.
SAG has detected a higher than normal mortality rate among hens in a
breeding hen farm in the Province of San Antonio, Fifth Region (Valparaiso).
The sanitary measures provided for in such cases were immediately adopted,
with the breeding farm in question being placed under quarantine, control
of movements, and biosafety measures. A sanitary control zone was
established within a 10 km radius of the breeding farm and the national
animal health emergency system was activated.
The relevant epidemiological investigations are being carried out and
samples taken from hens from the breeding unit have been sent to the SAG
Central Laboratory in Santiago and to international reference laboratories.
The preliminary results from the SAG Central Laboratory provide serological
evidence of avian influenza using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and
agar gel immunodiffusion.
Note: No positive serology of avian influenza has ever been detected in
Chile. Between Jan 2000 and now, more than 70 000 serological tests have
been carried out, with negative results.
Further details will be published in the next issue of OIE's Weekly Disease
Information, available on line as from Fri 31 May 2002 afternoon (GMT).
