Mosquito-borne chikungunya is spreading fast in the capital Dhaka with intermittent rains. The government's disease monitoring arm, IEDCR [Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control & Research], has asked people to be aware of the viral infection that has some similarities with dengue fever caused by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

[SHS] has been struggling to bring his fever down. A doctor by training, he could not figure out why his fever persisted as high as 104 deg F [40 deg C] despite taking medication. He ended up in a hospital that sent his blood sample to the IEDCR. He was diagnosed with chikungunya [virus infection].

Speaking to bdnews24.com on [Tue 16 May 2017], 11 days after he first noticed his fever, [SHS] said the symptoms were so bizarre that he could not walk due to pain in the joints. "Now I can walk, but still I feel some pain," he said. IEDCR Senior Scientific Officer Dr ASM Alamgir told bdnews24.com that chikungunya is spreading in the capital with sporadic rains.

He would not say how many patients they have recorded so far since he said the actual magnitude is much higher than the figure they get. "We do not get all the samples for testing. Even if any sample is sent 5 days after the fever, we do not test that because that can give a false negative result," he explained.

"But 1 person getting fever in a family of 4 means 3 other members can be infected. Mosquito can rapidly transmit the virus from one person to another. So the key is to use mosquito nets whenever you go to bed even in daytime."

Both dengue and chikungunya show some common symptoms such as fever, pain. "But in chikungunya the pain is so severe that people cannot move. It involves all the joints," Dr Alamgir said. It can be misdiagnosed, but neither of them has a specific treatment. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms only. Paracetamol is the drug of choice for relieving both fever and pain. There is no need to wait for testing, experts say.

General awareness is important as the _Aedes_ mosquito usually breeds in a small collection of clean water in and around houses, such as inside a flower vase. Intermittent rains cause a proliferation of the breeding when water accumulates in different containers around houses. IEDCR advises removal of all open containers with stagnant water in and around the houses on a regular basis -- flower plates and pots, used tires, tree holes, and rock pools.

[SHS], who lives in a new, luxurious flat in Dhanmondi [Dhaka], said he has already identified the source of the mosquito breeding inside their building. "It's a new building. Many apartments are empty. There are some fountains which are not well maintained so water remains stagnant there. Mosquito breeds there," he said.

The IEDCR advises patients to take rest under bed-nets, preferably permethrin-impregnated nets. "We have to educate the patient and other members in the household about the risk of transmission to others and the ways to minimise the risk," Dr Alamgir said.

The name 'chikungunya' came from the word 'Makonde' meaning bending up, referring to the posture developed as a result of the arthritic symptoms of the disease.

It was first identified in 1953 in Tanzania. India reported an epidemic in 1964. Bangladesh found the 1st case in 2008 in northern Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj districts. In Dhaka, IEDCR noticed the presence of the disease later in 2011.

[Chikungunya virus is transmitted to people by mosquitoes. The most common symptoms of chikungunya virus infection are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Outbreaks have occurred in countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In late 2013, chikungunya virus was found for the 1st time in the Americas on islands in the Caribbean. There is a risk that the virus will be imported to new areas by infected travelers. There is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya virus infection (https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/index.html).

Laboratory diagnosis of chikungunya infection is generally accomplished by testing serum or plasma to detect virus, viral nucleic acid, or virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and neutralizing antibodies. Viral culture may detect virus in the 1st 3 days of illness; however, chikungunya virus should be handled under biosafety level (BSL) 3 conditions.

During the 1st 8 days of illness, chikungunya viral RNA can often be identified in serum through PCR, which is confirmatory. Chikungunya virus antibodies normally develop toward the end of the 1st week of illness. Therefore, to definitively rule out the diagnosis, convalescent-phase samples should be obtained from patients whose acute-phase samples test negative (https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/hc/diagnostic.html).

The report above mentions that samples are not tested if obtained after 5 days of fever onset as they may give a 'false negative'; however the report does not mention the diagnostic test involved which in case of serological assay may remain inconclusive when carried out before 8 days. - Mod.UBA
