There have been 5 more outbreaks (4 in Alpuente, Valencia and one in nearby
village of Talayuelas, Cuenca). Both locations are about 45 miles north
west of Valencia. The new outbreaks bring the total to 20 since 14 Jun 2001.
The epidemic began on 14 Jun 2001 on a farm near Lerida, North-East Spain.
The new outbreaks have resulted in the destruction of another 14 000 pigs
on 13 farms in Valencia, and another 800 pigs in Cuenca.
The situation in Valencia is serious - there are about 40 pig farms close
by, in addition to 7 large integrated swine production companies units
nearby, and related farms spread all over the regions of Valencia and
Castellon. In Valencia 70 percent of the 2300 farms are owned by large
integrated production companies.
The Spanish pig industry has been the fastest growing in Europe in recent
years, with 22.5 million swine, located mainly in Catalunia, Aragon,
Murcia, Navarra, Castilla y La Mancha and Castilla y Leon.
Castilla y Leon is an important exporter of growing pigs to Catalunia. A
national ban on movement of pigs was introduced on 11 Jul 2001 in an
attempt to halt spread of the swine fever outbreaks that began in the
Catalonia region (near Barcelona). Pigs going directly to slaughterhouses
are exempt from the ban. The ban extends the ban already in place in
eastern Spain.
