First case of avian flu H5N1 in humans detected in Spain, the 2nd in all of Europe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a worker at a poultry farm in Fontanar, a municipality in Guadalajara, according to sources from the Ministry of Health of Castille-La Mancha. The worker "has always been asymptomatic."

In January 2022, the 1st case in Europe was detected, a 79-year-old man resident of the town of Buckfastleigh (England).

The official confirmation occurred last Tuesday, 27 Sep 2022, and was declared to the Center for the Coordination of Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES), the WHO, and the ECDC (European Center for the Prevention and Disease Control). According to this study, there have been 2467 outbreaks in poultry, 48 million birds slaughtered in affected establishments, 187 detections in captive birds, and 3573 events of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds. The report warns that the geographical extension of the outbreak is "unprecedented" since it has reached from the Svalbard Islands to the south of Portugal and east to Ukraine, affecting 37 European countries. Now, after the detection of a 2nd case in humans, concern is increasing.

Transmission of bird flu from birds to humans is rare but possible. Clinical signs of the disease in humans include the rapid onset of flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, headache, sore throat, dry cough), as well as frequent watery diarrhea and progression to severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure.

Globally, from 2003 to early 2022, 864 cases of human infection with influenza A (H5N1) virus have been reported in 19 countries. Of these 864 cases, 456 were fatal, showing a case fatality rate of 53%. Difficult human-to-human transmission infection usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered low, though not zero. At this time, the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) virus does not spread efficiently from person to person, so transmission is limited, sustained, and rare.

[ProMED has published approximately 138 notifications on human cases of Avian influenza (H5N1) throughout the years. In addition to the See Also posts below, the following posts may be of interest:
-Avian influenza, human: Europe (UK) H5N1 20220107.8700700
-Avian influenza, human (15): India (HR) H5N1, confirmed, WHO 20210819.8601971

-Avian influenza, human (09): Nepal (BK) H5N1, update 20190514.6466304

Given the unprecedented scale of H5N1 outbreaks (and the millions of wild and farmed birds involved) across the globe just this year, the relatively small number of human cases supports just how difficult it is for the virus to jump to humans (at present). It also reinforces that the various protective measures that have been utilized to safeguard farm workers, veterinarians, etc. during the initial testing/confirmation and subsequent depopulation of the affected farms have generally worked well. With several of the recent cases reported as asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic it would be useful to understand the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 in these same groups of people to get a more robust picture on transmissibility from birds to people, and across the larger public as well given the number of cases in waterfowl.

Additional commentary on H5N1 situation in animals in the region
---------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the outbreaks declared in the 2021-22 season, from 1 Jul 2021 to 30 Jun 2022, a total of 52 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were detected in wild birds (except 3 cases in which the subtype N could not be determined). These outbreaks were in the autonomous communities de Andalusia, Aragon, Castile and Leon, Catalonia, Extremadura, Madrid, Navarra, and Basque Country. In addition, 2 outbreaks were confirmed in captive birds, in Andalusia and Basque Country.

In relation to domestic birds, during the same period, a total of 31 outbreaks were declared, affecting Andalusia and Castile and Leon.

From the beginning of the current 2022-23 season, from 1 Jul to 29 Sep 2022, 5 outbreaks have been confirmed in poultry, 33 outbreaks in wild birds, and 1 outbreak in captive birds. The outbreaks in wild birds are in Huelva, Cadiz, Sevilla, Badajoz, Cáceres, Toledo, Guadalajara, Ciudad Real, Guipúzcoa, Viscaya, Madrid, Pontevedra, A Coruña, Cantabria, Barcelona, and La Rioja. The cases in poultry have been detected in Huelva (2), in Badajoz (1), and 2 in Guadalajara.

Even though infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, clade 2.3.4.4b of the Eurasian H5 viral lineage has been found able to infect mammals of phylogenetically distant orders, namely, Carnivora (seal, fox, raccoon, and skunk), Cetacea (dolphin, porpoise), and Primata (human). It is noteworthy that the ability to infect does not imply host competence. So far, mammals act as accidental hosts and do not sustain transmission within their populations. However, as influenza A viruses can evolve in all known manners, a major concern is that a reassortant adapts to a new type of host species. - Mod.PMB
