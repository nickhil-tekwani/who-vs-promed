Democratic Republic of Congo has confirmed 2 cases of Ebola in the northwestern town of Bikoro [Equateur province] and at least 10 more cases are suspected, the head of the national institute for biological research, Jean Jack Muyembe, said on [Tue 8 May 2018].

A source at the ministry of health also said 2 cases had been confirmed and added that there would be an official announcement about it later in the day.

It is the 9th time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC, whose eastern Ebola river gave the deadly virus its name when it was discovered there in the 1970s.

The latest incidence of the disease comes less than a year after the central African country's last outbreak, in which 8 people were infected of whom 4 died.

Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying, as it infects other animals it shares trees with such as monkeys. It often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat.

Congo's vast, remote geography gives it an advantage, as outbreaks are often localised and relatively easy to isolate.

In West Africa, an Ebola outbreak that ended 2 years ago killed more than 11 300 people and infected some 28 600 as it rolled through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia before finally being contained.

[This is an early report and there is no information on the strain of Ebola virus, clinical and epidemiological features of the cases, nor the mortality rate. We look forward to learning whether the current cases in the DRC stem from direct contact with an index case, and what measures are being taken to control spread.

Ebola virus was first identified in human populations in 1976 when it caused 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in Zaire (now DRC) and Sudan (now South Sudan). The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an infected human or other animals. EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports a total of 24 outbreaks involving 1716 cases. The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa, which occurred from December 2013 to January 2016, with 28 616 cases and 11 310 deaths.

The DRC has experienced 8 previous outbreaks, thus has the expertise to bring the chains of transmission from human to human quickly under control. It is now well known that it is critical to control to implement rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. - Mod.LK
