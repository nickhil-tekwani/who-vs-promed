An outbreak of bird flu has been discovered today (17 Jan 2015) on a turkey farm in the village Aviel, near Pardes Hanna [Haifa district]. Ministry of Agriculture's [MOA] officials arrived at the scene and ordered the destruction of 100 000 turkeys. The decision was made after the ministry experts affirmed the disease. The infected holding is located in an isolated area within the village; culling has already become operational. It is being carried out by the dispersion of a special foam which brings about immediate death of the birds which are subsequently buried on spot. The Ministry made known that the undertaken activities are in accordance with the international requirements prevailing in Western countries. Tests are being carried out in poultry farms within 3 km [about 2 mile] radius from the affected coop. It is anticipated that 2 additional (smaller) units within the said radius will have to be culled.

MOA is still unclear how the virus reached the coop; and the matter is under investigation.

[The current event is located in Haifa district; map at http://tinyurl.com/q8z5pb9.

According to the website "PoultryMed", the causative agent of this outbreak has been designated H5N1 (http://tinyurl.com/n4d7yg6 [in Hebrew]). Official confirmation will be appreciated.

Israel is situated on major bird migration routes; see an interactive map at http://www.flywaysmusic.org/the-birds/interactive-map/. Previous Israeli HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were assumed to be contracted from wild birds.

The application of foam for the mass destruction of the infected flock has been introduced in Israel in view of public disfavor of the application of gas for euthanasia. - Mod.AS
