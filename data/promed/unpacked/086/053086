The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry said on Tuesday [12 Mar 2013] that it has confirmed 3 more cases of infection with a tickborne virus, bringing the number of victims of the viral infection in the country to 8. The 3 patients were infected with the virus, which causes severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS] between 2005 and 2012, but have since recovered, according to the Ministry.

Of them, a woman in her 80s in Kochi Prefecture developed the disease in April 2012. A man in his 80s in Saga Prefecture and a man in his 50s in neighboring Nagasaki Prefecture [died] in August 2010 and November 2005, respectively.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[ProMED-mail thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for tracing these records of the 8 recent cases of severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) described in Japan, a disease initially characterised in China and associated with a novel phlebovirus (family _Bunyaviridae_) believed to be transmitted by ticks. (For further details see Hongbin Chen, Ke Hu, Jinjing Zou, Jinxiu Xiao. A cluster of cases of human-to-human transmission caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus. Int J Infect Dis. 2013 Mar; 17(3): e206-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2012.11.006. Epub 2012 Dec 6; available at http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(12)01298-2/fulltext.)

The 8 Japanese cases have occurred in several prefectures and appear to be unrelated. None of the patients is believed to have travelled abroad. At least 2 of the 8 cases had a fatal outcome, and one case had a record of tick bite.

Further information about these cases, and any similar cases elsewhere in the world would be appreciated.
