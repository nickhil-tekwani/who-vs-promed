Trichinellosis, Berrotaran, Argentina: alert
--------------------------------------------
The Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health of Cordoba, has reported an outbreak of trichinellosis, and warned of the risk of eating or buying pork meat of suspect provenance or without the relevant health inspection.

To date, 13 people have been treated for trichinellosis at the Municipal Hospital "Dr Rene Geronimo Favaloro" and at the "Clinica Privada Sur" in the city of Berrotaran and at the "Dr Guillermo Golesbery Rawson" hospital in the city of Cordoba.

All patients reported consumption of products made with pork bought in a shop in the same locality.

The relevant investigation and controls are being conducted by the Municipality of Berrotaran, the audit department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, the National Food Safety and Quality Service (SENASA), and the Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health Cordoba.

Trichinellosis is a disease transmitted by eating raw or undercooked pork contaminated with the parasite _Trichinella spiralis_. Clinical manifestations are variable and may present as an inadvertent infection or have symptoms that generally begin with fever, severe muscle pain, headache, and pain and swelling around the eyes. Gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting and diarrhea may also occur.

Outbreaks of the disease occur mostly during the period of low temperatures when freezers are not required to preserve food. The risks are greater when the meat comes from illegal slaughterhouses or home slaughter, which may not follow the necessary hygiene and health regulations.

Recommendations to prevent this disease:
 do not consume or permit the consumption of raw meats and homemade sausages that have not been previously inspected.
 check the tag or manufacturing label of all pork products being acquired; they should clearly state the product brand; company responsible; number of national registry of the establishment; date of manufacture and expiration of the product; maintenance conditions regarding environmental temperature; and a label with the composition of the product.
 do not consume choripan [chorizo sandwich] from unauthorized vendors.

It must be remembered that:
 salting or smoking meats is not enough to destroy parasites.
 marketing of meat or meat products from non-licensed premises is prohibited, as is the purchase and sale of food from unauthorized street vendors.

[ProMED-mail has reported regularly on outbreaks of trichinellosis in the northern provinces of Argentina, and in Cordoba in particular. The core of the problem is that pigs slaughtered for consumption are not inspected for trichinellosis. The infection is passed to pigs by feeding offal and waste, for instance kitchen waste. The best prevention is to avoid buying homemade sausages and other meat products, which have not been cooked or fried at markets in Argentina. - Mod.EP
