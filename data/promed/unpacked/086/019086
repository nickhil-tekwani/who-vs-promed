The Department of Epidemiology of the Secretary of State of Health
announced today that laboratory tests conducted at the Mineiro Institute of
Agro-forestry (IMA) on 3 May 2002 have confirmed the death of a man due to
rabies. The affected man was 50 years old and lived in Curvelo. He died on
2 May 2002, in Belo Horizonte. He was the proprietor of a farm in Corinto,
where he contracted the disease from the bite of a bat. Further
investigation is under way.
The last cases of human rabies registered in Minas Gerais occurred in 1999,
when there were 4 deaths.
