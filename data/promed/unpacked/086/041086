The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate a new virus which has been linked to the death of a Kansas resident during the summer of 2014. Although the host of this new virus, called Bourbon virus, is unknown at this time, it is thought to be transmitted through the bites of ticks or other insects. Symptoms in the Kansas resident resembled other tickborne diseases, including fever and fatigue.

This is the 1st known case of Bourbon virus [infection], which has been named after Bourbon County, where the patient had lived. Because of the patient's symptoms and changes in blood counts, it was believed that the resident had a tickborne illness, such as ehrlichiosis or Heartland virus disease. However, specimens taken from the resident tested negative for known tickborne diseases, and after further investigation, it was determined to be a new, never before seen virus. It is not known whether Bourbon virus was the cause of death or how much it contributed to the resident's death.

CDC, KDHE, and the clinical team are working to learn more about this new virus. The patient's case history has been reviewed, and there are plans to test other residents with similar symptoms who have tested negative for Heartland virus in the last year for this novel virus. CDC has developed blood tests that can be used to identify and confirm recent Bourbon virus infections. Finally, investigations are ongoing to explore how people are getting infected with the virus, including plans to collect and test ticks and other insects for the new virus.

There is no known specific treatment, vaccine, or drug for Bourbon virus disease. Since Bourbon virus disease is thought to be transmitted through tick or insect bites, risk to the public during the winter months is minimal.

[According to Dr Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at University of Kansas Hospital, this newly identified virus is an Orthomyxovirus [a multisegmented enveloped RNA virus] similar to viruses found in eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, but no virus like it has been identified in the western hemisphere... (See The Independent, Tues 23 Dec 2104, by Andrew Griffin http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/bourbon-virus-researchers-discover-mystery-tickborne-deadly-virus-9942584.html.) Its uniqueness in the western hemisphere signifies that it may predate the formation of the Atlantic Ocean (Kansas is too far inland for ticks of migratory seabirds, and they wouldn't bite people!).

It should be noted, however, that Johnston Atoll virus is an orthomyxovirus from a noddy tern tick in the Hawaiian Islands of the central Pacific at 170 degrees west, therefore just within the western hemisphere. Other tickborne orthmyxoviruses include Quaranfil virus and Lake Chad virus, among others. See: Presti RM, et al. J Virol. 2009. - Mods.LK/JW
