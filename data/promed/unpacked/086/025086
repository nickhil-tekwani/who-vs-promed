The Hong Kong Standard reported yesterday that Dr. Daniel Lavanchy of the
WHO influenza surveillance program said that the H5N1 flu virus, which has
produced only one human case, could have infected others who did not show
symptoms of disease. Lavanchy announced that a new test for analyzing
antibodies to the virus is now being developed and may be ready in 2 months
or so.
In the meanwhile, laboratories at the Agriculture and Fisheries Department
and Hong Kong University Department of Microbiology are testing samples
(2100 samples have been collected thus far) from chickens and pigs to see
if the virus is still around and if chickens with the virus have developed
antibodies.
Prof. Ken Shortridge from HKU said that because pigs have receptors that
can accommodate both human viruses and bird viruses in their tracheas, and
because bird viruses need a human gene to sucessfully infect a human, pigs
are suspected to be involved in transmission of the virus from bird to man.
Shortridge's hypothesis is that if there were a human virus already present
in a pig when a bird virus came along, "both viruses could infect the same
cell and the virus could rearrange itself genetically to infect humans."
