In Chiquimula, an outbreak of malaria has been reported. 200 cases

fever, nausea and dizziness. According to Raul Espina Ruana, Director
of the Public Health Center, the villages affected by this disease
are: Santa Barbara, Colonia El Maestro, the hamlet of El Jurgallon,
and the colonias Lomas, among others.

Health employees sprayed houses, courtyards and places where there
