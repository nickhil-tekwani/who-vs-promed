The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs said Sunday [3 Feb
2008] that bird flu was detected in Yorukler town in the Black Sea
province of Samsun. The virus was detected upon examination of samples
taken from poultry belonging to a local villager, the ministry said in
a written statement. "Laboratories of our ministry detected bird flu
in the samples. We have determined that the wild waterfowl in the
region are the source of the disease," the ministry said.

The ministry also said that the disease affected only a small area
and officials have taken all the necessary measures to halt the
spread of bird flu in the region.

Experts say Turkey, being on the route of migrating birds, is under
the threat of bird flu because of wildlife. The 1st bird flu case in
Turkey was detected in Bandirma town in 2005.

Turkey detected bird flu virus in dead chickens found late last month
[January 2008] in the northern part of the country after it had
started culling poultry due to bird flu suspicions, the Agriculture
Ministry said on Sunday [3 Feb 2008].

The culling was sparked after residents reported chicken deaths in a
district in the Samsun province in the northern Black Sea region.
"Bird flu disease was detected in the samples after examinations in
our ministry's laboratories," a statement from the ministry said. It
did not say whether the virus was the deadly H5N1 strain. The
statement said it was informed about the dead chickens on 28 Jan 2008
in Samsun province, on the Black Sea coast, and that studies showed
the virus was transmitted to farm chickens from wild birds. "In a
limited area covering farms of 8 families, 37 birds were culled for
prevention and culling has ended. There is nothing to worry about the
situation as all measures have been taken on this disease which was
detected in a very small area," the statement said. The area where
the virus was spotted remains under quarantine, it added.

Last month [January 2008], Turkey culled nearly 600 poultry in
villages in Zonguldak, another province on the Black Sea coast, after
an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was identified.

Turkey lies on the migratory route for wild birds flying south from
Scandinavia and Siberia to north Africa for winter.

in 2006, 4 people in eastern Turkey died from bird flu after they came
into contact with sick birds. An outbreak of bird flu in the winter of
2006 hit Turkey's tourism industry and seriously damaged the poultry
sector.

With a ban imposed on the import of poultry and poultry products from
outside [Manipur] state in view of the bird flu outbreak in West
Bengal, the Patsoi police today [3 Feb 2008] seized altogether 6120
chicks, which were being brought in from Assam along NH-53 this
afternoon.

According to reports, the chicks were meant to be delivered to a
named individual who runs a chicken meat shop at Kwakeithel bazar.
The chicks, packed in 120 baskets, were brought in from Assam, via
Jiribam on a Tata truck [which] was caught by the Patsoi police at
around 12:35 pm this afternoon [3 Feb 2008] at Keithelmanbi, on
NH-53. The entire load of chicks, along with the vehicle was later
handed over by the police to the veterinary department.

It may be mentioned, as a precautionary measure against the
possibility of spread of bird flu to the state, the state chief
secretary recently issued a notification asking all district DCs as
well as all police stations to maintain vigilance to prevent entry of
poultry and poultry products outside the state. However,
interestingly enough, the consignment of chicks was not intercepted
at Jiribam, where it should have been as per the chief secretary's
instructions. Veterinary department sources meanwhile affirmed that
the consignment of chicks has been handed over to the department by
the Patsoi police this afternoon [3 Feb 2008] at around 3:22 pm. The
chicks would be culled tomorrow [4 Feb 2008], the sources informed.

In view of the possibility of spread of bird flu again in the state,
the sources also appealed to poultry farmers and poultry traders to
stop importing poultry and poultry products from outside the state.

[This is posted to remind readers that birds migrate in other ways
than by flying, even if the apparently healthy chicks were being
moved from Assam into Imphal. Smuggling of birds and livestock is a
chronic problem in SE Asia and the Indian subcontinent. At this time
we have no reports of avian influenza in Assam. - Mod MHJ
