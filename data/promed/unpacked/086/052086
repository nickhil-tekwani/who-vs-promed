[With the addition of the newly confirmed cases reported to WHO during the month of October 2019, the global tally of cases of MERS-CoV infections is now at 2484, including 857 associated deaths (case fatality rate 34.5%).

I've added in brackets the dates that these cases were reported on the MOH website, which differed from the dates these cases were reported to WHO. As an aside, during the month of October 2019, there were discrepancies in reporting with changes being made on the MOH website retrospectively, including the removal of a case that had been listed as reported several days after it had been put on the website.

The above update also adds to the known information on pre-existing co-morbidities and highlights there were 2 cases in healthcare workers related to caring for patients with MERS-CoV infection.

Fortunately, there were no major nosocomial outbreaks during this period.
