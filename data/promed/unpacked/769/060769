Chickenpox cases on the rise
------------------------
As the temperature in the city soars, doctors say they are seeing an increase in the number of chickenpox cases. That's usual for summer, but this time, doctors say, more pregnant women and newborn babies have been infected.

Chickenpox is a mild, but highly infectious condition caused by the Varicella-Zoster virus. The virus is highly contagious, especially between March and May. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through contact with the fluid from chickenpox blisters. While it is most commonly found in children under 10, doctors say one can contract the disease at any age.

Pregnant women and newborns, who tend to have a weaker immune system, are the most at risk. Unlike children, pregnant women can't be vaccinated against the disease. When infected, those in the early stages of pregnancy are advised abortion and those infected a week before labour are closely monitored. "In the last 10 days, I have seen three cases. One of them went in for abortion. We are monitoring the other who is 24 weeks pregnant," said Apollo Hospital obstetrician gynaecologist Dr Jayashree Gajaraj.

If the infection occurs in the early stages of pregnancy, it can cause serious problems to the child's development -- it may be blinded by cataract formation or have serious nervous problems. If it occurs a week before delivery, it can be passed on to the child. Such children are also generally very sick, said neo-natologist Dr Deepa Hariharan of Sooriya Hospitals. "One infected infant was less than a week old. It had severe shock and liver dysfunction. We had to work hard to help her survive and she was just lucky," she said.

The incubation period for chickenpox is generally 14 to 16 days. It begins with rashes resembling "crops" of multiple, small red bumps similar to insect bites. These quickly develop into fluid-filled blisters which burst. Rashes usually appear on the upper body before spreading. Blisters can also appear in the mouth, throat and genital area. Groups of blisters can appear for several days with all stages of the rashes simultaneously being present.

But the disease is harmless in most children, says paediatrician Dr S Balasubramaniam. "I advised most patients to be vaccinated. Even if vaccinated children are infected, the severity of the disease isn't very high," he said. Those infected are advised to take lots of fluids and be quarantined at home.

[Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a herpes virus. It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox nor received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters. VZV also causes shingles. A person with shingles can spread the virus to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. In these cases, the exposed person might develop chickenpox.

Chickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. In many countries there is a policy of universal vaccination of all children by the age of 14 to 15 months. However, in India, although chickenpox vaccine is available in private practice, it does not yet form part of the National Immunisation Schedule.

In February of this year an increase in cases of chickenpox virus infection was reported also in the in city of Mumbai on the opposite coast of India, similarly attributed to the onset of summer [see: Chickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634. Ultraviolet (UV) rays should help prevent the spread of chickenpox, therefore people in milder climates should be more at risk of catching the disease. However the peak incidence of chickenpox in India and Sri Lanka appears to be during the hot, dry, sunny season. This anomaly has been explained because UV rays are actually much lower in the dry season compared with the monsoon period. In the dry season, the pollution in the atmosphere reflects the UV rays back into space. Whereas in the monsoon season, the rains wash away the pollution, and UV irradiation is increased.
