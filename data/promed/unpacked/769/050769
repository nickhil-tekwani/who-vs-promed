El Salvador: West Nile Virus Suspected as Cause of Boy's Death
--------------------------------------------------------------
SAN SALVADOR: Authorities suspect West Nile virus killed an 11-year-old boy
in eastern El Salvador and have sent the victim's blood samples to the
U.S.for additional testing. Health Minister Jose Lopez Beltran said in a
news conference on Sat 7 Sep 2002 that the boy was suffering from severe
flu-like symptoms and was first hospitalized in his home town of San
Miguel. He later began suffering from severe nervous system failure and was
transferred to the capital, San Salvador, where doctors were unable to save
him.
Lopez Beltran said authorities sent blood samples taken from the boy to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga., and have asked
that they be tested for West Nile. The virus can cause flu-like symptoms
--fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches. In most cases people who are
infected never become sick or have only very mild symptoms. In rare cases,
however, the virus can cause encephalitis, nervous system disorders and death.
Last month, West Nile killed a Mexican man who had recently spent 3 weeks
in the U.S. No cases have yet been reported in Central America. So far this
year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has
documented close to 500 human cases of West Nile in the U.S., the country's
worst outbreak since the virus first was detected there in 1999. The virus
has killed 43 Americans so far this year.

[A case of West Nile virus infection (probably imported from the USA) was
reported earlier this year in Mexico, and a single case in the Cayman
Islands in the previous year. There have been no other reports of West Nile
virus infection in Central America or the Caribbean. It is not clear from
the above report why the death of this young boy in El Salvador has been
attributed to West Nile virus infection rather than another viral
encephalitis. However, probable West Nile virus infection has been reported
in birds in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and it is possible that
already West Nile virus may have penetrated further south. Further
information is requested. - Mod.CP]
