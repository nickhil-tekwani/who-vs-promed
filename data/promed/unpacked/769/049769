At least 60 chickens are dying every day in each poultry farm in
Sherpur. There are about 3000 small and big poultry farms in the
district having 500 to 3000 birds in each farm.
Various diseases have broken out in an epidemic form in the poultry
farms due to low temperature.
As a result, the poultry industry in the district faces the threat of
closure. Blockade programme of grand alliance [??] has aggravated the
situation. As a result, poultry owners have become frustrated.
Some poultry firm owners yesterday claimed that the prices of chicken
fell considerably while prices of poultry feed increased greatly in
the local markets in last few days.

[The newswire attributes the significant mortality, apparently
observed in many holdings in the affected district, to the
combination of low temperatures and "various diseases." Temperatures
are a measurable parameter (see map, which includes also current
meteorological data in Sherpur, at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BG/81/Sherpur.html>), while the
involvement of "diseases" is in need of substantiation. Information
on the prevailing poultry health, including suspected or confirmed
diseases, infectious or otherwise, is requested. - Mod.AS]
