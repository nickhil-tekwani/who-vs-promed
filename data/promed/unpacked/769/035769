A deadly disease is hitting the population of wildlife in Kentucky and Fish and Wildlife Officials are reportedly overwhelmed by the amount of deceased wildlife.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease or "EHD" is spreading in multiple counties. Reports of dead deer are being called in to fish and wildlife officials across the state.

The virus is insect borne and can fatally affect red deer and sheep. The disease is not contagious but can become widespread due to insect activity, specifically the midge fly.

Dry hot weather is usually blamed for EHD as deer are forced to move to bodies of water where carriers of the disease reside.

"Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease is not transmittable to people or pets," Dr Iga Stasiak, state wildlife veterinarian for Kentucky Fish and Wildlife. "However, we always recommend that hunters avoid eating venison from deer that were obviously sick."

The counties hardest hit have been Magoffin, Floyd and Knott counties.

Deer can exhibit signs of illness within 24 to 72 hours after receiving a bite from an infected midge. Infected deer may appear sluggish and unresponsive to humans. EHD causes dehydration and fever in deer, which causes the animals to seek water. Infected deer are often found dead near bodies of water. Kentucky last had significant outbreaks of EHD in 2007 and 2012.

Contact Fish and Wildlife if you find a deceased deer at 1-800-858-1549.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD] is a viral disease which is often fatal to many wild ruminants, especially cervids. The acute, infectious disease is usually characterized by extensive hemorrhages. EHD is NOT the same as bluetongue disease. Although presentation may be similar, these diseases are antigenically very different.

As long as this disease has been around, it seems we should be able to find a vaccine for this disease, especially one capable of delivering immunity though feed or some other source that we could protect some of the deer. While that may sound like a dream or unrealistic, it is nevertheless really hard on land owners and deer lovers to continually come across the sick or dead deer.

Some would argue it is nature's way of thinning the herd and keeping nature in balance. But if this disease were extremely deadly and contagious to domestic livestock it would be much more likely for funds to be put toward a vaccine or preventative.

On occasion we do have EHD in cattle, but it is not as frequent as in cervids. - Mod.TG]

[Commercial vaccines are available in Japan although used primarily for cattle. Killed autogenous vaccines have been used in captive cervid herds in the United States, but the efficacy of the vaccine is unknown.
