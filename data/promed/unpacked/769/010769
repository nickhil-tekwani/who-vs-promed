China has suspended the import of pigs, cattle and goats from Middle
Eastern countries which have been hit by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD, the official media said Friday.
Import of the animals from Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel and "other Middle East
countries" have been stopped, Xinhua news agency said. Also, imports from
Malawi have been suspended, the agency said.
A notice released recently by the State Administration for the Inspection
of Import and Export Commodities ordered the import suspension on "pigs,
cattle and goats as well as their products from those nations as of
February 4."
