A mysterious virus has claimed a third victim in Santarem, western Para
state, Brazil. An 8-year-old schoolboy died yesterday in the emergency
ward of the municipal hospital from "respiratory insufficiency" and
"cardiorespiratory complications." He had been seen at the emergency room
several times during the past week with vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever.
Dr. Aparecida Helena Ferreira gave the cause of death as "unknown."

[Santarem is a major river port on the Amazon. A subsequent news item from
the same source dated 10 Apr 2003 quoted the identical text but added the
sentence: "More than 2000 cases have already been reported in the city."
This is very strange, because a search of the Portuguese language newsmedia
has not turned up any previous or subsequent report of the outbreak, nor of
the previous 2 deaths. There is no reason given for the assertion that
this is due to a virus rather than a bacterium -- but perhaps it is not
responding to antibiotics, which would favor a viral etiology. Further
information from our readers would be welcome. - Mod.JW]
