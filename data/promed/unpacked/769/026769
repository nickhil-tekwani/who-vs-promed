Federal officials are investigating a new multi-state foodborne illness outbreak with turkey products identified as the likely source. In a 4-word listing on its outbreak investigation table, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service revealed the outbreak: "_Salmonella_ Hadar, turkey suspect." A spokesman for the FSIS told Food Safety News this afternoon [Thu 18 Mar 2021] that additional details would have to come from the CDC.

A spokeswoman from the CDC confirmed that the agency is investigating the outbreak, which involves _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hadar infections. She told Food Safety News that as of 15 Mar [2021] there had been 22 patients reported across 9 states. She did not indicate when the investigation began or when the 1st person became ill. The agency has not posted an outbreak notice.

"People are reporting eating a variety of turkey products, but a specific brand or type has not yet been identified. CDC is collecting additional data to determine the source of infections," according to the spokeswoman for the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.

Turkey has increasingly been identified in food poisoning outbreaks in the USA in recent years. Outbreaks in 2018 and 2019 involved _Salmonella_ Reading and _Salmonella_ Schwarzengrund, respectively. The 2019 outbreak sickened at least 7 people in 3 states, according to the CDC. The 2018 outbreak sickened at least 358 people in the USA across 42 states. One death was confirmed, according to the CDC's outbreak information. The illnesses were linked to raw human and pet foods from a variety of sources, including Jennie-O. That company recalled products. At the same time in 2018, officials in Canada investigated an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Reading linked to poultry products. Testing showed the same outbreak strain on both sides of the border.
