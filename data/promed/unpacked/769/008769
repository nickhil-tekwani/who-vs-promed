1st Signs of Soybean Rust Spotted in Alabama, USAgNet
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st soybean rust of 2006 was detected on 2 kudzu patches in the
city of Montgomery, Ala. last week. Montgomery is approximately 125
miles north of the Florida Gulf Coast.
According to Ed Sikora, professor and Extension plant pathologist
with Auburn University, most of the 2 patches were dormant, but the
remaining green foliage was infected with the disease.
One patch was in a protected site on the north side of an underpass
off of Interstate 85, while the other patch was hanging in a tree
along a bluff of the Alabama River. This is the 1st report of soybean
rust in Montgomery County. Soybean rust has been detected in 34
counties in Alabama since June 2005, and this is the 22nd
rust-infected kudzu patch identified in the state.
There were 138 U.S. counties found to have soybean rust in calendar
year 2005. This is the 1st reported U.S. rust find in the new year [2006].

1st 2006 Rust Found in US; Disease Detected on Kudzu
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust made its 1st U.S. 2006 appearance in central
Alabama and 10 Florida counties. The disease was discovered on kudzu
plants, USDA reported.
The rust detected in Montgomery, Alabama was the 1st for that county.
34 counties in Alabama were infected with rust during 2005.
In Florida, of the 10 counties yielding positive results -- Polk,
Duval, Leon, Alachua, Pasco, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lee, Marion and
Gadsden -- all but Polk were infected in 2005. The 10 cases were
discovered by scouting teams that traveled 2500 miles between 11 and
13 Jan 2006, visiting kudzu sites that tested positive for rust in
2005, USDA reported.
Cold snaps have caused kudzu dieback in most states, including Texas,
the Associated Press reported. The Liberty County, Texas kudzu patch
that ranked as the westernmost and most well-positioned case to
infect Midwest soybean growing areas has "completely died back,"
Texas A&M plant pathologist Tom Isakeit told the Associated Press.
Last year [2005], the 1st rust case was reported on 24 Feb 2005. The
northernmost 2005 case of rust was in Caldwell, Kentucky. In 2005,
138 counties throughout Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky,
Mississippi, the Carolinas, Texas and Louisiana reported cases.

Rust Still A Threat in 2006; Though Spread of Infection Was Light in
2005, Growers Should Be Vigilant This Year
-----------------------------------------------
We are into a new year, and growers should be thinking about soybean
rust and making a few contingency plans.
No major outbreaks were reported in 2005, but the threat is still
viable, and rust is overwintering in the southern U.S. How far north
it will move this summer is anyone's guess. Having a host, a pathogen
and the right weather conditions -- the disease triangle -- will
determine how much rust the U.S. will have in 2006.
It's a foregone conclusion that plenty of hosts will be available,
since soybeans will be planted on about 75 million acres from the
Gulf Coast to the Canadian border.
The pathogen is here, but whether there's enough in the right places
early enough in the season to infect the host remains to be seen.
If rust is worse this year [2006] or makes its way to major
soybean-growing areas, management tactics will be required. Once rust
arrives in an area several hundred miles south of a grower, he/she
needs to pay attention to where it's sighted then scout and treat
prophylatically to prevent infection.
Fungicide applications are determined by many variables, so
preventative treatments are better than curative ones, because
infected tissue cannot be reclaimed. But don't spray just because
rust has been found in the U.S. Growers should wait until it moves in
their general direction and their state extension pathologists start
to recommend spraying.
Growers know that soybean varieties have no resistance to rust, and
other than fungicides, no known agronomic practices limit the risk of
infection, so they must rely on fungicides.
Fungicides work if the right ones are selected and applied in a
manner to treat the whole canopy and applied early enough to prevent
infection. 2 applications might be required if the disease begins
early enough. Fortunately, soybeans do not become vulnerable to rust
until the reproductive stage, so growers do not have to spray until
soybeans begin to flower.
Scientists can use 2005 as a learning year. Rust didn't overwinter
along the Gulf Coast, but with the tropical storms, rain and
humidity, conditions seemed right for disease development.
Fortunately for growers, the amount of inoculum was not great enough
for early disease development.
It was hot and dry during most of last summer [2005], and rust never
developed. It was not until the summer began to cool off in late
August 2005 that rust began to establish itself.
Spores moved north with wind currents and rust spores and rust-like
spores were found from the Canadian border to the Mexican border. Yet
spore survival was very low, and rust never appeared in any of the
states where rust spores were found, even after it rained.
The big success story from 2005 has been the sentinel plot system,
which growers, agronomists and pathologists will continue to count on in 2006.
The big question no one can answer is whether rust will overwinter in
the U.S. and how much inoculum will be produced. The months of
January and February will be revealing, because they will determine
how far south the freeze line moves and where the initial inoculum
will be located.
If the freeze line is down to the Gulf Coast as it was last year
[2005], rust will probably not appear in the central and western Corn
Belt until perhaps very late in the season. If the freeze line
remains north of the Gulf Coast and rust is found on overwintering
kudzu, then the risk is greater.
So far, according to the USDA rust web site, the freeze line extends
from Corpus Christi, north to Houston and Beaumont, Texas and east to
New Orleans. Temperatures have dropped below freezing along the
Alabama and Mississippi Gulf Coasts. In Florida the freeze line
extends to Jacksonville on the Atlantic Coast.

Rust Ahead of Schedule; Expert: Weather Still Needed to Move Spores
-----------------------------------------------
At this time last year [2005], there were no reported finds of Asian
soybean rust in the U.S. Now there are 12 just one month into 2006.
At the close of 2005, plant pathologists indicated a higher volume of
rust spores may be in the U.S. this winter, increasing the chances
that the pathogen could show up early in 2006.
According to information from the USDA's soybean rust web site, field
scouts in Grady County, Georgia on Monday [30 Jan 2006] found rust on
a kudzu plant near the Florida border, making it the 1st find in
Georgia this year. Rust did not show up in Georgia until 27 Apr 2005 last year.
Tom Isakeit, assistant professor and extension plant pathologist at
Texas A&M University in College Station, said the prevalence of rust
in January 2006 is likely a sign of a mild winter so far.
"I was surprised to learn that it is still around in Georgia," he
said. "I think this is a reflection of the effects of a relatively
mild winter. I don't know whether the Georgia situation represents
new infections of kudzu, where the spores are somewhat local, or
whether they are the result of movement from farther south."
10 positive rust finds in Florida and one in Alabama have been
reported already this year [2005]. The Florida reports come as no
surprise to experts, many of whom said that at the end of 2005 rust
would show up in areas of Florida where the weather is mild.
According to USDA, between February and April 2005, there were just 5
rust finds. Last year [2005] it took until 18 Jul 2005 for the 12th
rust find to be confirmed in the U.S.
Though rust has popped up some 2 months earlier than in 2005, Isakeit
said it's too soon to judge whether the disease could spread to the
main soybean growing areas of the U.S.
"So the initial inoculum for an epidemic is spread a little further
than was observed this time last year [2005]," he said, "but later
developments will still depend upon the weather farther down the
road. For example, a dry spring would limit rust spread and
development. Last year showed that rust can pretty much hang out in
the Southeast for more than half the year. You will need weather to
move spores from there to the Midwest, and I still get the impression
that this movement is not typical of the spring and early summer."
Isakeit said scouts are already scouring fields in Texas and other
areas of the south for rust.
Some evidence says soybean rust may behave similarly to sorghum
ergot, which became widespread when it was introduced to the U.S. in
1997, he said, but is prevalent during winter months only near Corpus
Christi and south.
"It can occur further north during the usual growing season, but it
is very weather driven up there," he said. "Observations suggest that
it will cause a serious epidemic once every 10 years. So far, that
seems to be holding out. I am wondering if soybean rust might be the
same way for the Midwest, but I am inclined to hold judgment until
the disease gets introduced into south Texas and we have a couple of
years of observations behind us."
In 2005, Caldwell, Kentucky was the farthest north rust was
identified; Hyde County, North Carolina was the easternmost location
and Liberty County, Texas was the farthest west rust had been found.
According to USDA, 138 counties reported soybean rust last year [2005].

Rust Survives Winter in South States; Some Rust Survival North of Freeze Line
-----------------------------------------------
Freezing temperatures nipped the southern United States this winter
[2006] and eliminated some Asian soybean rust hosts, but rust
discoveries in Georgia, Alabama and Florida in January 2006 revealed
that refuges remain for the disease, even in areas where temperatures
dropped below freezing.
Scouts found the most recent rust case Monday [30 Jan 2006] in
southern Georgia, along the Georgia/Florida border. The Grady County
case was Georgia's 1st 2006 find. 7 roadside patches of kudzu were
examined along the border; 5 of the patches had a "small amount of
greening/leaf sprouting," according to USDA's soybean rust
information web site. One patch tested positive.
"This particular kudzu was located behind a building, protected from
the weather," USDA said. "The rust was found on what appeared to be
older leaves that had survived through the cold temperatures ...
Copious amounts of rust pustules and spores were observed later at a
laboratory." USDA has monitored kudzu -- an exotic weed that commonly
serves as an alternative host for Asian soybean rust -- dieback this
winter [2006] to see where host vegetation still exists.
The freeze line, which marks where minimum temperatures have been
equal to or lower than 32 F during the fall and winter, rings the
Gulf of Mexico. The line extended from Corpus Christi, Texas to north
of Houston and Beaumont, Texas to near New Orleans, according to
USDA's 30 Jan 2006 freeze line report. From there, the line crosses
to Yankeetown, Florida through Ocala to Jacksonville.
Temperatures have fallen below freezing through all of Mississippi
and Alabama to the coastlines and throughout the Florida panhandle.
Except in coastal areas, nearly 100 percent of Texas and Louisiana
kudzu has died, USDA reported on 30 Jan 2006. Most of the monitored
plants in Georgia, Alabama and the Florida panhandle have perished,
but some areas along the Gulf coast and south of the Florida freeze
line only have a 5 percent kudzu dieback rating, according to USDA's
rust report, and, as demonstrated by Monday's [30 Jan 2006] find,
some plants within freeze zones have survived.
Temperatures climbed as January 2006 closed, and chances of
additional freezes are quickly dimming as the winter months roll toward spring.
"In south Texas, people are already getting ready to plant," said Tom
Isakeit, a Texas A&M extension plant pathologist. Texas A&M planned
to begin planting sentinel soybean plots during the last week of
January and the 1st part of February 2006.
During his winter scouting, Isakeit found some volunteer soybean
seedlings in Victoria County, Texas but there weren't any signs of
rust. "There's limited (volunteer) growth because of the drought. The
state is pretty much in a state of dormancy except for the extreme south."
Isakeit has also been keeping tabs on other possible host plants,
asking commercial green bean growers to watch for rust, though green
beans "probably ... won't be a significant factor in the (U.S.) epidemiology."
The westernmost 2005 rust case was discovered on Liberty County,
Texas. That kudzu patch has completely died back, Isakeit said. He
scouted 3 kudzu patches north of the 2005 site and didn't find a sign
of rust. "In my opinion, I don't think there is any rust in Texas at
this time," he said, though it is possible that an urban kudzu plant
could harbor the disease.
The chances of rust traveling from Florida to Texas are slim, he
said. Spores from the south are a more likely threat to Texas and the Midwest.
"I'm trying to monitor incoming spores from Mexico," he said.

Soy Rust Threat Still Looms; Asian Soybean Rust Could Reach Midwest
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust, _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, is still a largely
unknown fungus in the U.S. and could destroy crops, according to
scientists at the American Soybean Association's "Beyond 2005 --
Preparing for Rust is a Must" meeting in Davenport, Iowa Wednesday [1
Feb 2006].
"We still have no idea how soybean rust will react in the United
States with ideal conditions," said John Askew, president of the Iowa
Soybean Association.
Though the disease has been studied throughout the globe, and
researchers worldwide have swapped information, many questions remain
about the disease's potential to harm U.S. soybeans.
Data collected since rust's arrival in the U.S. mainland nearly 15
months ago provide insights into why the fungus didn't infect the
Midwest during 2005 and give clues about what to expect in 2006,
researchers told meeting attendees.
Environmental conditions in 2005 were somewhat unfavorable for the
spread of rust, said Alison Robertson, an Iowa State University
extension field crop pathologist. Winds in infected areas were light,
making it more difficult to carry spores long distances. Dry
conditions west of the Mississippi may have helped confine the
disease, because rust won't develop on leaves that haven't been wet
for more than 6 hours, she said.
ISU research gives rust a 5 percent chance of moving from Florida to
Texas and upward to Iowa this year [2006]. That chance would increase
to 18 percent if soybean rust managed to survive the winter in Texas.
"We expect it will get here (to Iowa) one day," she said. "Don't be
complacent. We've only had one year of the disease. We don't know
what we are in for."
When looking at any disease's ability to spread, 3 key components
need to be remembered: the environment, the pathogen and the host.
Eliminate one and disease cannot survive.
Even if spores move north, they must be viable in order to infect host plants.
The Midwest has the advantage of killing freezes during the winter,
which eliminates the green foliage needed for rust's survival, and
fewer alternative hosts than the South. The southern states are
plagued with kudzu, which serves as an excellent host.
Based on the 3 key components -- environment, pathogen and host --
required for disease survival, 2006 could provide rust with a
different scenario.
On the positive side for growers, some meteorologists are calling for
weak La Nina conditions, which would point to hot, dry weather and
conditions that hinder soybean rust's development.
But conversely, rust spores may have some advantages they didn't have
last year [2005].
"It's likely the freeze line for this winter [2006] will be slightly
north," from 2004/2005, Robertson said, which may give rust a
slightly better chance of moving northward during the growing season,
because more hosts are available along the Gulf of Mexico coast and
areas to the north.
Rust has already been detected earlier this year [2006] than last
year. The 1st 2005 rust case was discovered in Florida in late
February; Georgia had its 1st case in late April and Alabama found
rust during the end of June. Rust was found in all 3 of those states
by the end of January 2006.

Spore-Covered Aphid Raises Questions; Little Known About Insect's
Ability to Carry Rust
-----------------------------------------------
Microscopic Asian soybean rust spores covered the aphid's tiny green body.
Florida researchers photographed the bug, added the image to the
small collection of data about aphids and fungal spores, and pondered
the question of whether aphids could help spread rust in the U.S.
"Everyone is kind of scratching their heads at this point," said Jim
Marois, a University of Florida plant pathologist. "There really
isn't a whole lot of expertise on aphids moving fungal spores around.
"It's not like there's a body of literature we can look at."
Scientists have studied aphids and their role in the spread of
viruses, but aphid-fungus connections are relatively uncharted. The
possibility of aphids transporting rust is an even greater unknown.
"It's probably inevitable that it's going to happen," Marois said.
"My hunch would be that it's not going to play a major role."
Though soybean aphids could transport spores, Scott Isard, an
aerobiology professor at Pennsylvania State University, said his
guess would be that if they did, the results wouldn't affect growers.
"That's my hope," he said. "We need a lot more science before we draw
that conclusion. Often aphids get into the soybean crop relatively
late ... the plant may be past the stage when it's most vulnerable."
Even if spores traveled northward via wind-carried aphids, the spores
would have to be viable and the environmental conditions favorable
for the disease to develop.
Asian soybean rust can develop late in the growing season, but
soybean yields won't be harmed if the plants are infected after
they've reached maturity, the R7 and R8 stages. Rust causes the most
harm when plants are blooming and forming pods in the R1 through R6 stages.
If detected early, soybean rust can be controlled with fungicides.

UV rays might affect how rust spores spread, says expert
-----------------------------------------------
Purdue University soybean expert Greg Shaner offers some of the
latest thoughts on Asian soybean rust heading into the 2006 planting
season. Shaner and other Purdue researchers and Extension specialists
are still making plans for another summer of stepped-up vigilance.
They also have some new hypotheses about the fungal disease that
might surprise you.
"Last year's [2005] lessons indicate that soybean rust may not spread
that rapidly," said Greg Shaner, a professor of botany and plant
pathology. "We also know that just because the spores are present
doesn't necessarily mean you'll get soybean rust. Last year, there
was no direct connection between when you find spores and when you find rust."
Shaner said it was not possible to determine whether spores found in
areas outside the extreme southern portions of the country were
viable. Spores of the fungus may not survive after traveling long distances.
"Soybean rust may only spread by moving in short hops, almost
field-to-field," he said.
Those spores identified last year [2005] in places like Indiana,
Illinois and Minnesota did not lead to disease outbreaks.
"We think that ultraviolet light may have affected the viability of
the spores," Shaner said.
That hypothesis is tied to the fact that spores of the soybean rust
fungus are mainly produced on the underside of leaves where they are
protected from direct sunlight. Soybean rust spores carried on the
wind and in clouds are exposed to large amounts of ultraviolet light
that may make them impotent, according to Shaner, who said further
research will have to be done to test this theory.
Due to the current milder-than-normal winter, more of the spores may
survive on plants, creating a greater likelihood of soybean rust
occurrences this year [2006], Shaner said. However, he points out
that it may take a couple of years before the fungus becomes
established firmly enough throughout frost-free areas of the Deep
South to pose a real threat to the Midwest.
"Some producers were initially concerned that sentinel plots, in
which rust was allowed to develop, might contribute to the soybean
rust problem, but that doesn't appear to be the case," he said. "We
still need to learn a lot about how this disease develops in the
field, and sentinel plots can provide this information, as well as
serve as an early warning system."
He said a few additional fungicides may be available for use this
summer [2006], but he doesn't recommend that producers spray for the
disease until it's present. "We may do more tests this year to review
fungicide use protocols and try to find out when spraying is
beneficial," Shaner said.
Even though soybean rust didn't make it to the Midwest in 2005,
Shaner encourages producers to keep a lookout for the disease this
year [2006]. He said last summer's increased soybean field scouting
turned up some other soybean diseases.
"There was a lot more scouting going on last year [2005], thus folks
noticed more diseases that might have gone undetected," he said.
Despite the lack of soybean rust in Indiana, diseases like frogeye
leaf spot and sudden death syndrome did bring down yields in some areas.

Asian rust lessons from Alabama
-------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust infected few U.S. soybean fields in 2005. Yet, its
presence in Southern states provides a few clues as to how it may
behave in the United States and how to best control it. Ed Sikora,
Extension plant pathologist at Auburn University, discussed Alabama's
2005 Asian rust experience at the 2006 Illinois Crop Protection
Technology Conference held recently in Urbana, Illinois.
Rust preparation:
Decreasing soybean acreage was one way Alabama farmers shielded
themselves from Asian rust in 2005. Alabama's soybean acreage is
small at 150 000 acres. In 1980, soybean acreage tallied as much 2
million acres.
Other ways included:
* Shifting toward early planting and earlier maturing varieties.
* Checking frequently for rust updates.
* Lining up fungicide early in the season. This was a mindset shift,
since Alabama farmers used few fungicides on soybeans prior to 2005,
says Sikora.
Rust scouting is hard.
Asian rust was identified in 33 Alabama counties in 2005, including
17 commercial soybean fields, 20 kudzu patches, and 10 soybean
sentinel plots. Of these, adverse yield declines were reported in just 2 cases.
Rust's presence was a reminder of the difficulty of scouting for
Asian rust. "If you are scouting, you need a 20x or stronger hand
lens and lots of friends," jests Sikora. "It's not an easy disease to
find. It can be confused with a number of diseases."
"Volcanoes" that erupt from pustules that develop on the underside of
the leaf surface are indicators of disease progression. Sikora
suggests growers take leaf samples they suspect are infected with
Asian rust to a state diagnostic laboratory for confirmation.
Slow mover in 2005:
"There was lots of talk about the disease spreading so quickly, up to
400 miles in a day," says Sikora. "But we really didn't see that
rapid movement in Alabama."
For example, rust initially infected a sentinel plot on an experiment
station near Shorter, Alabama, on 13 Aug 2005. Approximately 33
percent of the plants in this plot showed symptoms of rust with
active sporulation.
"It took roughly 4 weeks for the disease to be detected in a one-acre
plot just 400 yards away where no fungicide was used," Sikora says.
"The spread within a plot was rapid, but the spread from field to
field was relatively slow. It might have been due to weather
conditions in our area. Between major tropical storms, we typically
had 2 to 3 weeks of hot, dry conditions."
One factor confirmed in 2005 is that kudzu will likely be rust's
principal overwintering host. In early September 2005, Sikora
examined 14 patches of kudzu on a drive by basis, and found 7 to be
infected with soybean rust.
"It may act as a green bridge from the south to the north in our
state as well as in the U.S." says Sikora. Not only is kudzu found in
southern states, but it also is present in some northern states like Illinois.
Fungicides worked well.
Alabama farmers treated up to 50 percent of soybean acres at least
once with a fungicide, up from less than 5 percent in previous years,
says Sikora.
All fungicides from the strobilurin and triazole classes of
fungicides appeared to work well. Sikora says a greening effect was
observed in some fields where strobilurin-type fungicides were used.
The fungicides worked well in controlling rust as well as some of the
other late-season foliar diseases. However, prolonged greening can
become an issue at harvest.
"In the coming years, desiccants may be needed to help dry down the
crop," says Sikora.
Lessons from 2005:
Alabama farmers learned several points about living with the threat
of Asian rust in 2005. They include:
* Keeping track of Asian rust movement by monitoring Web sites such
as the USDA's soybean rust web site <http://www.sbrusa.net>.
* Planting earlier with earlier maturing varieties. This may allow
growers to avoid soybean rust and/or reduce the number of fungicide
applications required to protect the crop through a season.
* Knowing that Asian rust scouting takes time and patience.
* Managing rust through timely applications of fungicides. Applying a
strobilurin fungicide at the R2 to R3 growth stages (full bloom to
beginning pod development) may provide a yield bump in some parts of
the U.S., even in the absence of Asian rust. This depends on various
factors, such as weather conditions and the presence or absence of
other diseases like brown spot and frogeye leafspot.
What to expect in 2006:
Sikora expects these rust developments to occur in 2006:
* Rust will overwinter on kudzu in Florida -- and possibly in Georgia
and Alabama if they continue to have a mild winter -- at greater
levels than in 2005.
* Rust spores will spread into the Southeast U.S. in late spring.
* Disease severity will be determined by weather conditions and
initial spore load.
* Yield reductions will occur if rust infects fields early and if
fungicides are not properly used.
Soybean rust's effect on Midwestern soybean production is still
unknown. "It will take 3 to 4 years to sort out," Sikora says.

ALERT: Kudzu with rust lives through below-freezing temps in GA
-----------------------------------------------
Georgia officials today [10 Feb 2006] reported finding soybean rust
on kudzu that had survived below-freezing temperatures last night and
this morning in Thomas County. This is the 2nd county in the state
with soybean rust this year, and the 13th U.S. county.
Soybean rust was found in copious amounts on older kudzu leaves in
Grady County, Georgia on 30 Jan 2006. The adjacent counties are on
the border with Florida in southwest Georgia. Layla Sconyers,
post-doctoral research associate in plant pathology at the University
of Georgia, reported the following on Sbrusa.net:
"Today Bob Kemerait re-visited a roadside kudzu site in Thomas
County, Hwy 84, Thomasville, 15 minutes north of the Florida border.
This site was scouted on 30 Jan 2006, and no rust was found.
"However, today [10 Feb 2006], kudzu was found growing protected in a
concrete culvert. A few older leaves (age unknown) and some new green
leaves (approximately 3-4 weeks old) were found. Soybean rust
pustules were found on the older leaf tissue, similar to that of the
Grady County find.

USDA To Expand Soybean Sentinel Plot Program
-----------------------------------------------
A USDA spokesman recently announced the agency will expand its
soybean sentinel plot program this growing season in an effort to
detect and minimize the impact of potential Asian soybean rust outbreaks.
Bill Hoffman, a national program leader at USDA who specializes in
homeland security, told participants of an American Soybean
Association meeting in Davenport, Iowa, that the number of sentinel
plots will be increased from 320 in 2005 to 354 this year [2006].
"The sentinel plot system was a roaring success last year [2005],"
Hoffman said. "But the disease spread in 2006 probably will be
different than in 2005."
The United Soybean Board (USB) and the North Central Soybean Research
Program also will establish rust sentinel plots this season. 20
soybean sentinel plots are planned in Illinois

Scouting for soybean rust continues on kudzu patches from Florida
northward through Georgia and Alabama, and westward to Texas.
Thomas county in southern Georgia is the newest county to have been
confirmed positive for soybean rust. The find occurred on a roadside
kudzu patch protected by its location in a culvert. The county did
not have any positive finds in 2005.
The confirmed reports of kudzu in 2006 include Alabama with one,
Georgia with 2, and Florida with 10 counties. There has been some
dieback to very little dieback of kudzu in rural locations in central
and southern Florida. In northern Florida and in a few locations in
Alabama and Georgia, where the kudzu has been protected from cold
winter temperatures, there is some green tissue. Most kudzu patches
scouted north of central Florida have been defoliated, and some are
just beginning to leaf out.
The locations where soybean rust infected kudzu patches have been
found north of central Florida have been in: 1) urban areas ("heat
islands") in positions where the plants have been protected from the
cold winter night sky, and 2) at a single location where a spot light
has provided artificial light and heat to create favorable growing
conditions for the kudzu.
It is unknown whether soybean rust is distributed more widely in the
southern U.S. in early February 2006 than it was one year ago. There
has been more extensive scouting this winter; all the Florida kudzu
locations that were positive for soybean rust in 2005 have been
scouted in January/February 2006 as well as many of the kudzu sites
where no soybean rust was found last year. Also, winter in Florida is
not over for at least another month. The last frost-free date for
parts of northern Florida is 15 Mar 2006.
"Newer leaves also had lesions and young pustules, with a few spores
on some of the pustules. Infection of the newer leaves is recent. The
kudzu survived temperatures that reached 29 F this morning [10 Feb
2006] and 30 F Wednesday [8 Feb 2006] night. There was no sign of frost injury.
"Young, greening kudzu tissue found on 30 Jan 2006 was frozen,
foliage gone, but vines had survived."
In an e-mail to colleagues today [10 Feb 2006], Sconyers added,
"We'll need to keep a close check on the weather and on areas such as
the kudzu patches in Cairo and Thomasville, Georgia for further
disease progress." Earlier this month [February 2006], the Georgia
commentary noted that on 31 Jan 2006, Bob Kemerait examined roadside
kudzu in Cordele, Georgia (Crisp County), located about 100 miles
north of the Florida border. No soybean rust was detected. Dead kudzu
vines were found around buildings, but no green tissue or rust was found.
So far in 2006, Florida has 10 counties positive for soybean rust;
Georgia has 2 and Alabama has one.

[The items above are from January and up to 10 Feb 2006. Item 9 in
particular gives a good summary of soybean rust (_Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_) in 2005 and what to expect in 2006. Scouting continues
to be an aggressive method for monitoring the disease and the
pathogen. In 2005 the 1st rust case on kudzu was reported on 24 Feb
2005. Positive reports in January and early February 2006 in Alabama,
Florida and Georgia suggest the disease is off to an earlier start
this year in kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot),
the overwintering host, but this may also reflect more intense
surveying of known kudzu locations in 2006 compared to 2005. In
Florida, of the 10 counties yielding positive results in
January/February 2006, all but one were infected in 2005. Rust did
not show up in Georgia until 27 Apr 2005, in contrast to the February
detection in 2006. In most of the early cases of detection in 2006,
rust was found on what appeared to be older leaves of kudzu that had
survived through the cold temperatures in sheltered spots in what
otherwise would be considered within freeze zones. As 2006
progresses, growers, agronomists and pathologists will continue to
count on results from sentinel plots of soybeans (_Glycine max_) for
early detection in the crop. They may rely less on trapping spores
now that it is known that spore survival is poor over long distances
and that short distance movement of spores from plant to plant
probably accounts for most new infections. Soybean varieties have no
resistance to rust, and other than fungicides, no known agronomic
practices limit the risk of infection, so growers must rely on timely
applications of fungicides, hence the emphasis on monitoring. Disease
severity in soybeans in 2006 will be influenced heavily by weather
conditions and initial spore load. - Mod.JAD]
