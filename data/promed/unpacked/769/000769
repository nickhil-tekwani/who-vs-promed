Subject: A disease of horses - Equine Encephalosis
--------------------------------------------------
Between October 2008 and January 2009, a febrile horse disease was
observed in dozens of stables across the country. Following
consistent efforts, the disease has been diagnosed as Equine
Encephalosis [EE], a disease caused by the equine encephalosis virus
[EEV]. This disease has never been diagnosed in Israel. The
isolation, identification and characterization of the virus have been
carried out by the virology laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary
Institute (KVI) [at Beit-Dagan, Israel] and the department of
virology of the [Veterinary Laboratories Agency], Weybridge, England [UK].

Infection route and incubation period:
--------------------------------------
EEV is transmitted by midges of the Culicoides family. The virus is
related to the bluetongue virus; all equids (horses, donkeys, zebras)
and -- sometimes -- elephants, are susceptible to infection. Its
incubation period is 3-10 days. There is limited information in the
literature about its clinical signs; the signs described include high
body temperature for 1-5 days, unrest, decreased appetite, edema of
lips and eyelids, accelerated pulse and breathing rates, congested
mucosae, abortions, neurological symptoms.

Diagnosis is carried out serologically (serum neutralization or
Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay -- ELISA), PCR (polymerase chain
reaction), and virus isolation in tissue culture.

Treatment:
----------
There is no specific treatment besides supportive treatment. 90
percent of affected animals recover without complications.

Prevention:
-----------
No vaccine is available.

[Equine encephalosis (EE) is a subclinical to mild, occasionally
peracute, arthropod-borne diseases of horses. This orbivirus was 1st
recognised in South Africa following its sudden appearance during the
early months of 1967, when it became apparent, for the 1st time, that
African horse sickness virus (AHSV) was not the only orbivirus of
significance known to infect horses. The virus was isolated from
horses that died from an unknown peracute illness. Necropsy
examinations revealed general venous congestion, fatty liver
degeneration, brain oedema and highly conspicuous and sharply
demarcated areas of catarrhal enteritis, especially in the distal
half of the small intestine. Histopathological examination confirmed
the microscopic findings. Serological investigations revealed that
widespread infections of horses with EEV had occurred during the late
summer of 1967. This survey furthermore suggested that EEV had not
occurred in South Africa to any appreciable extent in the preceding
10 years. Since 1967, equine encephalosis took on epidemic
proportions in some years, with more than 75 percent of horses tested
having antibodies against EEV.

Subsequent serological studies have shown it to be both widespread
and prevalent in southern Africa. The difficulty in differentiating
EE from African horse sickness (AHS) was addressed by Onderstepoort's
experts (see ProMED-mail post number 20070509.1495). Like other
orbiviruses (e.g., Bluetongue, AHS, Epizootic haemorrhagic disease)
EE is transmitted by culicoides.

Outbreaks of EEV infection have furthermore been associated with
equine fetal abortion during the first 5-6 months of gestation. An
early undetected abortion could therefore be misdiagnosed as
infertility in a mare. Until now, EE has not been recorded in other
parts of the world.

The theoretical possibility of EE being involved in seasonal equine
disease, characterised by fever and moderate neural symptoms, in
Israel has been raised several times during the recent decades,
without diagnostic confirmations. The Oct 2008 - Jan 2009 epizootic,
described above, was initially attributed to Equine viral arteritis
(EVA): on 9 Nov 2008, Israel notified the OIE about 28 outbreaks of a
febrile disease in horses throughout the country, diagnosed by the
KVI -- which applied seroneutralization test (SNT) -- as EVA.
Reportedly, the said diagnosis was confirmed by [Veterinary
Laboratories Agency] VLA (Weybridge), similarly by SNT. The said
notification was archived in ProMED post 20081111.3547.

However, the KVI succeeded in isolating a virus from diseased
animals; the isolate was forwarded to VLA where its identification as
EEV has now been, commendably, completed. Further characterization of
the isolate is to be expected.

It may be assumed that EEV was responsible, solely or combined with
EVA, for the clinical cases observed during the 2008 outbreak.

ProMED-mail has repeatedly mentioned EEV among the orbiviruses which
might emerge in the Mediterranean and European theatre since it became
apparent that culicoides species, capable of circulating orbiviruses,
appeared to be prevalent in regions hitherto regarded as free of
bluetongue. The hazard of EEV's possible spread to Europe has been
raised by [European Food Safety Authority] EFSA experts during early
stages of the BTV-8 epizootic in northern Europe (see ProMED post
20070414.1249).

The Israeli equines, found infected, should be seen as sentinels for
the virus' presence and circulation in the region; a clear warning
sign for the entire region, including southern Europe.
