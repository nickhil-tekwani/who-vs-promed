Foie gras producers in France have been ordered to clear their farms of ducks and geese in a bid to curtail an outbreak of bird flu.

About 2000 farms in the southwest were told today [17 Apr 2017] to halt production of the delicacy for 6 weeks and kill their birds as the H5N8 strain of the virus spreads. The order from the government has plunged the industry into crisis, prompting warnings that its existence could be threatened if it fails to eradicate bird flu.

Last year [2016], an outbreak forced a 2-week halt in foie gras production in all 4000 poultry farms in the southwest, which resulted in lost revenue of 270 million Euros [USD 287 million]. The industry, which has a 75 per cent share of the global market, usually generates about 1.6 billion Euro [USD 1.7 billion] annually. The overall losses this year [2017] are likely to be even greater, producers have warned.

"I've been in this business for about 30 years, and I have never seen a crisis like this one," said Philip Everlet, head of foie gras in the Chamber of Agriculture in the Gers department. "We thought we had protected ourselves, but we were unlucky. The duck killer came back. Producers are worried because they say that if there is a 3rd outbreak, they won't recover."

Under the latest so-called sanitary vacuum plan, farms across the southwest region, which produces 71 per cent of French foie gras, must kill all their birds and disinfect their buildings, which will be left empty until the end of May [2017].

A total of about 3.2 million ducks and geese will be killed, either because they have been infected by bird flu or as a preventive measure. However, anger is running high because of the failure of last year's [2016] eradication plan, with producers complaining of bureaucracy and lost earnings.

Christian Candelon, a producer in Gers, said he had emptied and disinfected his farm 2 months ago when nearby farms were affected by bird flu. "Now I'm being asked to begin everything again and to disinfect," he said. "It's going to be 6 more weeks without working. The sanitary vacuum is pointless for me."

He said last year's [2016] bird flu outbreak had resulted in a 60 per cent drop in revenue and meant that his balance sheet showed a loss of 18 000 Euro [USD 19 000] at the end of the year.

The beneficiaries of the French crisis are likely to be producers in Hungary and Bulgaria, which together have a 20 per cent share of the world market. Amid fears of the foie gras shortage in France, both countries hope to increase sales.
