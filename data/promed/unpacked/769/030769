EPIDEMIC RISKS, FLOODING - BRAZIL (RIO BRANCO)
==============================================

Subject: Flooding consequences in Acre State, Brazil
The city of Rio Branco, Acre State, Brazil has recently suffered from the
worse flooding in decades, making more than 15000 people temporarely and
many permanently homeless, in a total population of 240,000 habitants. The
flooding started at the end of February, and by now the water level in the
Rio Acre is steadily lowering.
Up to April 10th 54 cases of Leptospirosis (3 of them with Weill's syndrome,
1 death), 74 cases of Typhoid fever and 23 of Hepatitis A have been notified
in relation to the situation. In normal situations notification is poor, so
no estimates of real incidence increase can be made for these diseases. An
estimation of 100 total expected notified Leptospirosis cases has been made
from current incidence rates. No serious health problems have arisen in the
refugee-camps, which temporarely housed about 1900 families.

[I recently had a letter from a friend of many years farming in the back
country some thirty miles NNE of Siete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, that they had
been having very severe rains and flooding, been isolated for three weeks,
and lost all their bridges. We look forward to more reports from Dr Voorham
on how they make out in Acre. If there any similar situations elsewhere in
Brazil, would our Brazilian colleagues please inform us. MHJ]
