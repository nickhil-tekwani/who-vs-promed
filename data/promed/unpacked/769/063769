We [in Israel] have been experiencing YF vaccine shortages since July 2004.
At the beginning, none of the packages (single dose, 10 doses, 20 doses)
was available. Now we have started receiving the single dose packages,
surely at a considerably higher price. I'm not sure whether this represents
a true shortage, or merely a sales trick.

There have been repeated vaccine shortages in South Africa, going back to
at least 2000, for yellow fever vaccine and for quadrivalent meningitis
vaccine, usually just before the Hajj. Supply problems also extended to
other "popular" travel related items. Issues related to these incidents
were reported in the media and were also discussed in the South African
Medical Journal (SAMJ), a publication of the South African Medical
Association (SAMA).
On one such previous occasion, our practice had to obtain a special permit
to source and privately import Yellow Fever Vaccine from Europe in order to
stay in business, but at a significantly higher price.
Another characteristic of the South African immunization and vaccine
environment is the classification of human vaccines (as opposed to
veterinary ones) as "schedule 2 = OTC = over the counter medicines." This
has led to some sort of decentralization away from specialized providers to
aggressively competing vaccinating pharmacists, paramedics, nurses and GPs.
These providers often rather indiscriminately pre-vaccinate or
part-vaccinate and refer prospective travelers thereafter for "Yellow-Fever
Vaccination only" to licensed Yellow Fever Vaccination Centers, where
Yellow Fever Vaccine is then, in our experience, provided on demand rather
than by indication.
There has recently been an increase in providers following a so-called
"Certificate of Competence in Travel Medicine Course" in South Africa,
allegedly attended by more than 100 participants up to twice annually since
beginning of 2000. We also frequently receive requests to supply yellow
fever vaccine and yellow certificates to unlicensed providers, who claim
that other licensed centers do not object to providing such a service for a
fee.
As an apparent consequence of the classification of vaccines and vaccine
marketing, professional competence in the eyes of the general public would
appear to have moved from the medical to the paramedical and non-medical
professions, particularly travel agents who usually advise their clients to
get a yellow fever and cholera vaccine. Vaccination is no longer perceived
as the performance of a professional act but as the sale of an OTC item.
These sales are then mostly provided by franchises not organized as medical
practices but as commercial companies.
The above mentioned could partly explain the alleged unforeseen demand for
Yellow Fever Vaccine, and this demand is supported by many African Customs
officials insisting on Yellow Fever and Cholera Certificates, often in
breach of International Health Regulations and in order to elicit a bribe.
Egypt has recently introduced YF requirements for South African travelers
prior to visa applications, and travelers to Egypt are now being vaccinated
for Yellow Fever but usually not for foodborne diseases like Hepatitis A
etc. We have documented cases in which travelers *not* coming from an
infected area received Yellow Fever Vaccine for a visit to the UK and Paris.
All these issues have been well documented and referred to the relevant
authorities, i.e. to the Health Professions Council by ourselves in a
process lasting since 2000. There has, however, been no outcome to date,
but we have recently been informed that the matter has been referred to the
Council's Medical and Dental Board "for their determination on the legality
of Travel Medicine's business."
As far as the only provider of Yellow Fever Vaccine in South Africa
(Aventis) is concerned, there was no explanation ever as to the ongoing
problem regarding the supply of Yellow Fever Vaccine, except for vague
references to unexpected demand or "worldwide shortage of raw materials."
Should you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact us.

[While, from the clinical point of view, some of the situations described
above constitute unnecessary use, and a waste of precious vaccine (together
with a very small risk of adverse effects), from a public health point of
view, the more world travelers who receive the vaccine the better, reducing
the risk of accidental introduction to a YF-receptive area, such as cities
with _Aedes_ mosquito infestations. - Mod.JW]

New Zealand is also experiencing a shortage of Stamaril (Aventis-Pasteur
product). I would expect an official request for further information to
come into the Ministry of Health on Friday [4 Feb 2005] our time from
travel medicine physicians. The Ministry of Health can then ask officially
what has happened.

[Note that there are only 4 manufacturers whose YF vaccine has been
prequalified by WHO as of 7 Jan 2005
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-access/quality/un_prequalified/unyfproducers.html>:
Aventis Pasteur, France
BioManguinhos, Brazil
Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal
Evans Vaccines, (formerly Medeva), U.K.
Aventis Pasteur USA & the Institute of Poliomyelitis & Viral Encephalitis,
Moscow, Russia, have been removed from the list. Colombia and India produce
YF vaccines, but these have not been prequalified by WHO.
As commented in the previous post, a serious situation regarding prevention
of the spread of YF to Asia appears to be developing. - Mod.JW]
