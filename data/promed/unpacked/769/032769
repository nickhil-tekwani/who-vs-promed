importation of live animals and meat on the bone of cattle, sheep and goats

[FMD is a highly infectious viral infection of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats,
buffalo and artiodacytl wildlife species. It is characterized by fever,
vesicles in the mouth, on the muzzle, teats and feet and death in young
animals. - Mod.TG]
[Since FMD has not been confirmed, but is only suspected by the Ministry of
Agriculture in Brazil, we would be interested in hearing from anyone with
additional information. - Man. Ed. DS]
