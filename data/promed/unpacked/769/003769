Manitoba Agriculture reported that a new strain of clubroot of canola was positively identified in southern Manitoba near the US border. Outside of Alberta, very few fields have been found to contain novel pathotypes like the one identified, and this is the 1st finding in Manitoba.

The new strain is pathotype 3A, [which] is able to overcome some 1st-generation genetic resistance in commercial cultivars. Traditionally rated "resistant" varieties will not prevent infection [with] this pathotype. Genetic resistance to 3A can be found in a small number of commercial varieties. However, long-term sustainability of canola production requires crop rotation, rotation of sources of genetic resistance, [and] good farm biosecurity.

[With] resistant varieties, growers need to ensure the resistance is effective against their pathotypes. Under high resting spore loads, symptoms can occur after using the same resistance source 2 or 3 times, or even sooner. "It is critically important to limit the pressure we put on resistance by using resistant varieties before spore concentrations are high, extending the break between canola crops and changing resistance sources if necessary," said Dan Orchard, Canola Council of Canada.

[Clubroot of Brassicaceae is caused by the fungus-like organism _Plasmodiophora brassicae_. It is a destructive, soil-borne disease affecting nearly all cultivated members of the family, including oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties), cabbages and turnips, as well as many wild species that may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical highlands.

The pathogen enters root hairs and wounded roots. It multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots ("clubs"). Affected roots often decay before the crop has matured. Depending on the timing of infection in the crop cycle, symptoms may include wilting, stunting and yellowing of plants, or premature ripening resulting in shriveled seeds. Due to the distortion of the roots, plants may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores, which can survive in the soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant. The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural machinery), farming activities, and infected plant debris. Use of clean planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields is essential. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime and experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to be effective (see ProMED-mail post 20120521.1139354).

The species is composed of numerous pathotypes, which makes breeding crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult. It is therefore important to use multiple approaches to disease management simultaneously to counteract pathogen adaptation and extend the useful duration of both host resistances and effectiveness of fungicides.

In Canada, several of the pathotypes are known to occur, but it is not clear from the story above whether the strain in Manitoba is considered to be a new strain for the country within the pathotype group 3A. Host resistance breakdown to pathotype 5X has been reported previously from Alberta (ProMED-mail post 20180503.5780419).
