Legionnaires' disease, a [type] of pneumonia, is on the rise in New
England this year [2011], and the reason for the flare-up remains
unexplained, health officials said on Tuesday [29 Nov 2011]. Total
cases confirmed in Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have nearly
doubled from last year [2010] while many other northeastern states
were also showing sharp increases. States in other parts of the
country were not.

Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory
on Monday [28 Nov 2011] to all state health care providers to watch
for and report Legionnaires' cases after it documented 18 cases so far
this year, up from 11 in all of 2010. "This is a spike, and we need to
be looking into this and we need to alert people," Maine's state
epidemiologist, Dr Stephen Sears, told Reuters.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by inhaling an infectious dose of
_Legionella_ bacteria, usually found in contaminated water in sources
such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, showers, and faucets.

The illness, named for a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion
convention in Philadelphia, causes pneumonia and kills 5 to 30 percent
of patients, with 8000 to 18 000 people hospitalized each year.
Symptoms can include high fever, chills, chest pain, a cough, and
often headaches and muscle aches. It can be treated with antibiotics.

Hard-hit Massachusetts confirmed 211 Legionnaires' disease cases as of
23 Nov 2011, up from 118 cases in all of 2010, while Connecticut saw
72 cases, versus just 47 last year, said Jeff Dimond, a CDC spokesman
in Atlanta.

In the Mid-Atlantic, populous New York State reported 526 cases this
year compared to 379 last year, and Pennsylvania saw 450 cases, up
from 299 last year, the CDC said. By contrast, California, with its
200 cases this year, has a mere 10 more than it counted during 2010.

Maine epidemiologist Sears has spoken with his Massachusetts and
Connecticut counterparts about the jump in scattered individual cases
this fall [2011] in New England, but they have not yet managed to
pinpoint a specific reason for it. Experts were considering
possibilities such as an increased awareness of Legionnaires'
[disease] that has led to more testing, changes in climate, more air
conditioner usage, and an increase in the number of seniors, who are
more susceptible to infection. "We have looked but we haven't found
common connections at this point," Sears said. "We've found nothing
that tied the people together epidemiologically."

The Canadian province of Quebec has issued a similar advisory after a
rise in cases there, Sears said. [See ProMED-mail Legionellosis -

[Legionnaires' disease is rarely confirmed with laboratory testing
because most cases of pneumonia are treated empirically without
identifying the causative pathogen. Therefore, analyzing only reported
cases of Legionnaires' disease would severely underestimate the burden
of this disease.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that
is less severe than Legionnaires' disease. Legionellosis is generally
acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized
_Legionella_. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support
the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of
plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can
occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, cooling
towers, and car washes.
