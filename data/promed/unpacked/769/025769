High levels of _Potato virus Y_ (PVY) found in farm-saved seed potatoes
destined for the 2009 crop have prompted the National Institute of
Agricultural Botany (NIAB) to urge potato growers to get seed testing under
way if they have not already done so. NIAB head plant pathologist Jane
Thomas said while virus levels overall are lower than in some years, a
quarter of samples received by NIAB had been infected with PVY, with one in
10 tubers infected at levels high enough to cause serious damage in some
varieties. "The levels are probably a reflection of how well growers were
able to get on with their aphicide programmes last season [2008]," she said.

Virologist Adrian Fox of Central Science Laboratory [UK Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs], which also offers a virus-testing
service, said not all potato varieties are susceptible to the same viruses
but recommends testing for PVY and _Potato leaf roll virus_ as a minimum.
"It's important growers know the susceptibility of varieties to different
viruses. The safest thing to do is to test for all of them," he said.

Thomas advised growers to take soil samples for nematode testing when soil
conditions allowed. "The incidence in samples we've seen has shown a
noticeable presence of free-living nematodes, which is a worry," she said.
"They cause damage by direct feeding on roots." Other crops, particularly
carrots, may also be affected.

Growers should ensure farm-saved seed [tubers] is tested for virus to avoid
costly disease problems, warned the National Institute for Agricultural
Botany (NIAB).

While _Potato leaf roll virus_ was largely absent this year [2008/2009], a
quarter of farm-saved seed potatoes had been infected at some level with
_Potato virus Y_, one of the most serious viruses affecting crop yields and
tuber quality, said a NIAB representative. To date, one in 10 tuber samples
analysed by NIAB showed infection levels of 20 per cent.

NIAB is also advising growers to take soil samples for free-living nematode
tests, as samples have revealed high populations of _Pratylenchus_. This
could damage root crops, leading to reduced growth, yellowing and lesions.

[_Potato Virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of the
most damaging potato viruses. Different strains of PVY can cause a range of
symptoms, from a mild mosaic to severe foliar necrosis. The most virulent
strain, PVY-NTN, causes interveinal mosaic on leaves and distinctive ringed
necrotic areas on tubers. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum and some
other related species. It is transmitted by aphid vectors and can also be
spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected
planting material such as seed tubers.

_Potato leafroll virus_ (PLRV; genus _Polerovirus_) is another serious
pathogen of the crop and can be transmitted by aphids as well as seed
tubers. PLRV can also affect tomato and a number of weeds, and different
potato cultivars may show different levels of susceptibility.

Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato, and since the crop
is vegetatively propagated, many of them may be disseminated in tubers. If
virus-infected seed tubers are used, virus populations and numbers of
co-infecting species will build up with every crop cycle. This invariably
leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield. The
important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is recognised by
the strict requirements for certified seed potato production in many
countries worldwide. Disease management of potato viruses relies largely on
clean planting material, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and
vector numbers may also be useful.

Around 10 species of _Pratylenchus_ (root lesion nematodes) are known to
affect potato and other root crops. Pathogenic effects vary with species.
Some reduce yield only when present at very high levels in soil, while
other more virulent species can reduce yields already at low soil
population numbers. Usually, nematode numbers build up in soils over
several years until they reach levels that can affect crops. Management for
soil nematode diseases mainly relies on exclusion and crop rotation with
non-host species.
