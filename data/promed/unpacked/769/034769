A fox and domestic dog in Iqaluit have both tested positive for rabies. The Nunavut Department of Health reported the pair of animals suspected of infection on [8 Mar 2022] and confirmed the positives tests on Wednesday morning [16 Mar 2022].

The department is advising residents to be cautious of foxes in the area and tie up pets spending time outdoors. Pets should also be monitored for frothing at the mouth, making strange noises, staggering or otherwise strange behaviour. Animals exhibiting these behaviours should be avoided and reported to the regional environmental health office or conservation officer.

As rabies pops up in the north again this year, researchers look to predict future outbreaks [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fox-rabies-north-outbreaks-modelling-nunavut-1.6339790]. Anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a fox or dog is advised to go to the Qikiqtani General Hospital and report the incident immediately. The department warned treatment must be started quickly after exposure, "as rabies infections is almost always fatal."

The rabid dog and fox in Iqaluit are the latest in a string of rabies cases in Nunavut, which include a dog in the capital city in January [2022]. A fox in Coral Harbour and one in Chesterfield Inlet tested positive last month [February 2022].

If you see a fox or wolf wandering around the community, contact the conservation officer. If your dog had contact with a fox or wolf, call the regional environmental health officer at 867-975-4817.

[2] Canada (Ontario): bat, human exposure

http://globalnews.ca/news/8715982/hamilton-bat-rabies-public-health/


Hamilton public health says a bat who bit a resident has tested positive for rabies. In a release on Monday [28 Mar 2022], the city said the individual who was bitten is currently being treated for the virus, which can be [almost always is. - Mod.SH] fatal. It's the first positive rabid bat reported in Hamilton since May of last year (2021).

According to public health, Hamilton has an ongoing outbreak of rabies, with 330 animals testing positive for the virus since December 2015. Most of those have been raccoons and skunks, though 2 stray cats and a fox have also tested positive.

Public health says rabies is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal -- usually through a bite -- but can also enter the body through scratches, open wounds, or mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Residents should stay away from wild animals and call animal services if they see an animal they think might be infected.

Anyone who may have been bitten by an animal or had direct contact with an animal is advised to wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately or call public health. Hamiltonians are also being asked to ensure their pets' rabies vaccinations are up-to-date and contact a vet if the pet comes into contact with a wild animal, including bats.

[3] USA (South Carolina): calf, human exposure
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022

https://www.foxcarolina.com/2022/03/25/baby-cow-possibly-exposed-more-than-dozen-people-rabies-upstate/


More than a dozen people in the Upstate were potentially exposed to rabies by a calf, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). DHEC said the calf was raised near Highway 28 in Pickens County near Clemson. The calf was too young to be vaccinated against rabies, but the other cows in its herd were vaccinated.

The 13 people who were exposed to the calf have been referred to healthcare providers. But if you believe you, a family member or a pet may have come into contact with the calf, call DHEC's Greenville office.

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility coming with owning an animal. It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, your pets, and your livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind," said Terri McCollister, DHEC's Rabies Program team leader. If your pet or livestock animal is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your animal may have been exposed to rabies.

[4] USA (Washington DC): fox, human exposure
Date: Wed 6 Apr 2022
Source: Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/06/capitol-fox-euthanized-kits-found/


A mother red fox captured on Tuesday (5 Apr 2022) on the grounds of the US Capitol has been euthanized and has tested positive for rabies, said DC Department of Health officials. The DC public health lab "has confirmed the fox captured yesterday [5 Apr 2022] tested positive for the rabies virus," said DC Health.

The department said on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] that there were 9 "confirmed" bites by the fox over the past few days and it had been "humanely euthanized" so rabies testing could be done. Health officials said they were contacting "all human victims who were bitten by the fox".

Meanwhile, the animal's kits (fox babies) were found and "captured" Wednesday morning [6 Apr 2022], DC officials said. Officials would not disclose where the kits were being kept or whether they, too, would be euthanized. City health authorities said in an email they were "working to determine next steps for the fox kits".

To figure out whether an animal has rabies, it has to be euthanized, and samples from its brain tissue have to be taken so tests can be run at a lab, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 120 000 animals a year in the United States are tested for rabies, and about 6% of them are found to be rabid.

Health officials said "no other foxes" had been found on the Capitol Hill grounds but warned it would "not be uncommon to see more", because they are "present throughout" the city. City officials said they would not be doing a "roundup of healthy foxes in the area" and would intervene only to "remove wildlife if they are sick or injured" or if someone had been exposed and rabies testing would be needed. They urged anyone who encounters an "aggressive, sick or injured fox" to contact animal control.

Lauren Crossed, a wildlife program manager at the Humane Rescue Alliance whose crews were involved in the capture of the rabid fox Tuesday [5 Apr 2022], said it is "very common" for mother foxes to protect their dens and their kits. But she said the fox was "exhibiting unusual aggression, spanning an area much larger" than experts would expect for a "fox just protecting her den". Usually foxes protect their immediate area, she said, but this one was "traveling blocks to attack people".

After getting several calls about people being bitten and also seeing the fox, animal control officers and Capitol Police began a search, and eventually 2 animal control officers, Christina Best and Chelce Peterson, found the fox. According to the Humane Rescue Alliance, the fox charged at Best, who used her net to catch it.

[5] Trinidad and Tobago: livestock, vampire bats
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022

https://bit.ly/3KoDJ9Z


Farmers in Barrackpore have been counting their livestock losses following an outbreak of rabies. Within the past few weeks a number of animals have contracted rabies and 20 have died, the Express was told.

"Approximately 19 cows have died along with 2 bulls, 3 sheep and a goat," a resident familiar with the farmers' operations said. He noted the areas most affected were Cumuto Road and Cunjal Road in North Barrackpore.

A Cumuto Road farmer said he lost 3 animals. "I lost a bull, a cow that was full [pregnant. - Mod.TG], and a young bull approximately 11 months old," he said. He said he did not see any of his animals being bitten by bats. The farmer said his animals were "feeding and eating good and then just started to drift from their hind legs [wobble or stagger] one day, and then died the next". He said when he observed the affected animals, they were moving sideways as if their spines were damaged.

Agriculture minister Kazim Hosein said in a statement yesterday [24 Mar 2022] that Trinidad and Tobago has always had bat-transmitted rabies. He said there has been an increase in the number of bats in the Southern region which has a direct correlation to the current outbreak. "The Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries has a routine rabies vaccination programme and an ongoing vampire bat control programme. Currently, steps are being undertaken specific to the reports received," Hosein said.

He said some of the measures to be implemented are the vaccination of animals for rabies in Barrackpore and surrounding areas to assist those currently impacted and those that may potentially be affected; ongoing sensitisation to farmers on how to prevent this spread; working closely with the Ministry of Health to ensure any farmers or neighbours who are at risk are vaccinated; and a stepping up of human health sensitisation in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. "The Ministry is also currently investigating more effective measures of vampire bat control including strengthening the staff component and working arrangements for the Anti-Rabies Unit for effective response," Hosein noted.

[In the article from Trinidad/Tobago, the bat in question is most likely what is commonly known as the vampire bat. It is known for feeding on cattle and many other animals. There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well-known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although it will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. For a picture of _D. rotundus_ go to https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos.

These articles also show a broad range of animals can succumb to rabies virus. All mammals are susceptible to the virus. In animals, they may transmit the virus through a bite, or scratch (particularly if by a cat) and in the case of animals, it is a fatal disease. The virus is fatal to human beings as well if they either do not know they have been exposed or do not seek treatment.

Bats can transmit the virus to a sleeping human being and the person may not awaken. However, if the bite occurs from other animals, such as a dog, cat or fox, then the bite is clearly known. While we do not have treatment for unvaccinated animals, we do have treatment for exposed individuals but the treatment needs to begin very soon after the bite.

"See your doctor for attention for any trauma due to an animal attack before considering the need for rabies vaccination. After any wounds have been addressed, your doctor -- possibly in consultation with your state or local health department -- will help you decide if you need treatment known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Decisions to start PEP will be based on your type of exposure, the animal you were exposed to, whether the animal is available for testing, and laboratory and surveillance information for the geographic area where the exposure occurred.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach." (Extracted from: https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html)

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine. (People who may receive preexposure vaccination would include lab workers working with rabies samples, veterinarians, wildlife rehabilitators, game wardens and other individuals working with animals in some capacity. - Mod.TG)

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." (Extracted from: https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html) - Mod.TG]
