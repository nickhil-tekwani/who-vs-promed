At least 69 people hospitalized with dysentery symptoms in eastern Ukraine
---------------------------------------------------------------
Contaminated well water in a small town in eastern Ukraine sent at least 69
people, including 61 children, to hospitals with symptoms of dysentery,
emergency officials said Tuesday.
Fourteen children have a serious form of the ailment after drinking the
water over the weekend in Pavlohrad, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said. A failure in the municipal water supply system on 26 Feb 2000 -- a
common occurrence in Ukraine where many city water systems are outdated --
forced
residents to use water from abandoned wells that appeared polluted with
sewage flows, it said.
Dysentery is an intestinal infection whose symptoms include abdominal pain
and diarrhea.

[As I cleared by the medical authorities of the Ukrainian Research
Antiplague Institute, these cases of infectious disease were caused by
_Shigella_ (bacteria). - Mod. AV]
