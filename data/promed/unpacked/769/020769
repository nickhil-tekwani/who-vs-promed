Abstract
--------
A few animals have been suspected to be intermediate hosts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a large-scale single-cell screening of SARS-CoV-2 target cells on a wide variety of animals is missing. Here, we constructed the single-cell atlas for 11 representative species in pets, livestock, poultry, and wildlife. Notably, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 target cells in cat was found considerably higher than other species we investigated and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were detected in multiple cell types of domestic pig, implying the necessity to carefully evaluate the risk of cats during the current COVID-19 pandemic and keep pigs under surveillance for the possibility of becoming intermediate hosts in future coronavirus outbreak. Furthermore, we screened the expression patterns of receptors for 144 viruses, resulting in a comprehensive atlas of virus target cells. Taken together, our work provides a novel and fundamental strategy to screen virus target cells and susceptible species, based on single-cell transcriptomes we generated for domesticated animals and wildlife, which could function as a valuable resource for controlling current pandemics and serve as an early warning system for coping with future infectious disease threats.

[The 11 (domestic and wild) animal species addressed in the above study included pangolin, cat, dog, hamster, lizard, pig, goat, chicken, duck, goose, and pigeon.

From the exhaustive results section, we hereby present a (slightly abridged] copy of the sub-section "Systematic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risks in livestock, poultry, pets and wildlife":

"While comparing the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 target lung cells across different species, we noticed that cat clearly outweigh other species, with 13.19% in ciliated cells, compared to pig (3.35%), and hamster (3.87%).

"Moreover, when taking the proportions of SARS-CoV-2 target cells in distinct organs among cat, pangolin, and pig into consideration, it was further indicated that the proportion of [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2] ACE2 [entry receptor] and [transmembrane serine protease 2] TMPRSS2 [=entry activator] target cells were much higher in cat. For example, the proportion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells was as high as 40% in cat kidney proximal tubular cells while the proportions were only around 3% and 2% in corresponding cell type in pangolin and pig, respectively.

"We also noticed that SARS-CoV-2 target cells were widely distributed among organs within the digestive system (esophagus, rectum), respiratory system (lung) and urinatory system (kidney) of cat, implying that cats could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 via multiple routes such as dietary infections of the digestive tract or airborne transmission through respiratory system.

"To highlight SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell types, we summarized all cell types with proportion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells higher than 1%, which shows that cat, as well as pig, have more susceptible cell types than other species we investigated.

"Taken together, our data explains the observation that cats are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-28 and raise the necessity to carefully monitor and evaluate the possible roles of cat as intermediate hosts in current pandemic.

"SARS-CoV-2 replicate poorly in dog, chicken and duck. Our data suggests that the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is very rare in dog lung cells and absent in poultry lung cells (chicken, duck, goose and pigeon). Besides, it has been predicted that dog and poultry ACE2 cannot be utilized efficiently by SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein because of mutations in critical amino acids of dog ACE25. Therefore, our data, to some extent, explains why dogs and poultry are not as permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection as cat.

"Our study identified the SARS-CoV-2 target cells in distinct tissues of cat, pangolin and hamster, indicated by the simultaneous expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors: ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A detailed comparative analysis among cat, pangolin and hamster deciphered that the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 target cells in cat was much higher than in pangolin and hamster, implying that cats are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, as a companion animal, cats interact with humans more frequently than pangolins, thus we proposed that cats should be closely monitored in the current COVID pandemic.

"We found that SARS-CoV-2 target cells were distributed in a variety of cells in the kidney and lung of domestic pig. It seems to be plausible to question if domestic pigs have the potential to function as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. The reason why pigs could not support SARS-CoV-2 replication [in previous studies] seems to be an intriguing scientific question and definitely invites further investigations. Given that COVID-19 pandemic is still progressing and SARS-CoV-2 strains are constantly evolving, we need to keep monitoring and evaluating the possibility of pigs to become intermediate hosts of future pandemic."

Domestic, owned cats, have been reported from several countries as infected from their sick owners (see in "see also"); serosurveys have confirmed the susceptibility of domestic, stray and sheltered cats to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, cats have been subject to 3 published SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection trials (China, 20200402.7173286; Japan/USA, 20200514.7337185, and USA, 20200601.7416648). All 3 confirmed the susceptibility of cats to infection, as observed afield. In the Chinese transmission study, viral RNA was detected in the feces of virus-inoculated cats but the virus was not recovered from the viral RNA-positive small intestine. In the Japanese/USA trial, no virus was detected in any of the rectal swabs tested. The USA experiment did not address fecal samples.

The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats, with younger cats being more permissive and, perhaps more importantly, the virus can transmit between cats via respiratory droplets.

Fecal infectivity in free-roaming cats is epidemiologically of high significance in receptive, vulnerable settings such as the wet-markets and seafood markets, in South East Asia and elsewhere. This potential route of virus spread by cats deserves to be studied in depth, to be, hopefully, definitely excluded -- or otherwise.

The role of cats in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and between mink farms in the Netherlands is currently under investigation. It will be of particular interest to note if such spread could involve the fecal route.
