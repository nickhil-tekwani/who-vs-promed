Bovine TB [tuberculosis] case traced to Indiana farm
----------------------------------------------------
Staff of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) is
investigating a case of bovine tuberculosis (commonly called "TB" or
more formally known as _Mycobacterium bovis_ [infection]) in a beef
cattle herd in Southeastern Indiana. The TB-positive cow was
identified through routine testing at a meat processing facility in
Pennsylvania.

BOAH veterinarians are in the very early stages of conducting a
thorough investigation of the animal's movements within the state.
Few details are currently known about the herd; as the investigation
moves ahead, more information will be released.

Indiana has held a bovine tuberculosis-free status since 1984 with
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Under federal guidelines,
that status remains. The last time a Hoosier herd tested positive for
the disease was in the 1970s.

About bovine TB
---------------
Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects
primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal.
TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the
early stages of the disease, clinical signs are not visible. Later,
signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia,
low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph
node enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these
signs in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian

[The eradication of _M. tuberculosis_ from the United States cattle
herd must be a tough problem indeed as the eradication program has
been on for 81 years. The recent resurgence shows how difficult
indeed the challenge is, when it comes to getting rid of those last
few herds in the state, region, or country.

In 2007, there were 971 400 animals slaughtered and examined for _M.
tuberculosis_. Out of this population, there were 23 cattle detected
with tuberculosis and 14 of these were from foreign origin. Thus,
99.999991 percent of the bovine population was free of disease. Being
so close to disease freedom is not unusual -- many states have
disease free status.

However, Minnesota has the disease with split state status, that is,
most of the state is at the Modified Accredited Advanced stage, while
a small northwestern part of the state is just at the Modified
Accredited level. Minnesota was just downgraded as well. New Mexico
was just downgraded from Free Status in September (2008) and
California was downgraded in June 2008. Michigan, which has had a
long standing problem with domestic cattle being infected from free
ranging deer has a map of infected herds available on the Michigan
Department of Agriculture website at
<http://michigan.gov/documents/poscattle060206_ppt_161950_7.pdf>.

It is hoped that more resources will be available to finally get rid
of _M. tuberculosis_. However, several states being downgraded
recently causes some degree of consternation. Let's hope that states
will devote the resources required to eradicate this disease and
reverse this downgrading trend that seems to have popped up.
