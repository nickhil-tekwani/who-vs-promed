Another 100 000 [doses of lumpy skin disease (LSD)] vaccines for animals arrive in southern Bulgaria by the end of the month [May 2016].

The 2nd batch of 175 000 doses of vaccines against [LSD] have almost been fully applied.

At today's [27 May 2016] meeting in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, dealing with the said issue, it has become clear that the 3rd consignment of 100 000 [doses] of the vaccine will arrive earlier than expected, namely next week and not at the end of June. This will allow the immunisation of all susceptible animals in southern Bulgaria.

LSD infection in cattle has not yet been overcome; new outbreaks are reported every day. They are currently still in southern and western Bulgaria, but measures to control and limit introduction in the north of the country are being undertaken.

The meeting confirmed backing Bulgaria's efforts in obtaining the European Commission's agreement to apply the required effective measures to reduce and eradicate LSD, minimizing losses to [Bulgarian] farmers and the Member States.

The Ministry has received the support of the veterinary scientific community who have promised to draft an opinion to support their country before the European Commission.

Recall last week Bulgaria asked the European Commission to come up with a special decision on measures to tackle lumpy skin disease. The request for debate by Minister Desislava Taneva was supported by [Vytenis Povilas] Andriukaitis, European Commissioner-designate [responsible for Health and Food Safety].

[EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCPAFF) Section Animal Health & Welfare is scheduled to hold its next meeting in Brussels on 1-2 Jun 2016. The itinerary includes, among others, the following LSD-related topics:

"1. Under section A 'Information and/or discussion':

Art. A.07
Report by Greece and Bulgaria on the LSD situation.

2.Under section B 'Draft(s) presented for an opinion':

Art. B.04
Exchange of views and possible opinion of the Committee on a draft Commission Implementing Decision amending the Annex to Implementing Decision (EU)2015/1500 and Annex I to Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2055 (EC). The aim of the proposal is to further amend Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1500 and Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2055 in order to include additional parts of Greece in the lumpy skin disease restricted zones, due to the intention of the Greek authorities to extend vaccination in the regional units of Pella, Pieria and Imathia.

Legal Basis: Council Directive 92/119/EEC, in particular Article 19(1)(a), (3)(a) and (6).
Procedure: Examination procedure.

Art. B.05
Exchange of views and possible opinion of the Committee on a draft Commission Implementing Decision laying down the conditions for setting out the programme for emergency vaccination of bovine animals against lumpy skin disease in Bulgaria and amending Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/645. The aim of the proposal is to set out the conditions for the programme for emergency vaccination of bovine animals against lumpy skin disease in Bulgaria and to amend the Annex to Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/645 as a result of disease spread to the regions of Blagoevgrad, Kyustendil, Pernik, Plovdiv and Smolyan.

Legal Basis: Council Directive 92/119/EEC, in particular Article 19(1)(a), (3)(a) and (6).
Procedure: Examination procedure."

It may be assumed that Bulgaria's farmers, similarly to their Greek counterparts, strive to apply, the soonest, preventive LSD vaccinations in districts hitherto unaffected, particularly those bordering the affected region. For such measures, EU's agreement is required. - Mod.AS]

50 000 shots, donated by the European Union, are being used in the past 5 days to vaccinate cattle against lumpy skin disease [LSD].

Vaccination has been launched in the worst-affected areas in eastern Macedonia, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy Mihail Cvetkov said Friday [27 May 2016].

In the meantime, the shots procured by Macedonia for EUR 700 000 from a company in South Africa -- considered thus far the only manufacturer of the shots in the world -- are expected to arrive this week.

"We have been informed there is another company that is also producing these vaccines in addition to the South African company. ... The required amounts of vaccines are due to arrive and the cattle will be vaccinated. Hopefully, the entire process will be completed as soon as possible," Cvetkov told reporters attending an event marking Wheat Day 2016 in Skopje [see comment].

[Details about the vaccine "in addition to the South African" one will be appreciated. Is this a bovine-strain vaccine or based upon another capripox virus?

LSD has become a disease of major concern in Europe. Without preventive vaccination, its further spread will be difficult if not impossible.

Earlier in May 2016, EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) held a workshop in Brussels addressing LSD, with the participation of experts from South East European countries and the Middle East. International organisations participated as well.

Lumpy skin disease has been one of the 4 diseases attaining particular attention during the 84th General Session of the OIE, Paris, closed on Fri 27 May 2016. According to OIE's published press release, the 4 diseases were:

1. The global epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds, for which countries must continue their surveillance efforts, both in domesticated birdlife and in wild birds;
2. Bluetongue, a vector-borne disease with a global reach;
3. Lumpy skin disease, another vector-borne disease, typically endemic in Africa, which spread to the Middle East, then to Europe in 2015;
4. Infection with peste des petits ruminants virus (PPR); more than 25 percent of countries have reported the presence or suspicion of PPR in 2015 and at the beginning of 2016. - Mod.AS
