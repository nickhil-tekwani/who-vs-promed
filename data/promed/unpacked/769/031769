There are 2 suspected cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Los Lagos region; confirmation is awaited in the coming hours. The Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministry] official, Eugenia Schnacke, provided the information to this radio during a working day carried out in Puerto Montt with sector officials, [health] professionals, and technicians concerning the control and management of this virus.

The regional health official confirmed that there is a case in the Osorno hospital and another in Puerto Montt from Maullin, and they await prompt confirmation; both patients in stable condition.

The head of the Zoonoses Department, Alejandro Parada, indicated that to date there is a 50 percent fatality rate in detected cases in the region, a number above the national average, which is 30 percent.

He indicated that both patients were hospitalized this past week [week of 24 Aug 2015] and their exams [samples] were sent to the hantavirus laboratory in Valdivia, with results awaited within the coming hours.

It is worth noting that so far this year [2015] there are 8 confirmed cases of [infection by] this virus, or which 4 have died. Given this [situation], the Health SEREMI called the attention of the populace that they take precautions and not be exposed to the long-tailed mouse, considering the high degree of rural conditions that exist in the region, and the impact that forest fires have had on the migration of the rodents.

[Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases is no doubt Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. The diagnostic system has been substantially improved. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical because of the speed with which the disease progresses and the urgency of proper treatment.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rats (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm.
