In regards to the ProMED posting cited above -
As noted in the MMWR article, Basidiobolus is a wide spread fungus. It can
be isolated from the tropics to the high northern latitudes and every
continent except Antarctica (2 and references within). It can be isolated
from leaf litter and detritus and may represent a significant part of the
soil mycofauna in certain areas. Studies in England by Smith and Callaghan
(1) demonstrate that this fungus is resident in the soil with propagules
measured at high frequency at all times of the year (44% of all samples).
However this is not universally true. Basidiobolus could only be isolated
in 3.8% of soil and litter samples taken in the subtropical climate
surrounding Tampa, FL (2). In this environment the summer soil
temperatures exceeded 40 C in bright sun; growing hyphae of Basidiobolus
are killed at these temperatures. The stability of Basidiobolus spores
(conidia and zygospores) in the soil is unknown. In general,
entomophthoralean zygospores and conidia are quickly inactivated in the
environment unless sheltered from the sun and desiccation (2 and references
within). However, I have been able to recover cultures from completely
dried out media in the laboratory environment, so the propagules have some
durability
In contrast to the soil, this fungus could be recovered from 61% of all
amphibians collected in the same area of Florida (3). This rate of
recovery is similar to that observed in other environments (4,5). The
colonization frequency varied between 90% for _Rana uticularia_ to 50% for
_Hyla cinerea_. In general, Basidiobolus is very easily isolated from
fecal pellets of reptiles and amphibians in all areas studied (2 and
references. within). This has lead some to speculate that the primary
reservoir for Basidiobolus in many environments may be the intestinal
contents of amphibians and reptiles (2). Basidiobolus could not be cultured
from ground water sampled from where I collected colonized frogs. The type
of association that Basidiobolus has with its amphibian or reptile host is
unknown, however intestinal colonization with this
fungus does not appear to be detrimental to the host (personal observation).
In contrast cutaneous infection can lead to rapid death (6-8).
In the hot dry environment of Arizona, I would speculate that Basidiobolus
spores would not survive long under direct sunlight. It may be more
probable that fecal matter from resident reptiles or amphibians in soil or
poorly washed vegetables is the original source of the inoculum in the
cases from Arizona.
Human infections apparently were once common in tropical Africa in the past
(9-12) with only rare reports of recent Basidiobolus infections. These were
well covered in the MMWR article. In the older literature, some infections
spontaneously resolved without treatment. This complicated determining the
efficacy of antifungal chemotherapies. In an in vitro study by Yangco et
al. (13) the antifungal activity of the imidazole derivatives miconazole
and ketoconazole were shown to be superior to amphotericin B, 5-FC and
potassium iodide.
A note to those researching the literature  the taxonomy of the genus is
in revision. All species with the exception of _B. microsporus_ should be
considered synonyms of _B. ranarum_.
