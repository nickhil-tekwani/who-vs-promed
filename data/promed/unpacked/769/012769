Health Minister of the province Roberto Schwartz confirmed the death of a 2-year-old admitted last Sunday [21 Feb 2016] to the San Luis Hospital with characteristic symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Schwartz, who described the outbreak as "sporadic," said the province has the inputs and technology needed to diagnose and treat the disease, which occurs by exposure to bacteria in poorly cooked meat or through (poor) food processing.

The minister recommended using domestic prevention measures such as cooking red meats, especially hamburgers, sausages and meatballs, at a suitable temperature, and washing hands before handling food, as well as appropriate kitchen hygiene to avoid cross-contamination of food.

The case that triggered the alert was preceded by that of a child from Mendoza, who vacationed in San Luis and entered the hospital on 28 Jan 2016 with the same diagnosis.

[It is far from clear whether the 2 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome presenting more than 3 weeks apart are related. Most cases of HUS are post-diarrheal and are almost always secondary to enteric infection with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ such as serotype O157:H7. Rarely, non-diarrheal cases of HUS occur and may be due to non-infectious causes.

Typically, HUS develops after 5 to 13 days of illness with the onset of diarrhea being day one. Although sometimes prolonged, the usual incubation period of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ diarrhea after exposure is 3-4 days (1) but can be as long as 10 days. The gastrointestinal illness is usually quite prominent, with bloody diarrhea and significant abdominal pain but without significant fever. HUS, however, has been reported in patients with asymptomatic infection with the organism (2, 3). Post-illness shedding of EHEC can be prolonged, contributing to secondary cases, but it is probable that transmissibility is greatest during the initial diarrheal phase (4).
