The latest update from state health officials shows 40 confirmed cases of blastomycosis in an outbreak associated with the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County. That's 2 more confirmed cases than a week ago. The number of suspected but probable cases remains at 37.

Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores from decaying leaves and wood. These spores get kicked up when that earthy bed is walked on. The Department of Health Services tied the outbreak to people spending time along the Little Wolf River after Memorial Day weekend in May [23-25 May 2015].

Symptoms can take 2 to 15 weeks to develop. Those symptoms include cough, fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint, or chest pain. Because the symptoms are similar to a bad cold or mild flu, and we're heading into flu season, anyone who has these symptoms should call their health care provider and let them know if you were involved in any recreational activities near the Little Wolf River.

[The number of cases of blastomycosis continues to increase. ProMED-mail last reported a total of 29 (now 40) confirmed cases and 29 (now 37) probable cases of blastomycosis linked to the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County, Wisconsin (ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - USA (04): (WI) more cases, RFI 20150903.3621585).

The initial 4 cases were associated with tubing [see link below for explanation. - Mod.SH] on the Little Wolf River. However, we are not told whether these additional cases were linked to tubing on the Little Wolf River or to some other type of activity. Their exposure likely started on Memorial Day weekend (23-25 May 2015), but we don't know if it is thought that the exposure is continuing. More information would be appreciated in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

A photo of the Little Wolf River is available at the source URL above. A map showing the location of the Little Wolf River tubing campground in Waupaca County, 6 miles (about 10 km) west of the town of New London, can be found at https://goo.gl/bLtUWg. A county map of Wisconsin can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/wisconsin-county-map.gif. The length of the tubing trip is either 1.5 or 4 miles (2.4 or 6.4 km) down the not very rapid Little Wolf River (http://wolfrivertrips.com/river-trips/first-time-tubing-useful-info/).
