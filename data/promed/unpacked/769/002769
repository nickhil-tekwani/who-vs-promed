[The 19th meeting of the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD)'s Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe (SGE ASF19) took place as a teleconference on 23 Feb 2022. A total of 15 countries in Europe took part, as well as the representatives of GF-TAD from Asia and the Americas, the European Commission, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE; Office International des Epizooties), and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

According to the meeting report (https://rr-europe.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sge_asf19_report_vf.pdf), Russia noted the following:
"- Wild boar (WB) surveillance: in free zones: 407 samples and no positives. In non-free zones, 13 895 samples, and 0.3% were PCR positive. Population of WB is reduced in the affected regions until the density reaches a low level. Zones with new outbreaks: both far east, Caucasus, near Vladimir, and near Pskov.
- Domestic pigs: in free zones: no confirmed outbreaks. In non-free zones: 700 farms tested, and 1800 backyards tested. 9 cases confirmed in backyards.

"The risk of ASF spread in 2022 in the Russian Federation is assessed as high. Outbreaks of infections can occur in any of the regions of the country."
