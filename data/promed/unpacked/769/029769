Norovirus Reporting
-----------------------
[The following comment from Robert Jue relates to the initial part of the
2nd paragraph of part [2] of the ProMED-mail post entitled "Viral
gastroenteritis, cruise ships - UK, USA (03) 20060610.1623." This reads:
"The reason you hear about norovirus on cruise ships is because they are
required to report every incidence of gastrointestinal illness," said Dave
Forney, chief of the vessel sanitation program of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Protection, in a statement. "Nowhere else in the public
health system of the United States is norovirus a reportable illness." -
Mod.CP]
I would like to point out that, contrary to the last sentence in the above
quote that: "Nowhere else in the public health system of the United States
is norovirus a reportable illness," in fact, the State of Idaho has added
norovirus to the Reportable Disease List. See link to chart at
