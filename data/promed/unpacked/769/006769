Outbreaks of pool-related diarrhea rise in USA
----------------------------------
ATLANTA (Reuters) - The number of Americans who got diarrhea from
swallowing fecal contaminated water in swimming pools and other
recreational facilities rose in the 1990s, partly because many people were
continuing to swim while sick, federal health experts said on Thursday [24
May 2001. Diarrhea is often considered more of a nuisance than a serious
illness, [but it can cause severe dehydration and is especially dangerous
to pregnant women, young children, and those with weak immune systems.
About 10 000 cases and 32 outbreaks of waterborne diarrhea [were linked to
pools, waterparks, spas, and other facilities in the United States from
1989 to 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in Atlanta. The number of outbreaks rose to an all-time high of 10 in
1997-1998, the latest period for which data are available. Only one
outbreak was reported for the 1989-1990 period.
CDC said it was surprised to find that about 18 per cent of respondents in
one state continued to swim while suffering from diarrhea. "Clearly it is
happening and it is happening on a regular basis, so we need to get people
to think differently about when they have diarrhea," said Michael Beach, an
epidemiologist with the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. "It
is a common illness, but it doesn't mix with swimming," said Beach, who
noted that one person with diarrhea could contaminate an entire swimming
pool for several days.
Most of the recent outbreaks of diarrhea linked to swimming pools were
caused by cryptosporidium, a microscopic chlorine-resistant parasite. Pools
become contaminated during fecal accidents, often by young children
[waering diapers. CDC said [that people should refrain from swimming
until two weeks after diarrhea has stopped. It added that outbreaks could
be limited by improved public awareness of diarrhea and changes to swimming
pool policies, such as the inclusion of bathroom breaks for kids and
separate water filtration systems for children's pools.
Swimming is the second most popular exercise in the United States.
Americans make between 360 to 400 million visits to swimming pools each
year, especially during the hot summer months. "We don't want to scare
people off swimming, but we want people to swim responsibly," Beach said.

[The latest issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report includes
the original reports on which the above article is based. One of these
describes outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with pools in Ohio and
Nebraska in 2000. The other describes a study carried out in 1999, in which
none of the 293 stools collected from 47 participating pools following
fecal accidents were found to contain cryptosporidium but 13 contained
giardia, another pathogen responsible for prolonged diarrhea and
malabsorption. The reports are available online at:
