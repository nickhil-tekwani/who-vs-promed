[Outbreaks in this far eastern part of the Russian steppes are rare. The nearest outbreaks were in NE Kazakhstan in 2012, so I think we can assume a similar ecology. The custom in these steppe communities is for a herdsman to collect the village livestock in the morning and take them out to the area of community grazing. Any animal dying is butchered and the carcass, hide, and head brought back to the owner in the village in the late afternoon and given to the owner. The latter may be a junior member of a family and to prove that he had not stolen the animal the hide will be stretched and dried, and the head deposited on the house roof to be checked and counted when the actual family owner of this herd visits. If the death is not reported there is always the opportunity for human cases among those given or buying the meat from this animal. - Mod.MHJ
