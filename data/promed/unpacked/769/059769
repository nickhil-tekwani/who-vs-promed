_Listeria_ is a bacterium that can cause food-borne illness, known as listeriosis. It can grow in foods such as uncooked meats, vegetables, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized milk.

The current foodborne illness outbreak is listeriosis, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and has killed 1 person in Florida.

If more infections are coming falls outside the CDC's current knowledge. Here's what Friday's [23 Oct 2020] update from the CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeat-10-20/index.html] says the agency does know:

How many cases are there and where are they? This is either a small outbreak or an outbreak tracked early, as there have been 10 cases so far -- 7 in Massachusetts, 2 in New York, and 2 in Florida. All required hospitalization.

What's the food cause? The CDC says after interviewing 9 ill people; "all reported eating Italian-style meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations."

But a single store, brand, or manufacturer hasn't been identified.

[Multistate] outbreak of _Listeria_ infections linked to deli meats: Investigation notice, posted 23 Oct 2020; https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeat-10-20/index.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to deli meats.

Latest outbreak information
---------------------------
At a glance
Reported cases: 10
States: 3
Hospitalizations: 10
Deaths: 1

"10 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ have been reported from Florida, Massachusetts, and New York. All 10 ill people were hospitalized. One death has been reported from Florida. Epidemiologic evidence shows that deli meat is a likely source of this outbreak. In interviews with 9 ill people, all reported eating Italian-style meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations. A specific type of deli meat and common supplier have not yet been identified."

In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_ include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products such as, smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats, that do not require further cooking before eating. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source. - Mod.ML
