Disease at Auburn's Raptor Center kills birds
--------------------------------------
The future of Auburn University's Raptor Center seemed bright in
2002, when one of its trained eagles circled above the opening
ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Utah to the delight of millions
of viewers across the world.
But 18 months later, a deadly disease has swept through the center's
birds, and the subsequent out come threatens to cripple an important
place for promoting conservation and rehabilitating injured birds
from across the South.
The Southeastern Raptor Rehabilitation Center at Auburn was founded
in the mid-1970s. The center's medical unit each year takes in
hundreds of injured raptors, meat-eating birds of prey with sharp
talons and hooked beaks that include eagles, hawks, falcons, and owls.
The center also keeps 20 to 25 birds in its education collection to
promote conservation. They are used for school lectures as well as
flyovers such as the one at the Olympics and before Auburn home
football games, when the "War Eagles" circle the stadium and swoop
down toward a handler on the field.
But in late December 2002, one of the education raptors died suddenly
and tested positive for _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_, a disease known
to devastate poultry operations but whose effect on raptors is
largely unknown. More birds were infected with the bacteria in the
following months, and a string of them had died from the disease by
late March 2003.
12 birds from the education collection died, and 13 more from the
medical clinic tested positive for the disease and were euthanized.
The bacteria even spread to Auburn's famed football game eagles,
Spirit and Tiger, who won't be able to do flyovers this fall.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service eventually placed the entire
center under quarantine and revoked its permit to accept, treat, and
release injured raptors
Tiger and Spirit are both doing "very well," said the Center's
veterinarian, Jill Heatley, noting that their weight loss may have
been due to a diet problem, not disease. But she said there are no
plans now for eagle flyovers at this fall's Auburn games.
A spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service said that the Raptor
Center has been considered a "very good, respected center" and that
the agency is still waiting for Auburn to submit information about
the infections.
"Our decision to tell the Raptor Center to stop taking birds in and
releasing them is solely because the number of mortalities indicated
something was wrong," agency spokeswoman Christine Eustis said.

[_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ (MG) infections have commonly been called
Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD). It is primarily a respiratory
infection and most frequently occurs subclinically. It lasts the life
of the bird, but is of no public health significance. The disease
ostensibly is worldwide in distribution.
[The following refers to infection in poultry. - Mod.JW]
MG has few outwardly observable clinical signs, other than decreased egg
production and decreased feed efficiency. _Mycoplasma_ spp. infections would
probably remain dormant until the bird is stressed. A sudden change
in environment, vaccination, or heavy (peak) egg production triggers
spread of the disease.
MG is transmitted through direct contact between susceptible birds and
infected birds. The disease is spread primarily by airborne dust or droplets
and by contact with contaminated equipment, although it can also be
transmitted through the egg to the offspring. Transmission usually occurs
through the respiratory tract and often 100 percent of the birds become
infected, although very few show signs. Time of incubation or from contact to
outbreak can be as short as 4 days & as long as 3-4 weeks. However, as the
article stated, this is primarily a disease of domestic flocks, and there is
not much known about this disease in raptors. It is assumed that transmission
is the same, and that the disease would last the entire life of the bird or
result in death of the bird.
Although this is a tragic event, hopefully something can be learned
from these birds. - Mod.TG]
