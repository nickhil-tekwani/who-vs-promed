"Mute Swans, an alien invasive species that is spreading in the wild
in southern Ontario, are highly susceptible to infection with
_Sphaeridiotrema_."

Mute swans may be highly susceptible to infection with
Sphaeridiotrema, but quite a legion of very well informed birders and
ornithologists strongly disagree with the present official U.S. &
Canadian government position that mute swans are "an alien invasive
species." In fact, mute swan fossils have been found throughout North
America, and many early observers of bird life in North America
reported seeing mute swans, based on their physical descriptions and drawings.

The perspective that mute swans are non-native has been successfully
pushed by people who blame the presence of mute swans for their
failure to re-establish trumpeter swans in various habitats, and by
people who find mute swans to be generally a bit of a nuisance.

However, I was present at a Connecticut public hearing on mute swan
eradication in January 1990, at which no less an authority than the
late Roger Tory Peterson stood up and in about 10 impassioned minutes
completely demolished the state wildlife agency's case against mute
swans as non-native.

The leading advocate for mute swans as a native species in recent
years is Kathryn Burton (<KBurton759@aol.com>), who has waged
extensive litigation on the mute swans' behalf.

Burton has an extensive website documenting her case that mute swans
should be classified as a native species, occurring naturally
throughout the northern hemisphere as well as having often been
translocated by humans. See: <http://www.savethemuteswans.com/>,"Save
our Swans: Mute Swan, Citizen of the World"

[This slight deviation from the main story is a one-time only, and
put up to merely correct a possible error as to the perceptions of
the original distribution of this bird species. No further discussion
on the origins of mute swans in North America will be entertained.
But it does raise an interesting point as to their apparent
susceptibility to this trematode. Clearly it is not due to an alien
status. - Mod.MHJ]
