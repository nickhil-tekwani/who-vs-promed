Rabbits are at risk from a fatal 'new to Dorset' disease, according to vets. Dave Cumber Vets in Weymouth have recently treated 4 fatal cases of the rabbit disease. The 1st confirmed case was in Blandford in August this year [2017].

The surgery is now advising rabbit owners in Dorset to have their pets vaccinated against a newer strain of viral haemorrhagic diarrhoea - VHD2. Dave Cumber said: "Most of our rabbit-owning clients have their pets vaccinated annually with a combined vaccine against myxomatosis and VHD1. This November [2017] we have had 4 very sick rabbits brought into our Weymouth surgery and sadly all have died. The cause of death has been established at post mortem to be the VHD2 disease. The standard combined vaccine will not protect your pet against VHD2, and we strongly recommend that all rabbit owners in the area consider having their pets further vaccinated with a specific vaccine against VHD2. The 1st confirmed case of VHD2 in Dorset was in Blandford in August this year [2017] and these 4 cases are the 1st we know of in Weymouth to be confirmed as VHD2."

If your pet rabbit starts to display any of the following signs then contact the vet immediately as the disease is highly contagious and can be fatal: generally off colour, not eating and listlessness.

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). It is one of the 2 notifiable infectious diseases of Leporidae included in OIE's list (the other one is myxomatosis).

Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90 per cent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 per cent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission, and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from one to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards.

Requirements for vaccines: indirect control of the disease is easily achieved by vaccination. Although the capsid RHDVs has been expressed as recombinant VPLs, as of 2015 the vaccines used are inactivated vaccine prepared from livers of experimentally infected rabbits, and thus inactivated and adjuvanated. Vaccinated animals quickly produce solid protective immunity against RHDV infection (within 7-10 days), and experimental data indicate that protection lasts for a long period (over one year). As RHDV2 is a distant antigenic subtype or even a 2nd RHDV serotype, combined vaccination with both antigenic types, or the use of a vaccine homologous to the RHDV strain identified during the epidemics or the outbreak, is highly advisable.

The above and additional information on RHD is available in OIE's terrestrial Manual chapter 2.6.2, "Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease," at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf. - Mod.AS
