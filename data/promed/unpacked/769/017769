Bird flu has killed 590 ducks in a northern Viet Nam province, the
5th to have reported outbreaks among poultry within about a month,
the government said on Wednesday [7 Nov 2007].

The 2-month-old ducks started dying on Monday [5 Nov 2007] at a farm
in Ha Nam province [See No. 6 on the map available at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/VietnameseProvincesMap.png>].
Tests confirmed on Wednesday [7 Nov 2007] the presence of the H5N1
bird flu virus, the Animal Health Department said in its daily report.

Further tests also found the H5N1 virus in samples taken from 2 dead
chickens dumped in a river in Ha Nam province, 60 km (37 miles) south
of Hanoi, the report said.

The case in Ha Nam brought to 5 the number of provinces that have
confirmed bird flu in poultry since early October 2007. Three of the
provinces are in the north, one is in the southern Mekong delta,
while the 5th is in the central province of Quang Tri.

Floods that affected Quang Tri in the past 2 weeks could help spread
the virus to nearby areas, an Agriculture Ministry official said.

No human infections have been reported in Viet Nam since the virus
killed a teenager in early August 2007, one of 4 deaths among 7
Vietnamese known to have been infected this year. Since 2003, bird
flu has killed 46 people in Viet Nam.

Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed 205 people out of 334 known
cases, with most of the deaths in Indonesia, Viet Nam, Thailand and
Egypt, the World Health Organisation figures show.
