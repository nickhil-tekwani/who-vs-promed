Birds on 2 poultry farms in Suffolk and Norfolk have tested positive
for a strain of avian flu.

Vets from Defra carried out the tests at Bernard Matthews breeder
sites at Arran farm near Yaxham, Norfolk and Laurel farm, in
Ubbeston, Suffolk.

The birds tested positive for avian influenza but not the highly
pathogenic H5 or H7 types.

Defra has not advised a cull of the birds but has placed a movement
restriction on them.

A Defra spokesman said: "A routine veterinary investigation is
ongoing at poultry premises into the possible presence of a
notifiable avian disease. Laboratory tests are ongoing, and there is
no conclusion yet. Routine veterinary investigations into notifiable
diseases occur on a regular basis. It is a legal requirement to
notify the Animal Health Agency of the possibility of such diseases
whenever these cannot be ruled out by a vet or an animal keeper as
part of the diagnosis of illness in animals or birds."

A 2nd series of tests is taking place to identify the strain of influenza.

Bernard Matthews said in a statement: "Whilst the 2 small breeder
farms remain under movement restrictions until Defra has completed
its tests, other operations continue to run as normal. As a
precautionary measure and out of a duty of care for our employees, we
have sought guidance from the Health Protection Agency and are
providing Tamiflu treatment to our staff, who work on the affected
farms. Avian influenza is a disease of birds that continues to pose a
threat to poultry flocks both in the UK and around the world. Bernard
Matthews has in place clear procedures to identify avian influenza
and, under the direction of Defra, the ability to control and
eradicate the disease without posing any risk to public health."

A routine veterinary investigation is ongoing at 2 poultry premises
in East Anglia into the possible presence of notifiable avian
disease, Defra has confirmed today [26 Feb 2009].

Animal Health began the investigation late on Tuesday evening [24 Feb
2009]. Laboratory tests are ongoing, and there is no conclusion yet.
However, laboratory results so far have confirmed the presence of an
avian influenza virus, and that it is neither H5 nor H7.

Restrictions remain in place on the premises while the investigation
continues. No further precautionary restrictions are considered
necessary in the area at present.

Routine veterinary investigations into notifiable diseases occur on a
regular basis. It is a legal requirement to notify the Animal Health
agency of the possibility of such diseases whenever these cannot be
ruled out by a vet or an animal keeper as part of the diagnosis of
illness in animals or birds.

[The above Information Bulletin also included the following useful
Notes to Editors:

- Avian influenza is a disease of birds. Whilst it can pass very
rarely and with difficulty to humans, this requires extremely close
contact with infected birds, particularly feces.
- All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low pathogenic, but so far,
only H5 and H7 are known to have the potential to become highly
pathogenic.
- For further information, please visit the avian influenza pages on
the Defra website:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2009//animalh/diseases/notifiable/ai/index.htm>.
- AI has been found in Great Britain on the following occasions:

1. June 2008: Highly pathogenic H7N7 found among chickens on a
premises near Banbury in Oxfordshire.
2. January/February 2008? H5N1 Avian influenza confirmed in 11 wild
birds in the Chesil Beach area in Dorset.
3. November 2007 - H5N1 avian influenza on a turkey farm near Diss, Norfolk.
4. June 2007 - H7 Low pathogenic avian influenza near St Helens,
Merseyside, England.
5. May 2007 - H7N2 Low pathogenic avian influenza in Corwen, Conwy,
North Wales.
6. February 2007 - 2nd case in UK of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry,
found in Upper Holton, Suffolk.
7. May 2006 - Low pathogenic H7N3 in chickens in Dereham, Norfolk.
8. April 2006 - Cellardyke (Fife, Scotland).
9. October 2005 - High pathogenic H5N1 found in birds in quarantine
in Essex (although that did not count as an outbreak, as they were in
quarantine).

The final results of the serotyping are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS]
