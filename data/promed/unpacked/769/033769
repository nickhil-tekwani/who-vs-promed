The Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) has detected new cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Kavango West region's Mpungu constituency.

The new cases were detected while the DVS was undertaking surveillance in the area of the Mpungu constituency, which borders the Ohangwena region where there was an outbreak of FMD last month [May 2015]. The outbreak of FMD was also detected in some parts of Oshikoto, Oshana, and Omusati regions.

Chief animal health technician within the Directorate of Veterinary Services in the Kavango East region Veikko Hausiku told Nampa yesterday [16 Jun 2015] that the 1st FMD cases were detected on 7 Jun 2015 at 2 farms in the Ukwangali Traditional Authority that borders on Ohangwena.

Hausiku said the DVS has now started vaccinating all livestock in the Ukwangali Traditional Authority that borders Ohangwena, with the vaccination campaign set to go on until Thu [18 Jun 2015]. According to the Chief Animal Health Technician, the vaccination will be extended eastwards of the Ukwangali Traditional Authority, depending on the availability of the vaccine.

The surveillance was necessitated as the cattle in the Ohangwena region often cross into the Mpungu constituency to graze, hence the need to inspect them and establish whether FMD has spread to that part of the Kavango West region.

Hausiku called on farmers to bring their cattle to crush pens to be vaccinated against FMD.

The 1st cases of the disease were detected at the Ondama Yomunghete crush pen on 11 May 2015 and at the Okalupalona and Onehanga crush pens on 12 May 2015, while more cases were detected on 13 May 2015 at the Okakango village in the Okankolo constituency in the Oshikoto region.

As a result of the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry imposed a ban on the marketing of cattle and cattle products in the north-central regions of Namibia. The movement of animals has also been restricted, and abattoirs in those regions are negatively affected.

Government is said to be spending about N 119 million [USD 600 000] on the vaccination of close to 1.2 million head of cattle against FMD.

FMD is spread by the movement of infected animals and animal products. Contaminated vehicles, clothes, shoes, and other objects can also contribute to the spread of the disease.

[The situation in the Northern Namibian FMD-buffer zone, where vaccination is allowed, is rather confusing. The new event, in Kanango West, seems to be a 3rd event on Namibia's territory this year [2015].

According to the official information in the WAHID web-site, the 1st event started on 12 Jan 2015, was confirmed on 13 Jan 2015, and was notified to the OIE about 4 months later, namely on 18 May 2015. The causative agent has remained un-typed, with only one focus/outbreak included. See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17073.

The 2nd event reportedly started on 11 May 2015, was confirmed on 13 May 2015 and was duly notified to the OIE on the same day (13 May 2015). This event includes, so far, 4 outbreaks, of which 3 were in Ohangwena and one in Oshikoto. The causative agent has been serotyped as SAT2. For the reports and map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17724.

Official notification of the new event in Kanango West, including information on the serotype involved and statistics, is anticipated.

Namibia is one of 12 OIE member countries which are recognised as having an FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter 8.7. of the Terrestrial Code, Edition 2014. The zone was designated by the Delegate of Namibia in a document addressed to OIE's Director General in February 1997. The list of countries with FMD-free zones without vaccination was updated in May 2015 and is available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/list-of-fmd-free-members/.

The current event is in an infected zone where vaccination is allowed. - Mod.AS
