Booster vaccination of farm livestock for the Asia-1 strain of the
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus has begun in Russia's Primorsky
(Maritime) territory. This vaccination develops steady immunity
against the disease in the cattle.
All in all, the vaccine has been given to 125 000 head of cattle and
small ruminants and about 100 000 head of swine.
The situation with the FMD in the Primorsky territory has stabilized
by now, as no new cases have been reported from the farms for several
days running
Slaughtering of cattle affected by the virus has been practically
over, but quarantine will remain in force until mid-October 2005 in 9
population centers and 8 districts where cases of the disease were
reported earlier.
In the meantime, the territorial farming sector is computing
[calculating?] losses from the epidemic, and deputies of the
territorial legislature say the authorities will have to allocate 20
million rubles to 25 million rubles [USD 881 000 - 951 000] from the
budget to compensate for the farmers' losses alone.

[According to an official report to the OIE of the Russian
authorities, dated 10 Sep 2005, the recent Asia 1 outbreaks in the
territories of Khabarovsk and Primorsk, eastern Russia, bordering the
People's Republic of China, affected "unvaccinated animals of
different ages".
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/a_current.htm#Sec0>
The report indicates that the outbreaks started "around 15 Aug 2005",
affecting bovines in 2 villages in Khabarovsk (susceptible 529, cases
177, no deaths, destroyed 194) and 7 villages in Primorsk
(susceptible -- not specified, cases 805, no deaths, destroyed 516).
It will be of particular importance to note if the clinical
observations also covered pig farms; and if the pigs did show
clinical signs, or were found (serologically) to be subclinically
infected. This, in view of the significant role pigs may play in the
dissemination of the FMD virus, and assuming that FMD virus Asia 1
might be widely spread in China, from where more information is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
