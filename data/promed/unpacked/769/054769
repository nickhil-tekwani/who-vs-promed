The Holston Army Ammunition Plant says it is canceling deer hunts at Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Kingsport due to a disease that is devastating the deer population.

According to plant officials, the decision was made as a result of an outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), which it says already killed several deer late last summer [2017].

The installation will not hold any deer hunts during the upcoming 2018 season due to the low deer numbers.

Plant officials say the deer population will be monitored during the upcoming year. Experts that say if the numbers recover, the installation hopes to resume hunting in 2019.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: Orbivirus), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America, there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2 and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were 1st reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. - Mod.PMB
