Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) is testing 2 dead bison for anthrax.

It may just be 2 dead bison, but Wood Buffalo National Park is testing
recently-discovered carcasses for anthrax.

[According to Troy Ellsworth and Jeff Shatford these 2 carcasses were found
along Highway 5 within the WBNP. It appears that WBNP staff burned these
carcasses after taking samples. These were sent together with the NWT
samples to the Lethbridge diagnostic laboratory on Tuesday (10 Aug 2010).
Results are not expected until sometime next week. - Mod.MHJ]

ENR officials hopeful anthrax outbreak is winding down
------------------------------------------------------
Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) officials said they are cautiously
optimistic that the anthrax outbreak among bison in the Slave River
Lowlands (SLR) may be over. Ella Stinson, an ENR spokesperson, said 45
bison carcasses have been located within the 8 kilometer (5 mile) area
since the outbreak was 1st detected in June 2010. Two carcasses were
located recently, though they had been dead for a period of time, Stinson
said. "They're not new ones," she told The Hub on Friday. "The fact that
these 2 are old is leading us to believe it is (winding down)."

All the carcasses have been incinerated on site, Stinson explained. The
surrounding soil was also treated with a sterilant.

The animals are believed to have contracted the disease either by grazing
on contaminated sedges or by kicking up contaminated dust. The area, which
is located 80 kilometers (50 miles) south east of Fort Resolution, is only
accessible by boat or ATV. Stinson said surveillance flights over the
affected area are expected to end sometime this week, after which time
officials might declare the outbreak over.

There have been 14 outbreaks of anthrax in the Slave River Lowlands and
Wood Buffalo National Park between 1962 and 2007.

[There has been some confusion lately because 2 bison carcasses were also
reported found in the Wood Bison National Park to the south of the Slave
River Lowlands. According to Troy Ellsworth, NWT Wildlife and Environment
SRL Manager, the 2 SRL bison were found on 26 Jul 2010 and were estimated
to have been dead for at least a week when found. That would put their
deaths at around 16 to 19 Jul 2010. All being equal let us hope that this
SRL epidemic is over. - Mod.MHJ]
