A Comment on the Possible Presence of West Nile Virus in the UK
---------------------------------------------------
Should West Nile virus be found in UK birds, it is pertinent to remember
that West Nile virus isolates can be phylogenetically placed into 2 lineages.
Lineage 1 contains isolates that have caused symptomatic disease in humans.
Lineages 2 contains isolates that, to my knowledge, are exclusively from
Africa and have not been associated with any symptomatic disease or perhaps
some mild illness. Lineage 2 virus strains may work their way up from
Africa more often that we realize, as it is likely they would be overlooked
if they don't cause symptomatic disease other than being picked up in
serosurveys of the nature reported here.
It would be of interest to see whether an isolate can be obtained from UK
birds to confirm that West Nile virus is circulating and to determine to
which lineage this virus belongs.
