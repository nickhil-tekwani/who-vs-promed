The dengue fever epidemic appears to be on the decline, but the spread of another mosquitoborne disease is still going strong. Close to 500 people have been infected with chikungunya [virus] this year -- compared with a total of 60 cases in the 3 years between 2010 and last year [2012].

In the week ending 3 Aug [2013], 21 people were infected -- 16 in the Bukit Timah area, one in Jalan Papan in the Jurong area, and one in Woodlands Industrial Park, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Health.

Although it is not known where the other 3 people were bitten, none of them had been overseas recently.

[The number of chikungunya virus infections in Singapore continues to climb steadily. On 25 May 2013, 184 cases were reported. Now, there are nearly 500. No mention is made about what, if any, vector mosquito control measures are being taken. If dengue virus infections have been ruled out in these cases, those reported as chikungunya virus infections are presumably laboratory confirmed.
