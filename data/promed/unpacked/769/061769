Six children have died, and many more are sick following an outbreak
of Kala-azar [leishmaniasis] in Wajir, northern Kenya. The disease
has spread dramatically since March this year [2008], and over 180
cases have been reported across the district.

On-going drought has exacerbated the situation, and high levels of
malnutrition and low immunity have meant that local communities,
especially young children, are vulnerable to the disease.

The sand fly, often found in dry river beds and mud huts, bites the
victim transferring a deadly strain of the leishmania parasite. If
left untreated, the parasite can spread to the internal organs and
kill the person.

Working closely with the Ministry of Health and other NGOs, Merlin is
the lead agency working to tackle the disease across the district.

Children aged between one and 5 are particularly vulnerable to
Kala-azar, and so we've set up a specialist centre to treat patients
and stop the disease spreading. Currently, 42 children are being
treated by our expert medical team at Wajir district hospital.

We have also drafted in Merlin's Kala-azar expert, Dr Maurice, to
provide expert guidance to medical teams operating across the region.

Dr Maurice commented: "If left untreated, Kala-azar can lead to
substantial swelling of the liver and spleen ultimately resulting in
death. However, it can be treated with a simple course of
antibiotics. We give health workers the skills, knowledge and
equipment to manage the outbreak effectively."

Kala-azar is endemic to the area, however, few people are aware of
the symptoms and treatment available. To make sure local communities
know about the disease, Merlin are mobilizing an existing network of
village volunteers, helping them to educate the largely pastoralist
community about prevention techniques such as bed nets and sprays.

[ProMED has reported on the outbreak in Wajir previously. The ongoing
outbreak is probably sustained by a continuous flow of refugees from
neighboring Somalia with poor nutritional status, presence of the
sand fly vector, and a local reservoir in rodents. - Mod.EP]
