Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials confirmed anthrax in one calf on a Jim Hogg County premises on [1 Jun 2018]. This is the 1st anthrax case in Texas this year.

The premises is located about 30 miles [48 km] south of Hebbronville and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other cattle on the premise prior to release of the quarantine. "TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation," said Dr Susan Rollo, TAHC state epidemiologist. "Producers are encouraged to remain vigilant and consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are exposed to anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock."

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Anthrax cases in Texas are historically found in the triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona, and Eagle Pass. This area includes portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties. A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas.

Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and decompose quickly. Livestock or animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official.

If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts, and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Texas can be seen at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5846451,64220. Jim Hogg county is in southern Texas; see http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/texas/texas-county_outline-2010.pdf. It is in an area of now sporadic outbreaks of livestock and cervid anthrax.

A number of animals were noted to have died on this ranch without recent cases but samples from just this yearling calf were submitted to TAHC for laboratory confirmation. It happened 10 days after a bout of rain. This "10-day interval" is not uncommon with this disease in southern and western Texas. Whether it is due to multiplication of the pathogen in the wet soil, or aggregation of dispersed spores, or a spurt in grazing forage in a spore-contaminated singular low-lying spot which attracts hungry animals, must await an enthusiastic graduate student. But traditionally it is the latter explanation that seems to best fit the circumstances. If pathogen multiplication in soil were common and effective, we would never see this disease disappear. But this is not the case. If one can prevent soil re-contamination through vaccination and proper carcass disposal, all it needs is 6-10 years without outbreaks for the risk to be very significantly reduced, even disappear. Just don't trust fate by digging and excavating. - Mod.MHJ]
