Master of Science program in biohazardous threat agents and emerging
infectious diseases
-----------------------------------------------
Georgetown University is initiating a Master of Science program in
Biohazardous Threat Agents and Emerging Infectious Diseases. The program is
sponsored by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the School of
Medicine and is being coordinated by Dr. Leonard Rosenthal. The one-year
course of study is intended to provide a thorough introduction to
biodefense and emerging infections for persons planning careers in
medicine, scientific research, or public policy, including various branches
of government and private industry.
The program, which begins 1 Sep 2004, includes the following courses:
Microbiology of Biological Threat Agents and Emerging Infectious Diseases
Bioterrorism
Biosurveillance: an Applied, Multidisciplinary Perspective
Biological and Radiological Safety
Threat Analysis and Principles of Biodefense
Chemical Threat Agents
It also includes several seminars that will provide in-depth discussions of
biological and chemical threats and biosurveillance. Electives are also
available in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and in the
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
The deadline to register for fall term is 16 Aug 2004. A brochure for the
program can be obtained at
