Alberta Health Services and the CFIA are verifying that industry is removing recalled products from the marketplace.

[Chicken as well as turkey are unusual primary sources of enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ infections in humans. It is possible that another ingredient in the sausage such as the garlic or that the chicken was cross-contaminated with the pathogen during processing. Either way, adequate cooking of the sausage with appropriate kitchen hygiene would have prevented the infections.

It would be interesting to know whether there is DNA fingerprinting of the isolates to see whether they are related to the recent larger Alberta outbreak of EHEC associated with pork products (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall 20140909.2759887). No information is given here regarding the age of those affected or whether hemolytic-uremic syndrome occurred in any of the 4 cases. - Mod.LL
