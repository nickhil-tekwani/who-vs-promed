The Nigerian president has expressed deep concern over a high number of unexplained deaths in the northern state of Kano, amid fears they could be caused by Covid-19.

President Muhammadu Buhari said a lockdown would be imposed in Kano for an additional 2 weeks and that he was sending a government team to investigate.

Nigeria's Health Minister Dr Osagie Ehanire says the situation is being "monitored closely." But following preliminary investigations, the state authorities have dismissed a connection with coronavirus.

Hundreds of people are rumoured to have died in the community, but no official death records are being kept.

Grave diggers initially raised concerns that they were burying a higher than usual number of bodies. Ali, a grave digger at the Abattoir Graveyard, told the BBC: "We have never seen this since the major cholera outbreak that our parents tell us about. That was about 60 years ago."

This week, the state governor issued a statement saying the "mysterious deaths" were unrelated to coronavirus. But after ordering a "thorough investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the deaths," the state governor announced that preliminary findings "indicated that the deaths are not connected to the Covid-19 pandemic."

The state government said: "Reports from the state ministry of health have shown that most of the deaths were caused by complications arising from hypertension, diabetes, meningitis and acute malaria. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is earnestly awaiting the final report from the state ministry of health so as to take the necessary action."

As the commercial and industrial centre of the north, Kano has become the epicentre of coronavirus in northern Nigeria. Its highly dense population is still in lockdown in an effort to contain the spread of the [SARS CoV-2] virus.

State officials started testing for Covid-19 2 weeks ago, and one lab has had to close due to contamination. Samples are being sent to the capital, Abuja, which authorities say is causing a delay in announcing how many positive cases have been detected in the state.

Dr Sani Aliyu, who is the national coordinator for the presidential task force on Covid-19, says a team of 5 medical experts were deployed to Kano to facilitate reopening the testing centre this week after it was fumigated. Officials also plan to open a 2nd lab, at Bayero University, for testing for Covid-19 from next week.

It is unclear how many people have died, as the deaths causing concern are happening in the community. Deaths in many parts of Nigeria are not registered, and so for those who died outside of hospital, no records are kept. This makes it difficult to understand how many people have died in recent weeks.

Sabitu Shaibu, the deputy head of the state task force on Covid-19, is hoping to release preliminary findings of the investigation by next week but believes that most of the rumoured 640 deaths are from natural causes and says the figure is below the average death rate for Kano.

Hospital records, which provide the only death register available, are thought to provide lower numbers than the real picture across the state.

Those on the investigating taskforce say they will conduct "verbal autopsies" with family members to help establish why people are dying.

Private hospitals, which provide for a significant part of health provision in the region, have been closed due to coronavirus fears. This could mean a lack of support for those with existing conditions who may have died as a result.

Dr Nagoma Sadiq, who works at the Aminu Kano Hospital, thinks this could be behind the additional deaths, but he is also not ruling out coronavirus.

"It is shocking to most of us that the count of the dead is alarming. But it's likely due to the reduction in the number of health institutions available in the state, because there are a lot of hypertensive patients, diabetic patients, asthmatic patients, cancer patients, and they don't have much access to the hospitals. The lockdown is affecting everybody. Our poor majority don't even have a vehicle to take them to the hospitals."

Grave digger Ali agrees, adding: "Some say the current situation is due to the epidemic; others say it's difficulties of life. People have so many problems in their lives and a lack of peace of mind."

However, Covid-19 is known to be more dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, so it could be that the deaths are related to coronavirus. The only way to know for sure is to test for coronavirus.

Dr Sadiq also said that there was still a concern about an ongoing Lassa fever infection amongst communities. The state has had 5 confirmed cases and one death, according to the most recent report from the Nigerian Centre For Disease Control.

Kano currently has 77 positive cases of coronavirus with 3 deaths. Authorities are urging the public not to panic.

[Based on this and other published reports, it is difficult to determine what the real situation is in terms of the numbers of deaths or their cause. The number of deaths is conflicting. The above 28 Apr 2020 BBC report indicates that it is unclear how many people died, but there are 640 rumored deaths from "natural causes," with none, or perhaps 3, due to SARS CoV-2 virus infections. A 9 Jun 2020 CNN report indicates that there are 979 deaths, around half of which may be due to SARS CoV-2 virus infections (https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/africa/nigeria-spike-in-deaths-covid/index.html).

The difference between the 2 reports could be due to the number of deaths increasing from late April 2020 to early June 2020, with the April 2020 peak in cases due to "natural causes," from reports from the state ministry of health indicating that most of the deaths were caused by complications arising from hypertension, diabetes, meningitis, and acute malaria. The deaths following the April 2020 peak may have been due to SARS CoV-2 virus infections, but no laboratory results are reported to confirm that.

Lassa fever is mentioned in passing but is very unlikely to be a significant contributor to the total death count, since this time of year is well past the peak of cases in Nigeria.

ProMED would be interested in any additional information that would determine the number of cases and their cause of death.

An ongoing epidemic of any single pathogen can certainly result in excess mortality for other "conventional" ongoing medical conditions due to the disruption it causes in health care systems, including closure of hospital and clinic facilities and fear of seeking medical attention. This is a phenomenon we have observed in recent Ebola epidemics in sub-Sarahan Africa and in the current COVID-19 pandemic. But the situation in Kano state bears watching and further investigation to ensure that an unconventional outbreak, whether of Lassa fever or otherwise, is not missed. - Mod.LXL
