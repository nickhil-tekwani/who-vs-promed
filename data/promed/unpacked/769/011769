A Hucknall vet is warning pet owners to be extra vigilant after
treating 3 local dogs for suspected poisoning. The cases were all
discovered at the Orchard House Veterinary Centre on Vine Terrace
inside one week. It is feared the animals had been affected by the
mysterious seasonal canine illness (SCI).

It is suspected that the complaint develops after the dogs have been
walked in areas of woodland and is caused by a natural substance that
occurs in the autumn. In the last 2 years, 11 dogs have died in
Nottinghamshire as a result of SCI. Of the local cases treated at
Orchard House, one of the pets had been walked in woodland around
Papplewick. Another had been taken to Blidworth. Daniella McCready,
clinical director of Orchard House, said: "We have seen a similar
problem during the last few years when dogs have been walked in
certain local woods during September, resulting in vomiting,
diarrhoea, lethargy, and kidney failure. Unfortunately, some dogs have
died in previous years."

Previous investigations have failed to identify the exact cause, but
blue green algae, which grow in ponds and lakes, have been suggested
as a possible trigger. Dogs do not need to drink infected water to be
affected, but merely have to walk in the infected areas and then lick
their paws. Other areas of particular concern that are popular with
dog-walkers from the Dispatch district include Sherwood Forest,
Blidworth Woods, Sherwood Pines, and Thieves Wood in Ravenshead.

Miss McCready added that dogs that contract SCI "often deteriorate
despite intensive treatment." She advised that if owners suspect their
dog might have been affected, they should seek veterinary attention
immediately. Other owners should also take extra caution when walking
their pets.

The Forestry Commission is working with the Animal Health Trust to
identify the cause of the illness.

Anyone whose dog displays similar symptoms has been asked to fill in a
questionnaire on the Animal Health Trust's website. Nottingham
University's veterinary school is also carrying out research.

[Blue green algae blooms can be thick, but for a dog to get enough on
their feet to kill them, might be a bit of a stretch. Furthermore,
they are walking their dogs. Are the dogs allowed to wade or swim in
the water? Are there any reports of dogs having been in the water in
any fashion that succumb to this illness? At the moment, the blue
green algae theory seems to be all there is. - Mod.TG]
