Dr Pedro L Alonso, director of WHO Global Malaria Programme applauded Iran's remarkable development in elimination of malaria in his meeting with the Iranian deputy health minister Alireza Raeisi.

The 2 met on the sidelines of the 1st WHO Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health on [30 Oct-1 Nov 2018] in Geneva, ISNA [Iranian Students' News Agency] reported on [Fri 2 Nov 2018].

According to WHO 2017 malaria report, Alonso said, the incidence rate of malaria in Iran has decreased significantly from 12 000 people in 2000 to 57 in 2017.

The Iranian official said that malaria is mainly transmitted from other countries, especially Pakistan.

Getting close to total elimination of malaria and substantial reduction in tuberculosis, he added, are among the outcomes of healthcare reform plan, which has led to major improvements in health condition in Iran.

The 2 officials also discussed setting up a 3-party committee between Iran, Pakistan, and WHO to prevent malaria from being transmitted into Iran and to control the disease's dissemination.

According to the World Malaria Report 2017, Iran is targeting elimination by 2020. Trends in Iran have declined from 1847 to 81 cases between 2010 and 2016. The report presents a comprehensive state of play in global progress in the fight against malaria.

It is indeed an important achievement, but as pointed out, continuous introduction of new cases from Pakistan is a challenge and may result in limited local transmission. - Mod.EP
