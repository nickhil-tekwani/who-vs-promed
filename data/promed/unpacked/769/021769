Japan's health ministry was cited as saying the number of incidents of
_Salmonella_ food poisoning exploded in the first three months of this
year, sickening 1,770 people, almost five times the average number for the
same period during the last three years.
The figure included a massive outbreak among elementary school students
that left 1,100 children in Tokyo and the nearby Kanagawa and Iwate
prefectures suffering from fever and diarrhea.
Still the ministry did not provide an explanation for the sudden rise in
incidents, but noted the import of foreign hatched chicks for poultry
farming and egg production was a possible entry route into Japan for the
bacteria.
A ministry official added the rise in _Salmonella_ incidents has been a
trend over the last five years.
Last year, 11,000 people suffered from _Salmonella_ in 499 incidents of
food poisoning -- three times larger than in 1992.
_Salmonella_ has been the leading cause of food poisoning in Japan since 1992.
