Fiji Ministry of Agriculture kills bacteria-infected cattle
-----------------------------------------------------------
Fiji's ministry of agriculture says it has slaughtered more than 30 of
the 282 cattle infected with the brucellosis bacteria. The disease
causes late-term abortion and infertility in cattle, while it can also
lead to fever in humans.

The ministry's veterinarian officer, Robin Achari, says the infected
cattle are distributed among 14 farms in North Tailevu, with one
suspected case in the south. Mr Achari says all sick animals have been
quarantined and will be killed.

"We're slaughtering, removing all the positive reactors from the farms
as soon as possible. We have just managed to slaughter 32 at this
point in time; and the meat has been inspected and cleared, if not,
then discarded."

Robin Achari says the meat is safe for consumption, but people should
stop drinking unpasteurised milk or risk infection.

However, New Zealand's Food Safety Authority senior advisor, Kathleen
Shaw, says cooking meat should make it safe to eat, but adds it's not
good practice to eat products from any sick animal.

Task force formed to find origin of Brucellosis
-----------------------------------------------
A task force has been formed to investigate the origins of the
outbreak of the infectious cattle disease brucellosis and map out
plans to completely eradicate it from the country.

Ministry of Primary Industry Spokesperson Joe Ulilakeba said they are
confident that the disease is being contained.

Uluilakeba said tests on cattle continue around the country and so far
out of the 3371 cattle tested, 282 have tested positive to brucellosis
and all confirmed cases are confined to the Wainivesi and Waimaro area.

Meanwhile, Minister for Primary Industries, Joketani Cokanasiga, has
reiterated that the meat from cattle slaughtered after being found
with Brucellosis is safe to eat and was thoroughly inspected by 2
highly qualified meat inspectors.

He stresses that nobody in Fiji eats meat raw and has suggested that
people get their facts right before jumping to any conclusion and
creating fear amongst the people.

[Since 2005, when OIE introduced a new disease reporting system
(WAHID/WAHIS), Fiji submitted periodical reports for 2007; no reports
are available for the years 2005, 2006 and 2008. According to the 2007
report, Bovine brucellosis (a disease cause by _Brucella abortus_) was
not present in Fiji during 2007; the year of its last, previous
occurrence was indicated as "Unknown."

Though bovine brucellosis is caused by _B. abortus_, cattle can be
infected also by _B. melitensis_, the causal agent of ovine and
caprine brucellosis; no information on the status of this bacterium in
Fiji is available in WAHIS.

According to FAO statistics (FAOSTAT) for 2007 (estimates), there are
315 000 head of cattle in Fiji. The cow milk production in 2007 was
estimated to be 58 000 tons. There are also 270 000 goats; this
species is susceptible in particular to infection with _B.
melitensis_, but may be infected by _B. abortus_ as well.

Knowledgeable sources are encouraged to provide updated information on
the animal disease situation in Fiji. In case cattle brucellosis is
new to Fiji, the current outbreak is expected to be officially
notified to the OIE.

According to FAOSTAT (most recent data 2005, 2006) Fiji imported some
cattle from New Zealand and Australia. _B.abortus_ was, reportedly,
absent in both countries since 1989.

The official name of Fiji is the Republic of the Fiji Islands. The
country occupies an archipelago of about 322 islands, of which 106 are
permanently inhabited, and 522 islets. The 2 major islands, Viti Levu
and Vanua Levu, account for 87 percent of the population (estimated,
July 2008, to be 944 720). A map of Fiji is available at
