[Ref: SS Vaish et al: First documentation on status of barley diseases
from the high altitude cold arid Trans-Himalayan Ladakh region of
India. Crop Protection (2011) 30, 1129-1137;
DOI:10.1016/j.cropro.2011.04.015]
-------------------------------------
Cold arid trans-Himalayan Ladakh region of India bordering with
Pakistan and China is one of most elevated inhabited regions of the
world. Barley (_Hordeum vulgare_) is the most important staple crop
occupying 54 percent of the total acreage of 22 443 ha, [but] the
status of barley diseases has not yet been explored.

Extensive field surveys were conducted for the 1st time during
2004-2005. and 475 fields were inspected at 95 locations. Yellow rust,
powdery mildew, leaf spot blotch/blight, covered smut, loose smut,
foot/root rot and cereal cyst nematode causing molya disease were
encountered during the survey. However, yellow rust, molya and
foot/root rot were found as the most destructive diseases. Excellent
hotspots of these diseases were identified, which may be used for the
screening of barley genotypes [for disease resistance] and determining
the impact of climate change on plant diseases.

Barley contaminated with smut spores as seed might be the reason for
higher prevalence of the smut diseases. Farmers were unaware about
seed treatment and the rouging of smutted ears.

The severe cereal cyst nematode and foot/root rot may be related to
light soils with low organic content and the use of glaciers water for
irrigation. Dispersal of nematode cysts could also take place through
movement of soil with high winds.

Regular outbreaks of yellow rust might be attributed to spread of
spores from Kargil (India) and Pakistan and favorable local
conditions. Higher incidence and severity of yellow rust, leaf spot
blotch/blight and powdery mildew along running surface water is
attributed to higher humidity.

Most of the diseases showed their clustering in Khalsi, Nobra, Leh,
Kharu and Kargil as compared to Nyoma and Durbuk. This may be
attributed to weather conditions conducive to the development of all
the encountered diseases. Cereal cyst nematode and foot/root rot
showed their prevalence at almost all the localities in the Changthang
valley.

The work provides useful information for developing disease management
tactics to achieve regional food security. It also emphasizes the need
of regular surveys and surveillance of the diseases for risk
appraisal.

[Cereal cyst nematodes (CCN) include _Heterodera avenae_ and other
species in the genus. They can cause significant yield losses on most
cereal crops when populations are high.

All other diseases mentioned above are caused by fungi:
- stripe rust (also called yellow rust) on cereals by closely related
species and their strains of _Puccinia_; barley stripe rust by _P.
hordei_ only affects barley;
- powdery mildew of barley by _Blumeria graminis_ f. sp. _hordei_, one
of the major diseases of the crop;
- leaf spot by _Ascochyta_ species;
- net blotch (also called leaf spot blotch) by _Pyrenophora teres_
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.);
- covered and loose smuts by _Ustilago_ species;
- foot (or root) rots by _Pythium_ or _Rhizoctonia_ species.

For more information on the diseases, see previous ProMED-mail posts
in the archives and links below.

National crop pathogen surveys like the one described above provide
valuable information for agricultural management, increasing food
security and addressing international biosecurity issues. The data
also make important contributions towards the knowledge of individual
pathogens (including geographical 1st reports and new species), their
epidemiology and distribution.
