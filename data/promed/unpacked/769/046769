Public health officials are urging residents to take precautions to avoid
hantavirus [infection].

Previously, 2 cases of hantavirus [infection] were reported in Kiowa County
in February and Fremont County in early May [2008]. The patient in Kiowa
County died [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080310.0970].

"This year's [2008] heavy snowpack has provided moisture for ample
vegetation that provides food for rodents, and often results in a large
jump in both mouse populations and infection rates," said John Pape, a
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment epidemiologist who
specializes in animal-related diseases.

Hantavirus is a serious respiratory disease carried by deer mice
[_Peromyscus maniculatus_. - Mod.TY], which are common to rural areas
throughout the state. Deer mice are brown on top and white underneath, with
large ears relative to their head size. The virus can infect humans who
inhale dirt and dust contaminated with deer mice urine and feces when
working in rodent-infested structures.

"May, June, and July are the months when most of our human cases occur,"
Pape said. "Before people begin cleaning structures that have been closed
up all winter, they need to take precautions if there are accumulations of
mouse droppings and other signs of mice."

Before cleaning rodent-infested structures, health department officials
recommend ventilating the area for 30 to 60 minutes. Watering down areas
where dust, dirt, and mouse droppings have accumulated with a bleach and
water mixture is also suggested.

"Just vacuuming an area without first wetting it down doesn't provide the
necessary protection," Pape said. "If you are living in rural areas and
have deer mice around, you can assume there is some risk of exposure to
this virus. The more live mice that are present, the greater the risk."

Hantavirus [infection], which is fatal in nearly half of the cases, begins
with high fever, severe body aches, headache, and vomiting. Within 1-5
days, the illness quickly progresses to respiratory distress, including a
dry cough and difficulty breathing when the lungs fill with fluid. The
symptoms begin from 1-6 weeks after exposure. There is no effective
treatment for hantavirus [infection], said Pape.

"When hantavirus infection is suspected or confirmed, early admission to a
hospital where careful monitoring, treatment of symptoms, and supportive
therapy can be provided is most important," he said. "If you become ill
with these symptoms, it is important to tell your physician about possible
exposures to deer mice or rodent-infested environments."

[Although the identity of the hantaviruses involved in these cases was not
specified in this report, most likely it was Sin Nombre hantavirus, which
is closely associated with _Peromyscus maniculatus_. For an image of a deer
mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, see
