After a record-breaking year for rabies cases in Carroll County
[Virginia], health department officials expect the high rate will
continue into 2006.
Testing of animals that came into contact with people, pets or
livestock confirmed 18 positive cases of rabies through November
2005, said Larry Petrie of the Carroll County Health Department.
That's more in 2005 than all the other years Petrie has worked for
the health department combined.
While Petrie doesn't see the rabies cases decreasing anytime soon,
people can avoid complications simply by vaccinating their pets, he
noted. "I think we'll have a situation like this next year," he told
The Gazette. "That's why it's so important to get your pets vaccinated."
It takes a while for a rabies outbreak to run its course, agreed
Terry Woods, Carroll's animal control officer. "It can take 2 or 3
years before it will ever peak," he said. And scattered cases of
rabies will continue to occur, he added.
Most cases this year have been found in raccoons, but it's also
infected several skunks, a cat and a fox.
Just saying it's been an active year for rabies in Carroll is an
understatement. More confirmed cases of rabies have been reported in
Carroll than in any neighboring locality. Patrick County comes closes
at 15 [confirmed cases], and Wythe [county] is next with 11 confirmed
cases. Grayson [county] only had 6 and Floyd [county] had 3.
3 people in Carroll had to undergo treatments after taking in an
infected kitten that scratched and bit them.
Several unvaccinated dogs were euthanized after getting into scrapes
with infected animals, including one Great Pyrenees that defended
children from an attack by a rabid raccoon on Coulson Church Road.
But a dog and a cat with vaccinations that encountered a rabid
raccoon that invaded their home through a pet door got by with only
45-day confinements and booster shots.
Petrie said rabies is likely present in many more animals, because
the health department only tests when humans or animals may have
contracted rabies.
But people wouldn't have to worry about their pets if they had them
vaccinated, he pointed out. Which is why Carroll will sponsor yet
another a rabies vaccination clinic 10 Dec 2005 at various locations.
Shots will be provided at a discounted USD 6.50 each. Places and times include:
8:30 to 9 a.m. at Coon Ridge Grocery on U.S. 52
9:15 to 9:45 a.m. at the Sylvatus Ruritan Building on Virginia 100
10:15 to 11:15 a.m. at the Dugspur Rescue Squad building just off U.S. 221
1 to 1:30 p.m. at Nester's Store on U.S. 58 in Laurel Fork
2 to 2:30 p.m. at Gladesboro Elementary School
Galax veterinarian Joe Turk reminds pet owners of the grim facts:
"It's 100 percent fatal. There's no cure. The bottom line is to get
your pets vaccinated," Petrie said. "That really is the best thing you can do."

[Rabies has been an increasing problem as people encroach on wildlife
habitat and urban areas and wild animals cohabit.
This article does not tell us if this raccoon rabies, bat rabies, or
some other strain of rabies. In all likelihood, this is a raccoon
strain. Raccoon-associated rabies was present in Virginia in 2003.
Although earlier in 2005 a teenage girl was treated and survived
rabies, there are currently no such treatments for pets. One of the
best ways to help prevent rabies in the community is to vaccinate
pets. - Mod.TG]
