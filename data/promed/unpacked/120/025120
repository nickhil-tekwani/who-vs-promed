The Kawaoka Lab's Justification
-------------------------------
I'm wondering whether those discussing the Kawaoka lab's experiments
have seen a presentation Dr. Kawaoka recently gave on the risk
assessment that led to the decision to move from a BSL-4 facility to
a BSL-3:

The direct link to Dr. Kawaoka's slides is the following:

Does the information here change anyone's conclusions?

On Responsibility for Assignment of Containment Levels
---------------------------------------------------
The most critical issue raised by the Kawaoka work with the 1918
chimera at BSL-3 is not that of the assignment of containment levels
for specific experiments, rather, it is that there is no effective
national system ensuring consistency, responsibility, and good
judgment in such research.
In addition to reverse genetic engineering of influenza, Dr. Kawaoka
has NIAID funding to perform reverse genetic engineering of Ebola
virus. Similarly, Dr. Katze of the University of Washington in
Seattle has proposed to conduct aerosol challenge of primates with
influenza containing up to 5 of the 1918 genes at BSL-3. (These
grants may be viewed in the NIH CRISP database.)
As was noted in the Sunshine Project's recent report on IBCs, even
the 1st reported creation of a 1918 chimera and subsequent
experiments at the USDA BSL-3ag facility in Athens, GA were not
reviewed by any IBC. Thus, it is unclear how USDA arrived at its
determination of BSL-3ag containment (not BSL-4) for its experiments
with 1918 constructs.
It is reasonable to suspect that more laboratories will become
interested in pandemic influenza and other experiments involving
manipulation of very dangerous viruses (e.g. SARS). As such
experiments proliferate in the absence of binding rules, there is a
distinct danger that the lowest containment level assigned by any IBC
will become a de facto standard for similar experiments elsewhere. To
wit, the University of Washington is presently trying to convince
USDA to release 1918 constructs to it, despite the fact that
UW-Seattle does not have a BSL-3ag facility. (That's not an
endorsement of USDA's BSL-3ag designation -- it is an illustration of
how biosafety levels are being dragged down.)
Unfortunately, several years after the 1918 construct experiments
began, the formal federal advice for containment in pandemic
influenza experiments remains BSL-2. At a recent meeting of the NIH
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), it was stated that the RAC
will not use its abilities to effectively compel compliance with its
advice (through limiting access to funding). Rather, the RAC will
provide voluntary "points to consider" to Institutional Biosafety
Committees which, as the Sunshine Project recently demonstrated, are
frequently dysfunctional. This is woefully inadequate.
At the RAC meeting, the Sunshine Project submitted 11 written
questions concerning the absence of an enforceable system imposing
responsibility on PIs, IBCs, and institutions conducting such
research. These included a pointed question about national and
international availability of tamiflu. Sadly, none of the questions
was answered by the RAC and, in fact, when I spoke at the meeting,
the RAC Chair deemed my concern about its reticence to flex its
muscle to ensure safety with pandemic influenza and other experiments
as "irrelevant", because the RAC has (by means unknown) already
decided it will produce nothing more than 'points to consider' in
response to concerns raised about safety in experiments such as Dr.
Kawaoka's.
Responsibility is needed that extends beyond the moral responsibility
that some PIs accept. I mean laboratory safety regulation (not
guidelines) that establish potential criminal and civil liability for
PIs, IBCs, institutions, and funders in the event of an accidental or
deliberate release. 30 years ago at Asilomar, biotechnology
practitioners agreed to an accountable and responsible IBC system,
and thereby they forestalled regulation. But now, that system is no
longer accountable and, in too many cases, no longer responsible.
The answer is not to quarrel over biosafety levels for a particular
experiment, rather, it is to impose accountability and liability
through comprehensive laboratory safety legislation, something the US
does not have.

[No support has been expressed so far by correspondents for the
decision to conduct reverse genetic experiments with the 1918/19
pandemic strain of Influenza A (H1N1) virus at containment level 3
rather than containment level 4. It is hoped that those conducting
this type of research will take note of the concern expressed by
ProMED-mail correspondents and will reconsider their risk
assessments. This thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
