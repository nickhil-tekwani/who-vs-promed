[The original email version of this post had an erroneous comment (by me) stating human disease was associated with ingestion of raw milk. That is true of _mycobacterium bovis_ and not _mycoplasma bovis_. This erroneous comment has been removed. My apologies for this error. - Mod.MPP]


Dangerous illness continues to spread across the lands and dairy farms of South Canterbury. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) has ordered to slaughter all the ill cows from the 1st farms according to their new program of depopulation.

Since the last July [2017] bacteria has spread across 8 dairy farms. There are 21 properties that stopped their work by quarantine restrictions from the ministry.

The disease is spreading quickly and it is dangerous to all dairy consumers. Ministry has proclaimed that infected animals must be culled. After this, farms will be disinfected by professionals and will be left for some period empty, to handle the stand-down time.

Meanwhile, the representatives of Ministry have officially confirmed that all the stories that came up after _M. bovis_ has spread usually just a product of someone's imagination. They don't believe that these bacteria can survive inside the soil for a few years.

According to the official statement, there has been only one case in the history when these bacteria caused a bovine type of tuberculosis.

They confirmed that dangerous [bacteria] cannot survive in a soil. They explained the stand-down time, as the measure to ensure that animals will not be infected.

Officials believe that if silage was properly prepared, it would not spread the bacteria. There had to be a normal level of pH of 4 or lower.

We must still remember that there is no risk for people because of bacteria. Only the cattle may be hurt. It can affect the production, and it is true, but it can't harm the human being.

MPI assured that they will send veterinarians to check the health of animals and their readiness to leave the farm and handle the transportation. They confirmed that veterinarians will check cattle carefully before they will be slaughtered.

[The spreading of this disease is sad news for the bovine industry, especially the dairy sector. Having incorrect information refuted is critical to keeping accurate information before the public. We are most sorry for those premises facing depopulation. We continue to wish them luck and hope this disease is controlled/eradicated shortly.
