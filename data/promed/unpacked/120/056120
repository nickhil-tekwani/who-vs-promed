The Prefecture of Maua is investigating the cause of the death of a 12-year-old boy, a resident of Jardim Primavera. It is suspected that he was a victim of spotted fever, disease transmitted by a tick. The child died on Mon 23 Jun 2014, a week after being admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of the CHM (municipal hospital) of Santo Andre. According to the Prefecture of Santo Andre, the confirmation of the cause of death of the child will take about 20 days, when the results of laboratory tests performed by the Adolfo Lutz Institute in the Capital are expected.

The 1st suspicion of the disease was only raised by the doctor of [the emergency room in Bangu], in Santo Andre, on the same day that the boy was referred to CHM. The Prefecture of Maua stated that the procedures in the care of the boy were performed according to the symptoms presented -- pain in ankle -- and that there were no problems observed in the X-ray performed.

Residents in Jardim Primavera are frightened by the possibility of one more death caused by spotted fever. The disease already caused the death of 3 people of the same family in 2005. The victims were, until then, the most recent cases reported in the city.

The department of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Municipal Department of Health reported that from January to May of 2014, 3 people in Piracicaba died due to spotted fever. In 2014, 30 suspected cases have been reported and the 3 confirmed cases resulted in the death of the patients.

The numbers for 2014 are above those recorded in the same period of 2013 when, until May, 25 cases of spotted fever and one confirmed death were reported. This month of June (2014), the secretariat has begun orientation activities in health units, reinforcing the need for the population to report frequently in areas of risk to assist in the diagnosis of the disease.

In 2013, 141 suspected and 10 confirmed cases were reported. Of these 5 died and the other 5 were cured. The 131 remaining cases were discarded.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America.

It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (an area that is red and has small, confluent bumps) at the wrists and ankles, before becoming petechial (red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage) and purpuric (purple spots) involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
