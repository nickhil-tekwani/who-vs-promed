[3] UK: earliest case, March 2022?

Yesterday [28 Sep 2022], the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) released a new report [https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu/] on the monkeypox outbreak in Europe and noted that the 1st specimen identified through retrospective testing in the United Kingdom was on 7 Mar 2022, and the earliest date of symptom onset was reported on 17 Apr 2022.

The UK Health Security Agency, in contrast, confirmed the 1st UK case in the current global outbreak on 7 May 2022.

[4] Virus sequence mutational patterns

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
An epidemic of monkeypox virus (MPX virus) infections has arisen in May 2022 in non-endemic countries particularly in Europe among men having sex with men, whose extent is unprecedented. Since May 2022 we implemented MPX virus diagnosis by real-time PCR at university hospitals in Marseille, southern France. Here, we performed DNA metagenomic analyses of clinical samples from MPX virus-infected patients between June and July 2022, using next-generation sequencing with Illumina or Nanopore technologies. The 25 samples taken from 25 patients were studied. This allowed obtaining an MPX virus genome for 18 patients, essentially from genital skin lesions and rectal swabbing. All 18 genomes were classified in the MPX virus B.1 lineage, and we delineated 5 sublineages (A-E). We detected a high number of mutations (66-73) scattered along the MPX virus genomes relative to the genome obtained from a human in Nigeria in 2018. Some non-synonymous mutations occurred in genes encoding central proteins, among which transcription factors and core and envelope proteins. They included 2 mutations that truncate RNA polymerase subunit RPO132 and a phospholipase D-like protein, which suggests gene inactivation. In addition, we identified that a large majority of nucleotide substitutions (94%) in the 18 MPX virus genomes were G>A or C>T, suggesting the action of human APOBEC3 enzymes. Finally, while we did not detect reads matching with main bacterial agents of sexually transmitted infections, >1000 reads identified _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_ for 7 and 17 samples, respectively. These findings warrant close genomic monitoring of MPX virus to get a better picture of this virus' genetic evolution and mutational patterns, and they point out the common presence in monkeypox lesions of bacterial agents of skin superinfection, which warrants close clinical monitoring in monkeypox patients.

[5] Transmission, people to animals
Date: Thu 29 Sep 2022

Citation: Shepherd W, Beard PM, Brookes SM, et al. The risk of reverse zoonotic transmission to pet animals during the current global monkeypox outbreak, United Kingdom, June to mid-September 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(39): pii=2200758
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report results of surveillance between June and mid-September 2022 of pet animals living in households of confirmed human monkeypox (MPX) cases. Since surveillance commenced, 154 animals from 40 households with a confirmed human MPX case were reported to the United Kingdom Animal and Plant Health Agency. No animals with clinical signs of MPX were identified. While a risk of transmission exists to pets from owners with a confirmed MPX virus infection, we assess this risk to be low.

Conclusions
----------
Understanding the likelihood of reverse zoonotic transmission via pet animals associated with the current MPX outbreak will improve comprehension of the potential risk of further zoonotic ingress to the human population and inform further development of control measures to reduce spread -- to both humans and other animals -- via this route. Surveillance of pets in the households of confirmed human MPX cases is a valuable component to further our understanding of this risk.
