I was pleased to read your report identifying a long standing and often overlooked potential public health concern.

_Trypanosoma cruzi_, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is found only in the western hemisphere, and its natural vector, the hemiptera insects, belonging to Family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae, have an extensive geographic distribution roughly from the middle of Argentina and Chile up through the middle of the United States (1). These aggressive, nocturnal insects are popularly known as "kissing bugs" or "assassin bugs" in the southern United States, as "pitos" or "vinchucas" in Spanish America, and as "barbeiros" in Portuguese Brazil.

The most important factor predisposing humans to infection is the transfer of _T. cruzi_ infected Reduviidae from the sylvatic cycle of the vector to the domestic cycle: namely, the deposition of the vector into human dwellings. Continuity between cycles is known to occur (2, 3).

The Reduviidae insects conceal themselves in the walls and roofs of dwellings and come out at night to feed on the human inhabitants. In areas highly endemic for Chagas disease, badly infected houses have been estimated to contain up to several thousand insects, 70 percent of which may be infected (4). In such situations, the prevalence of infection of the human inhabitants is close to 100 percent (4). Significantly, in areas where the insect adaptation to houses has not occurred, only a few isolated cases of Chagas disease are found even though the infection rate of sylvatic Reduviidae may be high (5).

In the United States, early seroprevalence studies estimated that 2-4 percent of the human population in certain rural areas of the southwest may be _T. cruzi_-infected (6). The ProMED moderator's note cited reports of several autochthonous cases of human _T. cruzi_ infection in Arizona and Louisiana.

Autochthonous cases of _T. cruzi_ infection have been reported from other areas of the United States, including California and Tennessee (7-10). It is interesting to note that _T. cruzi_ has been isolated from sylvatic animals as far north as the state of Maryland (11), but no human infection has been reported there.

With the reported apparent increase in the number of Reduviidae insects in the southwestern United States and the continued encroachment on rural areas by urban development, there is an increasing potential for the transfer of Reduviidae from the sylvatic to the domestic cycle. This may in turn contribute to a potential increase in cases of autochthonous _T. cruzi_ infection in the United States.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Acosta for this thorough review of the available background information. The point that increasing population movement into rural areas may change the habitat and increase the risk of human exposure is well taken. In this context, more information is needed on the habits of the species of Reduviidae insects found in the United States.

The seroprevalence surveys should be interpreted with caution. Serological assays perform differently in screening situations compared to a diagnostic situation, and a large proportion of the "positive" results could be false positives, thus the prevalence would be expected to be lower than the 2-4 percent cited from reference 6. - Mod.EP
