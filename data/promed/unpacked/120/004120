Wild poliovirus in Coe d'Ivoire - 21 Apr 2011
---------------------------------------------
Cote d'Ivoire is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 3
(WPV3) with 3 new cases reported with onset of paralysis on 27 Jan, 24
Feb and 27 Feb this year [2011].

Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses show that they are linked
to WPV3 last detected in mid-2008 in northern Nigeria. They are the
1st WPV3 recorded in Cote d'Ivoire since 2000. In 2008-2009, Cote
d'Ivoire was affected by a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak
affecting west Africa (and which was recently stopped).

There is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 -- both
within and from -- Cote d'Ivoire. It is the 1st time since 2000 that
WPV3 has been recorded in this part of west Africa (WPV3 transmission
has been limited to northern Nigeria and parts of Niger, and since
2008 also in parts of Mali and one case in Benin). The outbreak
response may be constrained by the current security situation in Cote
d'Ivoire. Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in
Cote d'Ivoire and other areas of west Africa, undetected further
circulation cannot be ruled out at this time.

Detection of these WPV3 cases underscores the risk suboptimal
surveillance poses to the global polio eradication effort. Globally,
WPV3 transmission is at its lowest level in history, with only 9 cases
reported worldwide in 2011 -- efforts to rapidly interrupt all
remaining chains of WPV3 transmission is a key priority for the global
polio eradication effort.

The overriding priority is to urgently stop the WPV3 outbreak, while
maintaining high population immunity across west Africa to WPV1. 2o
rounds of coordinated, multi-country supplementary immunization
activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and
trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) across west Africa have been/are
being implemented on 25 Mar 2011, and again on 29 Apr 2011, in 15
countries across west Africa (except Cote d'Ivoire, see next
paragraph). A further outbreak response is currently planned in 6
countries, over and beyond these 2 multi-country SIAs. Such a further
response could see planned SIAs scheduled for the 4th quarter to be
brought forward to earlier in the year.

In Cote d'Ivoire, the end-March [2011] SIA did not take place due to
the current security and political situation. A response round is
proposed in the affected province using bOPV in late April 2011, to be
followed by 2 national immunization days (NIDs), as soon as the
situation permits. Planning is under way to ensure capacity (that is
technical, vaccine, operational) is in place for this emergency
response. Coordination with other United Nations (UN) organizations
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Cote d'Ivoire
is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization
activity, in particular for displaced populations. Ongoing
transmission will be monitored, and mop-ups implemented as
epidemiology dictates.

An investigation is ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance
gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant, and underserved
populations. Measures will be implemented to strengthen sub-national
surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly
high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance.

As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and
health, travellers to and from Cote d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected
countries of west Africa, should be fully protected by vaccination.
Travellers who have in the past received 3 or more doses of OPV should
be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any
unimmunized individuals intending to travel to should have a complete
course of vaccination. Travellers from Cote d'Ivoire, and other
polio-affected countries of west Africa, should have a full course of
vaccination against polio before departure, with a minimum one dose of
OPV before departure.

Another polio case detected in Sindh
------------------------------------
An 18 month old girl has been diagnosed with polio in Karachi,
bringing the number of polio cases in Sindh to 7 this year [2011]. The
girl [is a resident of Baluch Colony in Orangi Town].

The case came only days after a 5-day polio immunization drive
concluded in the province. This was the 3rd drive in the province
since the turn of the year. Last year 27 cases of polio were detected
in Sindh.

According to sources, [the girl] contracted the disease after having
received 7 courses of polio drops. As a signatory to the Millennium
Development Goals, Pakistan was supposed to have eradicated the virus
in the year 2000.

This was the 7th reported case of polio virus in Sindh despite the
fact that polio campaigns are being launched every month to control
it.

Pakistan, along with Afghanistan, India and Nigeria are the last
remaining endemic countries. 144 cases of polio were reported in
Pakistan in 2010.

Wild Poliovirus cases confirmed as of 20 Apr 2011
-------------------------------------------------
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011/ Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010*
Globally: 103 / 71 / 1292
- in endemic countries: 38 / 42 / 232
- in non-endemic countries: 65 / 29 / 1060

*Data in WHO as of 20 Apr 2010 for 2010 data and 19 Apr 2011 for 2011
data.

Polio this week - as of Wednesday 20 April 2011
-----------------------------------------------
Afghanistan
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains one. The most recent case was wild poliovirus
type 1(WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2011] in Kandahar
province in the south of the country.
- Afghanistan has been able to limit transmission to just one case in
the 1st quarter of 2011 (by this time last year [2010] Afghanistan had
reported 8 cases). However, the country must remain vigilant, given
continuing transmission in neighbouring Pakistan.
- national immunization days (NIDs) were conducted on [13-15 Mar
2011]. The next NIDs are planned for 2-4 May 2011, and will use
trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) and Vitamin A.

India
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The country's 1st and
only case of WPV reported for 2011 (WPV1) had onset of paralysis on
[13 Jan 2011], in Howrah district, West Bengal.
- The historically polio-prone state of Uttar Pradesh has gone a year
without a single case of polio (the most recent reported case was on
[21 Apr 2010], in Ferozabad). Meanwhile, environmental sampling has
not detected WPV at any of the 3 sites in Mumbai and 5 sites in Delhi
since November 2010.
- The country remains cautious and continues to regard the WPV1
detected in West Bengal as a serious event requiring a large scale
outbreak response. The West Bengal outbreak response team is currently
training vaccinators, improving microplans and continuing social
mobilization efforts in preparation for the sub-national immunization
days (SNIDs) to start this Sunday, [24 Apr 2011] in West Bengal and
other high risk areas of India. Activities have been staggered to
avoid conflicts with election dates in West Bengal.

Nigeria
- A total of 3 new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 8. The most recent case was a WPV1
with onset of paralysis on [18 Mar 2011] in the Sabon Birni district
of Sokoto province, in the north west of the country.
- Violence has erupted in response to the results of the recent
elections, affecting several northern states including Gombe, Kaduna,
Kano and Katsina. All WHO staff have been reported to be safe;
however, many state offices remain closed. Mop-ups in Kano and Zamfara
were interrupted by the violence.
- The insecurity may also affect plans for state-wide mop-up rounds
in Kebbi, Jigawa, Borno and Zamfara, due to take place in early May
[2011]. However, resources have been mobilized so that vaccination
activities can resume the moment the situation improves.
- A sub-national Child Health Week, including a combination of tOPV
and bOPV, will take place from [14-17 May 2011].
- Rapid assessments of AFP surveillance are planned to take place in
the high-risk states in the 2nd half of May.

Pakistan
- A total of 2 new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 28. The most recent case (WPV1) had
onset of paralysis on [1 Apr 11] in the Khyber district of the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
- The next activity will be NIDs, with bivalent OPV, on [9-11 May
2011].

Angola
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 2. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of
paralysis on [4 Feb 2011].
- While Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia are
sticking to the original plans for the synchronised rounds scheduled
for April and May [2011], Angola is considering delaying the activity
in some flood affected provinces due to the beginning of the wet
season. Namibia has confirmed that it will postpone its rounds for the
same reason until the flooding has subsided.

Central Asia and Russian Federation
-----------------------------------
- This region has not reported a case of wild poliovirus in more than
6 months. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 25 Sep 2010
in the Russian Federation.
- In the Russian Federation, SNIDs covering the northern Caucasus
using tOPV took place on [4-9 Apr 2011]. Further SNIDs are planned for
[3-7 May 2011].
- NIDs are planned for Turkmenistan for 25-28 Apr 2011 using tOPV.
- Kazakhstan held its last SIAs from [21-27 Feb 2011] (SNIDs using
monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1-mOPV1). The country's next round
is planned for [25-28 Apr 2011], using mOPV1.
- Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are all currently carrying
out NIDs using tOPV.

Chad
----
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 20. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [28 Feb 2011] (WPV1 in Logone Occidental).
- Chad presented its new emergency plan for polio eradication to the
recent meeting of the IMB. The country is currently facing outbreaks
of both remaining types of wild poliovirus and appears to have missed
transmission of WPV3 for 8 months. A strengthened plan will be crucial
in improving the country's ability to fight off polio.
- SNIDs using bOPV were planned for [15 - 18 Apr 2011]. NIDs are
planned for May [2011].

Congo and Gabon
---------------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains one in the Republic of Congo (WPV1 with onset
of paralysis [22 Jan 2011]); and one in Gabon (WPV1 with onset of
paralysis on [15 Jan 2011]).
- The Republic of Congo will vaccinate children and adults against
polio in southern provinces on [28-30 Apr 2011].
- Gabon held a national round using mOPV1 from [22 Mar 2011].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
----------------------------------
- A total of 8 new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 36. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [26 Mar 2011] (WPV1 from Selembao, Kinshasa).
- The outbreak in Kinshasa continues to affect an unusually high
number of teenagers and young adults. Almost 10 million residents of
Kinshasa were vaccinated using mOPV1 at the end of March [2011], and
the next round in Kinshasa will also target the entire population
(instead of children less than 5 years old). A 3rd whole-population
round may be required.
- DR Congo will take part in synchronized campaigns with Congo (and
possibly Angola) on [28-30 Apr 2011].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No cases have been reported from this group of countries this year.
However, a single positive environmental sample collected in December
2010 from Aswan, Egypt has been genetically linked to virus
circulating in Sudan in 2009.
- A surveillance review has just been completed in southern Sudan
which noted improvements in AFP detection and stool collection across
all states and recommended further efforts to ensure that the network
can identify AFP among mobile and migrant populations. Following the
detection of the WPV positive environmental sample in Egypt, an
international mission to investigate surveillance quality in northern
Sudan has now been launched, with particular focus on possible
sub-population or migrant groups which may have been missed by the
surveillance system.
- SIAs were carried out in southern Sudan from [28 Mar 2011] and
northern Sudan from [11 Apr 2011]. Further rounds in May [2011] are
now being discussed. Sudan remains at risk of polio, both due to
potential undetected circulation and ongoing transmission in
neighbouring Chad.
- Efforts are ongoing to interrupt any residual transmission related
to a 2009 outbreak from Kenya (which was detected again in September
2010 in Uganda). So far, 3 SIAs have been conducted in the
Uganda/Kenya border area, and a 4th activity is planned for May
[2011]. SIAs are also being held in Ethiopia and Somalia, to boost
immunity levels and minimise the risk/consequences of any
importations.

West Africa
-----------
- 2 new cases were reported in the past week -- both WPV3 from Cote
d'Ivoire. Cote d'Ivoire has seen a total of 3 cases in 2011. The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on [27 Feb 2011].
- Mali is the only other west African country to have seen a polio
case this year. Mali has reported a single case (WPV3), with onset of
paralysis on [8 Feb 2011].
- Genetic analysis of the Cote d'Ivoire case shows it is linked to
WPV3 last detected in northern Nigeria in mid-2008, indicating
undetected circulation. The Mali case is closely related to 2010 WPV3
transmission in Nigeria, Niger and Mali.
- Stopping these WPV3 outbreaks completely is the overall priority.
Meanwhile it is crucial that high population immunity to WPV1 is
maintained (a multi-country WPV1 outbreak in west Africa in 2010 has
only been recently stopped).
- Coordinated multi-country SIAs were conducted in late March [2011],
and a further multi-country campaign is planned for [29 Apr 2011]. An
additional emergency response is currently planned in 6 countries over
and beyond these 2 multi-country SIAs. Such a further response could
see planned SIAs scheduled for the 4th quarter brought forward to
earlier in the year.
- The current insecurity in Cote d'Ivoire prevented it from taking
part in the end-March multi-country SIA. The [29 Apr 2011] SIA will be
conducted with bivalent OPV in the affected province of the country,
to be followed by 2 NIDs on [14 May 2011] (with bivalent OPV) and 12
June (with trivalent OPV). Ongoing transmission will be monitored, and
mop-ups implemented as epidemiology dictates.
- A rapid assessment is being carried out in the southwest of the
country, and in Liberia, to determine access in particular to
displaced populations. WHO Geneva and the WHO Regional Office for
Africa are coordinating with its humanitarian response units (who are
currently supporting activities in Cote d'Ivoire) and are in contact
with other UN organizations. Coordination is ongoing with other UN
organizations and NGOs operating on the ground and in neighbouring
countries (in particular Liberia, which may be receiving large numbers
of displaced populations), to ensure OPV is added to any planned
immunization activities.

The current situation with polio is very disconcerting, as events of
the past 12 months are highlighting the added challenges of undetected
wild poliovirus (WPV) circulation going on for about 12 months in
Kenya and Uganda, for 3 years in Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire, and for 2
years in Sudan and Egypt. Questions arise as to the efficacy of the
AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance activities in the post
interruption of transmission phase in lower resource countries in
Africa. From the data available on confirmed cases of polio in the
world, one sees that the majority of confirmed cases in 2011 are in
non-endemic countries -- those countries that have interrupted
transmission of the WPV in the past for at least 3 years.

The repeated finding of WPV isolates genetically related to viruses
last identified 12 or more months preceding the isolate highlights the
challenges in WPV surveillance. While one would like to be able to
conclude that the challenges relate to continued circulation of the
WPV without clinical cases (remembering that there is an observed
average paralytic to non-paralytic infection ratio of 1 to 200 with
WPV), a review of non-polio AFP rates in WPV endemic regions shows
there are countries with suboptimal indicators (a non-polio AFP rate
should be greater than or equal to 2 per 100 000 population under age
15 years in endemic regions) (see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Surveillance/Endemicregionindicators.aspx).
Of note, while Kenya and Uganda have reported adequate AFP indicators,
there was still undetected circulation of WPV for approximately 12
months (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (23): Uganda 20101027.3900).

In addition, there are countries in non-endemic regions with
suboptimal AFP surveillance activities (a non-polio AFP rate should be
greater than 1 per 100 000 population less than 15 years of age in
non-endemic regions) (see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Surveillance/Globalindicators.aspx).
