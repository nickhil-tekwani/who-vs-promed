African swine fever (ASF) is spreading in Armenia. The disease has
been registered in villages in the Ararat region, said Gevork
Tomasyan, deputy head of the veterinarian inspectorate of Armenia.

In his words, on 8 Dec 2007, 8 outbreaks of ASF were registered in
the village Avshar and 10 days earlier [since 10 Dec 2007] in the
village Jraovit. 262 pigs were destroyed in Avshar and 600 in Jraovit.

Tomasyan said that inspectorate officials are doing all they can to
stop the disease. He said that "quarantine measures have not been
applied in the region, so it is not a necessity to do it, because ASF
was registered in the isolated [closed] farms."

According to our data, pigs belonging to small farms also were
destroyed in these villages.

46 foci of infection have been registered to date in the republic.

David Lokyan, Agriculture Minister of Armenia, said that 10 000 pigs,
a total live weight of 400 tons, had been destroyed so far in the ASF
control measures applied in the republic.
