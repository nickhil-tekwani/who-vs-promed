Meningitis kills more than 400
----------------------------------------
Meningitis has killed 403 people between 1 Jan and 7 Mar 2004 in
Burkina Faso, where 2060 cases of the disease have been reported.
According to the Ministry of Health, the disease has reached epidemic
proportions in 2 of the country's 53 districts -- Diebougou in the
southwest and Nanoro in the central region.
"Nationally we are not talking of epidemic proportions yet," Dr
Souleymane Sanou, head of the diseases control directorate (DLM),
told IRIN on Tue, 16 Mar 2004.
He explained that a vaccination program run from 5 to 9 Mar 2004
targeted the 'A' strain of the meningococcus, prevalent in Diebougou,
but that lab tests had revealed that a different strain -- W135 --
was prevalent in Nanoro.
Sanou told IRIN that health authorities had made an appeal for
donations of a new trivalent meningitis vaccine, which targets
existing African strains of the disease as well as the new W135
bacterial strain. There are currently no supplies of the trivalent
vaccine, which retails for around US$12 per shot, available in
Burkina Faso.
A special consortium made up of the World Health Organisation, the UN
Children's Agency UNICEF, International Red Cross, Crescent
Societies, and Doctors without Borders holds stocks of some 6 million
doses of the trivalent vaccine. Countries can make applications for
the consortium to provide the trivalent vaccine only when epidemic
conditions have been reached and tests prove that the W135 strain has
been detected.
Each year, during the dry harmattan season, which runs from October
through to May, meningitis claims thousands of lives in the so-called
African meningitis belt that stretches from Senegal in the west to
Sudan in the east.
According to the UK's Department for International Development,
meningitis killed around 1 500 people in 2002 in Burkina Faso alone.

No respite from deadly diseases
----------------------------------
Frightening new figures show 3 new cases of meningococcal meningitis
and septicemia are emerging in the western board area each month, the
Telegraph has learned. And so far this year at least 1 life has been
claimed locally by meningococcal meningitis type C.
The Western Health and Social Services board confirmed that the
number of new cases has not fallen, despite a massive drive towards
vaccination of children and teens in recent years.
Local medical teams battled 21 new cases of the life-threatening
disease and a further 12 cases of bloodstream infection associated
with meningitis during 2003. Despite a UK-wide vaccination campaign,
levels of diagnosis have remained static, with the new figures
revealing that admissions for both 2002 and 2003 were exactly the
same. And already in 2004, 6 new cases had emerged by the 3rd week in
February.
Western board area consultant in communicable diseases Richard
Smithson said: "It has been fairly steady over the past 2.5 years.
There has been no major increase or decrease."
He added, however, that mortality rates from meningitis and
septicemia had been "extremely low" locally when compared with the
national average of 10 percent. It is estimated that mortality rates
among those diagnosed with meningitis are now as low as 4 percent in
the western board area.

[The 2nd posting suggests that either the immune response to the
meningococcal vaccine is inadequate in some or -- less likely -- that
capsular antigens of pathogenic meningococci may escape the response
to the vaccine antigen. Conjugated meningococcal vaccines in which
the capsular polysaccharide is linked to a protein carrier can
provide a better immune response and one effective in children less
than 2 years of age. A conjugate vaccine against serogroup C
meningooccus is in routine use in the UK. - Mod.LL/LM]
