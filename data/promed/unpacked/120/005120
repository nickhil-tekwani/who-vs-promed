[The report above includes a map showing the location of the outbreak.

Avian infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a respiratory disease caused by _Herpesviridae alphaherpesvirinae gallid herpesvirus_ 1. It is principally a disease of chickens, although it can also affect pheasants, partridges and peafowl. The clinical signs and pathological reactions may vary from extremely severe, with some birds dying due to asphyxiation, to very mild, indistinguishable
from other mild respiratory diseases of chickens. The principal lesion is tracheitis. In infected birds the virus can become latent and re-excreted at a later date without clinical signs.

Vaccines against ILT are usually prepared from attenuated live virus. Those available at present afford some degree of protection,
but are not completely satisfactory. There have been recent promising studies on the efficacy of a genetically engineered vaccine.

The above and additional information on ILT is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf.

ILT's distribution is global. Very few countries can substantiate a claim of freedom thereof. Norway is one of only 7 countries, worldwide, which -- according to the OIE reporting system -- maintain "targetted" surveillance addressing ILT.- Mod.AS]
