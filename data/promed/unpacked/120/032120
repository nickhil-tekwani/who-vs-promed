The need for developing short and long-term strategies to control the spread of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever was stressed at a consultative meeting of officials headed by Bicholim deputy collector Pradeep Naik at the Community Health Centre, Valpoi. Speaking at the meeting, Naik stated that an action plan would be set up to control KFD, which has affected different parts of Sattari in the last 3 years. ZP member Fati Gaonkar, Valpoi health officer Dr. Gajanan Naik and Sankhali health officer Dr. Uttam Desai were also present for the meeting.

The deputy collector said, "There will be a special meeting after 8 days to implement the action plan. I also sought the support and assistance of the people and NGOs from Sattari taluka (administrative unit) to help control the spread of KFD". Dr. Abhijit Wadkar said KFD was 1st identified in 2015, after a 55-year-old woman had died of the disease. He said that Dr. Arun Kumar, a virologist from the Manipal Virology Research Centre in Karnataka, and his team had identified the disease as KFD or monkey fever. After the disease was identified, the health department began various steps to control KFD and 57 patients tested positive for KFD last year (2017). Dr. Wadkar said that the health department is very serious about eradicating KFD in Sattari taluka and other parts of Goa.

Health official Gajanan Naik said that his team decided to reduce this figure by initiating various measures. He further said that (Dimethyl phthalate) DMP oil was found to be very effective in repelling ticks and it has already been distributed in various villages. He appealed to people to apply the oil before entering the forest area. He also suggested that people entering forested areas should wear light coloured clothes so that ticks could be easily identified on the clothing.

Deputy collector Pradeep Naik advised villagers to contact the 24/7 helpline 2374090, operating from the Valpoi mamlatdar's office, if a monkey is found dead in any of the affected villages. "The death of a monkey is a primary observation regarding KFD and care should be taken following the death of the monkey. Locals should alert health officials at the earliest," said Naik.
