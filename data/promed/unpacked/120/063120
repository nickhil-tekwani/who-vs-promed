[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between
infection & chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail.
We commissioned him to provide a summary of the current state of
knowledge, which will be posted in several parts, all with titles
beginning:
"Chronic disease"
The following contain his interim conclusions, subject to
modification by your comments, which should be sent directly to him,
NOT to ProMED-mail. His address is at the end of this post

Conclusion
--------------
Even a cursory examination of this sort reveals the enormous
complexity facing the elucidation of the pathophysiology of chronic
infectious disease states. Chronic disease, by definition and by
nature, will always present the greater challenge to the researcher.
But with today's molecular biological tools, research has the ability
to provide answers.
The tremendous strides made by infectious disease research since the
days of Robert Koch have led to great expectations of the infectious
disease control community. Time and again, that community of
researchers has delivered. However, acute disease lends itself to
easier discovery than that of chronic disease, as has been seen by
the easier application of Koch's postulates to acute disease. And so
it was that acute diseases were more naturally dealt with in the
history of microbiology. It might not be fair to expect the same
from chronic infectious disease research.
Some respondents to my queries made occasional references to Koch's
postulates. In having to read between the lines, it appears that
perhaps those who determine funding, or those who determine projects
worthy of funding, might be trying to apply Koch's postulates to the
study of chronic diseases. This might not be a fair thing to do.
>From the diseases addressed in this synopsis, it is clear that when
investigating chronic diseases, by their very nature they cannot be
made to fit into the framework of Koch's postulates. Those
postulates cast an enormous light on our understanding of infectious
diseases ... of the acute type.
The earliest forms of life on Earth were of a procaryotic nature,
bacteria which [now live on and in and occasionally parasitize
virtually every life form on the planet. It should not be surprising
that, considering that they were here first, they should colonize
human bodies in nearly unimaginable ways. And it should not be
surprising that some of those ways be subtle. And that the
subtleties have varying degrees depending on the nature of the host
(and just how varied that alone can be!). This realization is a
necessity for those in positions of funding and decision-making
regarding research into chronic diseases.
