A new outbreak of dengue in Rio de Janeiro City was detected last week; up
to now 809 cases were reported, without [any] cases of DHF.

Month Cases

1 98

2 118

3 593

Total 809
The program of vector control has being interrupted due to many reasons
that could be summarized as lack of continuing support. According to the
National Plan of Eradication (June 1996) the control of the program would
be by the municipal government, all cities in Brazil made their own plans.
Here in Rio all Secretaries of City Hall participated, but we had a change
of minister and this process was interrupted.
Other cities in Brazil have been going through outbreaks like Belo
Horizonte (Minas Gerais). I think the most important isn't who has more
cases but to look at the situation in the whole country and why not around
the world. Dengue's control is a good example of how we need to work together.

[I support Cecilia's comments about the need to work together around the
world for dengue control. Countries with dengue mosquito control programs
are continually being re infested by mosquitoes brought in from neighboring
countries that are not doing their share in control. Look at what's
happened in Cuba; re infested after 17 years without dengue.

Brazil battles severe dengue fever outbreak in Rio
By Tracey Ober
Brazil's new Health Minister Jose Serra, who took office Tuesday, raced to
Rio Wednesday and said he was mounting an all-out effort to quell the disease.
"It's now crucial that we coordinate all efforts to fight this disease,"
Serra told reporters after meeting Rio de Janeiro state and local health
officials.
He said the central government was providing 11.4 million reais (about $10
million) to the state of Rio de Janeiro and would bring in army troops to
help emergency efforts to kill the mosquitoes.
"We will provide every resource that is needed," Serra said. "The state has
an essential role, but it's very important that the population eliminate
piles of garbage, plant pots, and other places that collect water that
allow it [the mosquitoes] to grow."

right now to stop the epidemic without waiting for the arrival of funds
from the central government - Mod.JW]
