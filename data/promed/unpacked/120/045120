Ireland: variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob case confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
Irish premier Bertie Ahern moved quickly to quell public fears today [Wed
10 Nov 2004], after the country's 1st case of the fatal brain disease
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD] was diagnosed in a Dublin hospital. He said he was confident
state controls on beef production were rigorous and met international
standards. "Ireland's controls to eradicate BSE [bovine spongiform
encephalopathy] are deemed to be optimum stable from 1998 onwards," he
said. "We will continue to take all necessary precautions. Both the CJD
advisory group and Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) have indicated
there should not be public concern for the safety of Irish beef."
The patient, believed to be in his early 20s, has never received a blood
transfusion or made a blood donation. Given that he has never undergone an
operation, it is understood that doctors are investigating the possibility
that he contracted the disease by eating infected beef. Mr. Ahern said the
worrying issue was that, even though all precautions have been taken, the
incubation period for the disease is not yet known. "There is a possibility
that the man became infected prior to the introduction of the more rigorous
food safety controls," he said.
A statement released by the hospital said: "The patient is seriously ill
and is being provided with all of the appropriate care by the hospital. All
of the necessary precautions are being taken, and the relevant authorities
have been updated."
The government was made aware of the potential case on Thu 21 Oct 2004,
when Health Minister Mary Harney was briefed by the chief medical officer,
Dr. Jim Kiely, and the chairman of the national vCJD advisory committee,
Prof. William Hall. Mr. Ahern said he was assured that the measures in
place to protect public health, particularly in relation to blood supply,
reflect international best practice standards.
The hospital confirmed the conclusive test involved a tonsillar biopsy of
the patient. "In the interests of patient confidentiality, further
information on the patient's condition will not be issued, and we ask that
the privacy of the patient and family be respected during this difficult
time," the statement added. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose
vCJD, but the presence of prion in immune system tissue in the tonsils, and
the specific appearance of the brain on an MRI scan, is understood to have
put the diagnosis beyond doubt. The national CJD advisory board will
continue to monitor all developments nationally and internationally. The
Taoiseach (Prime Minister) said the government's thoughts and prayers were
with the victim, his family, and friends.

[A previous case of vCJD in Ireland was reported in the Lancet in 1999
(see: CJD (new var.), human - Ireland 19990715.1192). St. Vincent's
Hospital in Dublin reported that a patient, who had undergone a gastroscopy
earlier in 1999, was diagnosed with vCJD on 31 May 1999. The scope used on
the vCJD-infected patient was subsequently used on 49 other patients.
Although the patient was not identified by the hospital, she was a mother
in her 30s who had been resident in England during the high-risk bovine
spongiform encephalopathy period. Although CJD has been shown to be
transmitted from one infected patient to another via certain neurosurgical
procedures, there was no subsequent report of transmission of vCJD to other
patients in this case. The current vCJD case in Dublin is the 1st case in
which exposure outside of Ireland is unlikely. - Mod.CP]
