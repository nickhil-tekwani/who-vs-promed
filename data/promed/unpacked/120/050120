GASTROENTERITIS, CRUISE SHIP - CARIBBEAN

More than 100 travellers including 29 Britons have been struck by a mystery
bug which has hit the same cruise ship three times, it was disclosed today.
Despite attempts by operators Airtours to destroy the virus by deep
cleaning the luxury ship Sundream after 117 tourists were taken ill on two
seven-day cruises, the bug has reappeared.
Five passengers and two crew sailing between the Caribbean and the
Mediterranean are currently suffering from symptoms including stomach
cramps, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhoea. The victims had all embarked
from the Dominican Republic, scene of a recent travellers' health scare.
But Airtours - based in Rossendale, Lancashire - said the problems on board
the ship were unconnected to the situation on shore. They believed the bug
originated in north America and was spread by Canadian passengers [but see
next para. - Mod.JW].
One Sundream passenger back in the UK after being hit by the bug said it
ruined her holiday and she is now demanding compensation. [Name deleted],
44, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, said she and her 52-year-old husband
were both taken ill before [note "before" - Mod.JW] they boarded the
vessel. "It was awful, there was a lot of pain from stomach cramps and we
were being sick, vomiting and having to go to the loo all the time. "The
symptoms were coming and going every day. "The worst part was that we'd
prepared so well, getting books out of the library to check on the best
places to visit on the island excursions, but we couldn't go on any of
them. "If we made it to the dining room some days it was half-empty because
so many people were ill. I talked to people and it was all the same
symptoms - cramps, dizziness, throwing up and going to the loo. "I was
annoyed too after talking to the staff on board and finding out it had been
going on before, just the other week. "I certainly want my money back at
least. The disappointment and the stress just ruined it for me," she said.
Richard Carrick, marketing director of Airtours, said: "The illness people
are experiencing seems to be a form of gastric flu. "We have carried out
tests over the last 10 days and environmental specialists have also
inspected the ship and they have demonstrated the problem is not associated
with the food, water or air conditioning, which is typically the sorts of
areas where you might pick up this sort of bug." He said the current
outbreak was concentrated in customers from Canada and this led the company
to believe the bug had been brought on board by passengers. They have been
advised to stay in their cabins to prevent the illness spreading and the
situation was being "closely monitored". He said: "In the big scheme of
things we are looking at a total passenger complement of 1,500 and it is a
relatively small number affected, although that's not taking anything away
from the seriousness of the situation." Claims for compensation would be
looked at on an individual basis, he added.
The health scare has led to two tour operators dropping the Dominican
Republic as a destination. Airtours has stopped using four hotels over
hygiene concerns and there are fears of a long-term slump in the number of
British visitors.

[The sooner there is a lab diagnosis of the cause of this outbreak and the
source is identified, the better for all concerned. We have not yet seen a
CDC Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) travel advisory on this, nor an
announcement from the British or Canadian public health authorities - Mod.JW]
