France, Italy and New York City have seen record numbers of COVID-19 cases over the Christmas holidays as the highly transmissible omicron variant has triggered a huge surge in infections worldwide.

France recorded 104 611 on [Sat 25 Dec 2021], according to data from the public health office, higher than the 94 124 infections the previous day and the first time the country has gone past 100 000 infections in a single day. The French government will meet on [Mon 27 Dec 2021] to discuss new restrictions to stem the increase. It comes after France announced earlier this month that all UK arrivals would be banned from entering the country unless they had a "compelling reason to do so".

The French government is also considering passing a law transforming its health pass needed to do some jobs and to go to cinemas and bars into a "vaccination" pass in the first half of January [2022]. The main aim of a vaccination pass will be to do away with the option of obtaining a valid certificate by testing negative instead of having the vaccine shots.

Italy saw the highest number of cases since the pandemic began on Christmas day, with 54 762 daily new cases, although the numbers dropped to 24 883 on [Sun 26 Dec 2021]. The iNews reported last week how the country, the first in Europe to be struck by the pandemic in February 2020, is now seeing a "pandemic of children" as 28% of the total reported cases were children.

Germany is set to bring in restrictions no later than the [Tue 28 Dec 2021] that will see limits on gatherings of 10 people. The country's Robert Koch Institute has also added the US, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Monaco and Cyprus to the high-risk travel list from Christmas Day, meaning those wanting to enter from those countries will be subject to extra requirements like a negative test result and quarantine on arrival which can be cut short with a negative test result.

In the US, New York state also recorded a record increase of 49 708 new COVID-19 cases on Christmas Eve, beating the record set one day earlier with 44 431 cases. The State Department of Health issued a warning claiming it had seen a 4-fold increase in children being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 since w/e [5 Dec 2021]. "The risks of COVID-19 for children are real," said acting state health commissioner Dr Mary T Bassett. "We are alerting New Yorkers to this recent striking increase in paediatric COVID-19 admissions so that paediatricians, parents and guardians can take urgent action to protect our youngest New Yorkers. We must use all available safe and effective infection control, prevention and mitigation strategies."

Elsewhere, Australia reported its first confirmed death from omicron amid its biggest daily surge in infections, but authorities refrained from imposing new restrictions saying hospitalisation rates remained low. The death - a man in his 80s with underlying health conditions - marked a grim milestone for the country which has had to reverse some parts of a staged reopening after nearly 2 years of stop-start lockdowns, due to the fresh outbreak.

The state of New South Wales recorded a record 6394 new coronavirus cases on Christmas Day [Sat 25 Dec 2021], according to health officials. State health minister Brad Hazzard said "we would expect that pretty well everybody in New South Wales at some point will get omicron. If we're all going to get omicron," he said, "the best way to face it is when we all have full vaccination, including our booster."

China's city of Xian has tightened rules and started a fresh round of testing on the 5th day its 13 million people are in lockdown. As the city reported 150 new local symptomatic coronavirus cases on [Sun 26 Dec 2021] a slight drop from the previous day's 155, lockdown rules have intensified, with only essential vehicles allowed on the streets. Since last week [w/e 26 Dec 2021], Xian residents have not been allowed to leave the city without permission from their employer or authorities. From [Mon 27 Dec 2021], no vehicles are allowed on the roads unless they are for virus control or for people's livelihoods and violators could face up to 10 days in police detention and 500 yuan fines.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett started self-isolating on [Sun 26 Dec 2021] after his 14 year old daughter tested positive to COVID-19. He will now await a negative PCR result before resuming his activities. The premier's daughter had been vaccinated against the virus, his office said. It did not disclose whether she had been infected by omicron or the delta variant also prevalent in Israel.

It comes as a major hospital in Israel started administering 4th jabs after the government announced plans last week to roll out another booster for those aged 60 and over. The hospital will give the additional dose to 150 staff in a trial aimed at assessing whether a 2nd booster is needed nationwide to help protect people against omicron. Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv said its trial would shed light on the efficacy of a 4th dose and help decision makers set health policy in Israel and abroad. Israel has reported 1118 confirmed cases of the fast-spreading omicron coronavirus variant, with the number of people infected by it doubling every 2 days.

[3] Israel : 4th dose
Date: Mon 27 Dec 2021

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/israel-tests-4th-covid-vaccine-dose-awaits-ministry-green-light-2021-12-27/?taid=61ca02aa5bce710001f16107&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=trueanthem&utm_source=twitter


An Israeli hospital administered 4th COVID-19 vaccine doses to a test group of health workers on [Mon 27 Dec 2021], in what it called the first major study into whether a 2nd round of boosters will help contend with the fast-spreading omicron variant. Results of the trial, likely to be closely watched internationally, will be submitted to Israel's Health Ministry in about 2 weeks, said a spokesperson for Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv.

Israel was the fastest country to roll out initial vaccinations a year ago, and became one of the first to launch a booster programme after observing that immunity waned over time. On [Mon 27 Dec 2021], the Health Ministry said it was shortening the time between offering the 2nd and 3rd doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 3 months from 5 months in order to beat back rising infections as omicron spreads. Concerned about the risk of a sudden surge in hospitalizations, a ministry expert panel last week recommended Israel become the first country to offer a 4th jab to medical workers and those over 60 or with compromised immune systems.

The proposal was welcomed by the Israeli government, which has struggled against a plateauing of turn-out for vaccines. But the expert panel was divided over whether there is enough scientific data yet to justify 4th shots. Final approval by Health Ministry director-general Nachman Ash is still pending, and Israeli media say he may limit 4th shots to over 70s.

"The biggest question is, how significant is omicron? It's clear to all that it is very contagious. But whether it causes very severe illness - that's the most significant question," said Gili Regev-Yochay, who is running the Sheba trial. The Sheba study of 150 participants "will zero in on efficacy of the vaccine in producing antibodies, and safety, in order to ascertain if a 4th vaccine is needed in general", the hospital spokesperson said.

Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist, said more data is needed to gauge whether there has been a drop in protection against severe disease and death provided by the 3 shots offered so far. "We can't blindly assume that another shot will solve it all, because it won't," said Levine, who heads Israel's Association of Public Health Physicians.

Some 63% of Israel's 9.4 million population have received the first 2 vaccine doses, according to ministry data. Almost 45% have taken a booster shot, they make up a little more than half those eligible for it. Close to 2000 confirmed or suspected omicron cases have been logged and infections have risen sharply over the past week.

A retrospective study of a large cohort of US pregnancies during the COVID-19 pandemic found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased risks for poor pregnancy outcomes, an international team of researchers reported today in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Using de-identified administrative claims and electronic health record data for 78 283 US pregnancies with estimated conception before [30 Apr 2020], and pregnancy end after [11 Mar 2020], the researchers measured the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women. They then compared the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in infected versus non-infected women using Cox proportional hazard models that adjusted for confounding factors.

Overall, 2655 (3.4%) of pregnancies had a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 3.4% of pregnant women with COVID-19 required admission to intensive care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO treatment. In adjusted hazard models, COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated with risk of miscarriage, antepartum hemorrhage, or stillbirth, but was associated with a 2-3 fold higher risk of induced abortion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 5.78), cesarean section (aHR 1.99; CI 1.71 to 2.31), clinician initiated preterm birth (aHR 2.88; CI 1.93 to 4.30), spontaneous preterm birth (aHR 1.79; CI 1.37 to 2.34), fetal growth restriction (aHR 2.04; CI 1.72 to 2.43), and postpartum hemorrhage (aHR 2.03; CI 1.60 to 2.63).

The study supports previous research suggesting increased risk of fetal harm following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"These findings suggest prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy may confer maternal and fetal health benefits," the authors write. "In addition to handwashing and social distancing measures, with the availability of highly efficacious vaccines, guidelines encouraging vaccination of pregnant individuals, and early results suggesting mRNA vaccine safety in pregnancy, effective prevention of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is possible."

Abstract
"Background. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal health outcomes. However, few large-scale, community-based epidemiological studies have been conducted.

"Methods. We conducted a national cohort study using de-identified administrative claims data for 78 283 pregnancies with estimated conception before 30 Apr 2020 and pregnancy end after 11 Mar 2020. We identified maternal infections using diagnostic and laboratory testing data. We compared the risk of pregnancy outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models treating COVID-19 as a time-varying exposure and adjusting for baseline covariates.

"Results. 2655 (3.4%) pregnancies had a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection; 3.4% required admission to intensive care, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO treatment. COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated with risk of miscarriage, antepartum hemorrhage, or stillbirth, but was associated with 2-3 fold higher risk of induced abortion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.60, 95% CI 1.17-5.78), c-section (aHR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71-2.31), clinician-initiated preterm birth (2.88; 95% CI 1.93, 4.30), spontaneous preterm birth (aHR 1.79, 95% CI 1.37-2.34), fetal growth restriction (aHR 2.04, 95% CI 1.72-2.43), and postpartum hemorrhage (aHR 2.03, 95% CI 1.6-2.63).

"Conclusions. Prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Prevention could have fetal health benefits." - Mod.LK]

[5] Predictions
Date: Mon 27 Dec 2021
Source: STAT news [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/27/forecasting-the-omicron-winter-experts-envision-various-scenarios-from-bad-to-worse/


Since the omicron variant was discovered 4 weeks ago, epidemiologists have been crunching data as fast as scientists on the front lines can produce it to scope out what the newest coronavirus variant means for the pandemic this winter and beyond. While many uncertainties remain, disease modelers have cranked out several potential visions for what the first months of 2022 may have in store. Worst case -- they could bring the deadliest phase of the pandemic yet. But even the most optimistic scenarios aren't exactly pretty.

Which immediate future plays out will be a function of a few big unknowns -- some already baked into omicron's biology and some that can be altered based on how people behave in the coming days and weeks. Further out, the models get fuzzier still. But though they differ in the details, all of them point to SARS-CoV-2 being here to stay.

"I think we may be in for a longer road than we had hoped," said Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious disease forecaster at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. What's obvious about omicron is its record-setting spread. Harder to grasp is the extent to which it is intrinsically more contagious than previous variants, versus the extent to which it's simply better at infecting vaccinated and previously infected individuals.

In a preprint published this week, Shaman and his colleague Wan Yang tried to disentangle these 2 dynamics using data from South Africa, where the variant was first discovered. They found omicron to be only about 35% more transmissible than delta, a departure from the going estimate of 2 to 5 times as infectious. The researchers believe that the majority of South Africans had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the omicron wave, meaning the rapid spread was due more to the variant's ability to erode the immunity conferred by previous infections or vaccines. [W Yang, J Shaman. SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa and epidemiological characteristics of the omicron variant. medRxiv 2021.12.19.21268073; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.19.21268073]

"That's not something that should apply directly to other countries, like the US, because it's very specific to the South African context," said Shaman. Different strains took off there, leading to an immunological history not as relevant to the Northern Hemisphere. "How much immune erosion we can expect here will be hard to say," said Shaman. "However, we're talking about large numbers, so we could imagine it's going to be pretty potent at running by the immunity of people who've already been infected or vaccinated in most places it shows up."

That could be a recipe for the omicron surge being the most devastating one yet. In one of the most comprehensive forecasts to date, researchers from the COVID-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas, Austin, played out 18 different scenarios for how the new variant might hit the US.

In the report, which has not been peer-reviewed, the worst outcome arose when the researchers assumed omicron to be no more transmissible than delta, but far better at evading immunity and more likely to cause severe disease -- meaning requiring hospitalization. Combined with low booster uptake, this scenario resulted in cases peaking in early February [2021], resulting in 342 000 deaths over the first 6 months of the year, a 20% spike over COVID-19 casualties in 2021. [https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/media/filer_public/20/b0/20b055db-78da-41e6-a1e4-d3afaad6167b/omicron_emergence_-_us_scenarios_-_ut.pdf]

In the most optimistic outcome -- which assumes high transmissibility relative to delta, little ability to evade immunity, slightly elevated severity, and high booster uptake -- the researchers project the omicron spike to lead to 50% fewer deaths compared to last year.

"Across all scenarios we expect to see cases that are at least as high as the delta surge in September 2021, but that would be the minimum," said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. "At a maximum we could see a surge in cases that is even higher than our January 2021 surge, which would make it the biggest national surge seen to date."

Whether these surges lead to equally calamitous casualties hinges hugely on that question of severity, an issue that has remained murky for weeks. On [Wed 22 Dec 2021], however, 3 separate teams of researchers, tracking omicron's advance through South Africa, Scotland, and England, reported new findings that suggest the variant was less likely than delta to send people to hospitals. Though preliminary, these studies are providing an injection of optimism that the worst-case scenarios won't come to pass. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html]

Looking overseas for clues
-------------------------
In South Africa, where the omicron infection wave went steeply up and then sharply back down, particularly in Guateng province, the peak of hospitalizations looks to be about half of the previous delta wave. Deaths and ICU admissions appear even lower.

"That initial coming in really hot ... is really scary, but what we saw in Guateng, of it kind of crashing early, gives some hope here," said computational biologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who was among the first U.S. experts to sound the initial alarm on SARS-CoV-2.

It's a tricky thing though, to extrapolate the shape of that curve from South African provinces like Gauteng, because the populations there look very different from either Europe or the US. People there tend to be younger, and therefore less prone to serious disease than in the US, where the population skews older and sicker, with more comorbidities like heart disease and diabetes. Another difference is that in South Africa, omicron was a standalone surge, whereas here omicron is hitting on top of delta surges in the Northeast and Midwest, compounding the strain on health care systems.

Bedford is keeping an eye on London, where infections have exploded in recent days. Even by conservative estimates of detection rates, 1% of London is getting infected every day. That's a big number. And even if the risk of hospitalization may be substantially lower per individual -- a new analysis suggests that might be the case -- that many infections would be markedly disruptive to the society and to the functioning of health care systems. "So it really matters when that crests," said Bedford. "If it crashes as early as it did in Gauteng, then it's not so bad. But if it gets past that, then things get bad pretty quickly."

Since [Fri 24 Dec 2021], Meyers' team has updated its forecasts based on the increasing evidence that omicron is becoming dominant in the US even faster than expected. The researchers will continue to do so as more and better data on the severity question come in. But given how rapidly omicron is advancing, the peak might arrive before firm answers do. Especially if a "less severe" narrative begins to take hold and people's behaviors don't change. "Even in our most optimistic scenarios, the numbers are already surging to such high levels that we're worried about what's to come in the next couple of weeks in our hospitals," said Meyers.

The models might be noisy; assumptions and uncertainties abound when data is sparse, which happens when a new variant emerges. But they're better than nothing. And right now they're telling us we've entered a high-risk period, said Meyers. "So if ever there was a time to err on the side of caution, it's now," she said. "If we all tap the brakes a little bit right now, that can help us to protect the integrity of our health care system and also prevent us from really having to slam on the brakes at some point in the future."

A worldwide wave
---------------
It's not just the US being hit in every state simultaneously. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, modelers are expecting a rapid surge all over the world. On [Wed 22 Dec 2021], the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation released new projections, showing approximately 3 billion infections globally between now and the end of February [2022]. "We believe it will reach all countries quite soon," the institute's director, Chris Murray, told reporters at a briefing.

If the numbers are to be believed -- critics have previously assailed the institute's COVID-19 modeling as unreliable -- then we're talking about 2 years' worth of infections cresting in the next 2 months. Murray's team is projecting comparatively modest deaths during that staggering surge, fewer than the number caused by delta, owing to a vast number of the infections being mild or asymptomatic. But stealth spread coupled with omicron's rapid replication rate causes other sorts of problems; traditional public health strategies like testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine start to fall apart.

"There's just not enough time to detect infections and act on that information," said William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That means even countries who've had very few cases, like New Zealand and many small Pacific Islands, may have a hard time holding off omicron.

China, where most citizens have received either the Sinopharm or Sinovac shots, is also particularly vulnerable to major disease and disruption. Both vaccines have shown particular weakness against omicron in preliminary lab studies. Strict lockdowns in areas where many countries still outsource production of many pharmaceuticals and medical supplies could lead to new and more severe rounds of shortages. [Lu Lu, Bobo Wing-Yee Mok, Linlei Chen, et al. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant by sera from BNT162b2 or Coronavac vaccine recipients. medRxiv 2021.12.13.21267668; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267668]

The long view
--------------
The newest variant has also inexorably altered the course of the pandemic. Although it's still unclear how high and how fast the curves will climb (and how many people will get very sick or die in the process), Murray said when he and his team run their models further out, they see COVID-19 quieting down for much of 2022. "The thing omicron will do, because it's going to infect 40% of the entire world in the next 2 months, is it will raise population-wide immunity for a while," he said. After a massive omicron wave passes through, transmission should drop to very low levels. Ongoing rollouts of vaccines should help keep it that way.

But forecasting is hard, and gets harder the further out you go. And the one big caveat to every far-out-future scenario is how the coronavirus will evolve next. "The long-term prospects for 2022 and beyond are very much a function of what the next variant that comes along shows," said Murray.

Next year [2022] should see the scaling up of antiviral production, he also pointed out. As future variants drive new waves in infections, the wide availability of these treatments -- especially Pfizer's newly authorized pill, which the company expects to make 120 million courses of in 2022, should blunt hospitalizations and deaths further. "We would be in a different place, at least temporarily, at the end of the current surge than we've been at any point since the beginning of the pandemic," said UT's Meyers.

The result could be something that starts to look like SARS-CoV-2 becoming an endemic coronavirus and joining a quartet of more ancient, cold-causing cousins. As Bedford has suggested, we might look back on the omicron surge as the last wave of the pandemic. If, after all the dust settles, omicron does turn out to cause milder disease, then its world domination could turn out to be a good thing in the very grand scheme of things.

But between variant evolution and waning immunity, that's not to say the virus won't still lead to significant casualties in that endemic future. "I could still easily imagine 100 000 people [in the United States] dying every year from COVID-19 in the endemic state just because you have a very big number of infections, even if the infection fatality rate is quite low," Bedford told STAT. In 2020, 385 000 Americans died from COVID-19, according to data collected by the CDC. By November of this year [2021], deaths associated with COVID-19 in 2021 had already surpassed that.

But guessing where exactly the next variant will arise and what problematic properties it will have is pretty much impossible, even for the sharpest COVID-19 minds. Back in September [2021], Bedford predicted that whatever came next would almost certainly be a twist of the then-dominant variant, delta. But then omicron materialized almost out of nowhere -- its closest evolutionary relatives versions of the virus not seen since summer of 2020, leading some scientists to hypothesize that it might have come from an animal host.

If it could happen with omicron, it could certainly happen again. SARS-CoV-2 is what's known as a promiscuous virus. It gets around, and not just in humans. Scientists have found it in dogs and house cats, tigers and lions, gorillas, mink. And it's really taken off in white tail deer. Last month [November 2021], researchers reported that up to 40% of deer populations in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York had antibodies to the coronavirus. Another group found active SARS-CoV-2 infections in at least 30% of deer tested across Iowa in 2020.

The findings suggest that the animals could become a long-term reservoir: a safe haven where the virus can circulate and evolve indefinitely, spilling back mutated versions of it to humans from time to time. While the virus doesn't have infinite capacity to mutate -- it still needs to be able to bind to human receptors to get into our cells -- this promiscuity will certainly complicate efforts to manage SARS-CoV-2 in the coming years and decades. And yes, you heard that right: decades.

"Whether or not it becomes endemic in 6 months or a year or 5 years from now, this virus is sticking around on Planet Earth, probably forever," said Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport. "As long as humans and animals and rodents are around it will continue to evolve and change and probably won't be the threat it is today, but it's not going away."

Even if we accept that permanence, we still hunger to see around the corner. At the beginning of the pandemic, Osterholm and his colleagues attempted to predict its future course, using historical influenza pandemics as a guide. As STAT's Sharon Begley wrote at the time, they envisioned 3 possible futures: a monster-wave followed by mini-waves every few months with placid times between; recurring small outbreaks, and constant crisis. What we've had in reality is something that doesn't look exactly like any of these.

In the United States, SARS-CoV-2 was never really brought under control, so the successive viral surges of spring, then summer, then winter of 2020 weren't really waves so much as humps in an ever-building coronavirus current. Vaccines brought a precipitous drop in the first few months of 2021, but then delta emerged, and then omicron, and now 2021 is looking like 2020 again, but bigger, with even more infectious energy behind it.

"At the time, we had no way to understand the power of these variants," said Osterholm. "What has made this such a challenging pathogen to predict is that its mutational changes are really different than what we see with the flu virus. We thought it would behave somewhat like influenza but it's turned out to be a very different animal."

[This is a rather dire forecast with the one hopeful point made that omicron may be the last hoorah of the virus before it becomes endemic like human cold viruses. It already appears to be slightly attenuated, and the immune population is large and growing. But this is not to say, we are warned, that infection will not lead to significant casualties in this endemic future. It is going to be a difficult start to 2022 and then the future picture may become clearer. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries -- the USA (543 931), the UK (318 699), Spain (214 619), Canada (54 923), Switzerland (35 882), Italy (30 799), France (30 383), Turkey (26 099), Russia (23 210), Argentina (20 263), Germany (18 734), Denmark (15 525), Vietnam (14 872), Belgium (14 760), and the Netherlands (11 432) -- all reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6385 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 Dec 2021 to late 26 Dec 2021). The major differences seen over the holiday period, and likely to continue over the coming weekend, serve to underline the value of looking at rolling 7 day averages to follow the trends of the pandemic, as the inflated or under-reported numbers on day to day basis can be misleading.

A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 6 are from the African region. Note that the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asian regions are less represented in the "highly active countries list" when compared to a few months ago, and the African and Western Pacific regions are more represented than previously, while the Americas and European regions maintain their dominance in terms of affected countries with high transmission rates.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 29.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 65.3% increase in daily reported cases and 13.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 281.87million cumulative reported cases and over 5.43 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
