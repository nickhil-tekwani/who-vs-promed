A patient who visited a Soran hospital in Erbil [governorate] for treatment is believed to have symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), said Erbil Health Communications Center on [Sat 30 Jun 2018].

Speaking to NRT, the head of Erbil Health Communications Center Fakhir Kirmanji said the patient is now undergoing medical treatment at an Erbil hospital and samples of his blood and medical examinations have been sent to Baghdad to diagnose the kind of the disease.

"According to the initial clinical examinations, the patient is believed to have been affected by CCHF virus which is transmitted to people through contact with infected animals," said Kirmanji.

Meanwhile, a source from Soran hospital told NRT that the patient is a 15-year-old shepherd and a resident of Sidakan.

NRT reporter in Soran said security forces have cordoned off the area where the hospital is located, preventing people coming nearby.

The Hospital of Ashti in Soran issued a statement on [Sat 30 Jun 2018] saying a patient who has been diagnosed with a "special virus" has been transferred to Erbil.

Known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the disease first occurred in Iraq in 1979. Iraqi Health Ministry said earlier this week [week of 25 Jun 2018] that the disease has caused the deaths of 4 people in [Diwaniyah, Al-Qadisiyyah governorate].

The 1st case of CCHF was announced during World War II in 1944 in Crimea. It starts out as an ordinary fever, but becomes fatal if not treated quickly.

[An earlier report on 27 Jun 2018 was published in ProMED-mail, with a request for further information from the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project on 3 fatal cases of undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever from Diwaniyah, the capital of Iraq's Al-Qadisiyyah governorate. No response has been received.

Recent cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever were also reported from Al-Qadisiyyah and Dhi Qar governorates in southern Iraq (see PRO/MENA posts 20180630.5883403 and 20180629.5881818)

The incidence of CCHF in Iraq has not been well described. CCHF was first reported in the country in 1979; a total of 10 cases and 7 deaths were reported in the Baghdad area. Several cases were also reported in 1980 in the city of Halabja in Sulaimani governorate. According to published reports, the number of confirmed cases annually between 1998 and 2009 ranged from zero to 6; however, 11 confirmed and 28 suspected cases were reported during 2010 in a single province over a period of 3 weeks, with a case fatality rate of 36 percent (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217300656).

Another publication by Ibrahim AS, Ibrahim KS, Mohammed MO, et al. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever management in Erbil during 2010-2011. Eur Sci J 2014; 10(24); http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/3969/3793 reports, "There are about 192 confirmed cases of CCHF which have been reported from different provinces in Iraq (between 1992 and December 2010); however 5 cases of nosocomial infections were recorded in 1979, 1992 and 1996.

Whether the case from Erbil governorate in the report above is epidemiologically linked to the last week's cases from Al-Qadisiyyah and Dhi Qar governorates remains to be seen and any further information would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
