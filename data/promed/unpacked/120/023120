From: Darcy E. Hanes <DEH@VAX8.CFSAN.FDA.GOV>

I am interested in developing a risk assessment model for _Cyclospora
cayetanensis_ and am looking for any information that is available. I have
the data from the outbreaks that have occurred in the United States, what
is really need is information from areas where the disease is endemic. I
also need information on infected individuals: age, sex, potential source
of the infection, risk factors, is the individual a resident or visitor to
the area, and the time of year that the infection occurred. I am
interested in any data available on the immune response to the infection,
i.e. are antibodies generated or is this strictly cell mediated immunity.
Any and all information would be greatly appreciated.
You can contact me directly by phone, e-mail or fax.
