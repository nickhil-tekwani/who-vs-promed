India: Undiagnosed Encephalitis Affects Children in Western Uttar Pradesh
-------------------------------------------------
At least 11 children have died and dozens taken seriously ill due to a
fast-spreading encephalitis (or brain fever) epidemic in Khekda village in
Bagpat district in western Uttar Pradesh. The critically ill children had
complained of high fever, delirium and distorted limb movement -- all
symptoms of the deadly encephalitis epidemic.
Authorities at Khakeda village have called in a team of medical specialists
from Lucknow and are immediately distributing life-saving drugs as well as
cleaning up the extremely dirty village, where almost all water sources are
polluted and villagers have to trek for miles for clean drinking water.
"Till now 11 deaths have been reported. Most of them are children. No
clinical results are available, but doctors say brain fever [encephalitis]
could be the cause of death. We have arranged a team of doctors. Medicines
are being distributed. General check-ups especially of children are being
done. Some cases of malaria have also been found. At present we are paying
more attention on cleaning and fumigating the area," Bagpat DC Kamini Ratan
Chauhan said.
Encephalitis is [usually attributed to] viral infection of the brain,
transmitted by mosquitoes. Though curable if detected early, unhygienic
living conditions, coupled with the lack of proper medical care in the
region, doctors say, are only adding fuel to the epidemic. "Garbage and
filth are the main reason, the water is polluted. There are no drains and
the rain water and polluted water are all mixed," said the uncle of a dead
child.
The virus infection follows a particular pattern by striking part of the
state every alternate year. The patients run the risk of slipping into
coma. Vaccination is believed to offer the only protection against the disease.

[The most likely diagnosis is Japanese encephalitis, but other
possibilities should be considered. In Bangladesh an endemic focus of Nipah
virus infection was recently associated with childhood disease, and
Chandipura virus infection has been implicated in childhood illness
elsewhere in India. Further information on the outcome of the current
investigation is requested. - Mods.MPP/CP]
