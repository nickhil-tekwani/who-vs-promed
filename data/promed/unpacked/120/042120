The director of health of the state of Zulia, Luis Felipe De los Rios,
stated that in the Zuliana region 38 patients have been registered under
suspicion of yellow fever. Of these 18 patients died, 13 of them with a
confirmed diagnosis of yellow fever.
He also said that most cases are found concentrated on the Sierra de
Perija, near the Colombia border, in particular around the Sur del Lago
area, where a system of surveillance and vaccination is being implemented.
The disease, which has not been detected in urban areas, may have
originated in neighboring Colombia, Dr De los Rios said.
