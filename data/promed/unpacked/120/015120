Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The laying hens had been sampled after observation of a drop in egg production and eggs bearing an unusual white shell. Samples of 45 animals (15 per stable) were sent to the National Reference Center for Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK, Zurich, Switzerland), where 25/45 animals tested positive for NCD serologically in the ELISA (stable 1: 15/15 positive; stable 2: 7/15 positive; stable 3: 3/15 positive). RT-qPCR analyses will be performed at the Institute of Virology and lmmunology (IVI, Mittelh√§usern, Switzerland). At the moment, the source of introduction into the holding is unknown. There is no link to the recent outbreak of ND in the Canton of Zurich from January 2022. The establishment has been put under movement restriction. The culling of the animals, cleaning and disinfection of the holding as well as the establishment of protection and surveillance zones are underway. No table eggs nor hatching eggs have been exported from the affected holding.
