Public Health officials report on tularemia outbreak at Boston University
-----------------------------------------------
The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) released its report today
[the press release was dated Mon 28 Mar 2005 - Mod.LL] on the
tularemia outbreak at Boston University that occurred in 2004. The 15
page report, which is authored by Dr. Anita Barry, the BPHC's
director of Communicable Disease, draws the following conclusions:
1. At this time, the source of Type A _F. tularensis_ in the BU
laboratory remains unknown. The federal investigation into the
incident is pending.
2. The extensive investigation to date has found no evidence to
indicate that either the contamination of the LVS stock or the
infections of the BU researchers were intentional.
3. The tularemia outbreak at BU was limited to 3 BU employees and
never posed a risk to the public at large.
4. The failure to identify work-related illness in laboratory staff
is a major concern for health officials.
5. The failure to immediately report suspicious work-related illness
to local and state health departments is a major concern.
6. Appropriate infection control practices in laboratories must be
clearly documented for all workers and enforced.
7. The BU Institutional Biosafety Committee was not able to ensure
compliance with appropriate laboratory protocols and procedures.
As a result of the incident, the Boston Public Health Commission has
outlined the following steps:
1. Develop and implement new mandatory guidelines on the monitoring
and reporting of occupationally acquired infectious disease illness
among microbiology research laboratory workers.
2. Develop and implement mandatory procedures for the public health
response to reported occupationally-acquired infectious diseases.
3. Identify a public health worker to monitor practices in
microbiology research laboratories, particularly those working with
the most dangerous organisms and toxins.
4. Develop and offer a mandatory educational training for
Institutional Biosafety Committees, Human Resources, and Occupation
Health personnel responsible for ID research laboratories.
5. Solicit the input of laboratory science and infectious disease
experts to consider specific policy and regulatory changes regarding
laboratory operations, including but not limited to the criteria for
specimen acceptance, periodic verification of the organism's
virulence, storage, chain of custody, and sharing of specimens with
other research labs.
6. Closely monitor the internal progress made at BU to strengthen
infection control practices in its laboratories.

[ProMED would like to thank Powell Gammill for calling our attention
to this report. The full report can be found at:
<http://www.bphc.org/reports/pdfs/report_202.pdf>
The report found that the original culture (obtained from the
University of Nebraska) of LVS strain (the Soviet vaccine strain
derived from a type B, a somewhat less virulent organism) and its
subcultures all contained a mixture of the LVS strain and a type A
_F. tularensis_. The amount of the contaminating virulent strain was
less in the original vial obtained. Another LVS culture that the BU
labs had obtained from the University of Iowa was found to contain
pure LVS.
CDC's analysis of this type A strain is continuing, but initial
characterization by pulsed field gel electrophoresis found the
organism to be distinct from a number of East Coast isolates of type
A _F. tularensis_, including isolates from Martha's Vineyard. The
strain, however, was indistinguishable from a SCHU-4 isolate, and
several other Midwestern strains, but distinct from a type A strain
that BU had previously obtained from the University of Nebraska.
Additional testing is in progress. - Mod.LL]
