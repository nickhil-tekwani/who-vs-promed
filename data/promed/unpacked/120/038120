Total / 130

Illnesses started on dates from 3 Mar 2018 to 7 Aug 2018. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 95, with a median age of 57. Of ill people, 69 percent are female. Out of 98 people with information available, 34 (35 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 4 Aug 2018, might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when their illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation update
--------------------
State and local health officials continue to interview ill people and ask questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. In interviews, 61 (77 perent) of 79 people specifically reported eating Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. Ill people in this outbreak reported this cereal more often than any other cereals or food items.

The Kellogg Company recalled all Honey Smacks products that were on the market within the cereal's one-year shelf-life. However, Honey Smacks products with earlier dates could also potentially be contaminated. People who recently became ill report eating Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal that they had in their homes. Do not eat Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal of any size package or with any "best if used by" date.

If you see Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal available for sale, do not buy it. Retailers should not sell or serve any Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[Breakfast cereal is an unusual vehicle for salmonellosis, but it has occurred previously. No details are yet available regarding the method of contamination of the product. Cases are occurring after the initial recall announcement. This is either because the recall has not removed all the Honey Smacks from the shelves or the breakfast cereal remains "active" in peoples homes. - Mod.LL
