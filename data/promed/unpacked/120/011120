Another case of mumps confirmed
-------------------------------
Public health officials late Thursday [25 Mar 2010] confirmed the
island's 5th case of mumps this year, prompting the agency to treat
the situation as an outbreak. Department of Education Superintendent
Nerissa Bretania Underwood this week issued a health alert for all
public schools, urging staff, students and parents to be more aware
and act immediately when they suspect someone may have the contagious
disease.

Of the 5 confirmed cases, 4 are students in the public schools: 2 at
Simon Sanchez High School, one at John F. Kennedy High School and the
most recent case at Jose Rios Middle School, said Annette Aguon,
immunization program manager for the Department of Public Health and
Social Services' Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. A 5-year-old
who doesn't attend school is also a confirmed case.

Guam normally receives about one case of mumps per year, Aguon said,
adding that Public Health is treating the cases as an outbreak because
of the unusually high number. There are about 10 other suspected cases
that Public Health is monitoring, Aguon said.

The 1st case was confirmed 10 Mar 2010 involving a Sanchez High
student, and that case has been linked to 2 of the others, Aguon said.
Public Health continues to investigate how the disease was contracted
and the level of exposure to family members and classmates of those
confirmed with mumps. Underwood has ordered school staff to monitor
students closely and ensure their immunization records are up to date.
Information handouts have been sent home with students, she added.

[Mumps is a viral infection characterized by fever, swelling and pain
or tenderness of the parotid glands and/or the salivary glands. Up to
half of those who contract mumps have very mild or no symptoms.
Symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this
period can range from 12 to 25 days. The virus is spread from person
to person by respiratory droplets, or by direct contact with items
that have been contaminated with infected saliva. Mumps most commonly
occurs in children ages 2 to 12 who have not been vaccinated against
the disease. However, the infection can occur at any age. Those with
suspected mumps should be excluded from work or school until 5 days
after the onset of swelling of the face and cheek.

Guam law requires all students entering school to submit proof of
immunization that includes 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella
(MMR) vaccine. School officials are currently assessing those students
identified as close contacts of known cases to ensure compliance with
vaccination requirements.

Guam is located in the western north Pacific Ocean, and is the largest
and southernmost island in the Mariana Islands archipelago. A map of
Guam can be accessed at:

[Although mumps is considered an inconsequential childhood disease,
orchitis (inflammation of a testicle) occurs in 20-30 percent of
post-pubertal males, but usually without causing sterility; aseptic
meningitis in 10 percent of cases, nerve deafness and rarely
encephalitis, which can be fatal. So vaccination during childhood is
a sensible precaution. - Mod.JW]
