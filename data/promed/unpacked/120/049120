China probes bizarre death of falling birds
-------------------------------------------
Chinese authorities have been quietly investigating the mysterious deaths
of thousands of tiny birds said to have fallen from the sky over Communist
Party chief Hu Jintao's birthplace, sources say.
The Yangzi Evening News and the Nanjing Daily said more than 10 000
bramblings dropped like "bird rain" from the sky in Taizhou, in the eastern
coastal province of Jiangsu, on Tuesday, considered a bad omen at the
beginning of the new lunar year. The editors of the newspapers stood by
their stories.
The Yangzi Evening News said on Friday authorities had ruled out bird flu,
which is sweeping across Asia, as the cause of death and buried the dead
birds. A spokesman for the Taizhou city government said the cause of death
of the bramblings was unknown but he suspected poisoning. "Dead birds have
been retrieved from villagers," he said. "Farmers have been told not to
sell or eat the birds." The Beijing Times ran a similar story on Thursday,
calling it an "inconceivable scene". It quoted a veterinarian as saying
migratory birds could die from eating or drinking poisoned food or water.
Villagers who ate or came into contact with the dead birds had been put
under surveillance, the Yangzi Evening News said on its website
<http://www.yangtse.com>. A Communist Party source said that the government
had sent investigators to Taizhou. Samples have been sent to a lab for
tests. Bramblings -- small birds that are members of the finch family with
an orange breast and shoulder patch, a white rump, and a black tail -- fly
south from China's north east every winter.
For thousands of years, Chinese emperors, fearful of losing the mandate of
heaven, paid close attention to rumors and reports of natural phenomena
such as mysterious deaths of flocks and livestock or inauspicious star
formations. China's atheist Communist Party virtually wiped out
superstition in the years after sweeping to power in 1949, but such beliefs
have grown in the wake of economic reforms, amid a spiritual vacuum.
China is battling outbreaks of the deadly bird flu virus in 13 of its 31
provinces, regions and major cities. About 50 000 poultry have died from
the disease and more than 1.2 million have been culled to prevent it from
spreading. The disease has ravaged Asia and killed at least 18 people.

[Birds falling from the sky does not sound like avian influenza. A toxic
cloud that the birds flew through may have caused such a death. Teflon is
know to produce sudden deaths in avians. Chlorine gas could also cause such
a phenomenon, but it would likely have affected people as well. Storms are
known to cause some problems with some birds, but there is no mention of it
here. The article is incomplete in not specifying what samples were taken.
However, ProMED-mail looks forward to the results of the tests as well as
some authoritative information on this event. - Mod.TG]
