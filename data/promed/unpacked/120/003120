Department of Conservation Press Release 4 February 1998
More Sea Lion Deaths a Concern
This is the first in a series of written updates on the New Zealand sea
lion mass mortality event. The updates will be issued by the Department of
Conservation on a regular basis as new information comes to hand, and will
also be available on its website, .
The number of dead sea lion pups and adults found on sub-antarctic islands
is increasing, the Department of Conservation reports.
Reporting from the Auckland Islands, DOC-contracted vet Nick Gales said
total sea lion pup mortality was now 45 percent, or 1353 pups, out of a
total pup population of 3033 pups at the Auckland Islands group. While the
pup deaths on Figure of Eight Island was above normal, Dr Gales had not
observed any symptoms of the disease.

At Davies Point on Campbell Island, 24 dead pups had been found and two of
six adult females there appeared to have symptoms.
About 95 percent of the sea lions breed on two small islands, Dundas and
Enderby, which are part of the Auckland Islands group.
DOC marine mammal expert Mike Donoghue said the deaths of adult sea lions,
especially the females or cows, was a greater concern as it meant the
remaining sea lion pups will die from starvation if their mothers did not
return with food for them, in addition to losing potentially pregnant
females. Cows usually left their pups while they foraged for food for up to
three to five days, so it was difficult to know when or if the mothers
would return.
Mr. Donoghue said an unknown number of adults might have died at sea so the
exact extent of adult mortality might never be known. Update figures on the
estimate of dead adults were expected tomorrow morning.
Dr Gales fitted seven Enderby Island cows with satellite tags about two
weeks ago but only three had returned, suggesting the remaining four cows
had died. Seven sea lion pups were also tagged at the same time, and four
pups had since died.
Minister of Conservation Nick Smith said the latest information on adult
sea lion deaths was tragic.
"The New Zealand sea lion had already been pushed to the brink of
extinction in the early 19th century and we were beginning to have success
with small increases in the population over the last few years. The news
about adults dying is very sad and we will need to keep a close eye on the
remaining animals over the coming days and weeks." Dr. Smith said a
decision to review the sea lion bycatch from the squid fishery, will be
made when further information on the cause of the deaths is known later in
the month.
Post-mortem examinations of dead sea lion pups and other samples brought
back from the Auckland Islands were being conducted by the Massey
University Cetacean Investigation Centre in Palmerston North, in
conjunction with MAF. No results were expected immediately, and DOC would
release final results when they were received.
Mr Donoghue said the three most likely possible causes of the deaths were a
virus, a bacterium or a biotoxin, although it could be weeks before any
definite results were available.
New Zealand sea lions, previously known as Hooker's sea lions, are one of
the world's rarest sea lion. Classified as threatened, the estimated
population is between 11,000 and 15,000 and they are confined to the
southern waters of New Zealand. They have been legally protected since late
last century and are New Zealand's only endemic seal species.

Conservation Public Awareness Unit on 04-4713117 or 025-571503.

[And from various newspaper sources:
The Massey University team has ruled out the distemper virus that killed
17,000 harbour seals in Europe 10 years ago. But after initial studies of
samples from Auckland and neighbouring islands, Cetacean Investigation
Centre director Per Madie said they were no closer to knowing what was
killing the mammals.
Massey University scientists trying to find the cause of the deaths of
hundreds of Hookers sea lions say while the present epidemic would dent the
population, it was likely to recover over time. Cetacean investigation
centre director Per Madie said yesterday it was "highly unlikely" the
entire population would be wiped out an organism because it would wipe
itself out by killing off its host.
Mr. Madie said an autopsy of two pups had found a slight lung infection but
that could be unrelated to the deaths. It was initially believed a virus
might be responsible for the deaths but so far there had been no evidence
to confirm that.
The team was now culturing tissue samples in the hope the micro-organism
causing the deaths would become apparent. However, that was likely to take
weeks.
