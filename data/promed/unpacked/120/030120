About 1.75% of more than 16 000 residents infected with COVID-19 reported no symptoms, according to the latest survey in the city of Ordos, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The city's COVID-19 infection rate surpassed 60%, Ordos's health authorities said.

In the past few days, many other regions in China released their reports of survey[s] on their residents' health conditions. Southwest China's Sichuan Province also said that the province's infection rate is over 60%, while China's southmost Hainan's expected infection rate reached 50%.

It came after the country launched the 2nd round of surveys to learn about the situation of residents infected with the coronavirus. The purpose of the investigation is to keep abreast of the pattern of the epidemic situation and provide targeted medical services to the public. The survey is carried out in the form of an online questionnaire, and anyone can participate anonymously.

The data from Ordos showed that of the 16 562 residents who identified themselves as infected with COVID-19, 78.89% had symptoms of fever, 68.93% had symptoms of headache, 64.88% had symptoms of cough, and 61.98% had muscle aches.

Respondents also reported symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. Only 1.75% of all infected persons interviewed did not report any symptoms.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Ordos city launched an online survey of residents about COVID-19 infection on 22 Dec 2022, and data collection for the survey continued through Thursday midnight. A report of the survey was released on Friday [23 Dec 2022].

Of the 27 502 residents who participated in the survey, 16 562, or 60.22%, reported COVID-19 infection. Of the more than 16 000 people infected, 0.81% were seen in hospital outpatient clinics, 0.19% were hospitalized, 0.78% were seen through the internet, and 12.81% did not see a doctor or take medication. The remaining 85% of patients took their own medication. Among the patients who took medication, 10.61% took Chinese herbal soup, 44.75% took traditional Chinese medicine, and 75.28% took Western medicine.

Of the 27 502 people who participated in the survey, 4.33% received 4 doses of vaccine, 70.61% received 3 doses of vaccine, and 18.16% received 2 doses of vaccine; 4.48% did not receive the vaccine.

Some 13 677 people reported that people living in the same apartment were infected; among them, 4181 patients reported that elderly people over 60 years old at home were infected. And 7337 people reported that minors living with them were also infected.

The COVID-19 infection rate of residents participating in the survey in Ordos was 60.22%, suggesting that the infection is at a high epidemic stage in the city, the Ordos CDC said in the report. More than 85% took medication on their own after infection, suggesting that medical institutions and community health service centers should strengthen online medication guidance.

When releasing the survey results, Ordos also said that the questionnaire did not collect sufficient sample representativeness and quantity, there were limitations in the data sources, and the results were for reference only.

In the results released by other regions, the COVID-19 infection rate also reached a high level.

The CDC of Sichuan Province released its survey result on 26 Dec 2022, revealing that the COVID-19 infection rate in the province's 21 city-level regions has reached 63.52%. In South China's Hainan Province, the expected infection rate is around 50%.

Two cities in East China's Zhejiang Province also unveiled the cities' infection rate. In Quzhou, about 30% to 35% of the residents have been infected with the virus. In Zhoushan, the health authorities expected that around 30% to 40% of residents have been infected.

Based on the comprehensive study by the experts, the upcoming chunyun will involve a large number of people moving, which will make the overall situation more complex, China's top epidemic expert Wu Zunyou said on Thursday [29 Dec 2022]. All regions are trying the[ir] best to monitor, analyze and judge the information about the epidemic situation, and work to weaken the impact of the infection peak, Wu said.

In face of surging cases, medical institutions and authorities at all levels are ramping up efforts to allocate resources to relieve pressure among medical institutes, including boosting fever clinic capacity and increasing reserves of COVID-19 medication.

The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism and the central leading group for rural affairs jointly published a work plan on Saturday [31 Dec 2022], specifying to-dos to strengthen the grassroot-level epidemic control system, ensuring supplies of medicines and enhancing protection of vulnerable groups so that rural areas can cope with contagion risks linked to the holiday travel peak.

[B] WHO wants more data from China as omicron drives COVID surge
Date: Wed 4 Jan 2023 18:04 UTC
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-04/who-calls-for-more-data-from-china-as-omicron-drives-covid-surge


Two known omicron subvariants are driving the vast majority of infections as COVID-19 surges through China, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday [4 Jan 2023], repeating a call for more transparency as the country grapples with the end of its COVID Zero policy.

The WHO wants rapid, regular and reliable data on hospitalizations, as well as more comprehensive real-time viral sequencing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing with journalists. A lack of adequate epidemiological data from China is a key factor cited by the United States and other countries as they put new COVID testing requirements in place for travelers. It's understandable that countries are taking steps to protect their citizens, Tedros said.

"We still do not have complete data," said Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program. The Chinese numbers probably still under-represent deaths, hospitalizations and intensive-care occupancy, he said, while also praising "increased engagement" in data sharing from China over the past 10 days.

Omicron lineages BA.5.2 and BF.7 accounted for 97.5% of local infections in a 2000-genome sample collected and sequenced from 1 Dec 2022, WHO said, citing data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. At this point, the Chinese agency hasn't reported any new variants, the WHO said.

The upcoming lunar New Year holiday may fuel a renewed wave of infections as people come together to celebrate, said Abdi Mahamud, director of the WHO's alert and response coordination department.

Outside of China, the WHO is monitoring the spread of omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 in the United States, with indications that it may be the most transmissible subvariant detected yet, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead officer for COVID. There's no indication yet that the subvariant is more severe than others, she said. "It's not just a matter of knowing what variants are circulating, we need the global community to assess these, to look mutation by mutation to determine if any of these are new variants that are circulating in China, but also around the world," Van Kerkhove said.

[A] Hong Kong to lift year-long ban on hamster imports as it opens borders
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2023
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64170999


Hong Kong is set to lift its year-long ban on the import of hamsters later this month [January 2023] as it unwinds some of the world's toughest COVID restrictions. The city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) told the BBC the rodents would be tested for the virus.

Last year [2022] officials said around 2000 animals would be culled to stop the spread of COVID.

A spokesperson for the AFCD said it planned to lift the import ban in mid-January [2023]. "Our staff will arrange to collect samples from hamsters and other small mammals for COVID-19 testing. They can only be sold if the test results are negative," the spokesperson said.

They added that this was because studies had found the animals could contract the virus and pass it to humans. "If such imports are to resume, the hamsters need to be handled with consideration [and] given the best care possible during transport and quarantine," a spokesperson from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Hong Kong said.

Hong Kong banned the import of hamsters last year [2022] after an outbreak of the delta variant of COVID-19 was linked to a worker at the Little Boss pet shop in the city. It prompted officials to test hundreds of animals in the shop for coronavirus. Eleven hamsters that had been imported from the Netherlands tested positive.

Officials said they believed this could have been a case of animal-to-human COVID transmission, and said around 2000 hamsters and other small animals would be culled as a "preventative measure." At the time, thousands of people signed a petition against the decision to put down the animals.

"Subsequent testing of humans and hamsters confirmed that there was transmission of COVID-19 from hamsters to humans," Vanessa Barrs, a professor of companion animal health at the City University of Hong Kong, told the BBC. "The situation was very sad, but the government acted out of an abundance of caution at that time," she added.

The virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, can be caught by animals including dogs, cats and hamsters, which are all commonly kept as pets. But there is no clear evidence that pets can easily pass the infection to humans.

[LY], owner of the Chinchilla & Pets Shop in Hong Kong, said he had handed over 22 hamsters to be culled by the authorities last year [2022]. He told the BBC that he hopes to start selling the pets again once import restrictions are lifted. "Since January 2022, our business has been bad. The hamsters are popular pets to lots of people, especially children," he said.

Hong Kong dropped almost all its COVID restrictions last month [December 2022], following a similar move by mainland China. People arriving in the city, which is a special administrative region of China, no longer have to do mandatory PCR tests. A vaccine pass system was also scrapped, although people were still required to wear masks in public places.

It was a dramatic move by the city, which once had some of the most stringent COVID-19 restrictions in the world.

[Long term, the question will be how to effectively surveil the multitude of susceptible animal species to ensure a variant isn't circulating unnoticed, which could then cross back over to the human population. This is especially true for companion animal species that live in close proximity to the owners, and whose owners often have to pay out of pocket for testing. This makes formalized government sponsored animal surveillance programs so important in ensuring surveillance is occurring versus relying on owner funded testing which will not give a complete picture of the at-risk animal populations. - Mod.JH]

[B] Hong Kong to reopen 4 border checkpoints on Sunday, as mainland China scraps most COVID travel rules
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2023 18:47 HKT
Source: Hong Kong Free Press [abridged, edited]
https://hongkongfp.com/2023/01/05/breaking-hong-kong-to-reopen-4-border-checkpoints-on-sunday-as-mainland-china-scraps-covid-travel-rules/


Hong Kong will accept up to 50 000 mainland visitors per day via its land ports from Sunday [8 Jan 2023], when China scraps most of its COVID-19 travel restrictions and reopens to the world after almost 3 years.

Four border checkpoints -- land crossings at Lok Ma Chau Station and Man Kam To, and sea ports at the Macau Ferry Terminal and China Ferry Terminal -- will resume operations on Sunday [8 Jan 2023], Chief Executive John Lee said during a press conference on Thursday [5 Jan 2023]. Visitor quotas will be allocated online on a first-come/first-served basis.

All cross-border travellers must obtain a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test -- both physical or electronic proof will be accepted -- taken within 48 hours of travel, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said during the same press briefing.

Breaking down the 50 000 daily quota, Chan said the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint would be allocated the largest number of spots for travellers coming to Hong Kong from the mainland, with a daily cap of 35 000. The Shenzhen Bay and Man Kam To checkpoints will have daily quotas of 10 000 and 5000, respectively.

Meanwhile, there will be a daily quota of 60 000 visitors from Hong Kong to the mainland.

Hong Kong residents returning to the city from the mainland, and mainland residents in Hong Kong travelling north, will be exempt from the daily quotas.

The booking platform for travellers in Hong Kong going to the mainland will open on Thursday evening [5 Jan 2023], the officials said. Slots for the first 8 weeks -- from Sunday [8 Jan 2023] to 4 March 2023 -- will be available for booking on a first-come/first-served basis. The platform will refresh with an additional week opening up every Sunday.

Those making the booking can do so for themselves and 3 others making the same trip. The platform will provide 3 time slots for each checkpoint.

Chan said that authorities would gradually increase the daily quotas after reviewing the measures.

Cross-border students in the mainland will also be allowed to come to Hong Kong for in-person classes after the Lunar New Year, Chan said. They will be exempted from the quotas.

Transport secretary Lam Sai-hung said the high-speed rail connecting Hong Kong and Shenzhen will restart "no later than 15 Jan 2023."

"[I] hope everyone understands that the high-speed rail stopped services almost 3 years ago...time is needed to prepare [for its resumption]," Lam said. "[Workers also] need time to familiarise themselves with the operations and the railroad situation from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to ensure safety," he added.

Health secretary Lo Chung-mau assured the city that the border reopening would not pose undue burden on local medical facilities. The mainland is experiencing an unprecedented wave of infections, with reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed following the abrupt scrapping of stringent zero-COVID measures.

While non-Hong Kong residents will be able to pay to receive COVID-19 vaccinations at private healthcare providers, Lo said [they] will not have access to free jabs at government centres. He added that although the city was experiencing a shortage of "some brands" of paracetamol, because there were more than 700 types of medication containing paracetamol, supply was steady.

Quarantine-free travel between Hong Kong and mainland China was suspended after the city recorded its 1st COVID-19 infection in January 2020. For years, both sides maintained some of the world's strictest social-distancing and travel restrictions, with arrivals subject to mandatory quarantine and testing.

Hong Kong scrapped hotel quarantine in September [2022], while China will lift most travel-related restrictions on Sunday [8 Jan 2023].

Beijing announced on Thursday [5 Jan 2023] that visitors from Hong Kong would no longer be tested when they cross the border from Sunday [8 Jan 2023]. However, they will still have to obtain the negative PCR result and complete a health declaration form before travelling.

China will also resume issuing travel and business visas for mainland residents to travel to Hong Kong.

Hong Kong has recorded 2.7 million infections and 12 081 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic 3 years ago.

[3] Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5
[A] EU: Update on SARS-CoV-2 variants -- ECDC assessment of the XBB.1.5 sub-lineage
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2023
Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [edited]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/update-sars-cov-2-variants-ecdc-assessment-xbb15-sub-lineage


Summary: XBB.1.5 is a sub-lineage of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage XBB, and is currently estimated to have a large growth advantage over previously circulating lineages in North America (139%) and Europe (137%), although these estimates are associated with significant uncertainty. There is a possibility that this variant could have an increasing effect on the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA, but not within the coming month as the variant is currently only present in the EU/EEA at very low levels.

XBB.1.5 is a sub-lineage of XBB, with an additional spike RBD mutation S486P. This lineage was first detected in the United States with sample collection dates as of 22 Oct 2022, and since then the lineage has been increasing. As of 3 Jan 2023, 3456 sequences had been deposited in GISAID EpiCoV belonging to XBB.1.5, with the mutational profile in Spike region - Q183E, F486P and F490S. Most of these submissions are from the United States (3080 sequences) and the United Kingdom (106 sequences). The variant has also been detected in several other countries, including EU/EEA countries -- Denmark, France, Austria, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Iceland, Belgium, Czechia, Portugal, and Ireland.

The lineage is currently estimated to have a large growth advantage over previously circulating lineages in North America (139%) and Europe (137%), although these estimates are associated with significant uncertainty. The US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (US CDC) report a doubling time of 9 days in the proportion of XBB.1.5, and the US CDC nowcast system estimates the current proportion of the variant to be around 40% in the United States, with the variant likely to become dominant in the country within a week. The US CDC also presented growth data comparing XBB.1.5 with previously successful variants, indicating that XBB 1.5 exhibits the second-highest growth advantage to date, second only to BA.1 (the original omicron lineage). This does not necessarily mean that the variant will become dominant in the EU/EEA because major differences in variant circulation have been observed between North America and Europe several times during the pandemic.

The most likely explanation of the growth advantage is the already high level of immune escape demonstrated by XBB, combined with the effect of the spike change S486P, which could provide either a transmissibility advantage, additional immune escape, or both. This mutation has previously been rare during the pandemic, probably due to it requiring 2 amino acid substitutions in the same codon to change from phenylalanine to proline. In fact, other variants with this change have emerged before without becoming successful. Further laboratory and epidemiological investigations are required to elucidate the mechanism of the growth advantage conferred by this change for the XBB variant specifically. There is currently not enough information available to assess any change in infection severity associated with the variant.

There is a possibility that this variant could have an increasing effect on the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA, but not within the coming month as the variant is currently only present in the EU/EEA at very low levels.

[B] Canada: 21 cases of COVID subvariant XBB.1.5 detected in Canada, says public health agency
Date: Wed 4 Jan 2023 21:14 EST
Source: CTVNews [edited]
https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/what-we-know-about-omicron-subvariant-xbb-1-5-spreading-across-the-u-s-1.6216768


The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says it has detected 21 cases of the XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant as of 4 Jan 2023. The agency said Wednesday that they wouldn't be reporting growth rates until there is "sufficient data," but a day earlier [3 Jan 2023] said in an email to CTVNews.ca that it's still "too early" to tell if the variant is spreading in Canada beyond sporadic cases. "PHAC scientists continue to monitor cases in Canada and track developments internationally," it stated.

The update on XBB.1.5's impact comes as the variant continues to spread across the United States and has caused concern among health experts, who warn that this variant may have a higher resistance to antibodies than previous strains.

At the beginning of December [2022], omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 made up just 1.3% of all COVID-19 cases in the United States. By the end of that same month, XBB.1.5 was responsible for 40% of cases in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The percentage of cases attributed to XBB.1.5 doubled in the span of one week at the end of December [2022], from 21.7% to 40.5%, according to the CDC.

PHAC also said Tuesday [3 Jan 2023] that they are continuing to monitor and identify COVID-19 variants in Canada, including sublineages of the omicron variant, but that we aren't seeing a trend similar to the United States at the moment.

XBB.1.5 is the latest in a long string of descendants of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As the virus evolves, it develops new mutations that subtly change its structure and plan of attack -- the variants and subvariants that catch on are the ones that have developed mutations that allow them to better infect our cells or evade antibodies. Since omicron emerged, its offshoots have dominated COVID-19 infections across the globe.

It's currently unclear where XBB.1.5 first emerged, but scientists began to warn about a new omicron lineage in the fall.

In a statement on 27 Oct 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) explained that XBB and its sublineages were actually a recombinant of the omicron BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 subvariants. This means that the 2 variants exchanged genetic material to create a new version that carries aspects of both, something that can occur when 2 different variants co-infect the same cell.

As of 17 Oct 2023, the WHO stated that XBB had been reported in 26 countries. While XBB and XBB.1 are believed to have been first identified in India before spreading across regions of Asia such as Singapore, XBB.1.5 was first detected in the United States in New York and Connecticut in late October [2022], according to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data, an international organization that aims to track and sequence variants.

According to CDC data, XBB.1.5 started spreading quickly across the United States in December [2022]. In the northeast, the variant has taken over: XBB.1.5 makes up 72% of all cases in New York State and New Jersey, and 75% in New England, per the CDC.

Not much is known about XBB.1.5 in particular yet, but early research has suggested that XBB and its sublineages are significantly better at evading antibodies generated by vaccines or previous infection. "Available preliminary laboratory-based evidence suggests that XBB is the most antibody-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variant identified to date," the WHO stated in its 19 Oct 2022 epidemiological update.

A study published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell in mid-December [2022] found that the BQ and XBB omicron subvariants were much better at evading antibodies. While these subvariants carried the same trait that allowed omicron to better attach to cell receptors to infect human cells, monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original omicron variant largely weren't able to stop these newer variants, the study found.

The results of another small study published 21 Dec 2022 in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine suggest that mRNA booster shots may be much less effective at neutralizing XBB and BQ.1.1. In one test looking at the serum samples of participants who received a bivalent booster shot, the level of neutralization was 12 to 26 times lower in XBB and BQ.1.1 compared with the original 2020 strain, and "neutralizing activity was lowest against the XBB subvariant." However, authors cautioned that their study was limited by a very small sample size of around 35 participants.

If XBB.1.5 is more transmissible and can evade antibodies easier than other variants, it could be more dangerous in terms of number of infections because a virus that infects more people has more chances to inflict harm or even death.

The WHO noted in its October [2022] statement that the data did not suggest that XBB and its sublineages were causing more severe disease. However, it added that the risk of reinfection appears to be higher with XBB than with other circulating omicron variants.

XBB and its sublineages have been detected in Canada, but the numbers are currently low. According to a risk assessment by Public Health Ontario in early November [2022], there were 6 cases of XBB and 5 cases of XBB.1 in Ontario between 25 Sep and 22 Oct 2022. A few cases of the new subvariant were also found in British Columbia, according to provincial data from December [2022].

According to the most recent PHAC data, BA.5 and its sublineages were still the most dominant strain across Canada as of mid-December [2022], making up 92.5% of samples analyzed at that time. A detailed breakdown of the variants detected in Canada weekly through genome sequencing lists XBB.1.5 as making up around 0.6% of samples analyzed in the week of 11 Dec 2022. In the same week, the subvariant BQ.1.1, which is counted under the umbrella of BA.5 by PHAC, made up 30.7% of samples sequenced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
"The BQ and XBB subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 omicron are now rapidly expanding, possibly due to altered antibody evasion properties deriving from their additional spike mutations. Here, we report that neutralization of BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1 by sera from vaccinees and infected persons was markedly impaired, including sera from individuals boosted with a WA1/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Titers against BQ and XBB subvariants were lower by 13- to 81-fold and 66- to 155-fold, respectively, far beyond what had been observed to date. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original omicron variant were largely inactive against these new subvariants, and the responsible individual spike mutations were identified. These subvariants were found to have similar ACE2-binding affinities as their predecessors. Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"The emergence of the highly divergent B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to concerns about the efficacy of vaccines based on the ancestral spike and to the approval in the United States of bivalent vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that include the ancestral spike and the omicron BA.5 spike proteins. Since the approval and distribution of these vaccines, additional subvariants containing key mutations that further enhance the ability of the virus to escape from vaccine-elicited antibodies and regulatory-approved monoclonal antibodies have been identified. Of particular concern is the R346T mutation, which has arisen in multiple omicron subvariants, including BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and XBB. We tested serum samples obtained from participants who had received either one or 2 monovalent boosters or the bivalent booster to determine the neutralization efficiency of the booster vaccines against wild-type (WA1/2020) virus and primary isolates of omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.5, BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and XBB using an in vitro, live-virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). All the participants provided written informed consent."

"Persons who received either one or 2 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine boosters had much lower neutralization activity against omicron subvariants (especially against BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and XBB, which contain the predicted escape mutation R346T) than that against the WA1/2020 strain. Persons who received the BA.5-containing bivalent booster had better neutralizing activity against all omicron subvariants (especially against BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and XBB) than those who received either one or 2 monovalent boosters, even though the neutralization GMT against WA1/2020 was similar in the cohort that received the 2 monovalent boosters and the cohort that received the bivalent booster. These responses are consistent with recent observations in persons with breakthrough omicron infection showing broadened neutralizing activity against omicron subvariants. Limitations of this study include the small cohort size, differences in age among the cohorts, the unknown effect of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and comparison of the vaccines at a single time point. These serologic data show an overall neutralization benefit with bivalent booster immunizations."]

[C] Shanghai detects omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB from imported cases
Date: Mon 2 Jan 2023 20:11 CST

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202301/1283058.shtml


Shanghai has detected the omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB that have been prevailing in some overseas countries, but experts said the 2 mutant strains were found in imported cases placed under closed-loop management which has not caused local transmission, saying there is no need to hoard Montmorillonite powder to relieve diarrhea that can be caused by subvariant XBB.1.5.

A total of 369 viral sequencing results of the local COVID-19 cases in China have been shared by a Shanghai research team with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). They showed that at least 30 known omicron subvariants have been detected in Shanghai, but no new variant has been identified, according to media reports.

These samples randomly collected from COVID-19 patients in Shanghai between 23 Nov and 22 Dec 2022 showed that apart from the BA.5.2 variant spreading in the southern China and the BF.7 variant spreading in the northern region, omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB widely spread in some overseas countries have also been found in Shanghai.

However, the great majority of the patients infected with BQ.1 and XBB were imported cases placed under closed-loop management so that they did not cause large-scale local transmission, according to the joint research team of Ruijin Hospital affiliated to the School of Medicine of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.

Yuan Zheng'an, member of the city's epidemic prevention and control work group, also confirmed that so far, the omicron variants BQ.1 and XBB found in Shanghai have only been detected in a very small number of inbound travelers quarantined upon their arrivals and have not caused local transmission in communities, Shanghai Observer reported on Monday [2 Jan 2023].

Meanwhile, as the designated hospital for treatment on imported confirmed COVID-19 cases, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center has implemented strict closed-loop management on imported cases as required, and the patients will only be released from quarantine after meeting the criteria for discharge from hospital, Ling Yun, deputy director from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Shanghai Observer, noting that the 2 mutant strains have not yet caused local transmission in communities.

Among the 25 samples of XBB variants detected in Shanghai, 3 were identified as XBB.1.5 subvariants, which has become dominant in the United States, accounting for about 41% of confirmed COVID cases across the country, according to the data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 30 Dec 2022.

According to the Chinese researchers, the samples were collected from imported cases that have not caused local transmission. They also noted that the mutant strains imported from abroad are more complex and most of them are detected for the 1st time in China.

The current sequencing results show that, in view of the large number of new mutant strains from the imported cases, it is still necessary to carry out normalized detections on the variants to provide a basis for subsequent scientific prevention and control.

BQ.1 and XBB are new subvariants of omicron that have become the dominant strains in some overseas countries and regions for their increased transmissibility and immune escape capacity. However, their virulence is no different from other mutant strains of omicron and the rate of severe illness and mortality rate have not increased significantly in the countries where BQ.1 and XBB are prevalent, Xu Wenbo, director of Institute of Viral Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China's CDC), said during a press briefing of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on 20 Dec 2022.

Li Tongzeng, doctor from the Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases at Beijing You'an Hospital, said that the XBB is still a subvariant of omicron. It is a recombinant mutant strain of the mutant strain of BA.2, but has a stronger immune escape capacity. Its prevalence in some overseas countries and regions has led to an increase in the number of infections but data from overseas show that its virulence is no different from the previous strains.

Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, also told the Global Times on Monday [2 Jan 2023] that XBB.1.5 has not resulted in significant increases in infections, hospitalizations, or deaths in the United States. The surge due to XBB.1.5, if there was one, was much smaller than that which occurred in early 2022. There is no need of too much concerns over its virulence or risk of a second-time infection, [said Jin]. It was even shown that there has been [a] certain degree of decrease in its immune escape capacity. In addition, changes in other aspects are relatively small fluctuations around a baseline.

A screenshot introducing [the] XBB.1.5 variant became a trending topic on Chinese social media on 31 Dec 2022. The screenshot said the variant that has prevalence in the United States mainly attacks [the] heart, blood vessels and stomach and suggested preparing Montmorillonite powder for diarrhea caused by XBB.1.5. The screenshot led to a sell-out of the medicine at many pharmacies in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen on 1 Jan 2023.

According to Li, Montmorillonite powder is a remedy for diarrhea. However, although some people infected with COVID-19 do experience vomiting and diarrhea, the symptoms usually relieve spontaneously within one to 3 days.

Medications for respiratory and digestive tract infections can be properly prepared, but there's no need to hoard the medicine, Li said, noting there is no discovery of XBB.1.5 to be more likely to invade the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems or digestive systems, the People's Daily reported on Monday [2 Jan 2023].

"At present, the immune escape capacity of XBB strain [is] enhanced, which is different from that of the BA.5 variant prevailing in our country. The level of protection decreased over a period of time after infecting with BA.5; thus there is an increasing risk of reinfection when encountering strains with strong immune escape capacity," Li said.

However, reinfection occurs mainly in people with poor immunity and people with normal immune function are less likely to be reinfected in a short period of time and the symptoms after infection are usually milder than the 1st time, Li added.

In terms of reinfection, herd immunity plays a weak role in preventing infection of new mutant strains of BQ.1 and XBB, and the new mutant strains can escape the immune barriers established by previous vaccinations and natural infections, according to Lu Hongzhou, head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen.

There is usually an interval between reinfections and the infection for the 1st time and the probability of reinfection with the same strain is extremely low, Wang Guiqiang, director of the infectious diseases department at Peking University First Hospital, told Xinhua. Even if they are infected, there will be no serious symptoms.

https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-alert-increase-covid-19-cases-and-hospitalizations


In recent weeks, there has been an increase in new outpatient COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in 12 countries/territories in the Region of the Americas, which, along with the increase in hospitalizations due to influenza, RSV, and other respiratory viruses, could impact the demand for health services.

PAHO/WHO urges Member States to update the prevention, preparedness and response plans of the healthcare system across all levels in order to respond to a possible increase in outpatient cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and/or deaths, as well as to establish strategies for increasing the proportion of the vaccinated, mainly among vulnerable and high-risk populations.

[5] Treatment: Angiotensin receptor blockers not effective against COVID-19, study published in the British Medical Journal
Date: Tue 27 Dec 2022
Source: JAMA Network [edited]
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2799914


A pragmatic randomized clinical trial demonstrated that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), widely used as an antihypertensive and used to treat individuals with a high risk of heart disease, did not improve clinical outcomes among people hospitalized with COVID-19.

Because SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, the investigators evaluated whether modulation of the renin-angiotensin system with ARBs might reduce disease severity.

The trial was conducted at 17 hospitals in Australia and India from May 2020 through November 2021. It included 787 patients whose average age was 49 years and who were naive to ARBs.

The 778 participants in India were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg/d of telmisartan or to receive placebo for 28 days. In Australia, the ARB type and dose were at the discretion of the treating physician; the control group received only standard of care because the placebo was not available there during the early stage of the pandemic. The primary end point was COVID-19 disease severity using a modified World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale.

After 14 days of treatment, there was no meaningful difference in illness severity between the 2 groups, so the trial was stopped for futility.

The trial cohort had milder disease than anticipated; nearly 75% of the participants returned home by day 7 and nearly all were home by day 14. ARBs may have a different effect among patients with more severe disease or at a higher dose, according to the investigators.

They concluded that although ARBs did not provide benefit in the treatment of COVID-19, the drugs are safe to use in patients with the infection. The results were reported in The BMJ.

Abstract
--------
"Objective: To determine whether disrupting the renin angiotensin system with angiotensin receptor blockers will improve clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19.

"Design: CLARITY was a pragmatic, adaptive, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled trial.

"Setting: 17 hospital sites in India and Australia.

"Participants: Participants were at least 18 years old, previously untreated with angiotensin receptor blockers, with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who had been admitted to hospital for management of COVID-19.

"Intervention: Oral angiotensin receptor blockers (telmisartan in India) or placebo (1:1) for 28 days.

"Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was COVID-19 disease severity using a modified World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale (WHO scale) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were WHO scale scores at day 28, mortality, intensive care unit admission, and respiratory failure. Analyses were evaluated on an ordinal scale in the intention-to-treat population.

"Results: Between 3 May 2020 and 13 Nov 2021, 2930 people were screened for eligibility, with 393 randomly assigned to angiotensin receptor blockers (of which 388 [98.7%] to telmisartan 40 mg/day) and 394 to the control group. 787 participants were randomised: 778 (98.9%) from India and 9 (1.1%) from Australia. The median WHO scale score at day 14 was 1 (interquartile range 1-1) in 384 participants assigned angiotensin receptor blockers and 1 (1-1) in 382 participants assigned placebo (adjusted odds ratio 1.51 (95% credible interval 1.02 to 2.23), probability of an odds ratio of >1 (Pr[OR>1] = 0.98). WHO scale scores at day 28 showed little evidence of difference between groups (1.02 [0.55 to 1.87], Pr[OR>1] = 0.53). The trial was stopped when a prespecified futility rule was met.

"Conclusions: In patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19, mostly with mild disease, not requiring oxygen, no evidence of benefit, based on disease severity score, was found for treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers, using predominantly 40 mg/day of telmisartan."]

[6] Testing: SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations -- Impact on COVID-19 tests
Date: Thu 29 Dec 2022
Source: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [abridged, edited]
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-viral-mutations-impact-covid-19-tests


[The US FDA recently updated its page on SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations -- Impact on COVID-19 tests. Relevant excerpts are listed below. - Mod.LWW]

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated over time, resulting in genetic variation in the population of circulating viral strains, also called lineages. This genetic variation may impact the virus's properties such as transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or the severity of symptoms on infected individuals (for example, it may cause more severe disease).

This page provides information about tests authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the identification and differentiation of specific SARS-CoV-2 mutations and lineages as well as the impact of viral mutations on COVID-19 tests.

General information for clinical laboratory staff and healthcare providers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical laboratory staff and healthcare providers should be aware that COVID-19 diagnostic tests are generally designed to detect all known variants. However, they are typically not able to identify the specific type of SARS-CoV-2 variant (such as delta or omicron) present in a patient sample. The FDA continues to conduct analyses to identify tests for which performance may be impacted for known SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Clinical laboratory staff and healthcare providers should be aware that false-negative results may occur with any molecular test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, particularly if a mutation occurs in the part of the virus' genome assessed by that test.

Changes in the viral genome can result in changes to viral proteins and, therefore, can also impact the performance of an antigen or serology test.

The FDA recommends clinical laboratory staff and healthcare providers who use SARS-CoV-2 tests note the following:

- Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 arise regularly, and false-negative test results can occur.
- Consider negative results in combination with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.
- Consider repeat testing with a different EUA-authorized or FDA-cleared molecular diagnostic test (with different genetic targets) if COVID-19 is still suspected after receiving a negative test result.
- Test performance may be impacted by certain variants.
- Tests with single targets are more susceptible to changes in performance due to viral mutations, meaning they are more likely to fail to detect new variants.

Tests with multiple targets are more likely to continue to perform as described in the test's labeling as new variants emerge. Multiple targets means that a molecular test is designed to detect more than one section of the SARS-CoV-2 genome or, for antigen tests, more than one section of the proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to these general recommendations, the FDA is providing information about genotyping tests authorized for the identification and differentiation of specific SARS-CoV-2 mutations and lineages and information related to specific variants and recommendations for the use of specific tests that may be impacted by genetic variation in the sections below.

Omicron variant and sub-variants: Impact on antigen diagnostic tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has been monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of genetic variants on antigen tests.

The FDA is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) RADx program to study the performance of antigen tests with patient samples that have the omicron variant. RADx performed preliminary studies evaluating the performance of some antigen tests using patient samples containing live virus, which represents the best way to evaluate true test performance in the short term. Early data from these preliminary studies suggest that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.

Prior to completing these live virus tests, RADx conducted initial laboratory tests using heat-inactivated samples for some of the currently available antigen tests, which were able to detect the omicron variant, with similar performance when detecting other variants. Heat-inactivated samples are patient samples with omicron variant[s] that have been heat-treated so that the virus is no longer live. Heat-inactivated samples are the best available option when patient samples with live virus are not available.

It is important to note that these laboratory data are not a replacement for clinical study evaluations using patient samples with live virus, which are ongoing. The FDA and RADx are continuing to further evaluate the performance of antigen tests using patient samples with live virus.

Antigen tests are generally less sensitive and less likely to pick up very early infections compared with molecular tests. In following the FDA's long-standing rapid test recommendations, if a person tests negative with an antigen test but is suspected of having COVID-19, such as experiencing symptoms or has a high likelihood of infection due to exposure, follow-up molecular testing is important for determining a COVID-19 infection. If a person tests positive with an antigen test, they should self-isolate and seek follow-up care with a healthcare provider to determine the next steps.

Additionally, when using a COVID-19 antigen diagnostic test, the FDA recommends repeat testing following a negative result, whether you have symptoms or not, to reduce your risk of a false-negative test result. For more information about this, read our FDA Safety Communication.

The FDA, our partners, and test developers continue to evaluate test sensitivity, when tests should be performed, and the frequency of testing. The agency is also coordinating with our international regulatory counterparts who are also evaluating the impact of omicron on antigen tests used in their countries.

The FDA's analysis to date has identified certain EUA-authorized antigen tests whose performance may be impacted by mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant and its sub-variants.

The agency will provide updated information and any needed recommendations to the public should they become available.

[The 9 countries/territories reporting more than 100 000 new cases in the week between 28 Dec 2022 and 5 Jan 2023 are Japan (1 034 612), USA (555 630), South Korea (432 132), Taiwan (213 427), Germany (203 018), Hong Kong (176 554), Brazil (152 961), France (124 352), and Italy (122 099). Daily and weekly case numbers reflect the size of COVID-19 epidemics and testing/reporting requirements in each country or territory. These may vary based on national or local responses and anti-epidemic measures in place during the reporting period. - Mod.LWW

With the preponderance of at-home tests in many parts of the world, one wonders if all of the various case data capture efforts should include an asterisk noting "among those that received formal medical testing" as the data presented paints a very different picture than reality? For instance, the US is shown as having 99 million cases in total yet serologic data indicates that was likely the case in 2020 before vaccination started. It's also confounded by those that have been infected multiple times, asymptomatic infections, etc. Since August 2022 ProMED has scaled back reporting on case statistics and would greatly appreciate subscriber input on the continued value of including any of this data and/or if there are other data sources/estimates that present a more complete picture of the pandemic than the data sets we routinely share. - Mod.JH]
