Re my comment on Foot & mouth disease, bovine - Russia (Far East) (03), ProMED
archive 20050830.2566:
[Note that 3 cows developed symptoms similar to FMD in Salskoye,
Dalnerechensky district, but they did not have FMD. Vesicular stomatitis
virus causes similar lesions, so that disease may be involved also. - Mod.JW]
Vesicular stomatitis is limited to the Americas, so could not have been the
cause here. I regret the misinformation.
However, there are at least 4 other infectious diseases of cattle in the Old
World that produce oral lesions that may confound the diagnosis.
