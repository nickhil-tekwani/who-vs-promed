A total of 399 cows have recovered from foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the
settlement of Srednaya Borzya in the Chita region bordering on China, where
an outbreak of the disease hit 642 head of cattle, the press service of the
regional department of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations
reported on Tuesday [24 Jan 2006].
22 of 23 swine ill with FMD are also recovering, the press service said.
According to early reports by specialists from the Vladimir research
institute for animal protection, who are working in the village, the
outbreak was a result of inefficient vaccination in autumn 2005. Weak
immunity failed to protect the cattle from the virus, but made it possible
to avoid the loss of cattle. Domestic cattle will be re-vaccinated in
Srednaya Borzya and nearby settlements. This will help localize the
outbreak and liquidate it.
First reports on the disease in the settlement, situated 500 meters from
the river of Argunh on the Russian-Chinese border, came on 13 Jan 2006. 2
quarantine posts were set up at the entry into the village. Private
households and vehicles are being disinfected.
All in all there are 696 head of cattle and 300 swine in the village with
122 private households. Quarantine was imposed in the settlement, while the
nearby settlements of Kadaya and Bura have been announced zones of
increased risk.

[Russia's last official notification pertaining to FMD was sent to the OIE
on 21 Dec 2005. It related to the recurrence of the disease in 2 locations,
the Amur region and the territory of Khabarovsk (see 20051227.3689). The
current outbreak in the Chita region has -- so far -- remained unreported.
It may be assumed that this outbreak was caused, as all 2005's outbreaks on
Russia's frontiers with China, by FMDV serotype Asia 1; confirmation will
be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
