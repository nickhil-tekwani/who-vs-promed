In reference to a statement in ProMED-mail 20011031.2690 about cats in
Costa Rica related to rabies: "The cat population of Costa Rica is also
mostly free-roaming, but very small.":
I agree with the free-roaming character of Costa Rican cats. However, one
cannot evaluate the number of cats in Costa Rica by counting them during
the day; they hide.
In Costa Rican towns cats move about in the open mainly at night when dogs
are not active. On average, they visit the yards of 6 houses during a
night. During the day they are in houses, on roofs, in vacant lots, in
wooded areas and shrub and probably elsewhere, "en el monte" as Costa
Ricans often put it.
We found large amounts of cat feces, identified by _Toxocara_ spp. eggs and
the isolation of _Toxoplasma_ spp, in the false attics of 9 out of 16
houses sampled in Palmares and San Ramon.
Dr. Armando Ruiz, from the University of Costa Rica and I, from the
University of Kansas School of Medicine, studied the cat population and
their role in the dissemination of oocysts of _Toxoplasma gondii_ in 7
towns in Costa Rica in the 1970s.
Based on our surveys and counts of cats identified by their color patterns
we calculated from 1.3 cats per house in Quesada-3.8 cats per house in
Limon and from 13 (San Ignacio)- 3330 (Limon) cats per sq km [Amer J Epid
113:254, 1981. These are large numbers.

[Both of our correspondents make good points regarding dogs, cats, and the
transmission of rabies based upon cultural practices. However, unless there
is further information regarding transmission of rabies to humans, this
particular thread is cut. - Mod.TG
