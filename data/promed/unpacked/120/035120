Here is a comment about moderator MHJ's remark on otter diet at the end of
the information on rabies in otter (which is not the first case in North
America). Even if the Eurasian otter (_Lutra lutra_) is a little different
from the North American otter (_Lutra canadensis_), even at the generic
[genetic? level, they do share some common habits.
For instance, from our experience here, even if their diet is mostly fish,
they do eat other prey when available, like crayfish, frogs when they meet
for frying [sic or even some small water mammals. A young muskrat
(introduced in Europe) could be caught and eaten. However, in this case,
the origin of the disease is most probably a carnivore as rodents are [an
epidemiological dead end.

This is not unprecedented. We have had 2 laboratory-confirmed rabid river
otters (_Lutra canadensis_) in New York State since raccoon rabies spread
into the state in 1991. Spill-over of the raccoon rabies variant into
non-rabies vector, wild mammalian species has been quite common. In New
York we have had confirmed cases also in a black bear, bobcats, coyotes,
whitetail deer, a fisher, a muskrat, opossum, and woodchucks, as well as
the otters. Spill-over into domesticated species during the period has
included, in addition to cats and dogs, a camel, cattle, Sika deer,
ferrets, goats, horses, swine, domestic rabbits, and sheep.

Rabies in river otters has not gone unreported in the eastern United
States. Please see the article by Tom Serfass et al. which describes a
case from Pennsylvania associated with the Mid-Atlantic raccoon variant
rabies virus:
Serfass, T. et al. 1995. Rabies in a river otter (_Lutra canadensis_)
intended for reintroduction. Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine 26(2):
311-314.

I would agree that a rabid otter is unusual, but not overly so. John W.
Krebs and others (1998) report 5 rabid otters for 1997 in the United States.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/professional/Surveillance97/surv97.htm>
One was reported in 1998 (Krebs and others 1999) in the US.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/professional/Surveillance98/Surv98.htm>
Rabid otters have also been found in Canada. One apparently attacked a
child in northern Quebec in 1996.
<http://www.gov.nf.ca/agric/her&rab/rabqueb.htm>
On a separate point, river otters do occasionally prey on muskrats
(Ceballos-G. 1999). However, I would certainly agree that eating a rabid
muskrat is very unlikely to be the source of the rabies in the
otter. Muskrats show up with rabies even less often than otters (although
even they do sometimes show up rabid). An encounter with a rabid raccoon
would be much more likely.

From: Luiz Jacintho da Silva <luiz_jacintho@uol.com.br>

A cautionary note should be added to this news report: rabies shots can be
relied as 100% effective only when a combination of passive (human rabies
immune globulin or equine rabies immune globulin) AND active immunization,
cell culture inactivated virus vaccine (a series of 5) is used, within a
relatively short interval after exposure. Even so, to be 100% effective,
part (as much as possible) of the immune globulin (HRIG or ERIG) must be
infiltrated around the wound.
