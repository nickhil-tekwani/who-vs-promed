Overview
--------
Collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs is a procedure used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adults and children (1-4; see source URL for complete references). The procedure is also commonly used to evaluate patients with suspected respiratory infection caused by other viruses and some bacteria. This video (see source URL) describes the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens for detection of COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

There are no specific contraindications for collecting specimens with nasopharyngeal swabs. However, clinicians should be cautious if the patient has had recent nasal trauma or surgery, has a markedly deviated nasal septum, or has a history of chronically blocked nasal passages or severe coagulopathy.

Preparation and equipment
--------------------------
Nasopharyngeal swabs are specifically manufactured to have long, flexible shafts made of plastic or metal and tips made of polyester, rayon, or flocked nylon. In addition to nasopharyngeal swabs, you will need personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, nonsterile gloves, a protective mask, and a face shield, as described below. Make sure that all sample tubes have been labeled and that the appropriate requisition forms have been filled out before starting the procedure.

It is essential that you follow the pertinent respiratory and contact precautions specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and by your own institution and that you put on the PPE correctly (Figure 1; see source URL for all figures). If possible, you should put on and take off the PPE in the presence of an observer to make sure there are no breaks in technique that may pose a risk of contamination.

First, put on a protective gown, wash your hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based solution), and put on a pair of nonsterile gloves. Then put on a protective mask with a rating of N95 or higher, as recommended by the CDC. Finally, put on a face shield for face and eye protection.

Procedure
---------
Masks are recommended for all patients suspected of having COVID-19 (Figure 2). Ask the patient to take off her mask and blow her nose into a tissue to clear excess secretions from the nasal passages. Remove the swab from the packaging. Tilt the patient's head back slightly, so that the nasal passages become more accessible. Ask the patient to close her eyes to lessen the mild discomfort of the procedure. Gently insert the swab along the nasal septum, just above the floor of the nasal passage, to the nasopharynx, until resistance is felt (Figure 3).

Insert the swab into the nostril, parallel to the palate. If you detect resistance to the passage of the swab, back off and try reinserting it at a different angle, closer to the floor of the nasal canal. The swab should reach a depth equal to the distance from the nostrils to the outer opening of the ear. The CDC recommends leaving the swab in place for several seconds to absorb secretions and then slowly removing the swab while rotating it. Your institution may also recommend rotating the swab in place several times before removing it. Ask the patient to reapply her mask.

Handling of the specimen
------------------------
Open the collection tube and insert the swab into the tube. Break the swab at the groove and discard what remains of the swab. Close the labeled collection tube and place it in a biohazard bag (Figure 4). Depending on institutional practices, you may instead return the sample to its original packaging for transport. Follow the CDC directions for direct processing of the swab specimen or placement of the swab in media with or without refrigeration.

Removing personal protective equipment
--------------------------------------
Remove your PPE as shown in the video and described here or in accordance with the standards at your institution. First, remove your gown and gloves. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based solution or soap and water. Put on a new pair of gloves, and then remove your face shield and either dispose of it or clean and store it in accordance with the guidelines at your institution. Remove your gloves, rewash your hands, and put on another pair of gloves; then remove your mask and follow your institutional guidelines for disposal or reuse. Finally, remove the last pair of gloves and wash your hands.

Summary
------
This video demonstrates the collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adults and in children. It is important to use approved PPE and the appropriate technique to minimize the possibility of spreading the virus.

[2] No evidence of protective immunity in COVID-19 survivors
Date: Fri 17 Apr 2020

There is currently no evidence to support the belief that people who have recovered from coronavirus then have immunity, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. Senior WHO epidemiologists warned despite the hopes governments across the world have piled on antibody tests, there is no proof those who have been infected cannot be infected again.

The British Government has bought 3.5 million serology tests, which measure levels of antibodies in blood plasma, even though they are not definitive of growing levels of herd immunity. Many tests being developed are pin-prick blood tests similar to widely used instant HIV tests and measure for raised levels of the antibodies the body uses to fight the virus.

Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Dr. Maria van Kerkhove said: "There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity. Right now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection."

She added: "These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence -- that level of antibodies -- but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies [is] immune."

[3] Visualizing speech-generated oral fluid droplets with laser light scattering
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2020

Aerosols and droplets generated during speech have been implicated in the person-to-person transmission of viruses (1,2; see source URL for complete references), and there is current interest in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the spread of COVID-19 by these means. The act of speaking generates oral fluid droplets that vary widely in size (1), and these droplets can harbor infectious virus particles. Whereas large droplets fall quickly to the ground, small droplets can dehydrate and linger as "droplet nuclei" in the air, where they behave like an aerosol and thereby expand the spatial extent of emitted infectious particles (2). We report the results of a laser light-scattering experiment in which speech-generated droplets and their trajectories were visualized.

The output from a 532-nm green laser operating at 2.5-W optical power was transformed into a light sheet that was approximately 1 mm thick and 150 mm tall. We directed this light sheet through slits on the sides of a cardboard box measuring 53 x 46 x 62 cm. The interior of the box was painted black. The enclosure was positioned under a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to eliminate dust.

When a person spoke through the open end of the box, droplets generated during speech traversed approximately 50 to 75 mm before they encountered the light sheet. An iPhone 11 Pro video camera aimed at the light sheet through a hole (7 cm in diameter) on the opposite side of the box recorded sound and video of the light-scattering events at a rate of 60 frames per second. The size of the droplets was estimated from ultrahigh-resolution recordings. Video clips of the events while the person was speaking, with and without a face mask, are available [at the source URL above].

We found that when the person said "stay healthy," numerous droplets ranging from 20 to 500 microns were generated. These droplets produced flashes as they passed through the light sheet. The brightness of the flashes reflected the size of the particles and the fraction of time they were present in a single 16.7-msec frame of the video.

The number of flashes in a single frame of the video was highest when the "th" sound in the word "healthy" was pronounced. Repetition of the same phrase 3 times, with short pauses in between the phrases, produced a similar pattern of generated particles, with peak numbers of flashes as high as 347 with the loudest speech and as low as 227 when the loudness was slightly decreased over the 3 trials. When the same phrase was uttered 3 times through a slightly damp washcloth over the speaker's mouth, the flash count remained close to the background level (mean, 0.1 flashes); this showed a decrease in the number of forward-moving droplets.

We found that the number of flashes increased with the loudness of speech; this finding was consistent with previous observations by other investigators (3). In one study, droplets emitted during speech were smaller than those emitted during coughing or sneezing. Some studies have shown that the number of droplets produced by speaking is similar to the number produced by coughing.

[4] Healthcare worker screening to prevent hospital transmission
Date: Thu 16 Apr 2020

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30917-X/fulltext


The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare services worldwide, leading to more than 100 000 deaths worldwide, as of 15 Apr 2020.

Most testing for SARS-CoV-2 aims to identify current infection by molecular detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen; this involves an RT-PCR of viral RNA in fluid, typically obtained from the nasopharynx or oropharynx.

The global approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing has been non-uniform. In South Korea, testing has been extensive, with emphasis on identifying individuals with respiratory illness, and tracing and testing any contacts. Other countries (e.g., Spain) initially limited testing to individuals with severe symptoms or those at high risk of developing them.

Here we outline the case for mass testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) to: (1) mitigate workforce depletion by unnecessary quarantine; (2) reduce spread in atypical, mild, or asymptomatic cases; and (3) protect the healthcare workforce.

Staff shortages in health care are significant amidst the global effort against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the UK, guidance for staffing of intensive care units has changed drastically, permitting specialist critical care nurse-to-patient ratios of 1:6 when supported by nonspecialists (normally 1:1) and one critical care consultant per 30 patients (formerly 1:8 to 1:15).

Fears of the impact of this shortage have led to other measures that would, in normal circumstances, be considered extreme: Junior doctors' rotations have been temporarily halted during the outbreak; annual leave for staff has been delayed; and doctors undertaking research activities have been redeployed.

In spite of this, a lack of effective testing has meant that a large number of HCWs are self-isolating (125 000 HCWs, according to one report). In one small sample, only 1 in 7 self-isolating HCWs was found to have the virus.

Increased testing capacity will enable all staff who are self-isolating unnecessarily to bolster a depleted workforce. Asymptomatic HCWs are an underappreciated potential source of infection and worthy of testing.

The number of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 is significant. In a study of COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 328 of the 634 positive cases (51.7%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Estimated asymptomatic carriage was 17.9%. Among 215 obstetric cases in New York City, 29 (87.9%) of 33 positive cases were asymptomatic, whereas China's National Health Commission recorded on 1 Apr 2020, that 130 (78%) of 166 positive cases were asymptomatic. Moreover, transmission before the onset of symptoms has been reported and might have contributed to spread among residents of a nursing facility in Washington, USA.

Furthermore, evidence from modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles suggests that 44% of secondary cases were infected during the presymptomatic phase of illnesses from index cases, whereas a study of COVID-19 cases in a homeless shelter in Boston, MA, USA, implies that individual COVID-19 symptoms might be uncommon and proposed universal testing irrespective of symptomatic burden. Substantial asymptomatic transmission might also mean that current estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, for COVID-19 are inaccurate.

HCW testing could reduce in-hospital transmission. In a retrospective, single-centre study in Wuhan, 41% of 138 patients were thought to have acquired infection in hospital.

Protecting the health of HCWs is paramount when staffing is limited. As well as by the provision of adequate PPE, the well-being of HCWs can be promoted by ensuring that infected colleagues are promptly tested and isolated. The scale of this problem is not yet fully understood, nor is the full potential for asymptomatic and presymptomatic HCWs to transmit infection to patients who do not have COVID-19, other HCWs, or the public. However, given that asymptomatic transmission has been documented, utmost caution is urged.

There is a powerful case in support of mass testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission. At the time of writing, the UK is capable of performing 18 000 tests per day, with the Health Secretary targeting a capacity of 100 000 tests per day by the end of April 2020. Initially, the focus of testing was patients, with NHS England stating only 15% of available testing would be used to test NHS staff.

As countries seek to flatten the growth phase of COVID-19, we see a significant opportunity in expanding testing among HCWs; this will be critical when pursuing an exit strategy from strict lockdown measures that curb spread of the virus.

[5] COVID-19 coinfection rate
Date: Thu 16 Apr 2020
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/researchers-report-21-covid-19-co-infection-rate


A research letter published yesterday [15 Apr 2020] in JAMA found that rates of COVID-19 coinfections with other respiratory pathogens are 21%, higher than previously thought, suggesting that identification of another pathogen may not rule out the presence of the novel coronavirus.

Also, a letter yesterday [15 Apr 2020] in the Annals of Internal Medicine detailing survey results on 272 primary care physicians in Lombardy, Italy, who cared for about 400 000 COVID-19 patients found that 40% had symptoms suggestive of the disease, and most had to buy their own personal protective equipment (PPE) and educate themselves on coronavirus management.

Early in the pandemic, reports from China indicated that coinfection of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens was uncommon, suggesting that patients who tested positive for other pathogens could be assumed to not have the novel coronavirus.

Also, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended testing for other respiratory pathogens, saying that confirmation could help rule out COVID-19 amid the lack of widely available testing.

In the JAMA letter, Stanford University researchers performed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens on nose and throat swabs from 1206 symptomatic patients from multiple sites in northern California from 3-25 Mar 2020. Some sites tested the specimens for COVID-19 as well as influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), non-COVID-19 coronaviruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_.

They found that, of the 116 specimens that tested positive for COVID-19, 24 (20.7%) were positive for at least one other pathogen, vs 294 of the 1101 specimens (26.7%) negative for the novel coronavirus (difference, 6.0 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.3 to 14.3]).

The most common coinfections included rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), RSV (5.2%), and non-COVID-19 coronaviruses (4.3%). None of the differences in rates of non-COVID-19 pathogens between specimens positive and negative for the novel coronavirus was statistically significant (P less than 0.05).

Of 318 samples positive for at least one pathogen that was not SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 24 (7.5%) were also positive for the novel coronavirus. Of 899 samples negative for other pathogens, 92 (10.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (difference, 2.7 percentage points [95% CI, -1.0 to 6.4]).

"These results suggest that routine testing for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to provide clinical benefit unless a positive result would change disease management (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in appropriate patients)," the authors said.

[6] Some mild COVID-19 cases have only GI symptoms
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2020
Source: MedPage Today [abridged, edited]
https://bit.ly/3eLEH0D


The goal of this study was to describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with low severity disease marked by presence of digestive symptoms.

We have known about SARS-CoV-2 for barely more than 4 months, but it seems like a lifetime. Now, the virus responsible for the 1st COVID-19 case in Washington state on 20 Jan 2020 has spread across the country, infecting more than half a million Americans and killing at least 23 607 people.

Action points
-------------
- A subgroup of COVID-19 patients may have digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, as their only symptom, with or without ever developing respiratory symptoms or even a fever, according to Chinese researchers.
- Note that this subgroup of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in their stool, have a longer interval before viral clearance, and experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.

As many as 177 countries are now experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic and practicing nonpharmaceutical mitigation measures to contain its spread in each region. Valuable lessons learned from the sentinel outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 have been absorbed and implemented across the globe.

Recognition of the respiratory symptoms accompanying the onset of COVID-19 -- recent-onset fever, dry cough, weakness, and sore throat -- are important considerations. Up to half of patients will develop shortness of breath, and some will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Far less is known about the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including nausea and diarrhea, that have been reported to occur in 5% to 50% of infected individuals in various series. A Chinese study highlighted the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples of hospitalized patients. Indeed, viral RNA is detected in the feces of over half of patients infected with COVID-19, and in almost a quarter of cases, stool samples test positive when respiratory samples are negative.

In contrast to the emerging COVID-19 literature, which mainly tends to focus on severe or critically ill patients, Xiaohua Hou, MD, PhD, of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues described a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with low severity disease marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.

By all indications, COVID-19 coronavirus appears to be stealthier and more lethal than seasonal influenza, spreading from one individual to another before the triggering of respiratory symptoms. While the crude mortality rate for COVID-19 has been estimated to be 3% to 4% (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases), mortality for seasonal influenza is usually well below 0.1%.

According to a modeling study, undocumented but infectious cases appear to be major drivers of the pandemic. Hou's group reasonably hypothesized that there was a large cohort of patients with mild illness who had digestive symptoms only, who unknowingly spread the virus.

Hou and team reviewed consecutively hospitalized patients admitted from 13-29 Feb 2020. Of note, they also monitored and quarantined patients with mild symptoms in the hospital during the height of the Wuhan outbreak. They diagnosed patients based on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and predefined criteria for mild disease (i.e., without clinical evidence of respiratory distress, and able to maintain blood oxygen saturation above 93% at rest).

Patients were monitored until they had 2 sequential negative respiratory tract specimens collected more than 24 hours apart according to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. They also matched each patient with digestive symptoms to another patient with only respiratory symptoms. Study participants were then divided into digestive only, respiratory only, and digestive + respiratory groups.

Of the 206 eligible patients (mean age, 62.5 years; 55.8% women), 48 had digestive symptoms only, 69 had both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 had only respiratory symptoms. Interestingly, the digestive and respiratory group was more likely to report shortness of breath, fatigue, and muscle soreness vs the respiratory-only group.

A total of 67 patients presented with diarrhea. Among those patients, 13 (19.4%) experienced diarrhea as the 1st symptom in their course of illness. Women were more likely to report diarrhea than men (65.7% vs 51.1%). Diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 days. Patients reported an average daily frequency of 4.3 bowel movements per day (maximum of 18 per day).

Some patients with digestive symptoms did not have an accompanying fever. Just under two-thirds of patients with digestive symptoms had a concurrent fever (62.4%), with 20.4% experiencing diarrhea before the fever, 10.2% after the fever, and the rest having both symptoms at the same time.

Patients with digestive symptoms took longer to seek medical care than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 vs 11.0 days). Mean interval from symptom onset and viral clearance across groups was 38 days, with an average hospital stay of about 24 days. However, the total time between symptom onset and viral clearance was significantly longer in the digestive-only and digestive and respiratory symptom groups vs the respiratory-only group (40.9 vs 42.0 vs 33.5 days, respectively; P less than 0.001).

Likewise, Hou and colleagues found that patients with coronavirus RNA in their stool had a significantly longer time to viral clearance than patients who tested negative in stool (44.2 vs 33.7 days; P = 0.003). Not surprisingly, those with digestive symptoms were more likely to have virus in their stool.

Study highlights and explanation of findings
--------------------------------------------
Compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms, those with digestive symptoms were found to have a longer interval between symptom onset and viral clearance. They were also more likely to test positive for coronavirus RNA in their stool, according to this retrospective evaluation of Chinese patients with mild COVID-19. This study suggests, but does not confirm, direct infectivity of the virus in the GI tract.

SARS-CoV-2 infection likely involves binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Hou's team noted that the ACE2 receptor is also found in both the upper and lower GI tract, where it is expressed at nearly 100-fold higher levels than in respiratory organs.

GI symptoms might be overlooked in coronavirus cases. Indeed, most coronaviruses cause either a respiratory or an enteric disease, and some do both. An investigation of the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong showed that as many as 66% of patients at one location had diarrhea, contributing to a significant virus load being discharged in the sewerage, which caused 361 cases of SARS.

Experts have been urging gastroenterologists to consider COVID-19 in a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with both respiratory and GI symptoms. Joint guidance from Indian professional societies also stated that it appeared "prudent to consider GI secretions as infective, and capable of causing feco-oral transmission, and be associated with potential for transmission of the virus during endoscopic procedures from patient to patient or from a patient to healthcare workers."

"This study is vital because it represents the 80% or more of patients who do not have severe or critical disease. This is about the more common scenario of people in the community struggling to figure out if they might have COVID-19 because of new-onset diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting," said Brennan M.R. Spiegel, MD, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, in a press release.

[7] Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period
Date: Tue 14 Apr 2020

Abstract
--------
It is urgent to understand the future of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.

The pandemic and post-pandemic transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as the intensity and timing of control measures. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the _Betacoronavirus_ genus, which includes the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and 2 other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with approximate case fatality rates of 9% and 36%, respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions, suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza. Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year, while SARS-CoV-1 infection can induce longer-lasting immunity.

Intensive testing and case-based interventions have so far formed the centerpiece of control efforts in some places, such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Many other countries are adopting measures termed "social distancing" or "physical distancing," closing schools and workplaces and limiting the sizes of gatherings. The goal of these strategies is to reduce the peak intensity of the epidemic ("flatten the curve"), reducing the risk of overwhelming health systems and buying time to develop treatments and vaccines. For social distancing to have reversed the epidemic in China, the effective reproduction number must have declined by at least 50-60%, assuming a baseline R0 between 2 and 2.5.

This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We integrate our findings in a mathematical model to project potential scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the pandemic and post-pandemic periods and identify key data still needed to determine which scenarios are likely to play out. Then, using the model, we assess the duration and intensity of social distancing measures that might be needed to maintain control of SARS-CoV-2 in the coming months under both existing and expanded critical care capacities.

Model simulations demonstrated the following key points

- SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year
In all modelled scenarios, SARS-CoV-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time. Winter/spring establishments favored outbreaks with lower peaks, while autumn/winter establishments led to more acute outbreaks. The 5-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times.

- If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent, it will likely enter into regular circulation
Much like pandemic influenza, many scenarios lead to SARS-CoV-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g., Fig. 3, A and B; see source URL for figures and tables), possibly in annual, biennial, or sporadic patterns over the next 5 years (Tables S2-S4). Short-term immunity (on the order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) favors the establishment of annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, while longer-term immunity (2 years) favors biennial outbreaks.

- High seasonal variation in transmission leads to smaller peak incidence during the initial pandemic wave but larger recurrent wintertime outbreaks
The amount of seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission could differ between geographic locations, as for influenza. The R0 for influenza in New York declines in the summer by about 40%, while in Florida the decline is closer to 20%, which aligns with the estimated decline in R0 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Table S8). A 40% summertime decline in R0 would reduce the unmitigated peak incidence of the initial SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave. However, stronger seasonal forcing leads to a greater accumulation of susceptible individuals during periods of low transmission in the summer, leading to recurrent outbreaks with higher peaks in the post-pandemic period.

- If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is permanent, the virus could disappear for 5 or more years after causing a major outbreak
Long-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and lower overall incidence of infection. If SARS-CoV-2 induces cross-immunity against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear (Fig. 3D). The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross-immunity against them, which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoV-HKU1.

- Low levels of cross-immunity from the other betacoronaviruses against SARS-CoV-2 could make SARS-CoV-2 appear to die out, only to resurge after a few years
Even if SARS-CoV-2 immunity only lasts for 2 years, mild (30%) cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for up to 3 years before a resurgence in 2024, as long as SARS-CoV-2 does not fully die out.

We evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing. When transmission was not subject to seasonal forcing, one-time social distancing measures reduced the epidemic peak size. Under all scenarios, there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted. However, longer and more stringent temporary social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size. In the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60% reduction in R0, for example, the resurgence peak size was nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic: The social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity was built. The greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks.

Our findings indicate key data required to know how the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will unfold. Most crucially, serological studies could indicate the extent of population immunity, whether immunity wanes, and at what rate.

In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next 5 years will depend critically upon whether it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts.

Longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence.

[8] 1st patient in USA in trial of gimsilumab for patients with COVID-19 and ARDS
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2020
Source: Temple Health [edited]

Temple University Hospital has treated the 1st patient in the USA in the BREATHE clinical trial evaluating the impact of intravenous treatment with gimsilumab on mortality for patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Gerard J. Criner, MD, FACP, FACCP, Chair and Professor of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and Director of the Temple Lung Center, is the principal investigator at Temple University Hospital for the adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trial, which includes a planned interim analysis.

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many COVID-19 patients experience an overactive immune response that leads to lung injury, ARDS, and ultimately death (1; see source URL for complete references). ARDS is a life-threatening inflammatory lung injury characterized by a lack of oxygen to the tissue and stiff lungs. It necessitates hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and, when implementing standard of care, including mechanical ventilation, it has an overall mortality rate of 41% (6).

Gimsilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is believed to be a key driver of lung hyperinflammation. Previous evidence from SARS-CoV-1 animal models and emerging data from COVID-19 patients suggests that GM-CSF contributes to the immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with or at risk of developing ARDS (2-5). GM-CSF has been found to be up-regulated in the serum of COVID-19 patients according to recent data from patients in China (2).

"Emerging evidence suggests that GM-CSF may contribute to clinical worsening in COVID-19," Dr. Criner said. "We are proud to participate in this clinical trial testing gimsilumab in this vulnerable patient population."

Gimsilumab has been tested in numerous non-clinical studies and 2 prior clinical studies, including a 4-week Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers which completed dosing in February [2020]. It has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile based on data collected to date.

The multisite clinical trial will enroll up to 270 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and clinical evidence of acute lung injury or ARDS. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either gimsilumab or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence of mortality by day 43. Key secondary endpoints include the incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation use during the study, number of days in the intensive care unit, and number of days of inpatient hospitalization. The trial is sponsored by Roivant Sciences.

[9] Possibility to transmit SARS-CoV-2 through blood and feces
Date: Thu 16 Apr 2020

Announcement of infectious disease evaluation results through the cultivation experiment of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
----------------------------------
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Director Eun-Kyung Jung) evaluated the infectivity and published the results through a culture test of blood and feces (urine, feces) of COVID-19 patients.

While there have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 virus gene amplification reactions in patients' blood and fecal matter, the experiment and evaluation have significance in cases where it was not known whether the results were infectious.

As a result of the analysis of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 of the SARS-CoV-2 gene detection cases were cultured among 699 cases of serum, urine, and feces obtained from 74 patients with COVID-19, but no virus was isolated.

This means that it is very unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through a path other than the respiratory system.

For the reason why the virus was not cultivated, he explained, "There is a possibility that only a small amount of the virus is present enough to be cultivated, or a gene fragment of the [SARS-CoV-2] virus that has already died and lost infectivity may have been detected."

The results of this evaluation of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will be released through a paper, and it is expected to contribute to the study of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

[10] COVID-19 and immunity in aging populations -- a new research agenda
Date: Fri 17 Apr 2020

The race is on throughout the world to develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and end a pandemic that threatens to infect a substantial portion of the planet's population and perhaps kill millions of people, especially older adults. As billions of dollars flow into research and development efforts aimed at controlling the virus, the pandemic response remains hamstrung by our limited understanding of how to generate effective immunity, particularly in the elderly.

As we age, health conditions associated with aging, particularly noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancers, and metabolic and autoimmune diseases, combined with treatments for these diseases and with immune senescence, substantially affect responses to vaccines and infectious diseases (1; see source URL for complete references). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and it has been suggested that differential levels of ACE2 in the cardiac and pulmonary tissues of younger vs older adults may be at least partially responsible for the spectrum of disease virulence observed among patients with COVID-19. These findings have led to debate regarding the potential use of ACE inhibitors in the context of the pandemic (2). This idea highlights the need for longitudinal studies in aging populations -- such as the Rotterdam Study (a prospective cohort study focused on cardiovascular, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrine diseases) -- to examine the impact of coexisting conditions and therapies on the effects of vaccines and infectious diseases.

Even as the brunt of severe illness from COVID-19 is being borne by aging adults, we are navigating partially blind in efforts to develop vaccines and therapies to stop this and future pandemics, since we lack knowledge of the mechanisms of immunity to protect this population. If we can delineate principles of effective immunity in the elderly, we might also be able to develop new strategies for broader disease prevention and control in older populations.

COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of aging populations to emerging diseases. This susceptibility to disease and death is also a major challenge for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents. Numerous studies have shown that vaccine efficacy decreases significantly with age, a reduction that is thought to be driven by the progressive age-related decline of innate and adaptive immune responses (3). Yet we know that some older people are protected by generally poorly performing vaccines, and some vaccines work very well in elderly populations: the Shingrix vaccine for shingles, for example, is 90% effective in people over 70. What accounts for the variability in immune responses from one elderly person to another? How can we use our understanding of this variability in developing new and improved vaccines and therapies?

Innovative new studies are needed to investigate questions of why some people have stronger responses to vaccines or diseases than others so that we can better prevent and treat disease. This undertaking will require a global approach and a radically new vision -- one that spans diseases and sectors of society, bringing together academia, industry, government, and philanthropic organizations. COVID-19 is already catalyzing collaboration among these sectors, and this work must continue beyond the pandemic.

Thus, the tools are now available to decipher the principles of effective immunity in aging populations. If investigators study cohorts of elderly people longitudinally and globally and probe their immune systems with licensed vaccines to distinguish people with effective responses from those without, and apply cutting-edge tools from systems biology and AI, it should be feasible to identify biomarkers for effective immunity in this population, which could then be applied to other vulnerable populations, such as those living in low- and middle-income countries. Over the long term, the research agenda will need to include cultivation of a new generation of multidisciplinary scientists trained in biomedical, informatics, and computer sciences in order to fully prepare for the next wave of emerging diseases.

COVID-19 is highly transmissible, causes relatively high mortality, particularly in aging populations, and has emerged globally in our highly interconnected world. Short-term efforts to quickly develop lifesaving vaccines and therapeutics are of the utmost importance.

[11] Rapid development of an inactivated vaccine for SARS-CoV-2
Date: Fri 17 Apr 2020

Abstract
--------
The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about an unprecedented crisis, taking a heavy toll on human health, lives as well as the global economy. There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with 2 different doses (3 or 6 micrograms per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histopathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

[SARS-CoV-2 is part of the _Coronaviridae_ family, whose members are named after their crown-like appearance under the electron microscope caused by the surface glycoproteins that decorate the virus.

Therapeutic options
Clinical trials with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04257656, NCT04252664, NCT04280705, etc.) and protease inhibitors (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04255017, NCT04276688, etc.), as well as other treatment options, are ongoing in China and the USA, and trial results are expected within weeks. Remdesivir works against coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in animal models, as well as against the related MERS-CoV, including in NHPs (Agostini et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2019, de Wit et al., 2020, Sheahan et al., 2017, Sheahan et al., 2020). Remdesivir was also tested for treatment of ebolavirus infections in humans (and found to be less successful than other treatments by Mulangu et al., 2019); therefore, safety data exist for this therapeutic agent, which should accelerate the process of clinical testing against SARS-CoV-2.

Other treatment options with ongoing or planned clinical trials include dosing recombinant human ACE2 to neutralize the virus and prevent lung damage (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04287686) and using the antiviral umifenovir (Arbidol), a fusion inhibitor (Kadam and Wilson, 2017, Teissier et al., 2011).

Another interesting option is the use of convalescent serum as treatment; clinical trials to test this are ongoing in China (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04264858, placebo control, not recruiting yet), and compassionate use of this strategy has recently started in the USA.

Studies on SARS-CoV-1 and the related MERS-CoV vaccines show that the S protein on the surface of the virus is an ideal target for a vaccine. In SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, this protein interacts with the receptor ACE2, and antibodies targeting the spike can interfere with this binding, thereby neutralizing the virus.

The report above does not mention the target protein in the candidate vaccine. - Mod.UBA]
