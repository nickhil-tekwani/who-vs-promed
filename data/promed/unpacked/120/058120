We report the 1st case of West Nile [virus]
meningoencephalitis in Italy in 2010.

On 30 Aug 2010, a 41-year-old Algerian male
resident in Veneto (Santo Stino di Livenza) was
admitted to the Hospital of S. Vito al
Tagliamento in Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG), where
his brother lives, complaining of fever (40 C
[104 F]) and vomiting for the last 3 days. The
patient appeared confused, disoriented, agitated
without a neck stiffness.

A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed and
disclosed a clear fluid with a white blood cell
(WBC) count of 40 cells/mm3, a glucose level of
147 mg/dL and a protein level of 0.7 g/L. Samples
of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were taken
and tested for neurotropic agents but not for
West Nile virus (WNV). A presumptive diagnosis of
viral meningoencephalitis was made. After 3 days,
as clinical conditions did not improve he was
transferred to the Clinic of Infectious Disease
at the Hospital of Udine (FVG) where a diagnosis
of WNV infection was suspected.

On 3 Sep [2010], a serum sent for WNV
[serological testing] was positive for IgG
(1:1000) in immunofluorescence (IF) assay. A 2nd
blood test taken 12 days later was positive for
both IgM (1:10) and IgG (1:1000). He had never
been vaccinated against fellow fever or Japanese
encephalitis [viruses] and had not travelled
outside Italy in the last 6 months.

Blood samples were sent to the Regional Reference
Laboratory for West Nile virus (U.C.O. Hygiene
and Preventive Medicine, University of Trieste,
Italy) in according with the regional
surveillance system. The results were confirmed
by Regional and National referral centres
(Istituto Superiore di Sanitý; Rome, Italy).

After the recent active and passive surveillance
strategies for the monitoring of WNV in humans,
equines, birds and mosquitoes, increased cases in
animals has been reported in various Regions of
Italy but until now human cases have been
notified only in the northeast (Emilia-Romagna,
Veneto and Lombardy). We believe that the
serological tests for WNV should be available
also in peripheral centres, so that they can
follow the indications of the national monitoring
program of this emerging virus

[These 1st-hand reports from the field are
especially valuable for ProMED-mail subscribers,
and we thank Dr. Beltrame and colleagues for
providing this information. There was a previous
report this year (2010) of equine WNV infections
in 4 outbreaks in Sicily, far away from the
location of the above human case (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20100908.3235). WNV has caused human
and equine cases in northern Italy in previous
years -- as recently as last year (2009; see
ProMED-mail archive no.20100521.1725). This year
(2010) has been an active one for WNV
transmission in the Mediterranean Basin and into
Central Europe.
