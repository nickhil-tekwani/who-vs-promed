Residents were horrified on Fri [1 Jul 2016] after noticing that dead ducks and other birds were lined all along Marsh Creek [a creek west of the city of Trenton, Michigan].

Police said their phones were ringing off the hook from residents in the area looking for answers and voicing concern for their pets and children. According to Sgt. Fred Zdankiewicz, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources [DNR] informed police that a lack of rain has caused the water in the creek bed to recede and a form of botulism, a toxin caused by growing bacteria, has been able to grow in that area. The intense heat from high temperatures also has contributed to the problem.

Zdankiewicz said the ducks have been drinking water in the creek, which is considerably lower than normal, and the number of ducks poisoned began to spread. Zdankiewicz said the DNR came out Fri [1 Jul 2016] and took water and ground samples. A full investigation by the DNR is underway.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. - Mod.PMB
