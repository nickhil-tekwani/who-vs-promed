Public Health Notice - Outbreak of Salmonella infections related to contact with live baby poultry
------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial and local public health and agricultural partners to investigate an outbreak of salmonellosis in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan with cases of human illness related to contact with live baby poultry originating from a hatchery in Alberta.

The risk to Canadians is low. The Agency would like to take this opportunity to remind those who have contact with live poultry to take precautions to protect their health. Contact with live poultry can be a source of salmonellosis, even if a bird appears healthy and clean. You can get the infection from a bird, its droppings or from environments where birds have been. Proper hand washing is the key to protecting yourself from illness. Always wash your hands immediately after handling birds, cleaning up after them or being in an area where birds have been.

Investigation Summary
------
Currently there are 34 cases of human illness under investigation in 3 provinces: Alberta (17), British Columbia (13), and Saskatchewan (4). Individuals became sick between 5 Apr 2015 and 12 May 2015. These cases have all reported contact with live baby poultry. Most cases have reported contact with live baby poultry from a hatchery in Alberta.

Alberta Agriculture and Forestry is leading the animal health investigation and is working closely with the hatchery to determine the source of the infected live baby poultry. The hatchery is distributing information letters about this outbreak directly to its customers who have placed orders for live baby poultry beginning 1 Mar 2015.

Who is most at risk
----
Canadians who are particularly at risk for infection with salmonellosis include babies, children 5 years of age and under, pregnant women, the elderly and those with weaker immune systems. Young children are at higher risk of infection because they often enjoy handling and interacting with live baby poultry and may not wash their hands before putting their fingers or other contaminated items in or near their mouths. If infected, young children are also at increased risk for serious illness because their immune systems are still developing.

What you should do
----
If you have been in contact with live poultry and develop symptoms of a salmonella infection that persist or are severe, you should consult a health professional and mention your exposure to live poultry.

When interacting with any live poultry, either in your own backyard or in public settings, there are things you can do to help protect your health and the health of your family:
- Wash your hands thoroughly with warm soap and water immediately after touching live poultry or any items around where birds have been.
- Adults should help children wash their hands.
- If you can't wash your hands right away, use hand sanitizer until you are able to wash with soap and water.
- Keep any live poultry away from your face. Don't snuggle or kiss the birds.
- Keep your hands away from your face while handling live poultry until you have washed your hands.
- Children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weak immune systems shouldn't handle or touch live poultry.
-Keep live poultry and poultry equipment outside your home and away from places where people eat or make food.

Salmonellosis can also result from exposure to contaminated poultry meat and poultry products, including eggs. There are precautions you can take to help protect you and your family from getting sick:
- Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before and after handling eggs and raw poultry meat.
- Do not eat raw or undercooked poultry meat and eggs. Poultry meat pieces, eggs and egg-based foods should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 74 degrees C (165 degrees F) to ensure they are safe to eat. Whole poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 82 degrees C (180 degrees F).
- Use pasteurized egg products instead of raw eggs when preparing foods that aren't heated (such as icing, eggnog or salad dressing).
- Never place cooked or ready-to-eat food on an unwashed plate that held raw poultry meat or eggs.

[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle and they carry salmonellae. 2 ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL
