The regional agricultural organisation (UPA CyL) has pointed out a problem being faced by potato growers, mainly those growing the variety Monalisa. Currently the potatoes are not getting harvested because they are infected with a virus. The virus is relatively widely distributed in Europe and does not affect taste, but it causes spots on the outside of the tubers. Local wholesalers and traders are imposing extreme standards and are refusing the produce.

UPA demands that producers harvest all potatoes still left in the fields without delay since they are suitable for processing at this time.
