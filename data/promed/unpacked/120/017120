KFD was first described in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka State
[of India].
- most cases are reported from Karnataka (Shimoga, northern and southern
Kanara and Chikmagalur districts).
- rates peak in January and February.
Notable outbreaks:
1983 - An outbreak (326 cases, 29 fatal) [case fatality rate (CFR) of 8.9
per cent] was reported. Other sources quote 1155 cases (180 fatal) [CFR of
15.6 per cent].
1999 - 10 cases were reported.
2000 - Outbreaks were reported in Honnavar, Joida and Siddapur taluks --
including 9 deaths, of which 2 were virologically confirmed.
2002 - An outbreak (98 cases, 6 fatal) [CFR of 6.1 per cent] was reported.
2003 - An outbreak (253 cases, 10 fatal) [CFR of 4.0 per cent] involved
about 70 villages in Chikmagalur, Shimoga, Uttara Kannada, and Dakshina
Kannada districts (Karnataka). [see also 20030503.1106] An additional 170
villages reported suspect cases at the time.
2004 - An outbreak (27 cases, 1 fatal) [CFR of 3.7 per cent] was reported
in Karnataka.
88 152 people in an endemic area were vaccinated during 1990 to 1992.
22.4 per cent of people living in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are
seropositive.
Local reservoirs include black-faced langurs (_Presbytis entellus_),
macaques (_Macaca radiata_), shrews (_Suncus murinus_), rats (_Rattus
wroughtoni_), birds, squirrels, and bats.
- epizootics were reported among monkeys during 1964 to 1973.
The principal vector is _Haemaphysalis spinigera_.
The appearance of dead monkeys in the endemic area may herald an epidemic
Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 _P. entellus_
and 186 _M. radiata_) died in endemic areas. KFD virus was isolated from
118 _P. entellus_ and 13 _M. radiata_.
