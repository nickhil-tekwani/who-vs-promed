[The following is an update on tomato curly stunt disease caused by tomato
curly stunt begomovirus (ToCSV) on tomato crops in South Africa from
Gerhard, who is a subscriber to ProMED-Plant. - Mod.DH
[The disease was first observed in 2000 in the Pongola area (confirmed
report, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transmission [by the
whitefly vector) where some fields with 100 per cent infections were
observed. It has now spread to the north of KwaZulu Natal (just south of
Mozambique). This year (May 2001) we have confirmed its occurrence 200 km
south of Pongola at Nkwalini, where several fields (about 30 ha out of
about 50 ha visited) had 100 per cent infections. In [several cases, where
infection occurred at an early stage of [plant development, [yield losses
were 100 per cent, and [virus identification was confirmed by PCR. We
have reports of its widespread occurrence in Mozambique (Nurbibi Cossa),
based on symptoms, but this has not been confirmed by tests. At Komatipoort
and Pongola, where outbreaks have occurred, farmers have controlled the
disease [by transplanting seedlings [treated with systemic insecticides
[followed by massive insecticide [applications.
I am concerned about the effect of this on the environment, the potential
[for resistance build-up in [thewhitefly to these insecticides, and the
fact that small-scale and subsistence farmers in the affected area cannot
apply these measures and are likely to [suffer total losses of tomato crops.
