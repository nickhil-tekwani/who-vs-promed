Red blotch virus has been detected in wine grape collections in South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria during random biosecurity testing. The collections are used for propagation, but the virus has so far not been found in commercial nurseries or vineyards. It is suspected to have been brought into the country with infected plants, probably from the US. The industry is now working with state governments for more testing to map exactly where the virus is present. In case of a suspected or proven incursion, a response system will be set up.

The detection in Australia is recent, but it is suspected that the virus has been present there for some time. So far, there is no evidence of its spread within the country. In the US, the virus is spread by a leafhopper, but currently no equivalent vector is known for Australia, which could be preventing local insect transmission for now. Officials say that there is no cause for panic, but eradication is essential.

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening. Previously, it had been reported from the US and Canada on a wide range of grape cultivars, including wine, table, raisin, and rootstock varieties, both in propagation and commercial grape production facilities. GRB does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (associated with several viruses within the family Closteroviridae; see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades; pink or red veins; occasional reddening of whole leaf blades; as well as slow accumulation of sugars in berries; or failure of fruits to mature. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards.

The new geminivirus _Grapevine red blotch virus_ (GRBV; genus _Grablovirus_) has recently been shown to be associated with GRB. GRBV has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. It is not known so far whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. GRBV is transmitted by grafting tools, with infected budwood, and via rootstocks. A treehopper native to North America (_Spissistilus festinus_; family Membracidae) has been identified as a vector for GRBV in that region (ProMED post 20160610.4276953).

GRBV is considered an emerging threat to grape industries. Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host, as well as a historic international exchange of germplasm, viruses, and viroids may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars. They can accumulate over many generations, leading to general decline of plants and severe yield reductions. Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus-free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, scions for grafting) is essential.

In the US, in addition to production vineyards, GRBV has also been found in a germplasm collection for distribution of cultivars to growers (ProMED post 20180117.5566550). Isolates were related to 2 different GRBV groups, indicating multiple incursions. The presence of a virus in a germplasm collection compounds the risk of its spread.
