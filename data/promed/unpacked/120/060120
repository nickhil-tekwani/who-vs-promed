According to a report in the Egypt Independent today, 2 people, an adult woman and a child, have tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza.

According to the report by Al-Masry Al-Youm [newspaper], "A 56-year-old woman in Beheira's Damanhour, and a 4-year-old child in Damietta, who are in critical condition, have been transferred to ICU and administered Tamiflu treatment.

"These 2 patients are the 1st bird flu cases to be discovered since April 2013."

There is no notice of the infections on the Egyptian Health Ministry website as of this publication.

As Avian Flu Diary blogger, Mike Coston noted in a post Friday [21 Mar 2014] concerning the precipitous drop in cases in Egypt in recent years: "After reporting the most human infections with the H5N1 virus for 4 years running (2009=39, 2010=29, 2011=39, 2012=11), the reported number of cases out of Egypt plummeted last year (2013) to only 4."

According to the WHO, the primary risk factor for human infection with the virus appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.

They go on to say there is no evidence to suggest that the H5N1 virus can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared poultry or eggs. A few human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood. However, slaughter, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are likely to be risk factors.

[According to the WHO Influenza at the human-animal interface Summary and assessment as of [25 Feb 2014] (available at http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_25Feburary14.pdf?ua=1), during the period 2003 to [25 Feb 2014], there were 658 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported including 388 deaths, from a total of 15 countries that have been reported to WHO. During the period 2005 through the beginning of 2014, there have been a total of 173 laboratory confirmed cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection including 63 deaths reported by Egypt (see http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140124CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1 for a table showing the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2014). (This table is current as of 24 Jan 2014 and does not include cases confirmed in Viet Nam (1), Cambodia (9), and China (2) since 24 Jan 2014).

As the media report above suggests, Egypt had been reporting 20+ cases annually up through 2012, when there were 11 cases (including 5 deaths) and 2013 when there were 4 cases (including 3 deaths) reported. As with other more eastern Asian countries reporting cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) infections, most cases were associated with "backyard flocks" of poultry, where human cases were associated with retrospectively identified poultry die-offs. We await further information on contact histories of these 2 newly confirmed cases in Egypt.

For a map of Egypt showing governorates, see http://www.ephotopix.com/egypt_governorate_map.html.
Damanhur is the capital of the Beheira Governorate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damanhur) and is located 160 km (99 mi) northwest of Cairo, and 70 km (43 mi) east/southeast of Alexandria in the middle of the western Nile Delta (see no. 2 on the map above).
Damietta, also known as Damiata, or Domyat, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damietta) is the capital of the Damietta Governorate, located at the Damietta branch of the Nile, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the Mediterranean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) north of Cairo (see no 9 on the referenced map above).
For the HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Egypt, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2353435,55.

Of note, earlier this year (2014), ProMED-mail reported on media reports of cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in Dakahlia governorate in Egypt (see Avian influenza, human (25): Egypt (DK) H5N1, RFI 20140120.2184238). These cases were never confirmed by official sources. (Dakahlia governorate is no 8 on the map of Egypt showing governorates mentioned above, and neighbors with Damietta Governorate). - Mod.MPP]
