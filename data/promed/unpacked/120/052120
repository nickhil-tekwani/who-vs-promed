Guam has averaged between 5 to 6 cases of leprosy per year. However, more cases are popping up in 2013, which has caused the Department of Public Health to spread more community awareness on this curable disease.

Hansen's disease (HD), better known as leprosy, is a growing cause for concern on the island. Public Health doesn't consider it an outbreak because it has been endemic. TB [tuberculosis] and HD Program Manager Cecilia Arciaga says leprosy has been around since the biblical times, but unfortunately on Guam, there are a lot of undiagnosed cases. "As of September of 2013, we have actually 15 new leprosy cases on Guam," said Arciaga.

According to public health's statistics, compiled between 2003 to 2012, the most reported cases of leprosy were documented in 2003 and 2008. Although leprosy affects all ages, the age group most affected on Guam is between 25 to 44 years old. 72 percent of diagnosed cases are also male. Current statistics also show 94 percent of all diagnosed cases on Guam are people that descended from the Freely Associated States of Micronesia.

Arciaga explains leprosy is a chronic infection caused by a type of bacteria group called _Mycobacterium leprae_. She mentions while leprosy is similar to the disease that causes tuberculosis, it is not as contagious. The World Health Organization states it is transmitted by droplets from the nose and mouth and during close and frequent contact with untreated cases.

"Technically what it does it affects actually the nerves," said Arciaga. "So the 1st symptom usually of leprosy would be a patch, which could be reddish in color, which could be pale in color." She points out the most significant feature of this patch is that it has no sensation and it does not itch. "So if anybody with a patch any part of their skin that has no or decreased sensation, they really got to see a doctor right away," said Arciaga.

She also says if a person has 5 patches or less, this type of leprosy is classified as paucibacillary. If there are more than 5 patches, it is classified as multibacillary. She emphasizes leprosy is not something you catch that develops into a full-blown disease right away. Arciaga says depending on individual immune systems, a person can catch leprosy and it can stay dormant for up to 25 years. But the good news is, there is a cure and it is free.

"For a single patch of leprosy, it can be cured as short as 6 months," said Arciaga. "And for multibacillary type of leprosy, you can be treated for only up to a year and you're considered cured."

Arciaga adds early diagnosis and multidrug treatment is the key to wipe out the disease. If left untreated, leprosy can cause deformities and permanent damage to a person's nerves, limbs, eyes and skin. She recommends for people to visit their local physicians if they are experiencing possible symptoms or to stop by public health.

"If you don't have any insurance, just come by and we'll have our physician take a look at you and we'll work you up," said Arciaga. "And if it's a leprosy case, we will surely start you on treatment and rest assured, it can be cured." Public health is planning outreach events in the community to educate people more about this disease in the coming months.

[Guam is part of the WHO Western Pacific Region, one of the 6 regions of WHO. The Western Pacific Region is home to about 1.6 billion people, nearly 1/3rd of the world's population. This region includes 37 countries and areas, from China and Mongolia in the north and west, to New Zealand and Australia in the south, to Japan and Korea in the northeast, and French Polynesia in the southeast (http://www.wpro.who.int/countries/en/). Included also are Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam, plus multiple smaller Pacific island countries (http://www.wpro.who.int/countries/en/).

The development of multidrug therapy for the treatment of leprosy in the early 1980s, initially implemented in the Western Pacific Region in 1985, has allowed possible control of the disease. According to the WHO report "Epidemiological Review of Leprosy in the Western Pacific Region 2008-2010", available at http://www.wpro.who.int/leprosy/documents/leprosy_report_2008_2010.pdf, elimination of "leprosy as a public health problem at the national level, defined as a prevalence rate below one case per 10 000 population, was achieved in 34 of the 37 countries and areas, covering 99.9 percent of the total population of the Western Pacific Region. In 2010, a total of 8386 cases were registered with a prevalence rate of 0.05 per 10 000 population. 5 countries (China, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam) contributed to 86 percent of the total prevalence. The Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands never reached leprosy elimination, while Kiribati failed to maintain the elimination threshold. The prevalence rate increased from 2008 to 2009 but decreased again in 2010. Compared with 1991, when the Region achieved the overall elimination goal, the prevalence decreased by 88 percent.

"A total of 5055 new cases were reported in 2010 with a new case detection rate of 0.3 per 100 000 population. The new case detection rate has decreased by 5.8 percent compared with 2009 and decreased by 66 percent compared with 1991, showing a continuing decline in the total number of new cases detected in the Region. 5 countries (Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam) contributed to 84 percent of the newly detected cases in the Region."

According to WHO, the prevalence rate for leprosy in Guam, however, has risen from 0.06 (1 case) in 2003 to 1 (16 cases) in 2008 and 0.8 (14 cases) per 10 000 in 2010; and the incidence rate has risen from 0.6 (1 case) in 2003 to 5.5 (10 cases) per 100 000 in 2010 (Tables 11 and 12, http://www.wpro.who.int/leprosy/documents/leprosy_report_2008_2010.pdf). Of the 6 new cases in 2009 and 10 new cases in 2010, 2 in each of those years were in children younger than 15 years (consistent with recent transmission) (Tables 4 and 5).

Guam is a US territory and the largest and southernmost island of the Mariana Islands. The rest of the Mariana archipelago is the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Chamorro are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands. Guamanians are United States citizens and have a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam).
