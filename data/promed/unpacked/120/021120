I talked to Dr. David Wilson, Seed Pathologist, P.O. Box 742, Dept. of
Plant Pathology, Univ. of Georgia, Tifton, GA 31793 (912-386-3368, email:
dwilson@tifton.cpes.peachnet.edu), regarding the inquiry about fungal
damaged sorghum. I am communicating his response as best I could record it
at the time, but if there are errors, they are probably mine rather than
his.
1) The food value (calorie & protein) is lost in the spoilage process
itself. Kwashiorkor may simply be the result of lack of nutrients.
However, he noted that rather non-specific maladies occur from eating
spoiled grain, often as the result of Fusarium fungi, and various yeasts
and bacteria. He suspects that these are probably more prevalent and
contributing more to illness than aflatoxin, which he thinks is not often a
severe problem on sorghum. He also noted that the incidence of bacterial
diseases may also increase due to general assault on the immune system.
This increase is similar to the increase in incidence of bacterial
pneumonia in cattle when fed improperly cured silage.
2) The best overall recommendation is to discard the spoiled grain, and
make sure the marginal grain is thoroughly dried and stays dry.
3) If the grain is being stored again after drying, a spray of acetic acid
or propionic acid, followed by drying before storage should help reduce
subsequent deterioration of the grain. The solution should be applied to
achieve a rate of 10 g of actual acid (not diluted solution) per kg of
grain.
4) He also suggested fermentation might decrease toxicity and increase
protein (echoing the suggestion of Aldert A Bergwerff (Aug.26)).
5) Also echoing Aldert A Bergwerff, he suggested bentonite or zeolite, to
be included at 1/2 to 1% when preparing the food.
