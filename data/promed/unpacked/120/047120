that no new case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) had been reported between 16

discharged [and no deaths [have been reported.
It was stated that the total number of cases of RVF since the outbreak
began last year until 23 Mar 2001 was 822 [presumably a misprint for 882 -
Mod.CP, with 757 recovered patients discharged and 124 deaths.

[The epidemic of Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia appears to have been
contained. Since Thu 11 Jan 2001, only 27 new cases and 4 deaths have been
reported. During this period another 27 patients were discharged from
hospital. There has been no recent update on the current situation in
neighboring Yemen, where the outbreak appears to have begun. - Mod.CP
