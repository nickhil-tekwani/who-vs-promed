The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) scare has gripped areas on the outskirts of Jodhpur district [Rajasthan], from where one person has been tested positive for the disease, while 2 others are suspected cases who have been admitted to a hospital in Ahmedabad [Gujarat] for treatment. Since CCHF has epidemic potential with high percentage of fatalities, the health department has issued an alert on the disease.

The Times of India (TOI) had published a story on [28 May 2019] 'Animals test positive for Congo fever antibodies' alerting the health authorities on Congo fever. The TOI had mentioned that the state is vulnerable to CCHF, commonly known as Congo fever, as blood samples drawn from animals in the state tested positive for CCHF virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.

The National Institute of Virology (NIV) had informed the state that seropositivity of CCHF among livestock has been reported from the state. The NIV had conducted the serosurvey to analyse the risk of spreading of the disease.

Currently, Congo fever is taking a toll on the health of the people in the neighbouring state of Gujarat, which has reported deaths of patients due to the fever. Despite increasing threat of Congo fever, the health department needs to take necessary measures.

A 32-year-old person has been tested positive for the disease [CCHF]. He is a resident of Jodhpur [Rajasthan] and his 2 children, 8-year-old girl and 6-year-old boy, were found suffering from the symptoms of Congo fever. The children were taken to Ahmedabad [Gujarat] for treatment. "The Gujarat government has informed us that one person from the state has been tested for Congo fever, we have issued an alert on it across the state [Rajasthan]," said Dr VK Mathur, health director, health department. Besides, health minister Raghu Sharma has confirmed that there were cases reported of diseases caused by bite of ticks in Jodhpur and Bikaner [districts in Rajasthan]. "We have sent our teams to the respective districts to take the situation under control," said Sharma.

"We have conducted surveys of houses in 2 days since the 1st such suspected cases of disease [CCHF] caused by bite of tick. We are keeping a watch in the affected area," said Dr Balwant Manda, chief medical health officer, Jodhpur. The situation is under control and there is no need to panic, he said.
