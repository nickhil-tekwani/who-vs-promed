[Early this year (2014) South Korea reported the occurrence of HPAI, H5N8. 29 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks occurred in the provinces of North and South Jeolla, North and South Chungcheong, Gyeonggi, and South Gyeongsang. The last outbreak was officially reported on 21 Apr 2014 (see follow-up report no 5 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15044). The event was resolved on 4 Sep 2014. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=14668.

In June and July 2014, Mod.AS in his comments in ProMED posts 20140619.2552686 and 20140730.2646054 asked that official reports be provided for outbreaks communicated by the media during the months of June and July.

Within 10 days of having officially declared the event resolved, another case occurred in a province where the disease had already been detected. It may have been premature to have declared the event resolved, especially given that in July 2014 outbreaks continued to occur, though these were not officially reported, and given the role that wild birds play in the epidemiology of the disease.
