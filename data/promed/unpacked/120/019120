Two batches of Valdilal Custard Apple Pulp were recalled after a customer complaint to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted testing that found _Salmonella_. That lone complaint, the company-written, FDA-posted recall notice says, said 5 people had gotten sick from the custard apple pulp.

By the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s count, salmonellosis strikes 1.35 million Americans each year, hospitalizes about 26 500 and kills 420. Most at risk for the worst effects are senior citizens, children under 5 and those with damaged immune systems. Most people get fever, vomiting, stomachaches and diarrhea that starts around 12 to 72 hours after eating the tainted food and runs for 4 to 7 days.

This recall concerns batch numbers KWHO and KRQO of 35.27-ounce packets with a best-by date of September [2023]. They were sent to stores nationwide. If you have the recalled custard apple pulp, [toss] it or return it to the store for a full refund.

Vadilal Industries (USA) Inc. of Newark, NJ is voluntarily recalling 2 batches of frozen Custard Apple Pulp because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with _Salmonella_ often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

The product was distributed nationwide through retail stores and is sold in 35.27-ounce packets. The packets are labeled as "Custard Apple Pulp," and the batch codes are printed on the back of the packet. The product code, description, lot code, UPC and Best Before information are noted below.

Product code / Product description / Batch lot code / UPC / Best before
FPEP44302 / Custard Apple Pulp / KWHO, KRQO / 8901777282168 / September 2023

The recall was initiated after FDA received a single complaint reporting 5 illnesses and FDA sampling revealed the presence of _Salmonella_ in the product. Consumers who have purchased Custard Apple Pulp with these batch codes should discontinue use or return it to the store of purchase for a full refund. Retailers that may have further distributed the recalled lot codes should share this notice with their customers.

[The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is not stated here nor is where the human cases occurred.

"Custard apple is a common name for a fruit and the tree that bears it, _Annona reticulata_. The fruits vary in shape, heart-shaped, spherical, oblong or irregular. The size ranges from 7 to 12 cm (2.8 to 4.7 in), depending on the cultivar. When ripe, the fruit is brown or yellowish, with red highlights and a varying degree of reticulation, depending again on the variety. The flesh varies from juicy and very aromatic to hard with an astringent taste. The flavor is sweet and pleasant, akin to the taste of 'traditional' custard" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard_apple).

Custard apple may also be the name of some similar fruits produced by related trees:
- _Annonaceae_, the soursop family
- _Asimina triloba, the "pawpaw," a deciduous tree, ranging from southern Ontario to Texas and Florida, that bears the largest edible fruit native to the United States or Canada
- _Annona cherimola_, a tree and fruit also called cherimoya
- _Annona squamosa_, a tree and fruit also called sugar apple or sweetsop
- _Annona senegalensis_, a tree and fruit called wild custard-apple
- _Casimiroa edulis_, in the rue or citrus family, Rutaceae. - Mod.LL
