[The awareness of the Senegalese veterinary authorities, leading to
detection of RVF in animals prior to the reporting of human cases, is
commendable and may be helpful in reducing human infections. Unfortunately,
in several earlier cases -- in Africa and the Arab peninsula -- human cases
preceded the detection of animal infections.
RVF was initially recorded in southwest Mauritania and bordering north
Senegal in 1987, following the opening of Diama Dam at the mouth of the
Senegal River. The dam project created additional breeding grounds for
mosquitoes carrying the disease, and initially resulted in more than 200
human deaths from RVF. - Mod.AS]
