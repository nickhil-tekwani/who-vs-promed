SARS - WORLDWIDE (28): LABORATORY INVESTIGATION

There are several points that I would like to highlight.
1. For the investigation of such laboratory infection cases, the
investigation team must base their investigation on BMBL [see below]
or WHO guidelines, and not based on some never-before-recorded
comments of the individual team members.
2. My concern is that when investigations are focused on lab
infection, other possible routes of infection will be neglected.
3. I understand that one of the patients had not been working with
live SARS virus, suggesting that there may be an unknown source of
infection within the lab. Despite the closing of the institute, some
staff members are left behind to carry on routine work. This further
increases the risk of more infections.
4. It is essential to perform a sero-survey of the members of the
institute staff to see whether there any are asymptomatic infections.

[Dr. Tang raises some interesting points. The suggestion to conduct
a serosurvey of the staff is a good one, combined with clinical
histories of possible mild respiratory illness that might not have
come to the attention of the health sector.
The BMBL refers to the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories manual. The 4th edition can be downloaded from
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl4/bmbl4toc.htm>.
Given the current history of 4 SARS coronavirus (CoV) infections in
individuals working in laboratories where research on the SARS CoV
was ongoing (Singapore, Taiwan and 2 cases in Beijing), it would be
an unusual coincidence if the 2 most recent cases in Beijing were not
associated with transmission within the laboratory but rather through
another route. Again, we await further information on the findings
of the laboratory-based investigations. - Mod.MPP]
