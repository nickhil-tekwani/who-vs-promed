Malaysia: Sharp Rise in Dengue Fever Cases
------------------------------------------
An opposition political party on Mon 17 Dec 2002 urged health authorities
to place [the whole of] Malaysia on dengue fever alert amid a sharp rise in
cases of the mosquito-borne disease, which has killed 40 people here this
year. Lim Kit Siang, chairman of the Chinese-dominated Democratic Action
Party (DAP) said in a statement that in the first 10 months of 2002, the
dengue fever outbreak has claimed the lives of 40 people, including 12 in
central Selangor state, 13 in southern Johor state, 10 in northern Perak
state, and 3 in southern Negri Sembilan.
In September 2002, Malaysia placed its capital city, Kuala Lumpur, and 4
states on dengue fever alert following an alarming surge in cases.
