The agricultural sector in Benghazi revealed today [26 Nov 2021] the presence of outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in the Al-Wahat region.

The coordinator of the agricultural sector in Benghazi, Miftah Al-Khashmi, met on Thursday [25 Nov 2021] with the head of the National Center for Animal Health, Zakaria Al-Khattal. The meeting took place in the presence of Abdel Hakim Al-Misrati, head of the Benghazi Agricultural Police. The meeting discussed the presence of some Rift Valley fever outbreaks in the Al-Wahat region.

The meeting dealt with how to coordinate actions with the competent authorities to combat this disease that affects animals and causes infection in humans.

[Since its emergence in December 2019 and up to September 2021, the Libyan competent authority in animal health had officially reported to OIE 12 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks. Clinical signs were observed among sheep and goats. According to the information published in the media report above, it seems that RVF outbreaks have been recorded recently in the Al Wahat region.

ProMED would appreciate receiving any available information on the event, in particular the results of the epidemiological investigation by the veterinary services, including results of the laboratory tests applied and the species involved. - Mod.SF

"Positive serological findings in Algeria, Western Sahara, Tunisia, Libya, Iraq, Iran and Turkey, which are or were countries considered officially free from RVF, must be carefully interpreted on the bases of the study designs and diagnostic tests used. However, the repeated detection of serological positive individuals (animals or humans) in these countries must be seen as a signal of a potential risk of RVF spread out of its endemic geographical area" (see abstract by Nielsen et al [1]).

Libya shares borders with 2 RVF-infected countries, Egypt and Sudan, where significant numbers of clinical cases in animals and humans, including mortalities in both, have been reported for decades. No human cases have been informed from Libya so far; the reports of cases in animals would benefit from more clinical detail.

Considerable imports of animals for slaughter or for further trade -- legal and otherwise -- from Sudan and other east African, RVF-infected countries, into Libya are known to take place. Egypt has been applying, since the major RVF outbreak in 1979-1982, annual mass vaccinations of susceptible ruminants. Seropositivity of vaccinated animals does not necessarily reflect virus activity.

Evidence of the local circulation of the RVF virus within Libya deserves substantiation by virus isolation, entomological studies and enhanced efforts to identify human cases. Such cases may be inapparent or associated with a moderate to severe, nonfatal, influenza-like illness.
