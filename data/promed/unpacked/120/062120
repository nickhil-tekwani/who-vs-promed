The Vindhya region has reported 200 cases of scrub typhus so far this year [2021]. However, viral and seasonal diseases are on decline, according to doctors at Shyam Shah Medical College hospital, Rewa. As per doctors, certain deaths too have been reported among scrub typhus affected patients. However, they attributed the deaths to comorbidities.

Scrub typhus cases are on the rise in Vindhya region. It leads to multiple organ failure. So, deaths are due to multiple organ failure. Viral disease is on decline, said Dr Naresh Bajaj, head of pediatric department at the hospital attached to Shyam Shah Medical College in Rewa.

As for its prevention, no vaccine is available to prevent scrub typhus. People are advised to reduce risk of contracting the disease by avoiding contact with infected chiggers. When traveling to areas where scrub typhus is common, avoid areas with lots of vegetation and brush where chiggers may be found.

The scrub typhus symptoms are similar to dengue. Its symptoms are fever and chills, headache, body ache and muscle pain, a dark, scab-like region at the site of the chigger bite (also known as eschar), mental changes ranging from confusion to coma, enlarged lymph nodes, rashes, etc.

According to doctors, scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. After an incubation period of 6 to 21 days (mean 10 to 12 days), symptoms of scrub typhus start suddenly and include fever, chills, headache, and generalized lymphadenopathy. At onset of fever, rashes develop at the spot of chigger bite. The typical lesion of scrub typhus, common in whites [and rare in Asians], begins as a red lesion and ultimately it ruptures, and becomes covered with a black scab. Regional lymph nodes enlarge. Fever rises during 1st week. Headache is severe and common. A macular rash develops on the trunk during the 5th to 8th day of fever, often extending to the arms and legs. It may disappear rapidly and intensely coloured. Cough is present during the 1st week of fever. In severe cases, pulse rate increases, blood pressure drops. Delirium, stupor, and muscular itching develop. In untreated patients, high fever may persist for 2 weeks, then it falls gradually over several days.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, but we are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis was made. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Vindhya Pradesh was a former state of India that was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956. Madhya Pradesh is a state in central India; its capital is Bhopal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh). Rewa is a city, with a population of 236 516 residents, which is the administrative center of Rewa District and Rewa Division (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewa,_Madhya_Pradesh). - Mod.ML
