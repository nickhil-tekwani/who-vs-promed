Cholera Has Surfaced in Ulsan
-----------------------------
The [South Korean National Institute of Health (NIH) yesterday reported an
outbreak of cholera in the southeastern city of Ulsan, South Kyongsang
Province. This is the first such occurrence since 1999, when 3 patients
were diagnosed with cholera in South Cholla Province. A patient in his 60s
showed symptoms of diarrhea after eating raw fish, but a medical diagnosis
revealed that he had contracted the disease, NIH said.
As part of efforts to see if there are another patients infected by cholera
and to prevent the spread of the disease, the NIH is conducting
investigations across the region with the cooperation of a group of
epidemic specialists from medical organizations, NIH officials stated. To
prevent the disease, people should boil their drinking water and eat
well-cooked food, as well as refrain from eating raw fish, according to the
NIH officials.

Concern Mounts as Cholera Spreads in Kyongsang Region
-----------------------------------------------------
Shortly after this year's first case of cholera was discovered in the
southeastern city of Ulsan, 7 more people were found to have contracted the
disease in Yongchon, North Kyongsang Province, the [South Korean National
Institute of Health (NIH) reported yesterday. They all had diarrhea and
stomach pains after dining at a restaurant in Yongchon, some 300 km
southeast of Seoul, the NIH said.
It also reported that more than 100 other people ate at the same restaurant
around the day that the 7 patients did. The medical authorities isolated
all of them in a bid to carry out emergency check-ups and prevent a further
spread of the disease, and did not rule out the possibility that the region
could see more cholera patients and that the sickness could spread to the
surrounding areas. Earlier, the NIH warned of a large-scale outbreak of
cholera this year, which usually surfaces every 10 years. The nation had
more than 100 cholera patients in 1980 and 1991.
To prevent the disease, people are advised to boil their drinking water and
eat well-cooked food, as well as refrain from eating raw fish, according to
the NIH officials.

[According to the GIDEON database, the Republic of Korea reported 1964
cases during 1950 to 1969; 475 in 1970; 145 in 1980; 0 during 1984 to 1988.
There were 6 imported cases reported in 1992; 5 (imported, 0 fatal) in
1993; 34 (imported, 0 fatal) in 1994; 74 (6 imported, 0 fatal) in 1995; 7
(5 imported, 0 fatal) in 1996; 10 (0 fatal) in 1997. The 1991 data
referenced in this article are not noted in the database, but the 1970 data
may further support the 10-year cyclical nature of the disease in Korea.
The data for 1950-1969 data are not presented by year, so they cannot be
analyzed for cyclical trends. - Mod.ES
