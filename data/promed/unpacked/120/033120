One of our friends has reported that 11 cases of suspected CCHF have been admitted to the TB hospital in Quetta [Balochistan] since 1 Oct [2015]. All had a history of animal handling due to Eidul Azha [Islamic Feast of Sacrifice]. Of these, 3 of them died and one is still in critical condition. Samples for CCHF tests have been dispatched to NIH.

Investigations are under way and a detailed report will be shared as received.

[Circumstances under which these patients acquired their CCHF virus infections are not stated in the report above. They probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

Quetta is the provincial capital of Balochistan, Pakistan and 9th largest city of Pakistan. ProMED-mail has posted CCHF cases in Balochistan recently (see archive no 20151004.3689071).
