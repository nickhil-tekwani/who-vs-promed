Given the high concentration of new cases of African swine fever [ASF] infection within a short period, located on Romania's border areas adjacent to the Ukraine region of Odessa, there is an emergency for both countries. In general, the ASF situation in the European Union has recently deteriorated, both in terms of number of new cases and the size of territories affected.

As viewed by Rosselkhoznadzor's experienced specialists, the development of such an epizootic situation and massive spread of infection in the direction of the Balkans is primarily due to uncontrolled movement of infected animals and pig products from the infected regions. ASF also challenges the well-being of southern and central European countries. The Rosselkhoznadzor has repeatedly notified its European counterparts of its concern about the "soft approach" implemented in conducting culling and other ASF-preventive activities.

[The extent of the recent ASF outbreak in Romania's Tulcea province is striking and exceptional. Starting 9 Jun 2018, 235 cases have been reported within 21 days, of which 234 occurred in backyard holdings (most of them including fewer than 5 animals), one in a large commercial pig-breeding farm (43 800 animals) and 2 in wild boar.

The summarised statistics, as of 4 Jul 2018, are as follows:

Total outbreaks = 237 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 45 873 / 1059 / 99 / 1734* / 0
Wild boar / 2 / 5 / 5 / 0 / 0

*According to the OIE summary, the eradication at the large breeding farm seems not to have been completed yet.

The data in each of the 237 reports and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000027136_20180705_164526.pdf.

In the meantime, the disease has spread to another province, Contanza, bordering Tulcea on its south [African swine fever - Europe (22): Romania (CT) domestic swine, OIE, archive number: 20180705.5890073].

The concern expressed in the Russian publication is plausible. - Mod.AS
