The upstairs neighbors of a 37-year-old woman who apparently tried to commit suicide with ricin were able to return home Thursday evening [3 Oct 2013] after a hazmat team determined there was little danger of exposure.

"The incident poses no danger to the neighboring houses," Jason Killinen, a spokesman for the North Logan [Utah] Fire Department said in a blog posting Thursday evening.

The woman remained hospitalized but was talking with police and the FBI on Thursday.

Production of ricin, which can be a weapon of mass destruction, violates federal law, but it was not clear whether prosecutors would prosecute her since her aim, according to North Park Police Chief Kim Hawkes, was to die -- not to spread the deadly toxin.

North Park is the police agency for North Logan and Hyde Park.

Members of the Utah Air and Army National Guard's 85th Civil Support Team entered the home -- divided into a basement apartment where the woman lived and another above -- in the late afternoon.

No ricin was found in the upstairs apartment or in the ventilation system, clearing the way for the family of 4 -- a couple, a grandmother and a son -- to move back in.

Ricin was found, however, in the basement apartment. The Bear River Health Department planned to work with the homeowner to mitigate any residual contamination, Killinen said.

Ricin is highly toxic, and at high levels of exposure can cause severe diarrhea and fatal episodes of shock. Death typically occurs within 3 to 5 days of the initial exposure due to multiple organ failure.

The scare began when the woman's out-of-state cousin contacted police Wednesday [2 Oct 2013] at about 10:30 p.m. after exchanging texts and at least one phone call with the woman, Hawkes said.

The North Logan woman was nauseated and vomiting during the day Wednesday and apparently told her cousin something that alarmed her. "She (the cousin) knew she (ill woman) was sick," Hawkes said.

The woman ordered 60 castor beans online, soaked and apparently ground and ate half of them, he said. She made no attempt to broadcast the deadly toxin or to vaporize it, he said.

Killinen said the woman told police on Thursday that she learned to make ricin online.

A neighbor said the upstairs neighbors were not happy to have to evacuate their home and to leave behind even their car keys.

"It's disheartening to be taken out of your house in your pajamas," she said of the family. They were checked out at a hospital Wednesday night and stayed with friends while waiting to return home.

The woman who ate the castor beans has back trouble and suffers mental health issues, [the neighbor] said.

Members in the North Logan 5th Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had tried to help, said [the neighbor], who has delivered meals but had little conversation with the woman. "There's nothing more we could have done to help her," she said.

The National Guard's 85th Civil Support Team is one of 50-plus around the country that helps local agencies respond to hazardous material spills, accidents and other exposures. The team is based in Salt Lake City.

Its members are full-time employees of the Guard and essentially active duty, so they are still working during the federal government shutdown, said Lt. Col. Hank McIntire, spokesman for the Guard.

[Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Castor beans can pass intact through the gastrointestinal system without causing a problem. But when the bean's exterior shell is cracked, such as when the bean is crushed or chewed, the intoxication is quite possible.

The following is extracted (citations removed) from: Lutwick LI, Gradon J, Zellen J: Category B Biotoxins. In Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds), Beyond Anthrax: Bioterror - The Weaponization of Infectious Diseases. Springer-Humana, New York, 2009, New York, pp. 181-206:

"Ricin is found in castor beans from the plant _Ricinus communis_ and is a residual product of the production of castor oil. The oil has applications as a purgative, an engine lubricant, and as a component of brake and hydraulic fluid. The industry is no longer active in the United States but the oil is produced in large quantities in other areas of the world. Importantly, the oil, if properly prepared, does not contain the toxin.

"One million tons of castor beans are used each year for producing the oil. The waste mash from the oil production process can have as much as 5 percent ricin by weight and is easily and inexpensively isolated via a simple process in a low technology setting using materials easily obtainable. Ricin is easily prepared in liquid or crystalline forms or as a readily aerosolized, lyophilized powder. The toxin is stable and can be poisonous in its native form in the beans.

"The clinical presentation of ricin poisoning depends on whether the exposure is parenteral, inhaled, or ingested. In mice, the dose found to be lethal to 50 percent (LD50) of animals was found to be 3-5 microg/kg in inhalation or intravenous exposures and 20-25 microg/kg in intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intragastric administration. The time to death in the mice was 60 hours for inhalation, 90 hours for intravenous, and 80-100 hours for the other exposures. It is important to note that there is a variation of as much as 2 logarithms [100-fold] in the microg/kg dose of ricin between animals, with the horse seeming to be the most sensitive and the frog and chicken the least.

"The 1st symptoms of toxicity generally occur 6-12 hours after exposure but can occur as early as 3 hours. This is longer than many of the chemical agents affecting the lung and more rapid than infectious agents. In humans, as seemed to have occurred in the Georgi Markov assassination, multiorgan failure occurred with a prominently elevated white blood cell count. [Markov was a Bulgarian communist defector who was killed in London in 2003 by a ricin pellet injected into his leg from a modified umbrella point -- see http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/01/07/terror.poison.bulgarian/index.html.]

"As a weapon of bioterrorism, ricin would most likely be dispersed as an aerosol although contamination of food and water supplies is also feasible. Although easily obtained, massive quantities of toxin are necessary to create a large scale effect. Because signs and symptoms are non-specific, detection of an attack would require a high index of suspicion based on clinical and epidemiologic factors. The finding of a geographic cluster of patients with acute lung injury should arouse suspicion of an attack via an aerosolized agent, although the list of potential culprits is extensive and includes chemical as well as biologic agents. Ricin cases do not exhibit mediastinitis, as with anthrax, and they do not demonstrate any response to antibiotic therapy as would be expected with an infectious etiology. Pulmonary edema may develop one to 3 days after ricin exposure, in contrast to staphylococcal enterotoxin B or phosgene where time to development of pulmonary edema is 12 and 6 hours respectively.

"There are limited data describing the outcome from an inhalation exposure. In the 1940s, sublethal and accidental exposures were said to have occurred and were manifest 4-8 hours after exposure with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and nausea. Studies in rodents suggest an inhaled ricin aerosol could lead to necrosis of the upper and lower airway, respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Chest x-ray would be expected to show bilateral infiltrates. In animal studies death occurred in 36 to 72 hours and was dose dependent. In primates, symptoms and time to death were also dose related and associated with alveolar flooding, fibropurulent pneumonia, and necrotizing tracheitis. Death occurred 36 to 48 hours after challenge following a 8-24 hour preclinical period."

*****It is important to remember that castor oil does not contain ricin. Also, ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

There is no antidote for ricin poisoning. Symptomatic treatment is suggested.
