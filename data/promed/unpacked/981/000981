Malaria outbreak in remote Arakan
---------------------------------
A strain of malaria has broken out in several villages in a remote area of
Ponna Kyunt Township, 16 miles north of Arakan State Capital Akyab, said a
pharmacy owner from Ponna Kyunt. "As far as I know, at least 2 people have
died recently from malaria. The number of deceased may be higher than I
thought," said the pharmacy owner. Many villages from the Taw Phar Chaung
area in Ponna Kyunt Township are now facing malaria. A villager from the
area said, "the area of the malaria outbreak is on the upper Taw Phar
Chaung River and is located between Rathidaung and Ponna Kyunt Township."
Among the villages, Ao Rama, Sin Thay, Thet Thun Bon Chaung, and Thet Yet
Chaung are suffering the most from the outbreak. "There aren't any
government clinics or any nurses or doctors in the area. When people become
affected by the disease, they will have to be sent to Ponna Kyunt Township
hospital. It is very far away from our area," the villager said. As the
hospital is located far from the area, many malaria patients have died on
their way to receive treatment there. On top of this, the price of
medicines and materials related to treating malaria are also very high, and
local people cannot afford to buy them.
According to local pharmacy sources, a tablet of Quinine or Colloquies
[Chloroquine?] is about 250 kyat [USD 40], while injections of
anti-malarials cost between 700 and 2000 kyat [USD 112-320]. "Our people
are very poor, and they are unable to buy the medicines in the pharmacies.
Due to that reason, many of our people often die in the area," the villager
continued. As far as the outbreak of malaria in the area is concerned, some
village headmen informed the Ponna Kyunt Township Peace and Development
Council, but there has been no response or implementation of disease
control measures by the authorities. A village council member from Poe Ree
Byint Village said, "The authority told us they want to send some doctors
to the malaria affected area, but there are no more doctors or nurses in
Ponna Kyunt Township, nor are there any medicines for treatment of malaria
patients at the hospital."
It has been learned that the malaria outbreak consists of a new strain that
has been seen in the area before, compounding the suffering of those with
the disease who are unable to obtain proper medical treatment or medicines
in the area.

[16 per cent of the population in Myanmar lives in areas with high risk of
malaria and, overall, the World Health Organization estimates that 70 per
cent of the population live in areas with malaria transmission. Between
1991 and 2004, the proportion of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria of all
diagnosed malaria cases declined from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. In 2004,
Myanmar reported 150 540 cases of malaria to WHO, of which 140 000 were _P.
falciparum_. (Source: WHO Regional Office for South East Asia
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section21/Section340_4018.htm>).
It is difficult to understand what "new strain" referred to in the report
means. Strains usually require molecular typing, and we assume that the
text just refers to the fact that an epidemic has broken out, or
alternatively, a shift to _P. falciparum_ in a previously predominant _P.
vivax_ area. This is more likely to be due to an increase in mosquito vectors.
The report mentions that quinine is the 1st drug of choice, and it should
be noted that quinine resistance was reported from the border areas of
Thailand and Myanmar more than 10 years ago. Chloroquine resistance in _P.
falciparum_ is widespread in the region, and if "Colloquies" refers to
chloroquine, _P. falciparum_ in the area is highly resistant, and we hope
that the population has access to diagnostic facilities which can
differentiate between _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria. - Mod.EP]
