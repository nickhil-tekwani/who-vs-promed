The Colombian Institute of Agriculture, ICA, declared a quarantine in the areas of La Uni贸n and El Pic贸n, in the Yopal municipality, Casanare [department], after confirmation of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a disease that could be transmitted between animals and humans [only via mosquito vectors, not directly. - Mod.TY]

In a press release the head of ICA in Casanare stated the "it is the responsibility of the Institute to impede the dissemination of the disease and contribute to its control in benefit of the country's animal health, hence ICA declared a quarantine corresponding to the focal area, equivalent to a radius of 5 km [3.1 mi] starting at the affected pastures."

Given the deaths of 8 equine animals and to avoid new cases, ICA prohibited the entry and exit of animals of the localities of La Uni贸n and El Pic贸n during the period of the quarantine, as well as scheduled equine concentrations on the dates that the quarantine is in force.

"Eastern equine encephalitis is a disease of special importance for human health due to the possibility of transmission between animals and humans. It is a zoonosis of high social and economic impact due to the disorders that the disease causes, characterized by mortality, especially in children and the elderly, incapacity for work, permanent sequelae, adverse reproductive effects, as well as high rates of morbidity and mortality in susceptible equines, " ICA stated, after requesting that the producers notify the authorities about any suspicious neurological cases in humans or animals.

[There is serious question if these cases are due to infection with Madariaga virus (MADV; formerly termed the South American variant of EEE virus) or of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). The report above does not indicate that EEE was laboratory confirmed. The 1st documented human outbreak of MADV occurred in the Darien region of Panama in 2010. Neither its epidemiology nor its transmission cycle is understood. These viruses have been found to co-circulate in the Darien region of the neighboring country of Panama, causing both human and equine cases. Both viruses have rodent reservoir hosts and are transmitted by mosquitoes, not directly from animals to people, among people, nor from people to animals. The quarantine imposed is appropriate for VEE outbreaks because equine animals are amplifying hosts with very high viremias, and can lead to explosive epizootics with spill-over to humans. It is not known if this occurs with MADV. MADV and VEEV are mosquito-borne, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses (family _Togaviridae_, genus _Alphavirus_). If these cases are in fact VEE, it would be important to know which virus subtype is involved, as the risk of outbreaks can differ. There is a commercially available vaccine for VEE. It is not known if the EEE commercial vaccine would protect against MADV infection, since duration of its protection against North American EEE virus infection is relatively short.
