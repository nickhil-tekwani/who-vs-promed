Situation
As of [19 Jul 2010], the Ministry of Health of Angola has reported 15
cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) since the beginning of 2010,
signaling an expansion of an ongoing outbreak. All of these cases
have been detected since February [2010] in the capital Luanda or in
provinces which were previously polio-free (Bie, Bengo, Huambo, Lunda
Norte and Lunda Sul). One genetically-related case was detected in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (in Kasai Occidentale province,
which borders Angola), with onset of paralysis on [25 May 2010].

The country has had a persistent outbreak of poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)
since 2007, where 8 cases were reported that year, and 29 cases each
in 2008 and 2009.

Given the persistent and widespread transmission of wild poliovirus,
ongoing sub-national surveillance gaps and recent further spread of
WPV1 internationally, WHO considers as high the risk of further
international spread into neighbouring countries. As per
recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health
recommendations, travellers to and from Angola should be fully
protected by vaccination.

Actions
Angolan Minister of Health Dr Jose Vieira Dias Van-Dunem re-affirmed
Angola's strong commitment to stop polio transmission by end-2010.

In 2010, Angola has conducted a sub-national supplementary
immunization round using monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1) targeting high
risk provinces from [7-9 May 2010], a national immunization round
from [11-13 Jun 2010] using a combination of trivalent OPV (tOPV) and
mOPV1, and mop-up immunization campaigns with mOPV1 in response to
WPV1 cases (on [23-25 Apr 2010] in Bie, and on [4-6 Jun 2010] and
[18-20 Jun 2010] in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul). Further national
immunization rounds are planned for early August and September
[2010]. The Democratic Republic of the Congo conducted mop-ups on [4
Jun 2010] and [18 Jun 2010] with mOPV1, and further outbreak response
is currently being planned.

Recommendations
In 2009 and 2010, immunization coverage has been sub-optimal, with as
much as 25 percent of children regularly missed during supplementary
immunization activities (SIAs). Urgent action is needed to ensure
that all children in Angola are reached with oral poliovirus vaccine
during the SIAs taking place in August and September [2010] through
strengthened engagement and ownership of SIA operations by
provincial- and district-level political and administrative
leadership.

It is important that countries across central Africa, in particular
those bordering Angola, strengthen disease surveillance for AFP in
order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a
rapid response. Countries should also continue to boost routine
immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of
any introduction.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Angola had been polio free during the period 2001 through 2005, when
there was a reintroduction of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) with
genetic markers indicating India as the origin of the virus. Since
2005, there have been annual cases reported including wild poliovirus
type 3 cases last reported in 2008 (see polio eradication website,
current as of 13 Jul 2010, at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).
According to the official classifications, Angola is categorized as
having all cases importation related since 2003 (see footnote ** at
the bottom of the table on the case count page link provided). Given
the continued re-circulation of WPVs in Angola since their
reintroduction in 2005, one wonders about the semantics used in
categorizing the status of a country.

The above notice is disconcerting as it identifies a high risk of
exportation of WPV in the region from Angola. This alert notice
signals a change since the most recent report from the polio
eradication website as of 13 Jul 2010, where it states:
- No new cases were reported in the past week, meaning the total
number of cases for 2010 remains 12 (all WPV1s). The most recent case
had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2010] (from Lunda Norte).
- NIDs are planned for [6-8 Aug 2010] and early September [2010],
using bOPV [bivalent OPV].
(see text at bottom of table
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp#details>).

The mention of coverages of only 75 percent during the supplemental
immunization activities is also of concern. The challenges will be
overcoming vaccination campaign fatigue on the part of the population
as well as the health sector.
