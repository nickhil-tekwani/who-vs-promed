Avian flu detected in cockfighting village
------------------------------------------
A local man suspected of having bird flu rested in his home in Jagapati
village, Badung, [island of Bali] a place well known for cockfighting,
while officials continued to cull fowls in the area. The 20 year old man
was resting in his bedroom when The Jakarta Post visited. A field doctor
who has been treating and observing the man, said he began showing symptoms
of influenza Monday [9 Feb 2009], just a few days after the report of a
possible bird flu outbreak in the area. "We've given him Tamiflu "the
medicine required to treat bird flu suspects" and we'll continue to observe
him every 5 hours," the doctor Tresna said Tuesday [10 Feb 2009]. She said
her patient seemed to be getting better but declined to rule out the
possibility of bird flu, saying that she was still waiting for results of
blood tests, which were sent to Jakarta on Monday [9 Feb 2009]. "We can't
know for sure until we've received the results of his blood tests, which we
will get in 2 weeks," she said.

It is the latest resurgence of the much-dreaded avian flu in Bali since the
death of a 29 year old woman, who allegedly died after being infected by
the H5N1 virus on August 2007. The virus was first detected on Wednesday
last week [4 Feb 2009], when a villager reported the sudden and nearly
simultaneous death of 15 fowls in the area to the Badung Animal Husbandry
and Fisheries Agency. The dead fowl tested positive of bird flu. The agency
has since culled as many as 133 fowls in the district, with further culling
to continue in the days to come until all the villages' estimated 180-fowl
population has been eliminated. "We have culled 133 fowls so far, including
the 40 we aim to finish off today [11 Feb 2009]. We'll continue the
elimination for as long as it takes," said I Made Badra, head of the Badung
Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Agency, in Jagapati on Tuesday [10 Feb 2009].

According to Badra, the resurgence of the virus was related to the wet
season, which may have weakened a certain fowl's immune system enough to
catch bird flu, quickly spreading to others. Another possibility, he said,
was the transportation of an infected chicken from Java to Jagapati to use
for cockfighting.

The Bali government has banned unlicensed live animal transportation into
Bali and cockfighting, but the latter remains a staple in the island due to
the religious and traditional nature of the so-called sport. On the other
hand, the ban on animal transportation seems to have been fully implemented
since the detection of rabies virus late last year [2008]. However, Badra
said there was a good chance that infected fowls escaped detection because
they might have been transported before the rabies scare. "For now we'll
continue to urge the public to not transport live animals into Bali," he
said. "We should all really learn from what happens to people who come in
contact with sick animals," he said, referring to the alleged death of the
29 year old woman from bird flu and the recent alleged deaths from rabies.

[This suspected human case of avian influenza on the island of Bali is the
first since 2007. The results of laboratory tests are not available yet and
the patient is not seriously ill. The presence of avian influenza in
poultry in the area is the main reason for the diagnosis of suspected avian
influenza.
