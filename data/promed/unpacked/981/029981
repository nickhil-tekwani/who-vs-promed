Outbreaks of suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been
occurring in the Kordufan region of Sudan over the past 2 years, but
scientists could not say for sure whether the CCHF virus circulates in the
country. Molecular tests on blood samples taken from patients during an
outbreak affecting 12 people in 2008 have identified the virus for the 1st
time in the country. The results of the analysis are published in the May
2010 edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases [IE Aradaib, BR Erickson, ME
Mustafa, ML Khristova, NS Saeed, RM Elageb, et al. Nosocomial outbreak of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Sudan. Emerg Infect Dis 2010; 16(5-May)
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/5/837.htm>. - Mod.CP].

CCHF is fatal for around 30 per cent of people who contract it. It can be
spread by the bite of an infected _Hyalmmoma_ tick. The ticks pick up the
virus from infected animals and live in many parts of Africa, Asia, and
southern Europe. The incidence of the disease is rising in some parts of
the world, including south eastern Europe and Turkey, where scientists
recently suggested that changes in the way land is used are behind the
trend. They say the ticks can travel farther when natural habitats are
separated by patches of bush left behind by human activity, and this
enables the virus to circulate in a wider area.

The Sudanese outbreak was probably triggered when a butcher from Al-Fulah,
a town in the central region of the country, picked up the CCHF virus from
infected meat he handled, according to Aradaib and colleagues. He died
after being admitted to the local hospital.

The virus spread to 2 nurses and 2 family members who cared for the man,
the man's sister and a nurse who cared for her, say the authors. It also
spread to 3 other people linked to the hospital. "No protective gloves or
antiseptic products were available at the hospital," they added.

A further 3 probable cases of the disease were spotted in the local
community, and in total, 9 people died in the outbreak. Laboratory tests
confirmed the CCHF virus was behind the illness in 8 cases, but it is not
clear how many patients were included in the analysis.

"Genetic analysis of the viruses showed that the strain involved was
similar to strains found in South Africa, Mauritania, and Nigeria," write
Aradaib and colleagues. Understanding the lineages of the CCHF virus
circulating in Sudan will help scientists to track the movement of the
virus in the region and identify areas at risk of the disease, they add.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; family _Bunyaviridae_, genus
_Nairovirus_) is a tickborne virus. Its tripartite RNA genome consists of
small (S), medium, and large segments. The virus is distributed throughout
much of Africa, Asia, and southern Europe. In some regions, the virus is
responsible for annual outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever with high case
fatality rates; in others, it causes sporadic cases only. The distribution
of CCHF largely mirrors that of its Ixodid tick hosts, particularly those
of the genus _Hyalomma_.

People become infected when bitten by virus-infected ticks or after contact
with blood or tissue from viremic livestock or other people. Outbreaks
often involve people in rural communities, such as shepherds,
slaughterhouse workers, or medical staff of resource-poor hospitals.
Despite presence of _Hyalomma_ tick vectors in Sudan, no CCHF cases had
been confirmed there prior to the investigation reported above. However, in
the past 2 years since 2008, suspected CCHF outbreaks and sporadic cases in
the Kordufan region of Sudan have been reported.

Nosocomial transmission of CCHF virus infection is a recognised hazard for
health care personnel, and procedures must be adapted accordingly.
