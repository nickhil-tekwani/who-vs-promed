There are concerns that garlic and onion diseases will increase rapidly due to frequent rains. Affected areas have requested thorough control of farms. If control is neglected, the diseases will spread rapidly and cause great damage. Onion downy mildew occurs in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment. Garlic leaf rot begins at temperatures of around 10 deg C [50 deg F] and continues in a humid environment until harvest.

[A large number of fungal, bacterial, and nematode pathogens, as well as several viruses and phytoplasmas, are known to affect onion (_Allium cepa_) and related crops like garlic (_A. sativum_). It is not clear from the translation above, if the 2 diseases mentioned are suspected to be part of or the entire problem. Downy mildew of onion is caused by oomycete _Peronospora_ species; various rots in garlic are known due to fungi or bacteria, but none of those diseases have been designated specifically as 'leaf rot'.

Reliable diagnosis of the specific pathogen(s) involved is always required for designing effective management strategies for any local situation.
