[On 3 Nov 2021, the 1st rhinotracheitis outbreak was confirmed in Bestamak village, Alginskiy, Aqtobe region. The event was resolved on 28 Dec 2021. See the final report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=47447.

"Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed worldwide, but has been eradicated from a number of European countries and others have active eradication programs.

"The disease is characterized by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease) and by conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Post-mortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever'" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2021, Chapter 3.4.11, Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV); https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.11_IBR_IPV.pdf).

IBR/IPV does not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
