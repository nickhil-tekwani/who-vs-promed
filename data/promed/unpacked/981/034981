Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 7
---------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 5 Apr 2005, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 181 cases
of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been
reported from 5 provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak.
While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75
percent of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults.
One person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
WHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg
haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the
government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent,
on 21 Mar 2005, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the
situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment
prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of
international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and
several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its
partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).
Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also
now in place. This escalation of support is continuing, with the government
making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies
and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response.
WHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral
haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is
clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains
confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time,
however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several
significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak.
Marburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly
understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a
human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by
WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only 2 large outbreaks of this
disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the
virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which
began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to 2
sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused
sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over 2 years, and never
reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in
Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the
highest fatality, but is also the 1st to occur in an urban setting.
Almost 3 decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened
health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment
and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a
population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper
containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid
detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities,
and rapid tracing of contacts.
Based on experiences with Ebola haemorrhagic fever, control measures can
have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The
eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application,
supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication
and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in
Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the
country's recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to
remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious
and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment.
Intensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that
some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the
community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe
collection and burial of deceased persons.
Cases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies
of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit
Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged 3 shipments of this
equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective
equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Medecins sans Frontieres, and UNICEF. Nonetheless,
supplies still fall short of the need.
The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the
majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This
anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other
areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially
disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some
evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in
hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system,
restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures.
Numerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the
Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct
investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about
the evolution of the outbreak is improving.
The incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days,
necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a
priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that
possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk
of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the
protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in
designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to
these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and
improve compliance with control measures.
In addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to
prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban
or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently
the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500 000 inhabitants, but Luanda,
where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million.
Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of
Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a
support.
Over the past 2 weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health
from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in
Angola and in Mozambique. GOARN partners and several additional
organizations, working with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak,
are as follows: The Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory. Winnipeg,
Canada; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, USA; Centre
