A potentially devastating piglet disease could have reached Australia for
the 1st time, authorities said
----------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture is investigating 2 suspected cases of the
post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in South Australia and
New South Wales.

Australia is one of the few countries to have been spared the disease, but
a Federal Court ruling last month [June 2005] found quarantine authorities
had ignored warnings that pork imports would effectively guarantee the
disease would gain a foothold here.

PMWS kills millions of piglets globally each year. The court issued orders
banning any more import permits under the existing risk analysis scheme and
blocked one company's permit to import.

Pig farmers welcomed the Federal Court ruling and have moved to stop 83
existing importers from continuing to bring pork to Australia.

The disease usually hits pigs aged between 6 to 8 weeks. They lose weight
rapidly, take on a runted and jaundiced appearance, and develop high
fevers. It is not thought to be particularly contagious, but has a high
fatality rate.

A spokesman for the department said the investigation into 2 suspected
cases of the disease should be completed by early next week [2nd week July
2005].

The disease was not a threat to the public, the department said.

"This type of investigation is part of the normal response by government to
a suspicious disease and is not out of the ordinary," Australian Chief
Veterinary Officer Dr. Gardner Murray said in a statement. The body
representing pork producers, Australian Pork Limited, welcomed the
investigation, but said it could not comment any further.

Depopulation unrealistic option for PMWS control
-----------------------------------------------
The Western College of Veterinary Medicine says that because the virus
responsible for Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) is
endemic in swine herds, depopulation is not considered a realistic option
for dealing with the infection.

Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome is a swine disease which
typically occurs between 6 and 15 weeks of age. It was discovered about 10
years ago but is creating controversy, as the Australian swine industry
attempts to use the courts to block pork imports from nations that have
reported outbreaks.

Western College of Veterinary Medicine Associate Professor Dr. John Harding
says the virus responsible for the disease, porcine circovirus type 2, has
been around for over 30 years, but few farms actually ever experience PMWS.

Dr. John Harding says that "there [are] 2 different syndromes in barns that
we see. One is a low-grade infection, and that means that very few pigs
would show clinical signs. It smolders but really doesn't cause any
substantial increase in mortality or level of sickness on those farms and
obviously, in that situation, is very controllable, and that's the way most
pig farms are. The flip side of that, though, is a situation where, in some
farms or in some countries, we have the fairly explosive outbreak of severe
disease, which causes severe and high mortality. When farms become infected
in that way, they certainly have high mortality for a period of time,
probably outwards of 16 to 24 months, before it tends to subside and go
back to pre-outbreak levels."

Dr. Harding says that, because circovirus infects all pigs in the
countryside, but only a select few farms develop clinical disease, farm
depopulation would not be a preferred option. He says the control across
any farm relies upon instilling good management practices.

[Most swine producing counties have reported this disease to some variable
degree over the last decade.

Transmission of this disease is believed to be through direct contact.
However, fomite, contaminated feeds, semen and biting insects are not
clearly understood in the picture of transmission, and more research on
these is needed. However, the virus has been found in urine, feces, blood
and saliva. It has been found in the semen of infected swine, but the role
of semen in transmission of the disease is unclear.

There is no treatment for the disease. Antibiotics are generally not
recommended in viral diseases, but antibiotics may help prevent secondary
bacterial infections. - Mod.TG]
