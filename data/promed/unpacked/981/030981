--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Cross-reactive immune responses elicited by seasonal coronaviruses might impact SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and disease outcomes. We measured neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in pre-pandemic sera from patients with prior PCR-confirmed seasonal coronavirus infection. While neutralizing activity against seasonal coronaviruses was detected in nearly all sera, cross-reactive neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable.

Introduction
------------
Since the initial description in December 2019 of a novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there has been a global effort to identify underlying the underlying causes for the great range of disease severity observed, from mild or even asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death. One hypothesis is that cross reactive immune responses, elicited by prior infection with seasonal coronaviruses, impact the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps providing a degree of protection against severe COVID-19 disease.

The endemic seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) -- HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E -- cause, mild or subclinical respiratory infections, with severe disease being exceptionally rare [1]. Although there is low overall sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and those of the endemic HCoVs, overlapping T-cell epitopes have been reported, particularly in the S2 subunit [2,3]. It is possible that neutralizing antibodies induced by seasonal HCoV infection could cross-react with similar epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 S. Such antibodies could potentially afford some level of protection against and perhaps contribute to the wide range of outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed sera that had been collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from patients with a recent PCR-confirmed diagnosis of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-229E infection. Such samples should contain neutralizing antibodies against the respective seasonal HCoV, without the possibility of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing us to specifically test whether antibodies elicited by seasonal HCoV infection can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate a lack of SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralization activity between the seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2.

Results
-------
We confirmed that neutralizing antibodies targeting the seasonal coronaviruses were present in the pre-pandemic samples. Indeed, all sera from individuals diagnosed with recent infection by a seasonal coronavirus neutralized that same virus.

In contrast, none of the very same 37 serum samples tested had any detectable neutralization activity against rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP. Importantly, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP is at least as, or more, sensitive to neutralization by COVID-19 plasma analysis as SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Indeed, sera collected from 10 individuals with recently diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection could neutralize rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP with NT50 values ranging from 96 to 5400. Overall these data strongly suggest that only pandemic sera, and not pre-pandemic sera have neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, and further suggest that pre-existing serological immunity to seasonal coronaviruses is not a major driver of the diverse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion
----------
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shares 24%-29% amino acid identity with the seasonal coronaviruses. In agreement with the notion that there is little cross reactivity between seasonal HCoV neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2, many of the monoclonal antibodies cloned from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals contain very low levels of somatic hypermutation [9], suggesting that they arise from de novo rather than recall B-cell responses. However, instances of cross-reactive antibodies with high levels of somatic hypermutation have been reported, indicating that in some cases memory B cells evoked by prior seasonal HCoV infection may be recalled during infection with a SARS-like coronavirus [10].

Others have reported SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in sera from individuals that were not infected SARS-CoV-2, but the levels were low.

Our data argue against a broad role for pre-existing protective humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

It is notable that these investigators assayed sera for neutralizing antibodies since this provides the strongest information on the ability of the sera to protect against infection. Demonstration of serum reactivity against spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 by ELISA or other techniques while important is less significant biologically. But even the latter spike reactivity analyses have generally found lower levels of reactivity to the seasonal coronaviruses than to MERS or SARS. These results correlate with the sequence homology of these proteins, that is, SARS-CoV-2 spike is more similar to SARS-CoV and MERS than the seasonal coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1. Elucidating specificity of the antibody response is important in interpreting serological results, that is, who has been exposed to and recovered from which _Betacoronavirus_, of course after considering geographic distribution of the viruses. Lack of cross reactivity makes interpretation easier between SARS-CoV-2 and the seasonal coronaviruses. But it also has implications for vaccines and antivirals. - Mod.LK]

[2] Airline flight
Date: Mon 26 Oct 2020

A 7-hour international flight to Ireland this summer [2020] has been linked to 59 coronavirus cases in the country, Irish researchers said in a report [1].

Of the 49 passengers onboard, 13 tested positive for the novel coronavirus, even though the flight was only 17 percent full, according to the report released last week [week of 19 Oct 2020] by the Irish Department of Public Health. Those 13 passengers went on to infect 46 more people throughout Ireland, the report says, which "demonstrates the potential for spread of SARS-COV-2 linked to air travel."

The report did not disclose the airline or where the flight originated but said the cases and their subsequent spread show that "restriction of movement on arrival and robust contact tracing" can limit travel-linked transmissions of the coronavirus.

Masks were utilized by 9 of those 13 infected passengers, with one child not wearing a mask and 3 passengers' mask use "unknown," the report noted.

Out of the 13 who tested positive on the flight, 12 were symptomatic. The 13 ranged in age from 1 to 65. 4 were hospitalized, with one ending up in intensive care.

The report showed the cases on an in-flight map of the aircraft, which had a 3-by-3 configuration.

"Of the flight cases, 4 were not seated next to any other positive case, had no contact in the transit lounge, wore face masks in-flight, and would not be deemed close contacts under current guidance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)," the report states. Researchers defined "close contacts" on the flight as passengers within 2 seats of one another in every direction.

Symptoms began to appear in the earliest cases 2 days after the flight, and the latest case linked to the plane experienced symptoms 17 days after the flight. Researchers noted that the "source case is not known," although one passenger reported that a family member that had tested positive 3 weeks before the flight.

"Air travel has accelerated the global pandemic, contributing to the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) throughout the world," the study said. Researchers say the flight-linked cases show "the nature of transmission on board, despite implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions" such as masks.

In September [2020], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that nearly 11 000 people have been potentially exposed to the coronavirus on flights. A study released this month [October 2020] by the Defense Department that simulated in-flight transmission of the virus suggested that air passengers would need to be near an infectious person on a plane for 54 hours to receive a significant dose of the virus. The study has not yet been peer reviewed.

The report was published the same week that Ireland reimposed a stay-at-home order for 6 weeks in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Daily new cases peaked on [18 Oct 2020] with more than 1200 new infections.

Ireland did not require coronavirus tests for entry this summer [2020], according to the Irish Times, but the country has required 14-day quarantines for arrivals from certain nations. In September, Ireland angered airlines by tightening those rules for some European countries, according to Reuters.

"Abstract
---------
An outbreak of 59 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated with 13 cases linked by a 7 h, 17% occupancy flight into Ireland, summer 2020. The flight-associated attack rate was 9.8-17.8%. Spread to 46 non-flight cases occurred country-wide. Asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission in-flight from a point source is implicated by 99% homology across the virus genome in five cases travelling from 3 different continents. Restriction of movement on arrival and robust contact tracing can limit propagation post-flight."

"Air travel has accelerated the global pandemic, contributing to the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) throughout the world. We describe an outbreak that demonstrates in-flight transmission, providing further evidence to add to the small number of published studies in this area. This study depicts the nature of transmission on board, despite implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We demonstrate widespread in-country transmission as a result of imported infection and give recommendations to reduce the risk of importation and to curtail onwards spread.

"Outbreak description [abridged]
--------------------------------
"59 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 6 of the 8 different health regions (Regions A-H) throughout the Republic of Ireland were linked to an international flight into Ireland in summer 2020 (Figure 1). An outbreak case was defined as positive PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (naso-pharyngeal swab) in either a passenger or a contact of a passenger. 13 cases were passengers on the same flight to Ireland, each having transferred via a large international airport, flying into Europe from 3 different continents (groups 1 and 2; group 3 and group 4).

"Of the flight groups, group 1 reported spending up to 12 h overnight in the transit lounge during stopover; group 2 shared a separate transit lounge; group 3 and group 4 had separate short waits of under 2 h in the general airport departure area.

"The flight into Ireland was 7.5 h long and had a passenger occupancy of 17% (49/283 seats) with 12 crew (Figure 2). (seating plan)

"Whole genome sequencing and analysis was performed on 5 available samples, which came from one case travelling from one continent, 3 cases travelling from a different continent and one case travelling from a 3rd continent. All 5 samples were identified as belonging to SARS-CoV-2 viral lineage B.1.36 (PANGOLIN nomenclature, v2.0.7). Pairwise comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed more than 99% homology across the entire viral genome, strongly suggesting a single point source of infection.

"This outbreak demonstrates the potential for spread of SARS-CoV-2 linked to air travel.

"Conclusion
-----------
"This study is one of few thus far demonstrating in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with extensive onwards transmission. In-flight propagation patterns merit further study. Health advisories and personal responsibility, augmented by state and airline checks, should preclude travel in those with symptoms. Stringent on-board infection prevention and control measures are vital to reduce the risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic in-flight transmission. Restriction of movement on arrival and robust contact tracing are essential to limit propagation post-flight."

This study questions the safety of flying vis-a-vis SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Sobering data...Perhaps additional questions would include if food was served and how long were masks off? And use of the commodes... - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 217.

Data by country, area, or territory for 26 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct26_1603755751.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 34.9% of daily case numbers and 47.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.6 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Canada, and Ecuador. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Chile and Costa Rica.

- The European region reported 45.5% of daily case numbers and 28.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 9.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (26 Oct 2020) include Spain, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Switzerland. France is dominant (52 010), followed by Italy, the UK, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Austria, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, and Turkey. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Slovenia, Belarus, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 10.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.9 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Morocco, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Lebanon, UAE, and Oman. Pakistan and Kuwait, each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Tunisia, Sudan, and Yemen did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.97% of daily case numbers and 0.89% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.29 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Angola, Cameroon, and Uganda.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.87% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.71 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 12.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 12.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.9 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Even though this is a decreased reporting period ("weekend artifact") and 4 countries with known transmission ongoing that did not report in the European region, there are still 21 countries in the European region that were reporting more than 1000 new cases in 24 hours and 7 countries reporting more than 10 000 cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for over 80% of daily reported cases and over 75% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 26 Oct 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[A reminder about weekend reporting artifact. Some ocuntries that have not reported cases over the weekend, or have reported significantly fewer cases than expected will have the 1st and/or 2nd report after the weekend reflecting the backlog of unreported cases over the weekend.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (73 604), Spain (46 126), and India (36 838) have been dominant. A global total of 5509 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (25-26 Oct 2020), probably still reflecting a decrease related to weekend reporting artifact. While most countries are reporting cases in the past 24 hours, totals are reduced from end of the week last week.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (18 countries) include the USA, Spain, India, France (26 771), UK (20 890), Switzerland (17 440), Brazil (17 422), Russia (17 347), Italy (17 007), Belgium (15 622), Germany (12 621), Argentina (11 712), Netherlands (10 343), Czech Republic (10 273), Poland (10 241), Colombia (9167), Iran (5960), and Ukraine (5426). A total of 15 countries reported more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours, 11 of which were in the European region. A total of 47 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 45 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 8 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 5 were from the South East Asia region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 20.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.6%. In the USA, the 7-day average differences in case counts have increased by 20.8% and daily reported deaths have increased by 11.7%. Iran has had an increase of 32.5% in average daily case counts and 15.0% in daily reported deaths.

Coleman Schaefer has maintained growth curves of selected countries from different regions of interest. The 1st shows cumulative daily case counts. The 2nd shows daily population based (per 100 000 population).
Cumulative case counts: https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/usa-pdf/Comparative%20growth%20curves%20for%20selected%20countries_1603770751.pdf
Population based case counts: https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/Comparative%20growth%20curves%20per%20100%20000%20population%20for%20seletce%20countries_1603770751.pdf

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Europe is once again the 2nd region in terms of cumulative case counts, surpassing the South East Asia region once again. - Mod.MPP]
