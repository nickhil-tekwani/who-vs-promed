The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated Sun 12 Aug 2018: DRC Ministry of Health.
- A total of 57 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 30 confirmed and 27 probable.
- 58 suspected cases are under investigation .
- 5 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Mandima (Ituri) and 4 in Mabalako (all health care providers from the Mangina Reference Health Center)
- 2 deaths of confirmed cases, including 1 in Mabalako and the confirmed case in Mandima (Ituri)

News of the response
- The 1st patient discharged from the Ebola Treatment Center (CTE) of Beni, cured, is a 13-year-old girl. Psychosocial experts from the Ministry of Health visited family members to prepare them psychologically and facilitate her psychosocial reintegration.
- The CTE management teams in Beni and Mangina have started using the therapeutic molecule mAb114 as part of the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease. The mAb114, which stems from the research done by Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe on the serum of a survivor of the Ebola epidemic in Kikwit in 1995, has become the first therapeutic molecule against the virus to be used in the part of an active Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
- During the previous epidemic in the province of Equateur last May [2018], a joint scientific committee and an ethics committee had approved the use of 5 experimental therapeutic molecules, namely mAb114, ZMapp, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Regn3450 - 3471 - 3479. However, because of the rapid mastery of the previous epidemic, none of the molecules could be administered and they remained in the laboratories of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa.
- When the 10th epidemic broke out in North Kivu province in July [2018], the INRB asked the companies producing each of these molecules to give their authorization for their use again and an amended protocol of administration before submitting the request for approval to the Ethics Committee. To date, all molecules have already arrived at Beni, with the exception of ZMapp, which requires storage at -20 C [-4 F]. The ethics committee has already approved the amended protocol of administration provided by the producers of mAB114. The other 4 complete files have just been submitted to the Ethics Committee and the National Regulatory Authority for approval.
- The death registered in the Mandima health zone, Ituri province, is a man who was admitted to the Mangina Reference Health Center [CSR] in North Kivu province for heart problems. After being treated, he returned to his village in the Mandima health zone, about 400 meters [0.25 mi] from CSR Mangina, where he died. The samples taken were positive.

The infection and subsequent death of a patient being treated for his heart condition in Ituri province is concerning. He had been treated in the Mangina Reference Health Center [North Kivu] and released to his home. He may have become infected in the Center while he was there for treatment for his heart problem. It is for this reason that rapid point of care tests are badly needed to prevent patients presenting with other problems from being mixed in with Ebola patients and put at risk of infection. See more on this problem below in Mod.LXL's comment.

It is also of considerable concern that of the 5 newly confirmed cases, 4 are from Mabalako, and all are health care providers from the Mangina Reference Health Center. This is the same health center where the patient above was being treated. It is always very unfortunate when health care workers succumb to the disease they are treating, in this case possibly having become infected prior to recognition of the outbreak. Or these recent cases in health care workers may be due to inadequate protective measures being applied in this health center. An alternative possibility is that Mabalako has a very high level of Ebola virus activity. All of these possible explanations are disturbing. - Mod.LK

Mod.LXL asks "whatever happened to the promising Point-of-Care rapid finger-stick ELISA diagnostic test? A POC [point of care] test would be so useful in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit] triage entrance to separate low-risk from high-risk individuals in the Suspect Ward until confirmatory EBOv PCR tests come back. When [LXL] worked in the government hospital in Sierra Leone, several patients were discharged from the ETU suspect ward because they had something else (malaria, TB, etc.), only to die later at home from Ebola that they certainly acquired from infective patients while they were together in the suspect ward. - Mod.LXL [edited]

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information on the status or role of any POC tests in the recent DRC outbreaks. - Mod.LK]

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/worries-about-security-and-healthcare-exposures-drc-ebola-total-grows-52
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Following a visit by top World Health Organization (WHO) officials to the latest outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the WHO yesterday [12 Aug 2018] called for free and secure access for responders working in the affected conflict-affected area.

Over the past few days the DRC's health ministry confirmed 8 more cases, one of them a health worker from Mangina, the outbreak epicenter. According to an update yesterday [12 Aug 2018], the outbreak total has risen to 52 cases, reflecting 25 confirmed and 27 probable cases. In addition, health officials are investigating 48 suspected infections. 2 more deaths have been reported, lifting the fatality count to 39.

WHO mission highlights complex security issues
----------------------------------------------
In a statement yesterday [12 Aug 2018], the WHO said over a 2-day visit in the outbreak zone that was accompanied by the DRC health ministry, the group's leadership saw 1st-hand the complexities responders face in implementing Ebola activities in North Kivu province. They visited the city of Beni and the Mangina health area, the location of most confirmed cases reported so far.

A range of armed groups are active in the area, creating challenging security issues for health teams who need to go deep into communities to identify and monitor possible cases, the WHO said. Conflict settings can also discourage community members from coming forward for treatment.

The health ministry outbreak said in its response plan, posted by the WHO on 10 Aug 2018, that the far northern part of North Kivu province is relatively peaceful, but the situation near the outbreak area is unpredictable. The area dominated by armed conflict with a risk of deliberate attacks and acts of hostility against facilities, personnel, and property during times of tension. North Kivu--home to 8 million people -- is one of the DRC's most densely populated provinces.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said, "All of those participating in the response must be able to more freely and safety in conflict areas to do the work that is needed to bring the outbreak under control. The population must also have access to treatment centers that save lives and stop the spread of the disease."

Health worker exposures raise worries of worsening outbreak phase
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Of the 8 latest confirmed cases reported since 9 Aug 2018 by the health ministry, 5 are from Mabalako, 2 are from Mangina, and 1 is from Beni.

One of the cases from Mangina reported yesterday [12 Aug 2018] is a health worker from the Mangina Reference Health Center, the health ministry said in its statement yesterday. About 74 of the health center's staff members who have been identified as contacts of Ebola cases have been temporarily discharged and will be monitored for 21 days, the health ministry said in its 11 Aug 2018 statement.

As another response step, the ministry said it has finalized a plan through a World Bank-funded project to offer free healthcare in 3 health zones around the outbreak epicenter -- Mabalako, Blessed, and Oicha -- to remove financial barriers to care and encourage resident to seek care as soon as the first Ebola symptoms appear.

In Twitter posts today [13 Aug 2018], Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, said sadly, many health workers in Mangina were exposed to Ebola early in the outbreak. And since health worker infections are known to amplify Ebola outbreaks, health officials expect the current DRC outbreak to get worse before it gets better. "Given complexities, we ask all partners to support government-led response with their most experienced staff," he said.

Salama said the event is on an "epidemiological precipice" and that there's a crucial time-limited window of opportunity to prevent the Ebola outbreak from taking hold in areas that are much more difficult to access due to security concerns. "There is not a minute to lose," he said.

Authorities to deploy experimental antibody treatment
-----------------------------------------------------
Health officials are preparing to use an experimental antibody treatment called mAB114 in the latest outbreak Steve Ahuka, MD, PhD, a virologist from the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) told Reuters on 11 Aug 2018.

The monoclonal antibody treatment was developed in the United States and is based on antibodies of a patient who survived Ebola during an outbreak in the DRC city of Kikwit in 1995, according to the Reuters report. Ahuka said the DRC's ethical committee has approved the use of mAB114 and that it could be used within days. He also said other experimental treatments could also be used.

mAb114 was 1 of 5 experimental treatments that the DRC health ministry ethics committee approved for compassionate use during the earlier outbreak, pending finalized study protocol details. In May [2018], a WHO expert group evaluated 5 therapies -- including mAb114 -- that could be used in the earlier DRC outbreak. It said though early data on mAB114 look promising, more were needed before recommending it for compassionate use.

Remaining vaccine questions, immune response after natural infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Key scientific questions remain in efforts to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine, according to scientists from the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccination (PREVAC) who wrote a perspective piece that appeared in the 10 Aug 2018 issue of The Lancet [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31710-0/fulltext]. The team is currently conducting a phase 2 trials in West Africa to evaluate 3 Ebola vaccination strategies in people age 1 year and older.

In reviewing the status of the wider research landscape, they said 36 trials of Ebola vaccine candidates have been completed and another 14 are active. Focusing on 4 vaccine candidates (Ad26-ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo, chAD3-EBOV, and GamEvac-Combi), they said more data are needed in pregnant women, children, and people with immune compromise, including those with HIV and the elderly. Also, they note that more research is needed on the durability and speed of immune responses prompted by the different vaccine approaches. The team also called for studies to identify correlates of protection and large-scale trials to fully gauge safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccines.

In other medical literature developments, tests on the blood of 15 Ebola survivors found that antibodies from some of them neutralized Ebola viruses from 4 different strains, as well as Marburg virus. Writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases today [13 Aug 2018] , a team from the United States and the DRC described the experiments they did on the blood of survivors of a 2014 [outbreak]. 3 survivors had a strong response against 4 filovirus glycoproteins, including that of Marburg virus.

Though they said the mechanism of action of the response requires further study, the data suggest that a pan-filovirus vaccine might be achievable and that it might be possible to isolate human monoclonal antibodies that neutralized all filoviruses [see report under 'research' below].

- Sun 12 Aug 2018. DRC's latest outbreak more challenging than ever, WHO says.
[news24, Associated Press (AP) report, edited]
https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/drcs-latest-outbreak-more-challenging-than-ever-who-says-20180812

The World Health Organisation's director-general says instability, high population density and large displacement in Democratic Republic of Congo's east mean the response to the nation's 10th Ebola virus outbreak must be stronger than ever before.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke in Beni city, where an Ebola response centre has been established. He joined DRC's health minister, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, in overseeing vaccinations that began this week.

On [Sat 18 Aug 2018] they will visit Mangina village, where the outbreak was declared [1 Aug 2018].

The Ministry of Health says 44 cases have been reported, with 17 of them confirmed as Ebola, including 10 deaths.

WHO says more than 3000 doses of the Ebola vaccine are available in DRC.

The country's east is home to dozens of rebel groups fighting for control over the mineral-rich region.

[This latest DRC outbreak, which presents such a great challenge for the various reasons mentioned in this report, that is, instability, high population density and large displacement of people, benefits from lessons learned and products developed during the prior 2 recent outbreaks. But with the instability in the region, the displacement of individuals will continue, making control extremely difficult. The virus may move with individuals who have been infected but are not yet symptomatic. Identifying these individuals in an area with grave security threats is going to take a very concerted effort from multiple organizations working together. Controlling borders is essential, yet this is always difficult since borders are notoriously leaky, and even where individuals are checked, people incubating the virus may not be detected. - Mod.LK]

[Digital Congo, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/5b71968923b29e00045914c6/
[Byline: Véron K/Le Potentiel]

It is since Wed 8 Aug 2018 that the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has launched the vaccination campaign against Ebola virus disease in the health area of Mangina, Beni, North Kivu province. To this end, UNICEF has mobilized communication specialists to inform and encourage participation in the vaccination campaign of local communities affected by the disease. "Our communication specialists are on the ground and informing the communities involved in the vaccination campaign," said Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano, UNICEF Representative in the DRC.

As part of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Joint Action Plan coordinated with WHO and UNICEF, vaccination is offered, free of charge and on a voluntary basis, to all members of local communities with been in contact with an infected person.

UNICEF has deployed 12 communication specialists in the affected areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces to work with community workers. They provide advance advice to people eligible for immunization as well as basic information about the vaccine to affected communities.

These efforts are part of the global social mobilization and community communication that UNICEF is conducting with its partners to raise awareness of the Ebola virus and how to protect against the disease to prevent its spread. With its partners, UNICEF has already informed 60 community leaders of the Mangina health area in the health zone of Mabalako about prevention messages and actions.

The organization trained 100 community workers from the Beru health zone to conduct outreach activities in local communities. He worked with 79 local journalists and 9 radio stations in Beni and Goma to broadcast awareness programs; distributed Ebola prevention messages in 241 churches in the Beni health zone.

In addition, UNICEF is supporting the deployment of additional community workers in the affected region to strengthen communication and information efforts to promote good hygiene and sanitation practices and support the immunization campaign.

[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=4560

Due to lack of means of survival, these citizens say that they continue to hunt game and consume it despite the declaration of the Ebola virus disease in Beni territory. We decode their life situation on Thu 9 Aug 2018, World Day of Indigenous Peoples including pygmies in the DRC.

They met in their Luvangira camp in the Oïcha 1st district, and these pygmies told themselves they were aware of the epidemic that is causing fear. They confirm that they continue hunting because they are convinced that the animals they hunt do not carry Ebola. These pygmies mention they are observing the hygienic rules. They urge health professionals to eradicate Ebola.

https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy453/5071788

ref: Bramble MS, Hoff N, Gilchuk P, et al. Pan-filovirus serum neutralizing antibodies in a subset of Congolese ebolavirus infection survivors. J Infect Dis 2018; jiy453
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
One year after a _Zaire ebolavirus_ (EBOV) outbreak occurred in the Boende health zone of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during 2014, we sought to determine the breadth of immune response against diverse filoviruses including EBOV, _Bundibugyo_ (BDBV), _Sudan_ (SUDV), and _Marburg_ (MARV) viruses. After assessing the 15 survivors, 5 individuals demonstrated some degree of reactivity to multiple ebolavirus species and, in some instances, _Marburgvirus_. All 5 of these survivors had immunoreactivity to EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and EBOV VP40, and 4 had reactivity to EBOV nucleoprotein (NP). 3 of these survivors showed serologic responses to the 3 species of ebolavirus GPs tested (EBOV, BDBV, SUDV). All 5 samples also exhibited ability to neutralize EBOV using live virus, in a plaque reduction neutralization test. Remarkably, 3 of these EBOV survivors had plasma antibody responses to MARV GP. In pseudovirus neutralization assays, serum antibodies from a subset of these survivors also neutralized EBOV, BDBV, SUDV, and _Taï Forest_ virus as well as MARV. Collectively, these findings suggest that some survivors of naturally acquired ebolavirus infection mount not only a pan-ebolavirus response, but also in less frequent cases, a pan-filovirus neutralizing response.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[These exciting results demonstrate that a single infection with EBOV can elicit a pan-filovirus antibody response capable of neutralizing against pathogenic variants of both ebolavirus and MARV [Marburg virus]. The data suggest that a pan-filovirus vaccine may be achievable, and that it may be possible to isolate human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize all filoviruses for use in prophylaxes or therapy. - Mod.LK]
