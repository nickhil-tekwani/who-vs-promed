Comment: Advice on tick removal in Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever - Turkey (02) 20060722.2013
-----------------------------------------------
[Dr. Nick Honhold is very concerned about the
advice given in this ProMED post. He pointed out
that The European Center for Disease Control
(ECDC) advice is to "Grasp the tick as close to
the skin as possible, and rotate the tick 1-2
times, pulling back gently but firmly. Avoid
leaving mouth parts in the skin"
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/060720.asp#e>. Dr. Honhold added]:
"As a colleague of mine here in Turkey put it, it
is a tick not a screw. If you rotate it, there is
a much higher chance of leaving the mouthparts in
the skin, which the [ECDC] message goes on to say
is undesirable (which it is, but not because of
an increased risk of CCHF if they are left
behind). The very act of rotating the tick is
likely to make it attempt to dig in deeper and
very probably inject more saliva and gut
contents, which will likely increase the chance
of virus transmission. The act of trying to
rotate the tick will also make it take longer to
remove, again giving it more opportunity to transmit disease.
The CDC has excellent and clear advice on tick
removal in several locations on its website. Three such links are:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/ticktips2005/>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rmsf/Prevention.htm>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_tickremoval.htm>.
Indeed, the 1st of these sites states 'Do not
twist or jerk the tick; this may cause the
mouthparts to break off and remain in the skin.'
Having removed many ticks, I find it hard to
imagine how this act of rotation even once, let
alone twice, could be realistically accomplished,
and I wonder how much it is based on experience
and how much on the old folklores of tick
removal. It would certainly be useful to mention
that tick removal should be a quick and simple
affair and that the use of [petroleum jelly],
alcohol, matches etc. should be avoided."

[ProMED thanks Dr. Honhold for his comments on tick removal. - Mod.TY]
[Various methods have been proposed for removing
ticks, including dabbing them chloroform or some
other anaesthetic to make them withdraw their
mouthparts, or applying grease or nail
varnish to the bodies to prevent them breathing
with the hope that this will make them pull
out their mouthparts. But there is little
evidence that any of these methods induce ticks
to withdraw. Although some advise rotating or
twisting the tick when withdrawing it with a pair
of forceps I agree with Dr Nick Honhold that this
should not be done. The tick�s hypostome, which
is inserted into a person during feeding, has
numerous backwardly projecting denticles (teeth)
and there is no logic in rotating the tick, in
fact this is likely to make it more difficult to
remove, and may cause the hypostome to break off
leaving it imbedded in the skin. � Mod. MS]
