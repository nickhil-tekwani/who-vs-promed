The deaths of 28 hippos at a game park in Ethiopia is suspected to have been caused by an anthrax outbreak or toxic algae, the director of the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority has told BBC Afaan Oromoo. Kumera Wakjira added that he had never seen wildlife die on such a huge scale in Ethiopia.

At least 28 hippopotamuses were found dead in a national park in southwestern Ethiopia, local media reported on [Mon 22 Apr 2019].

According to the local broadcaster FANA, the giant semi-aquatic creatures died in the Gibe Sheleko National Park, part of the Gibe River which is the largest tributary of the Omo River in southwestern Ethiopia.

The cause for the deaths is still unknown, FANA said, citing Bahrua Mega, the head of the park. She said the deaths have been reported since fortnight, while 15 of the hippos died in a single day. According to her, most of the large mammals that died at the national park --which is home to nearly 200 hippos--, were aged.

The experts are investigating the cause of the sudden hippo deaths, she added.

"There have been illegal activities threatening the existence of the park," Mega said, adding that people have been cutting trees and using patches of land for settlements within the park. The 36 000 sq km (around 13 900 sq mi) park is located at 250 km southwest of the capital Addis Ababa.

[Gibe Sheleko National Park was established only in 2009 and is administered by the southern region. The park is about 174 km southwest of Addis Ababa, on the edge of the Ethiopian highland massif and covers 248 sq km in 3 districts of the Guraghe Zone. This park is unique due to its high bird species diversity and woodland eco-system.

Anthrax is hyper-enzootic in Ethiopia. In 2017 alone there were 196 bovine outbreaks, and the government has given up reporting the numbers of equine and sheep & goat outbreaks each year. Wildlife outbreaks occur but are under-reported. During 1999 through 2002 there was a total mortality of 1600 animals of 21 different species in the Omo Magoo National Park in the SW of the country. So there is a good probability that Ethiopia has joined the international hippo anthrax association. - Mod.MHJ
