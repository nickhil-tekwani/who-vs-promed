Malaria Cases Increase In Aweil Civil Hospital, Northern Bahr el Ghazal State, South Sudan

The Acting Medical Director for Aweil Hospital, Wol Wol Aken, said that malaria cases in 2015 have risen as compared to 2014.

In an interview with Gurtong, Dr. Wol said the situation regarding malaria in 2015 is [worse] than in 2014, which [includes] acute malaria cases proved by tests carried out by doctors in the hospital.

Wol also underscores the shortage of malarial drugs in most private clinics and hospitals.

"The medicines for malaria for adults are not available [in 2015] even now. The available drugs for malaria are provided by MSF for children from 6 months up to 11 years" he said.

Though Wol could not give statistics of malaria cases in the hospital, he strongly reiterates that malaria must be fought at all costs to avoid deaths.

"The exact statistics of malaria cases [in the last 3] months is not currently available because we are still receiving more cases even after the malaria season, which makes it difficult for us to give the number." he explained.

Wol further urged residents of Aweil to follow preventive measures as the only means to avoid the disease.

"People of Aweil should commit themselves and protect [their] children, [including preparation of] their bednets before [bedtime] to prevent mosquito bites" he said.
