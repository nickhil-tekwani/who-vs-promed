A bird flu scare has hit the Kaziranga National Park in Assam with
carcasses of at least a dozen migratory bar-headed geese found in the
sanctuary, officials said Friday [8 Jan 2010].

A park warden said at least 7 geese were found dead Friday [8 Jan
2010]. 5 carcasses of the same species that had recently arrived at
the sanctuary from Siberia were recovered Thursday [7 Jan 2010].

'"A team of experts, including veterinarians, are carrying out
post-mortem of the birds and samples will be sent to Bhopal to find
out if the deaths were due to avian influenza or some other disease,"
a park ranger told IANS [Indo Asian News Service].

"We are worried as other birds and animals might be hit if avian
influenza spreads in the park. We have issued an alert asking forest
guards to look out for dead birds or animals," an official said.

All the deaths were reported from the Agoratoli range in the sanctuary.

The 430-sq km [166 sq mi] park, home to the world's largest
concentration of the one-horned rhinos, is also a birding paradise
with more than 300 species of birds, including around 100 species of
migratory birds.
