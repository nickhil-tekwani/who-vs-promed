ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Note: as SARS activity has been decreasing, many of the official
websites are not posting updates on the weekends (Saturday and
Sunday). ProMED-mail will continue to monitor official websites and
post material as it becomes available. ProMED-mail will also monitor
newswire reports, but will continue to exercise prudence in posting
from newswires, as many "suspected" cases reported through newswires
are later found to have other etiologies. - Mod. MPP]

Situation report on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 8 Jun 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
There is no new confirmed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) today (8 Jun 2003). This is the third time that Hong Kong
recorded zero infections (the last 2 times were on 24 May 2003 and 5
Jun 2003). It is also the 24th consecutive day on which the number of
cases has fallen below 5 since 16 May 2003.
4 more patients had recovered from the disease and been discharged
from hospital, bringing the total of recovered patients to 1364.The
number of SARS patients in intensive care units is 20. They are among
the 66 cases under treatment in hospitals. 35 are recovering patients
in convalescence and in preparation for discharge.
One patient died, bringing the total number of deaths attributable to
SARS to 287. The deceased was a 57-year-old male with underlying
disease.
Meanwhile, temperature checks for all passengers at the airport,
ports, and border points continue to be implemented to watch for
travellers displaying symptoms of SARS. In addition, all incoming
travellers are required to complete a health declaration. 6
passengers were screened out at these points yesterday. After
undergoing further medical checks, 3 were cleared of SARS symptoms
and continued their journey, and 3 others were referred to hospitals
for observation.
All household contacts of confirmed or suspected SARS patients are
required to undergo home confinement for monitoring and treatment up
to a maximum of 10 days. So far, a total of 1262 persons (from 493
households) had been covered, of whom 34 had been found to have SARS.
Thanks to the co-operation of the confinees and members of the
community, no new warning letter has been issued since 16 May 2003
and the scheme is running smoothly.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with SARS since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
