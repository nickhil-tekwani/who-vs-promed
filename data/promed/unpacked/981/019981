Last February [2013], a 23 year old man arrived in the Antonio J Scaravelli hospital [in Tunuyan, Valle de Uco, Mendoza province] trauma unit with a very dirty, open arm fracture which required multiple surgical cleanings. The patient suffered progressive deterioration, further complicated by his asthma, which left him in a coma for a few days, requiring mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy, and subsequently spent 67 days in the intensive care unit.

The cause of his neurological deterioration was difficult to discern but eventually he was diagnosed with wound-related botulism, confirmed by the laboratory of the Cuyo National University [San Rafael, Mendoza province].

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most, but not all, cases of wound botulism have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). - Mod.LL
