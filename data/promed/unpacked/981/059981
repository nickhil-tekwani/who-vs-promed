A man is dead, and 4 others have been treated in hospital after a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Footscray, in Melbourne's west.

A man aged in his 50s who had other significant medical conditions died early today [24 Jan 2013] at Western Hospital. Three other people have been discharged after recovering from the flu-like illness, while another remains in hospital.

Health Department officials are testing and disinfecting about 2 dozen air-conditioning cooling towers in Footscray.

Legionnaires' disease is acquired through breathing in very fine droplets of water that contain the bacteria, such as spray drifts which are vented off from cooling towers. The acting chief health officer, Dr Michael Ackland, says all the patients spent time in an area within a 2-km radius of central Footscray. Dr Ackland says thorough decontamination and cleaning of infected towers should eliminate the disease, and there is no longer any risk to the public. "There should be no risk to people travelling in the Footscray area now, as all the cooling towers are now being disinfected, cleaned and rendered safe," he said.

But he says anyone in the area who has been unwell and has flu-like symptoms should go to their doctor. "Legionnaires' disease can take 10 days to manifest itself after an exposure," he said. "So if indeed any of the cooling towers that we are examining are ultimately found to be the cause of this problem, then, yes, people may well come forward as new cases." Dr Ackland says the cases were individually reported between 8 Dec 2012 and yesterday [23 Jan 2013], when the common link to the Footscray area was confirmed.

A 56-year-old St Albans man, a 93-year-old Yarraville woman, and a 69-year-old Footscray man have been treated in hospital and discharged. A 75-year-old West Footscray woman is still in hospital.

[The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Australia: (VI) cooling tower susp 20121204.1436695:

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and gardening.

The news report above does not say how the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was made or what species of _Legionella_ was implicated in the 5 cases, but presumably it is _L. pneumophila_, a water-borne pathogen, since a cooling tower is being tested as a possible source.

A diagnosis of even a single case of legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases. The effect of wind speed and direction on _Legionella_-contaminated plumes from cooling towers may influence the distribution of cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Footscray, with a population of 13 203 (2011), is a suburb 5 km (3.1 miles) west of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footscray,_Victoria). Yarraville is another suburb, 8 km (5 miles) west of Melbourne (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarraville,_Victoria). Victoria is the 2nd most populous and most densely populated state in Australia, with over 70 percent of its people living in Melbourne, the state capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)).
