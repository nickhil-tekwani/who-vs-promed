In a heart wrenching incident in Mayurbhanj district today [10 Sep 2016], the bodies of a female elephant and a calf were found in Budhipata Forest Range. The bodies of the pachyderms were found mud-dipped, raising fears of an anthrax bacteria attack.

According to reports, some locals of Niuti Chamarasahi village located the dead elephants in the Gudagudia Forest Range this morning [10 Sep 2016] and called up the forest officials. The forest officials led by Mahusudan Patra arrived at the spot later in the day and examined the dead female elephant and the calf. As both the bodies were seen lying side by side without any injury, it is feared that the duo might have suffered an anthrax attack before death.

On the other hand, some Chamarasahi residents have claimed that a herd of around 6 elephants stormed the Budhipata forest Friday [9 Sep 2016] night. As the herd approached the paddy crop field near Chamarasahi, a female elephant and a calf fell to the ground. They were seen bleeding through their anuses, establishing the anthrax fear.

Forest officials have completed the preliminary investigation to ascertain the cause of death, and they have not ruled out anthrax.

[A very similar report can be accessed at: http://huntnews.in/p/detail/2094045978072723?xlang=en&uc_param_str=dnfrpfbivesscpgimibtbmntnijblauputoggdnw&pos=1473490598147&channel=india&chncat=category_english.

The news report carries a photograph of the 2 animals side by side covered in mud. The accounts are somewhat confusing, but for the moment we may assume that they refer to the same pair of animals. That both should fall dead at the same time is unusual for any disease, unless they were shot. Confirmation of the causes of their deaths is awaited.
