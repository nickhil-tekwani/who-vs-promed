Cholera outbreaks have killed at least 13 people in south west Haiti in the wake of Hurricane Matthew, government officials told Reuters on Sat [8 Oct 2016], voicing concern that the disease was spreading. A total of 6 people died of cholera in a hospital in the southern town of Randel, while another 7 died in the western coastal town of Anse-d'Ainault, the officials said, likely as flood waters mixed with sewage.

Hurricane Matthew left almost 900 people dead in Haiti and caused major flooding and loss of livestock.

Dr Donald Francois, head of the Haitian health ministry's cholera program, said 62 others were sick with cholera as a result of the storm. "We are concerned about these new outbreaks of cholera we are seeing in new districts," he told Reuters. "The situation is particularly difficult in Randel and (nearby) Port-a-Piment. I am on my way to the south region to assess the situation and ensure all the necessary measures are in place," he said, adding that he had heard unconfirmed reports that as many as 50 people may have died from cholera in southern Haiti.

[2] Cholera - Haiti: post-hurricane

Every 10 to 15 minutes, new patients arrive at hospitals around Haiti, exhausted because of the upsurge in cholera cases in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. In Port-à-Piment, there were some 60 people suffering from the waterborne disease by Sunday afternoon [9 Oct 2016] and 4 people had died.

"We have had water here for a while. We need water to be able to try and bring down the number of cholera cases. We need oral serums (for diarrhoea) and aquatabs (water treatment tablets) to be able to save these people's lives. They are desperate," said Pierre Louis, a hospital worker.

At least 1000 people have died since the hurricane first crashed into the island less than a week ago [4 Oct 2016]. Thousands more have had their homes and livelihoods ripped out from beneath them.

Rural communities in particular are lacking clean water, food and shelter, prompting a public health crisis which is set to get worse before it improves, health officials fear. An estimated 10 000 people are in shelters and, although United Nations aid has begun to arrive, debris and floods are making communities difficult to reach.

[3] Cholera - Haiti

Haiti reported 255 deaths from cholera in the first 8 months of 2016, an increase of 33 per cent compared with the same period of 2015, said the local representative of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on 1 Oct 2016. According to the agency, in the same period of 2016 more than 27 000 cases of the fatal disease were recorded, representing an increase of 27 per cent over 2015.

The United Nations on 30 Sep 2016 announced a package of 181 million dollars to help victims of cholera in Haiti following the recent recognition by the UN that it was partly responsible for the spread of the outbreak, which has caused almost 10 000 deaths in the Caribbean country. The secretary general of the organization itself, Ban Ki-Moon, lamented a week ago consequences of cholera, affecting some 800 000 Haitians since it emerged in October 2010.

[Prior to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the infrastructure supplying clean water in the population was tenuous at best. The earthquake destroyed much of the ability to deal with human waste and supply safe potable water. When _Vibrio cholerae_ was then inadvertently introduced into the country, the epidemic spread quickly in this population due to the lack of clean water in an immunologically naïve population and had continued over the 6 years since the beginning. Hurricane Matthew produced an exclamation point to the on-going epidemic in its wake as a dramatic exaggeration to the yearly increases related to the rainy season. The beat of this dismal epidemic goes on and will not stop until adequate funding is obtained to rebuild an infrastructure. - Mod.LL
