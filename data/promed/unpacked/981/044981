_E. coli_ outbreak with unknown food source
-------------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 37
Hospitalizations: 10
Deaths: 0
States: 4
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

Update on source
----------------
A specific food has not yet been confirmed as the source of this outbreak, but many sick people reported eating sandwiches with romaine lettuce at Wendy's restaurants in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania before getting sick. Based on this information, Wendy's is taking the precautionary measure of removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in that region. Wendy's uses a different type of romaine lettuce for salads. Investigators are working to confirm whether romaine lettuce is the source of this outbreak, and whether romaine lettuce used in Wendy's sandwiches was served or sold at other businesses. Wendy's is fully cooperating with the investigation.

What you should do
------------------
- CDC is not advising that people avoid eating at Wendy's restaurants or that people stop eating romaine lettuce.
- Wendy's is taking the precautionary measure of removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in this region.
- At this time, there is no evidence to indicate that romaine lettuce sold in grocery stores, served in other restaurants, or in people's homes is linked to this outbreak.
- CDC will update this advice if the investigation identifies foods to avoid.

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, the FDA, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to identify the food source of this multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. A specific food has not yet been confirmed as the source of this outbreak, but many sick people reported eating burgers and sandwiches with romaine lettuce at Wendy's restaurants before getting sick.

Epidemiologic data
-----------------
Since the last update on 17 Aug 2022, 8 more illnesses have been reported and 2 new states have reported illnesses. As of 18 Aug 2022, a total of 37 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from 4 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2022/o157h7-08-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 26 Jul 2022 to 8 Aug 2022 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2022/o157h7-08-22/epi.html).

State of residence / Number of sick people
---------------------------------------
Indiana / 1
Michigan / 15
Ohio / 19
Pennsylvania / 2

Sick people range in age from 6 to 91 years, with a median age of 21 years, and 62% are male. Of 24 people with information available, 10 have been hospitalized. Among the 10 people who have been hospitalized, 3 people in Michigan have developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some of the recent illnesses have not yet been reported to PulseNet, as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak. In addition, some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _E. coli_.

State and local public health officials have been interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Among 26 people who have been interviewed, 22 (86%) reported eating at a Wendy's restaurant in the week before their illness started. The Wendy's restaurants where sick people ate are in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. People reported eating a variety of menu items, including burgers and sandwiches. Romaine lettuce served on burgers and sandwiches at Wendy's was one of the most common ingredients eaten among the menu items, but investigators continue to analyze data at the ingredient level to determine if there are any other possible foods that could be the source of the outbreak.

Public health actions
-------------------
Based on the information available, Wendy's is taking the precautionary measure of removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in that region. Wendy's uses a different type of romaine lettuce for salads. Investigators are working to confirm whether romaine lettuce is the source of this outbreak, and whether romaine lettuce used in Wendy's sandwiches was served or sold at other businesses.

Michigan has 43 cases of a strain of _E. coli_ that is being investigated in an outbreak in 4 states, with more than half of the Michigan sufferers hospitalized, the state health department said Friday [19 Aug 2022]. The health department said that more than 55% of the people who fell ill reported eating food at Wendy's restaurant locations. A specific food item has not yet been identified as the source of the illness, but investigations are focusing on sandwiches topped with romaine lettuce. "Currently there is not a recommendation to avoid eating at Wendy's while the restaurant works with local public health departments to remove potentially implicated products," the state health department said in a news release.

As of Friday [19 Aug 2022], Michigan had 108 cases of _E. coli_, with 43 of them confirmed to be _E. coli_ O157, the strain being investigated in the outbreak in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana, said Chelsea Wuth, spokesperson for the state health department. She said Michigan's 43 cases have undergone whole genome sequencing. State and federal health officials said no deaths have been reported.

Illness onset dates in Michigan range from late July 2022 through early August 2022, with cases in 18 jurisdictions, the state health department said. Those jurisdictions are the city of Detroit and Allegan, Branch, Clinton, Genesee, Gratiot, Jackson, Kent, Macomb, Midland, Monroe, Muskegon, Oakland, Ogemaw, Ottawa, Saginaw and Wayne counties. Those ages 6 to 94 years old have been affected, according to the health department. It said 4 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a severe complication that occurs in some people who are diagnosed with a Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), have been identified. The CDC said hemolytic uremic syndrome is a type of kidney failure.

"Additionally, we urge residents to take proper precautions when handling food and practice safe food preparation," said Dr. Alexis Travis, senior deputy director of public health administration at the state health department. Health officials said people experiencing symptoms of an _E. coli_ infection should consult a health care provider as soon as possible to see if testing is recommended. Health care providers should contact the local department to report suspected or confirmed STEC cases.

[The posting from Michigan seems to suggest that there are a substantially higher number of cases than confirmed by CDC at this point. Romaine lettuce has been a common vehicle for the transmission of EHEC. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope of this ongoing outbreak and the source and distribution of the suspected vehicle. - Mod.LL
