["Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a vectorborne infectious noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and cattle. Sheep and goats might also be susceptible, but usually do not develop overt disease.

"EHD virus (EHDV) is transmitted between ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges, thus EHD infections are strongly seasonal. White-tailed deer is the most severely affected species, with the peracute form having a high mortality rate. In cattle, clinical signs occur rarely but fever, anorexia, dysphagia, emaciation, ulcerative stomatitis, lameness, respiratory distress, and erythema of the udder have been reported."
Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual -- Chapter 3.1.7 Epizootic haemorrhagic disease, https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.07_EHD.pdf. - Mod.CRD

At least 7 EHDV serotypes are currently recognized worldwide. In Israel, serotype 7 was identified in 2006, when it manifested with serious clinical signs in cattle. EHDV serotype 6 caused an outbreak in 2015, when clinical signs were milder than those associated earlier with EHDV serotype 7. From September 2016 to February 2017, an EHDV serotype with close relationship to an EHDV serotype 1 strain in Nigeria, was identified in cattle presenting mild or asymptomatic disease. Final results of the pending serotyping of the EHDV circulating at present are expected. As apparent from the summary above, no mortalities have been caused, so far, by this strain. Most likely, circulation of this virus is not limited to Israel but is likely to circulate regionally.

Economical assessment of the 2006 outbreak in Israel (which affected 117 settlements with 41 000 milking cows) is available in ref 1.
A useful recent review of EHDV globally is presented in ref 2.
