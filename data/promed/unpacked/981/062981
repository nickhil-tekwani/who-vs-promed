The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the Gujarat chief secretary and the district magistrate, Rajkot, to respond to a complaint filed by health rights activist Jagdish Patel of the People's Training and Research Centre (PTRC), Vadodara, regarding the alleged death of RPP and 2 others reportedly because of silicosis, a fatal occupation disease, in Rajkot, one of Gujarat's top cities.

A notice issued to the chief secretary and the district magistrate, NHRC pointing out that at least 3 other workers had contracted the fatal disease said that the senior Gujarat officials have been "asked to look into the issue and direct the concerned officials to verify the complaint, insisting that they should "take necessary steps to extend monetary relief and rehabilitative steps to the next-of-kin as well as workers suffering from silicosis."

Asking the district magistrate, Rajkot to respond "within 8 weeks," the notice said: "It is pertinent to mention here that these people have allegedly died of silicosis and/or are suffering from silicosis. Hence, the state government has to keep this in mind while enquiring into the matter."

The incident of the deaths of RPP and others came to light in August 2019.

[Silicosis is a serious lung disease. We are not told the occupation of these 3 individuals and possibly others for which this complaint was filed. However, recently, in September 2019, ProMED-mail posted on stone masons in the US and internationally being affected by silicosis [Silicosis - USA: workers health 20191007.6712659].

"A summary from the CDC article: This article was likely generated by a recent CDC MMWR report on this problem: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6838a1.htm, (Rose C, Heinzerling A, Patel K, et al). Severe Silicosis in Engineered Stone Fabrication Workers -- California, Colorado, Texas, and Washington, 2017-2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2019;68:813-818. DOI; and the Australian article https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/50/suppl_61/OA484.

"Respirable crystalline silica exposure causes silicosis, a disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Clusters of cases have been reported internationally among stone countertop fabrication workers, but only one U.S. case in this industry has been reported previously."

While we are not told whether these individuals are stone or engineered stone workers, we can present some information with regard to silicosis.

For those who may not be aware of precisely what silicosis is:
"Silicosis is a lung disease caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica, a mineral part of sand, rock, and mineral ores such as quartz. It mostly affects workers exposed to silica dust in occupations such mining, glass manufacturing, stone cutting, and foundry work. Over time, exposure to silica particles causes scarring in the lungs, which can harm one's ability to breathe.

"Symptoms of silicosis can appear from a few weeks to many years after exposure to silica dust. Symptoms typically worsen over time as scarring in the lungs occurs."

- Acute silicosis causes cough, weight loss, and fatigue within a few weeks or years of exposure to inhaled silica.
- Chronic silicosis appears 10 to 30 years after exposure and can affect upper lungs and sometimes causes extensive scarring.
- Accelerated silicosis occurs within 10 years of high-level exposure.

"Silicosis can develop within a few weeks to even decades after exposure. When people breathe silica dust, they inhale tiny particles of the mineral silica. This silica dust can cause fluid buildup and scar tissue in the lungs that cuts down your ability to breathe. This can lead to lung scarring and cough, weight loss, and fatigue.

"Silicosis affects the lungs by damaging the lining of the lung air sacs. Once this begins, it leads to scarring and, in some situations, to a condition called progressive massive fibrosis. This condition happens when there is severe scarring and stiffening of the lung, which makes it difficult to breathe.

"People with acute silicosis experience cough, weight loss, tiredness, and may have fever or a sharp chest pain. You may also have shortness of breath over time, especially with chronic silicosis. Your healthcare provider might hear crackles or wheezing when they listen to your lungs. Having silicosis increases the risk of other problems, such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, and chronic bronchitis.

"Each type of silicosis affects the body somewhat differently:
- In acute silicosis, the lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, which causes severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.
- In chronic silicosis, the silica dust causes areas of swelling in the lungs and chest lymph nodes, which makes breathing more difficult.
- In accelerated silicosis, swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in chronic silicosis.

"Over time, lung capacity decreases, and people with silicosis may need support with oxygen and other devices to help them breathe."

"Symptoms of silicosis can appear from a few weeks to many years after exposure to silica dust. Symptoms typically worsen over time as scarring in the lungs occurs.

"Cough is an early symptom and develops over time with exposure to silica that is inhaled.

"In acute silicosis, you may experience fever and sharp chest pain along with breathing difficulty. These symptoms can come on suddenly.

"In chronic silicosis, you may only have an abnormal chest X-ray in the beginning and then slowly develop a cough and breathing difficulty. More than 1/3rd of people with silicosis have phlegm production and cough. Chronic bronchitis-like symptoms may occur, and the lungs have additional sounds called wheezes and crackles. As extensive scarring progresses over time, you may see signs of chronic lung disease such as leg swelling, increased breathing rate, and bluish discoloration of the lips."

"There is no cure for silicosis. Prevention is still the best way to avoid the disease. Once silicosis has developed, your doctor will assess the degree of lung damage with tests. Some people may need urgent treatment with oxygen and support for breathing. Others may need medicines to decrease sputum production, such as inhaled steroids. Some may need inhaled bronchodilators, which relax the air tubes.

"Once the disease advances, the management is similar to many other chronic lung diseases and needs a multidisciplinary or team approach. To keep the disease from getting worse, it is important to stay away from any additional sources of silica and other lung irritants, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens and smoke. You may consider counseling to discuss changing occupations.

"Acute silicosis may need to be treated with steroids, and a lung transplant may need to be considered;" https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/silicosis/diagnosing-treating-silicosis.html. - Mod.TG
