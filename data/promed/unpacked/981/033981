The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is telling Oklahomans to be alert for anthrax in their livestock this summer.
The disease usually occurs in sheep and cattle but can also be seen in dogs, horses, pigs or other animals -- including humans. Officials said outbreaks of the disease can occur after flooding that follows a drought, and Oklahoma has a higher-than-normal chance to see anthrax. The disease is most likely to occur in alkaline soil.

Officials said livestock will suddenly drop dead if infected by anthrax, and there could be no signs of the illness. After death, the carcass of the animal will quickly bloat and dark blood will ooze from the body. Carcasses of animals that die from anthrax should not be opened, as that could cause the bacteria to spread to soil in the area, officials said.

Anthrax causes a very high fever and listlessness in animals, causing death in a short period of time. The disease in livestock is not easily transmitted to humans. Humans could be infected by coming into contact with bodily fluids or the carcass of an infected animal after its death.

Officials said the anthrax found in animals is not as easily transmitted to humans as the anthrax spores used as bioterrorism agents after the World Trade Center bombings. Oklahoma has not seen a case of anthrax since 1996.

If you have questions, call your local veterinarian or contact state veterinarian Dr. Rod Hall at 405-522-0270. For information on how to dispose of an animal with anthrax, visit http://ag.ok.gov/aems/Carcass%20disposal%20options.pdf.

[KOCO is a television company in Oklahoma City. If you go to the article it is linked to an interview with Rod Hall, OK State Veterinarian, speaking about this risk. ProMED-mail only started reporting anthrax events in 1997 and so we lack any information on the 1996 event. If there has been a true absence of anthrax outbreaks for 19 years, the chances of any spores surviving in meaningful numbers must be slight. I normally assume that after a reported absence of 8 years the risk has essentially gone. But the recent wet weather has the capacity to float spores up from a deeper level in an old cattle grave, and farmers do put in new ditches and water lines with the possibility of bringing contaminated deep soil to the surface. And having no reported outbreaks is not the same as not having had any outbreaks in the past 19 years. Ranchers are notoriously lax in reporting unexpected deaths. And this recent rain will encourage grazing growth, and _B. anthracis_ can germinate and multiply in the root mass. The true disease risk from this has yet to be quantified but that is no excuse for not being on the alert for any unexpected livestock deaths. It just needs 1 to go unattended for the infection to spread to other animals on that pasture.

There has also been a prolonged drought in west Texas that came to end with the recent heavy rains. There anthrax is enzootic, and a year rarely goes by without any outbreaks in cattle and/or deer in the western counties and sometimes in the northwest. I think we can confidently expect to see Texas deer and livestock affected this summer.

We have no reports of anthrax in Oklahoma, but we do for Texas. - Mod.MHJ
