Live SV40 virus was present in both OPV and IPV used prior to 1963. [OPV =
oral polio vaccine, IPV = injectable polio vaccine.
Information presented at the NIH Conference on SIV40 in January, 1997
included the following:
1. Live RSV [respiratory syncytial virus used in challenge studies in
volunteers in late 1950s contained live SV40 [because it was grown in
monkey tissue culture. The nasal inoculum contained 10 000 TCID50 doses
of SV40 [TCID50 = 50% tissue culture infectious doses. Moderate elevation
of neutralizing antibody titers occurred in 70% and 30% recipients [sic
with shedding [of SV40 in the throat for 1-2 weeks.
2. OPV vaccine with high titer SV40 did not induce any antibody response in
recipients. Stool cultures [were positive for up to 5 weeks in 30%,
indicating some replication in intestinal tract occurred.
3. Lab workers with close contact with infected rhesus monkeys: 50-60% have
anti-SV40 neutralizing antibody.
Fortunately, there is no evidence that SV40 causes harm in humans.

Some odd things about this report ... they seem to have done a very narrow
viral search for the presence of antibodies and then what titre did they
take as "positive"? There are positive titres and then there is infection. A
low titre is interesting but nothing else. A medium-to-high titre is more
indicative of an infection. Also were the "four" clustered, possibly
indicating a primate center with poor hygiene, husbandry, whatever?
