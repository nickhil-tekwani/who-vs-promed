The Pahang Health Department has confirmed that 10 blood samples
taken from 19 people involved in the search and rescue operation to
locate a drowned victim in Lubuk Yu in Maran in June 2010 were
infected with melioidiosis and leptospirosis.

Pahang Local Government, Environment and Health Committee chairman
Datuk Hoh Khai Mun, who received the blood test results yesterday, 22
Jul 2010, said 6 of the blood samples were infected with melioidiosis
and 4 others with both diseases. He said the blood samples taken from
9 other rescuers, however, were not infected.

"Six people are still hospitalized, comprising 3 at the Sultan Haji
Ahmad Shah Hospital in Temerloh, 2 at Jengka Hospital and one at
Selayang Hospital in Selangor," he told reporters after launching the
state-level "No Plastic Bag" campaign. Hoh said 148 people were
believed to have contracted the diseases compared with 83 previously.
"However, these people only showed symptoms of fever, coughing and
dizziness," he said.

On 10 Jul 2010, the Lubuk Yu recreational area was closed to the
public after 6 people died, while 83 others contracted leptospirosis
after participating in the operation to locate a drowned man in the
area between 26-30 Jun 2010.

[Both melioidosis and leptospirosis can be acquired from contact with
water. Melioidosis is caused by _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and is
not a zoonosis, since transmission of the infection is basically
related to water/soil exposure in the endemic areas (primarily
southeast Asia and northern Australia during wet seasons). The
infection can be acquired, however, by humans and animals.

_Leptospira_ species infection, however, is a world-wide zoonosis
acquired directly or indirectly from exposure with infected animal
urine, usually either rodents or livestock.

It is not stated whether the test for melioidosis was culture or
serology. The latter is not useful in endemic areas. As a reminder,
melioidosis is a category B bioterrorism disease. More information on
the disease diagnoses and presentations would be useful. - Mod.LL]
