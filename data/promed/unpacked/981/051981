Hoosier Park received the 2nd set of test results recently submitted
to the University of Kentucky Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center on
54 remaining horses under quarantine.

Two of the nasal swab results have been returned positive. Although
no horses remaining in the quarantine barn are displaying any
clinical signs of equine strangles, the decision was made today [6
Oct 2009] by Jeff Smith, general manager of racing, on the
recommendation by the track veterinarian and the Indiana Board of
Animal Health, to remove all horses remaining in the quarantined barn
from the grounds.

In addition to the 2 positive tests from the horses remaining in
quarantine, one additional positive test was returned on one of 2
horses removed to a secondary off-site quarantined location last week
following a spike in temperature. The test results on the other horse
removed at the same time have not been returned.

"After consulting with our track veterinarian as well as the Indiana
Board of Animal Health, I am asking that all horses located in the
quarantined barn be moved off grounds immediately," said Smith.

It is standard procedure to remove any horse showing signs of
sickness in the quarantined barn. All horses remaining in the
quarantine barn will be transported out by their individual trainers
or designee. The location and contact information of all horses
removed from quarantine will be provided to Hoosier Park. The barn
under quarantine will be cleaned, disinfected, locked and not
utilized for the remainder of 2009.

"It is significant to note that no other horse outside of the
quarantined barn has shown any clinical signs of infection during
this entire quarantine process," said Smith. "Hoosier Park's team has
followed all protocol and biosecurity procedures outlined by state
officials and will continue to do so for the remainder of the meet.
Throughout this process, the welfare of our equine athletes has been
at the forefront of our decision-making."

All other horses stabled on the backstretch are not under quarantine.
The backstretch, which consists of 1032 stalls, is fully operational,
and no disruption to business has been experienced.

[The management at Hoosier Park certainly puts the health of the
animals at the forefront of concern. Healthy animals continue to
race, and it is in the best interest of all concerned to have healthy
animals. The Indiana Board of Animal Health does a great job of
assisting these folks with biosecurity and bio-containment to ensure
the health of uninfected animals and of the track and the racing
industry in Indiana. - Mod.TG]
