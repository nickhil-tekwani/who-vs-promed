Avian influenza may break out from 8 million geese
-----------------------------------------------
H5N1 has been found in unvaccinated ducks and geese in southern provinces.
Meanwhile, the Veterinary Department is unable to produce a vaccine for
geese, which signals a high risk for a recurrence of the bird flu epidemic
in Viet Nam.
In southern Ben Tre province, 50 ducks and geese tested positive for H5N1.
The local veterinary agency has sent 600 blood samples of 300 ducks and
geese to the HCM City Veterinary Centre for testing.
Mai Van Hiep, head of the provincial Veterinary Agency, said that the local
government should not ban farmers from rearing ducks and geese. Ben Tre
currently has around 700 000 ducks and geese. Its ducks have received the
1st vaccination only. The province is preparing for the 2nd injection.
In Tien Giang province, analyses of blood samples of 11 geese that were not
vaccinated shows that up to 2/3rds of the samples were positive for type
A/H5N1 virus.
According to Director Truong Van Dung of the Veterinary Institute, the
world doesn't have vaccine for geese, so this is a problem for Viet Nam.
Mr. Dung said that he didn't know when the vaccine for geese would be
produced because it was a "scientific research task."
Viet Nam's waterfowl number 50-70 million, accounting for over 26 percent
of the poultry flock, and includes 7-8 million geese, mainly in the north
and northern part of the central region. Provinces in the Mekong Delta have
smaller numbers of geese, but most of the geese are allowed to wander,
including 196 000 in Dong Thap and 114 000 in Can Tho.

Suspected avian influenza infections in symptomless ducks and geese, in the
southern provinces Tien Giang, Long An and Ben Tre, have been reported
earlier this month [August 2006] (see item [7] in archived 20060812.2266).
Since the lab tests at that time revealed the H5 subtype virus, ProMED-mail
indicated the need for laboratory findings on the full identity of the
virus strain. This need seems to have been fulfilled now by the
identification of H5N1, though an official confirmation and notification
are pending. No HPAI has been officially reported from Viet Nam since 26
Jan 2006. The last follow-up report -- notifying absence of the disease --
was sent to the OIE on 23 Feb 2006. - Mod.AS]

Dutch order poultry indoors to prevent bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
The Dutch Agriculture Ministry ordered farmers on Tuesday [22 Aug 2006] to
keep their poultry indoors from 1 Sep 2006 to protect flocks from the
threat of avian flu from migrating birds.
"During the forthcoming migration period, there is a risk that migratory
birds can spread bird flu," the ministry said in a statement.
"For this reason, all holders of chickens, geese and other birds should
keep them indoors." [The official press release says, "chickens, geese and
other poultry, including waterbirds." - Mod.AS]
Alternatively, farmers can construct an enclosure that would make contact
with wild birds impossible, it said.
The Netherlands, Europe's 2nd biggest poultry producer after France,
reported 2 suspected cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu in owls
at a Rotterdam zoo earlier this month [August 2006] but later said initial
tests ruled out the disease. Final test results are due later this week.
The Netherlands, which is also a top world poultry exporter, has never
reported H5N1, found in several other European Union countries, in
commercial poultry.
Scientists have suggested that migratory birds play an important role in
the spread of the H5N1 virus, which originated in Asia and has killed 141
people worldwide so far.
Earlier this month [August 2006], the Netherlands found a low-pathogenic
H7N7 bird flu strain at a farm. Authorities culled all the 25 000 chickens
at the infected farm and temporarily sealed off another 130 farms for
testing to prevent a major outbreak.
Five countries -- Russia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong
-- banned imports of Dutch poultry and poultry products, even though Dutch
authorities said all tests were negative and assured the situation was
under control.
Officials have said that the detected H7N7 strain is less dangerous than
the one that hit the Netherlands in 2003 and was not a threat to human
health but that measures were still needed as it might mutate into a more
aggressive form.
The Netherlands suffered a devastating outbreak of H7N7 avian flu in 2003
that led to the culling of 30 million birds, about 1/3rd of the poultry flock.
The ministry said farmers who have vaccinated their poultry against bird
flu can still keep the birds outdoors after 1 Sep 2006. [The official press
release specified, "birds which are fully vaccinated, which means at least
one week after the 2nd vaccination." - Mod.AS]
The government launched a vaccination campaign earlier this year [2006] to
reduce the risk of the disease.
But most farmers preferred not to vaccinate, as they feared that importing
countries would refuse to buy their meat and eggs because of consumer
worries about possible health risks.
