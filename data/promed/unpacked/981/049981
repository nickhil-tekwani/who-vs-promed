Experts have been left baffled after dozens of dead animals washed up on beaches popular with tourists in Mexico. Visitors are being warned to steer clear from the sands, which stretch almost 26 miles [42 km] along the west coast of Mexico, until the cause of the deaths can be determined.

A total of 21 dolphins, 11 turtles, and 2 sea lions were found either washed up on shore or floating in shallow waters near Sinaloa.

Worried environmentalists have called for an in-depth investigation to try and establish what caused the tragedy. None of the sea creatures appeared marked or cut in any way so it was possible to rule out that they had been caught in fisherman's nets or run over by a cruise liner.

Mexico's Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) are now investigating whether pollution is to blame for the deaths. They have also activated a security protocol and tourists have been warned not to use the beaches while the water is being tested.

A spokesman for FEPA said: 'We will be looking at what species are affected, their condition, size, age, physical appearance, nutritional state, health, visible traumas, the time and date, [climatic] conditions, state of the sea, topography of the beach, and accessibility of the area.

'We will also be carrying out an autopsy and collecting samples of tissue and organs to conduct laboratory studies.' However, he added that at the moment marine biologists were baffled about the cause of the mysterious deaths.

It is expected to take a number of weeks for the results to be released.
