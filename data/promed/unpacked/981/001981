Ex-Mayo employee may be link to 3 cases of hepatitis
----------------------------------------------------
[The Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida] reported Tuesday night [24
Aug 2010] that 3 transplant patients may have contracted hepatitis C
virus infection from a Mayo employee who was fired on Tuesday [24 Aug
2010]. The employee, a male radiology technologist, was fired after
admitting to "diverting drugs," according to a written statement from
the clinic.

A Mayo spokesman, Kevin Punsky, would not answer questions Tuesday
[24 Aug 2010] but said a news conference is planned [25 Aug 2010] to
discuss details of the situation. The 3 patients had all undergone
invasive procedures at the clinic's interventional radiology unit,
according to the clinic's written statement. The clinic said it was
contacting patients "who may be affected by this former employee's
regrettable actions." The statement said the technologist was
considered a "possible source of transmission," and that he had been
removed from contact with patients as soon the possibility of a link
was recognized.

Hepatitis C is an infection caused by a virus that can cause scarring
of the liver and potentially liver cancer and other illnesses. Many
people who use intravenous drugs have been infected with the hepatitis C virus.
