Pacific
---
Fiji. 10 Apr 2015. (reported) 1 case, imported.
http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=301424

[Although ProMED would not usually report a single imported case, since Fiji has active transmission of dengue viruses and the mosquito vector is the same for both dengue and chikungunya viruses, this single case is a good example of the risk of introduction of a virus where the vectors are abundant enough to support ongoing transmission.

[An interesting article by Dr. Ann Powers entitled "Chikungunya virus outbreak expansion and microevolutionary events affecting epidemiology and epidemic potential" appeared in the 30 Mar 2015 issue of the open access journal Research Reports in Tropical Medicine (http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=24367.0). This article is relevant to the chikungunya outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail.

Another report of interest related to the dissemination of _Aedes albopictus_ in Africa, with relevance to both chikungunya and dengue virus transmission, is entitled "Invasion of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) into Central Africa: what consequences for emerging diseases?" The authors are Carine Ngoagouni, Basile Kamgang, Emmanuel Nakoune, Chistophe Paupy and Mirdad Kazanji, and it appeared in Parasites & Vectors 8:191 DOI 10.1186/s13071-015-0808-3. - Mod.TY]
