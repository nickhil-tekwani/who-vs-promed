China reported bird flu cases in Tibet - OIE
--------------------------------------------
China has discovered a strain of bird flu, likely the one deadly to
humans, at a farm in Tibet, making the western region the 3rd to be
hit in the country, the world animal health body OIE said on
Wednesday [10 Aug 2005].
"We just received the information that bird flu has been detected in
Tibet," OIE director-general Bernard Vallat told Reuters.
He said the virus found was likely to be the H5N1 strain that has
swept large parts of Asia, killing more than 50 people in the region.
The disease also led to the death of 140 million birds in Asia at a
cost running to billions of dollars.
"It's highly pathogenic so it will likely have the same
aggressiveness as in the rest of Asia," Vallat said.
The Chinese authorities informed the Paris-based OIE that 133
infected birds had died in a farm close to the capital Lhasa, which
had prompted them to cull an additional 2600 birds in the surrounding
area.
China did not say what type of bird had been infected but Vallat said
it was likely to be chicken.
The news comes on the same day as confirmation that a bird flu
outbreak in Kazakhstan was the deadly H5N1 strain and news that the
disease had extended its reach in Russian Siberia and spread to
Mongolia.
But Vallat said the Tibet outbreak probably came from another part of
China. The Asian country already reported bird flu outbreaks in its
western provinces of Xinjiang and Qinghai, which are adjacent to
Tibet.
Some scientists have warned that avian flu, infectious in birds, does
not spread easily among humans, but it could mutate into a form
better able to pass from animals to people, possibly triggering a
global pandemic. They say such a pandemic would likely start in Asia
and could kill millions and result in devastating economic losses.
Vallat said the fact that bird flu had spread to Tibet was maybe
because China had not applied bird vaccination in the entire country.
"So we can hope that now they will extend vaccination and that the
virus will be quickly contained," he said.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, dated 10 Aug 2005, can be accessed

<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/China%20(Tibet)%20HPAI.pdf>.
It indicates that the outbreak started on 1 Aug 2005 in Lhasa,
affecting breeding chickens, causing mortality of 133 birds out of
2608, all of which have now been destroyed. IVPI (intravenous
pathogenicity index) revealed the isolate to be of high
pathogenicity. Vaccination has been applied, using an inactivated
mono H5N2 vaccine.
