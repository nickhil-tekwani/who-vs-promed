Spreading disease batters China's rural areas
---------------------------------------------
Nearly 71 percent of China's fatal hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) cases were reported in rural areas, giving a clear sign of the
huge rural-urban medical gap, the Ministry of Health said on Thursday
[24 Jun 2010]. The ministry vowed to further enhance medical
responses, particularly in vast countryside areas, to curb the raging epidemic.

As of Tue 22 Jun 2010 the common viral epidemic among children has
sickened nearly 987 779 on the Chinese mainland. Of that total, 537
died. The majority of those who have gotten ill are younger than 3
years of age, said Wang Zijun, deputy director of the emergency
response office under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), at a press conference.

The epidemic control situation is grave in the country as the number
of deaths caused by the disease stood at only 186 in the same period
last year, Wang said. "Rural doctors, who are less experienced than
their urban counterparts in treating the infection, are finding it
difficult to make timely diagnoses of the infection, with no lab
screening capacity at grassroots-level facilities," said Lu Lianhe,
veteran infectious disease doctor of the Beijing Ditan Hospital. A
late diagnosis might delay effective treatment for the disease,
which, in rare cases, can cause deadly complications like
encephalitis, he said.

Usually, the infected person recovers without medication in 7 to 10
days, experts said. Relatively poor awareness of public hygiene and
medical care among the rural population is also to blame for the
higher fatality rate there, Wang said, urging parents there to
practice better hygiene.

Among the fatal cases, about 92 percent were caused by enterovirus 71
(EV71), which, like other strains [species of enteroviruses] such as
the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses and echoviruses, can cause the
[same symptoms], Wang said. To address that issue, the CDC planned to
introduce a quick test kit for EV71 among rural doctors to help
facilitate early detection, according to Wang. "Early detection and
treatment are the key to averting death," he said. Also, the Ministry
has been busy training all rural doctors in the nation for better
HFMD response, said Yang Jinrui, deputy director of the Ministry's
information office.

The task will be completed by the end of June [2010], according to
Yang. Previously, treatment guidelines for HFMD had been distributed
to all medical facilities across the country. In truth, apart from an
unbalanced outbreak response between rural and urban areas in China,
the long-existing gap in health conditions of minors is also
widening, experts warned. The prevalence of stunted growth among
rural children younger than 5 is 17.3 percent, nearly 4 times that of
urban children, official statistics show. "And the gap shows no signs
of shrinking," said Song Wenxiu, divisional director of the National
Working Committee on Children and Women under the State Council.
Also, they are more susceptible to incidents such as the fake milk
powder, she said.

[HFMD) is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease
causes fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin
rash. In recent years, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, and the
coxsackievirus B viruses have been implicated most often. Less-common
causes include echovirus, parechovirus 1, adenovirus, and herpes
simplex virus (HSV).

Infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with
infectious virus. Infectious virus is found in the nose and throat
secretions, saliva, blister fluid, and stool of infected persons. The
virus is most often spread by persons with unwashed, virus-
contaminated hands and by contact with virus-contaminated surfaces.
Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the
illness. Everyone who has not already been infected with an
enterovirus that causes HFMD is at risk of infection.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged also as a major cause of
neurological threat following the eradication of poliovirus. Most
EV71 infections commonly result in hand, foot and mouth disease but
some cases are associated with brainstem encephalitis and acute
flaccid paralysis. Mortality has been high high in EV71 brainstem
encephalitis complicated with pulmonary edema, particularly in
children below 5 years of age. Destruction of vasomotor in the
brainstem by EV71 produces autonomic nervous system dysregulation
prior to the pulmonary edema. The pulmonary edema is the result of
increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by the direct
brainstem lesions and/or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome
produced by the release of cytokines and chemokines.

There is currently no specific antiviral agent to treat or vaccine to
prevent EV71 diseases. Treating severe EV71 brainstem encephalitis
patients with intravenous IgG and milrinone is associated with
significantly decreased mortality by attenuated sympathetic activity
and cytokine production (recently reviewed by Wang SM, Liu CC. Expert
