I have been following BSE and the growth of BSE-"like" problems for some
time. The chronic wasting disease in elk brings to mind several questions:
1) Were the elk farms using animal-based feed?
2) When the domestic herds were replenished from the wild were they fed the
same feed OR is the contamination caused from:
a. contact with infected animals? or
b. contact with the soil or water?

Have the involved ministries also put out alerts to hunters and others
about absolutely avoiding meat from sick or suspect animals since the
disease is so closely related to BSE and scrapie?

SASKATCHEWAN: Starting 1 Jan 2001, Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food is
offering a voluntary surveillance program for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)
to Saskatchewan game farmers. "The certificate of participation in this
program will help inspect herds that are in the program. Application forms
will be mailed to game farm producers in January. This new program
complements the expanded 3-year monitoring program, initiated by
Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management, to determine if chronic
wasting disease is in the province's wild deer and elk populations.

[Chuck Fenwick's questions draw an analogy with the BSE situation ongoing
in Europe in terms of the animal feed used for farmed elks as well as a
focus on possible means of transmission of the CWD. A prior posting from
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency mentioned that the CWD in these
affected herds in Canada was felt to be related to imported elk from South
Dakota in 1990, with all cases linked to the original imported
animals. Another prior posting from Dr. Elizabeth Williams of the
University of Wyoming (a leading expert on CWD) mentioned that the captive
animals in which CWD were identified had not been fed UK bone meal, and
that the strains of CWD were different from BSE strains. (see refs 1-6 for
further info).
Kathryn Tominey's question re: advisories for hunters is worthwhile. Even
if we assume hunters know not to eat sick or suspect animals, a warning is
just good public health. In the USA, the Colorado Division of Wildlife
issued an advisory letter in Oct 1996 to hunters to avoid eating meat or
organs from animals with signs of CWD. I vaguely remember reading a
national advisory from the US Fish and Wildlife Agency, but have been
unable to find the exact reference. On reviewing the advisories issued in
both the USA and Canada, most are for hunters to submit suspected
CWD-infected animals for testing. They mentioned that to date there has
been no evidence linking CWD to vCJD, but the hypothetical risk of an
analogous TSE should be considered before eating any animal showing signs
of emaciation. - Mod.MPP
