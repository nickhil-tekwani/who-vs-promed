35-year-old woman from Sarikei. They died between 12 and 16 Mar 2006,
Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan said yesterday.
"We are worried about dengue fever (DF) in Sarikei and Kuching, which have
registered more cases than other areas," he said.
Sarikei registered the most cases, with 225 of DF and one of DHF, while
Kuching came next with 164 DF and 2 DHF cases.

The National Environment Agency [NEA] is launching an intensive strike
against dengue, which spreads faster in hot weather.
Although cases have been low -- 700 so far in 2006, compared to nearly 3000
in the same period last year [2005] -- the agency believes pre-emptive
action is the way to go.
The weather is getting hot, and that suits the _Aedes_ mosquito just fine
because as things get hotter, so do female mosquitoes, carriers of the
dengue virus. They will produce more female eggs in the hot sun.
The heat will also help the mosquito grow from larvae to deadly adults
faster, in less than 10 days compared to the usual 2 weeks. The virus also
multiplies more quickly.
So from mid-April, the Environment Agency will be doing a one-month
intensive sweep of the outdoors. Covering some 120 000 HDB [Housing and
Development Board] blocks, schools and public areas, the intensive exercise
targets possible breeding areas like common corridors and drains. This will
involve a task force from over 23 agencies like Town Councils and HDB.
Said Dalson Chung, head (environmental health operations, National
Environment Agency, "At the same time, we would like to urge all the
households to continue to be vigilant and practice the 10-minute, 5-step
mozzie [mosquito] wipe-out campaign. Together, I think we can bring down
the number of breedings at homes and also outside homes."
Over the past few months, officers have been hitting the ground islandwide
to record and get familiar with potential breeding grounds at places like
construction sites, schools and plant nurseries. So when dengue cases are
reported, they would know which are the hotspots to go to and destroy.
This is all part of preventive measures to identify problem areas before
the virus spreads.
More than 500 officers will fan out across Singapore regularly to go
door-to-door and check on some 1.1 million households every 6 months and
all other public areas every 3 months. This will be stepped up once more
than 2 dengue cases have been reported in an area.
A marker has also been devised for officers to step in and clean up even
before the Health Ministry reports a dengue case.

An anti-dengue campaign is to be launched in the South to prevent the
spread of the deadly disease. A programme to destroy mosquito breeding
places and to keep the area clean will be launched by the Epidemiology Unit
in collaboration with the Government agents and medical officers in the
Southern Districts next week.
The campaign will commence from the South and will be expanded to Colombo
and the North and East districts. Over 500 workers will be engaged in the
cleaning of environment campaign and it will be completed within 2 months.
The campaign follows serious warnings issued by the health authorities
regarding an outbreak of a dengue epidemic in the country. Epidemiology
Unit Medical Officers told Lankapuvath that the number of dengue cases were
3-fold higher than in 2005.
They warned that if adequate measures are not taken by the Government, Sri
Lanka will face an epidemic very soon.
In the past 2 months 3 deaths have been reported from Kandy, Hambantota and
Jaffna. Medical Officer, Epidemiology Unit, Dr. Hasitha Tissera said 10
districts had been identified as the worst affected and measures were being
taken to carry out cleaning and awareness programmes before the end of the
next month.

The Argentinian Ministry of Health confirmed today the detection of 25
dengue fever cases in Misiones Province, which borders Brazil and Paraguay,
where the disease has also been detected.
"In addition to the 25 confirmed cases, another 13 suspected cases have
been detected, which are currently under study in order to rule out dengue
fever," announced the Health Ministry in a press release.
The outbreak is located in "Los Trabajadores" neighborhood in Puerto
Iguazu, a northern Argentinian city (Misiones Province), 1.615 km north of
Buenos Aires, and near Foz de Iguazu (Brazil) and Ciudad del Este
(Paraguay), in the area nearby the famous Iguazu cataracts.
Most affected persons presented with fever, headache, muscle and joint
pain, which are typical symptoms of dengue fever.
The Argentinian Ministry of Health sent technical personnel and specialized
equipment to the affected area in order to perform insecticide spraying
aiming to eliminate adults and larvae of the mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_.
Authorities are keeping watch for persons with fever in the surrounding
areas, in order to determine whether they are infected with the dengue
fever virus.
The outbreak is currently affecting the area known as Triple Frontera
(Triple Borderline). In Paraguay 112 cases of dengue fever have been
detected, as well as 480 suspected cases, while in Foz de Iguazu (Brazil),
31 dengue fever cases have been reported, and there are 150 suspected cases.
In the past few months, the presence of the dengue fever mosquito vector
has increasingly been reported in different zones in Argentina, and so far
there are 25r confirmed cases and 13 suspected cases.
The last outbreak of dengue fever was reported in 2000, consisting of 242
cases in Formosa Province and 218 cases in Misiones Province.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), dengue is one of the main
health problems in the world, since both case figures and mortality rates
are increasing.
It is thought that currently more than 2 billion people live in areas
exposed to dengue fever transmission.
