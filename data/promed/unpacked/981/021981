The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to consume any juice products or other beverages from Juices Incorporated (aka Juices International and Juices Enterprises) of Brooklyn, NY. The company's carrot and beet juice products have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal foodborne illness. Consumers are warned not to consume these products even if they do not look or smell spoiled.

Botulism can cause the following symptoms: general weakness; dizziness; double-vision; and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these symptoms after consuming carrot or beet juice products from Juices Incorporated should seek immediate medical attention.

Although previously distributed in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, Juices Incorporated products were recently found in retail establishments and restaurants in the New York City area, and consumers may have moved the products beyond this region.

The following Juices Incorporated juice products pose a particular concern for _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination:
Carrot Juice Drink
Carrot & Beet Juice Drink
Carrot & Ginger Drink
Double Trouble Carrot Punch
Ginger Beet Juice
Beet Juice Drink

The products are packaged under the following brand names:
Juices Incorporated
Juices International
Juices Enterprises

On 7 Oct 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint for permanent injunction against the owners of Juices Incorporated after FDA inspections revealed continuing violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including insanitary conditions at the Juices Incorporated facility. Under a 3 Jan 2011 Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction (Consent Decree), the owners of Juices Incorporated are required to stop manufacturing and distributing any articles of food, including all juice products and other beverages, until they correct the food safety deficiencies and insanitary conditions at their facility. (The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act refers to unsanitary conditions as insanitary.)

Subsequently, on 21 Jun 2012, U.S. District Court Judge Sandra L. Townes for the Eastern District of New York issued an Order to Enforce Consent Decree after the owners of Juices Incorporated failed to comply with the requirements of the Consent Decree. FDA investigators recently confirmed that Juices Incorporated and its owners continue to manufacture and distribute juice products and other beverages in violation of the Consent Decree and the Court's Order to Enforce Consent Decree.

Although _C. botulinum_ has never been found in Juices Incorporated's juice products, FDA is concerned about the firm's continuing production of potentially hazardous juice products despite the requirements of the Consent Decree and Order to Enforce Consent Decree. Because the company was ordered not to manufacture or distribute any food, FDA is also warning consumers not to consume other Juices Incorporated beverages, including but not limited to: Ginger Beer Drink, Agony Peanut Punch, Front End Lifter Magnum Punch, Irish Sea Moss, Cashew Punch, Sorrel Drink, Pineapple Twist, Soursop Juice, and Corn Punch.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

It should be noted that the FDA has just approved the 1st heptavalent equine derived botulinum antiserum for the treatment of botulism disease http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm. - Mod.LL
