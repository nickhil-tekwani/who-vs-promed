Hai Phong city has become the 3rd locality in Viet Nam to detect African swine fever [ASF]. The outbreak in Hai Phong was detected [Fri 22 Feb 2019] after a farmer in Chinh My commune, Thuy Nguyen district, reported that 35 of his pigs had died from the disease.

Out of the 5 serum and viscera samples collected from the dead pigs 3 tested positive for ASF with the same pathogens as the outbreaks previously detected in the northern provinces of Thai Binh and Hung Yen, according to the Animal Health Department under the agriculture ministry. Local authorities have disinfected the area and buried the dead pigs.

According to Pawin Padungtod, senior technical coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Disease in Viet Nam, ASF cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans, so the public should not be too worried and boycott pork. Padungtod also highly appreciated Viet Nam's epidemic prevention efforts and thanked the Vietnamese government for preparing, responding to the ASF outbreak and informing the public of the outbreak in a swift manner. "This is a very important condition for international organizations, including FAO, to mobilize resources and experts to help Viet Nam control the disease soon," he said.

Last week [week of 18 Apr 2019], the Animal Health Department announced that it had discovered 2 separate outbreaks of African swine fever that affected 130 pigs in Hung Yen province and another affecting 123 pigs in Thai Binh province. Local authorities have disposed of all the infected pigs, blocked all transportation and sales of live pigs and pig products, and sanitized farms and markets in the 2 provinces.

The African swine fever is a viral disease that exclusively infects all pig species through bodily fluids such as blood or mucus. It causes hemorrhagic fever with a 100 per cent mortality rate. There is currently no cure for it. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE], 20 countries and territories have reported cases of the disease and over one million pigs have been culled since 2017.
