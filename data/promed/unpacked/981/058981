Two new cases of mad cow disease have surfaced in France, bringing the
number of cases discovered in the country so far this year to nine, the
Agriculture Ministry said on Monday. A total of 40 cases of BSE have been
reported in France since it first appeared in 1990, the ministry said.
Both of the latest infected animals were dairy cows. One, born in September
1991, was in a herd of 149 cattle in the Aisne region near France's border
with Belgium, while the second, born in March 1989, was part of a herd of
74 in the Finistere area of Brittany. Both herds were destroyed over the
weekend, the ministry said.

[It would be interesting to know how these two cases, with clearly long
incubation periods, are geographically related to known exportations of
British livestock feeds. - Mod.MHJ
