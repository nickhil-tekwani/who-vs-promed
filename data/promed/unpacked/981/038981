Parents, among others, are being warned by county health officials of an increase in pertussis (whooping cough) cases compared to this time in 2013.

On Fri 28 Mar 2014, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency reported 10 new cases of pertussis, where others in the county may have been exposed to the disease. This brings the total number of cases reported so far in 2014 to 154, a large increase compared to the only 33 reported cases during the same time in 2013. The 10 new cases affected children between the ages of 2 and 13 years old.

Health officials urged locals, especially children, to obtain recommended vaccines. "We're seeing a very high level of pertussis activity throughout San Diego County," Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer, said in a media release. "Parents, caregivers and educators should be on the lookout for symptoms so those with pertussis get treatment so they don't infect others." To help prevent pertussis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive doses of DTaP vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. Preteens and adults are encouraged to get a Tdap booster.

Both the DTaP vaccine series and the Tdap booster can be obtained for parents and their children from primary care physicians or local retail pharmacies. A total of 430 pertussis cases were reported in 2013, 165 in 2012 and a recent high of 1179 in 2010.

Tehama County Public Health revealed today [27 Mar 2014] that they've had a confirmed case of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, so they're reminding people to take precautions. They recommend that adults who have not had a vaccination get one. Infants are at higher risk and should be vaccinated at 2 months of age.

Pregnant women and also family members who are around infants should get vaccinated, since the bacterial disease is spread through talking, sneezing or coughing.

Linda Rose, Tehama County Health supervising nurse, said it's also important to keep an eye out for symptoms.

Ada County is seeing the highest number of cases of whooping cough in several years. Whooping cough can be potentially deadly to infants. "Right now, our numbers are about 4 times average, and they're continuing to grow," said Central District Health Staff Epidemiologist Sarah Correll. "We do realize that the number of cases we get reported to us is just a very small part of the actual cases in the community, so we're really just seeing the beginning." Correll suspects not everyone who has whooping cough is getting treated or is being tested for the disease. There are 26 confirmed cases so far in Canyon County and 25 in Ada County.

"It's not unusual to have a spike every 5 to 7 years, a little bit of whooping cough cycle, but what we do worry about is that the infants may be adversely affected because people aren't thinking whooping cough. And if an infant or a newborn baby is infected with whooping cough, that could be deadly," said Correll. Most of the cases they have seen in Ada County have been kids between 5 and 18 years old, and they usually see the disease transmitted within the household.

Authorities recently confirmed pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, in an Antrim County student. The Health Department of Northwest Michigan mailed letters to parents in the affected school, to recommend students in that classroom be treated by their doctors with an antibiotic as a preventive measure. Letters also provided information about symptoms of the illness and vaccination recommendations.

According to the health department, the infected student did not receive an up-to-date pertussis vaccination.

"The best prevention is to ensure everyone in the family is vaccinated," said Joshua Meyerson, medical director for the Health Department of Northwest Michigan. "Make sure young children receive all 5 recommended doses of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 15 months of age, and again between 4 and 6 years of age. Starting at age 11, everyone should receive at least one Tdap booster dose, even if they have had a regular tetanus (Td) vaccine recently. Routine hand-washing is also helpful."

Meyerson warns that those who refuse vaccination put others at risk. "Even if you aren't concerned about the threat of pertussis for yourself, you may be unknowingly spreading the illness to others, especially infants and young children, to whom it may be fatal," he said.

The health department offers all necessary immunizations, including Tdap and DTaP vaccines, through its clinics in Bellaire, Mancelona, Charlevoix, Gaylord and Harbor Springs/Petoskey.
