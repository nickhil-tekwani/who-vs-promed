Suspected death due to Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease
--------------------------------------------------
Singapore: A 2-year-old toddler died on Sunday [10 Sep 2000 as a result of
a suspected outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD which struck a
child-care centre in Sengkang. 4 other toddlers at the centre appear to
have been affected by the disease. The Ministry of Environment (MENV) has
shut down the centre as a precautionary measure until further notice. The
condition of the 4 children is unknown because an investigation into the
outbreak is on-going.
The MENV said in a statement last night that it was notified yesterday
afternoon of the outbreak of the disease after investigations confirmed
that the death of the boy was linked to the disease. The boy had developed
a high fever and rashes on his body on Friday On Sunday afternoon, he
started to vomit blood and he was taken to the Kandang Kerbau Women's and
Children's Hospital. Doctors pronounced the boy dead about 12 hours later.
The MENV is in the process of contacting parents of children who are
enrolled at the centre to advise them to take their children to a doctor if
they suffer from symptoms of the disease. Symptoms include a fever lasting
for 2 to 3 days, a sore throat and runny nose, mouth ulcers and rashes.
Sufferers may also feel nauseous, weak and suffer from diarrhea. HFMD is
not serious usually, although it can cause rare complications which result
in death, the MENV stated. It usually spreads through direct contact with
bodily fluids of patients or items used by them. Those who want more
information should call the Quarantine and Epidemiology Department on
7319-758 or 7319-751.

[HFMD is predominantly a disease of childhood. It can be a consequence of
infection by Enterovirus 71 or one of several coxsackieviruses,
Coxsackievirus A16 being the most common. Enterovirus 71 has been the most
frequent cause of HFMD in Southeast Asia and the Far East in recent years.
Typical cases of HFMD exhibit vesicles and ulcers in the mouth, and a
vesicular exanthema affecting the palms and soles of feet. The course of
the disease is usually mild and death is unusual. The vomiting of blood
described in this case suggests that other factors may have been involved.
It is not clear why HFMD is suspected in this case. Virus can be readily
isolated from vesicular lesions and laboratory confirmation of infection is
straightforward. Further information is awaited. -Mod.CP
