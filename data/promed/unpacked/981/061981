Suspected SARS - Germany ex Singapore via New York: Paramyxovirus-like
particles identified by electron microscopy
---------------------------------------------------
Numerous tests have been performed on the 3 patients admitted on Saturday
15 March to the Isolation Unit at Frankfurt am Main with suspected severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Tests from respiratory specimens for
influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses,
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ and _Chlamydia_ spp. by antigen enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were all
negative; antibody tests for dengue, influenza A and B, measles,
hantaviruses, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ and _Chlamydia_ spp. were likewise
negative or unremarkable so far; further test results are pending.
Particles morphologically resembling paramyxoviruses were seen in
respiratory specimens (throat swab and sputum) obtained from the index
patient, a doctor from Singapore, by the teams in Marburg and in Frankfurt
am Main. It remains to be seen whether this finding can be confirmed --
tests including low-stringency paramyxovirus PCR and tissue culture are
currently under way in Hamburg, in Marburg and in Frankfurt am Main. It
needs to be emphasised that at this time these preliminary results only
indicate a suspicion. Furthermore, even if the presence of a paramyxovirus
was confirmed, it is not clear at this stage whether this might represent
the causal agent of SARS or rather a coincidental finding.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Preiser for submitting this information. Dr
Preiser's caution on the interpretation of these results is paramount here:
"It needs to be emphasised that at this point of time these preliminary
results only indicate a suspicion. Furthermore, even if the presence of a
paramyxovirus was confirmed, it is not clear at this stage whether this
might represent the causal agent of SARS or rather a coincidental finding."
Confirmation of these findings will be important as well as identification
of a similar agent from additional cases of SARS will be necessary before
it can be concluded that this agent is the etiology of SARS. - Mod.MPP]
[Paramyxoviruses are viruses associated predominantly with respiratory
infections (the parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV)) and common childhood illnesses (mumps and measles). Some of these
viruses are ubiquitous (in particular human RSV) and it would not be
exceptional to detect one of these viruses fortuitously by electron
microscopy in any virus screening exercise. In general, paramyxoviruses
only infect vertebrates and no arthropod vectors are known. Unexpectedly,
in recent years several new paramyxoviruses have been discovered.
Predominant among these are _Hendra virus_ and _Nipah virus_, 2 related
viruses isolated from bats in Australia and South East Asia, which have
been responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in the human population.
These two viruses differ significantly from other paramyxoviruses in
molecular terms and might not be detected by PCR without the use of
specific primers. Other novel paramyxoviruses of unknown pathogenic
potential are _Salem virus_, isolated from a horse in North America,
_Tupaia paramyxovirus_, isolated from a tree shrew (_Tupaia_ sp.) in
Thailand, and a heterogeneous collection of paramyxoviruses isolated from
snakes, lizards, and turtles. Perhaps the most surprising discovery was the
recent characterization of a novel pneumovirus (that is, a member of the
sub-family _Pneumovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae)), designated
_Human metapneumovirus_, which is associated with respiratory illness in
infancy worldwide. Consequently a novel paramyxovirus must rank high among
candidates for the etiologic agent of SARS. - Mod.CP]
