A rash of _Escherichia coli_ [O157:H7] infections has prompted state
officials to close a central Pennsylvania lake to recreational
activities. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources says
at least 6 positive cases and 3 probable infections have been reported
by people who swam in the lake at Cowans Gap State Park in Fulton
County.

Spokesman Terry Brady says the infection cases involve patients
ranging from 2 to 49 years old. One affected child is from Maryland
and the rest from central Pennsylvania. Brady says all 9 cases involve
people who went swimming in the lake in late July 2011.

The lake was closed to swimmers one day last month, July 2011,
following a high _E. coli_ reading, but was reopened after the level
dropped within acceptable limits.

[Lakes and rivers are screened routinely for _E. coli_ ("coliforms")
as a measure of potential contamination with fecal contamination.
Specific organisms are not generally identified and the previous July
2011 closure may or may not have anything to do with the current
problem. - Mod.LL]

Terry Brady, a spokesperson with Pennsylvania's Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources said on Mon 8 Aug 2011, that the
lake at Cowans Gap State Park remained open, despite links to 3 cases
of _E. coli_ O157. "The beaches are open and actually there was a good
turnout today. A link to the park has not been established."

The lake was closed on Tuesday afternoon, 9 Aug 2011, as the number of
people, primarily children, confirmed to have contracted _E. coli_
O157:H7 rose to 6, with an additional 3 suspect cases.

At least 3 of the infected have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome,
including a 3 year old Mercersburg girl who has been hospitalized and
a 12 year old Chambersburg boy, who is now recovering after spending
his birthday in the hospital.

Spokesman Brady said in an email that the closing of the lake at
Cowans Gap is a precautionary measure "to protect the public's health
and safety until the investigation can be completed." He said the
decision was made after interviews showed that swimming in the lake
before becoming ill was a common factor between all individuals.

Through her Facebook group, a family friend of one of the children has
heard from several other people who say their children got sick after
swimming in the lake at Cowans Gap, she said. They include a 6 year
old girl, a 15 month old boy, and several children who apparently
suffered "mild symptoms" but did not require hospitalization. "All of
these kids have one thing in common, and it's Cowans Gap. The only
thing we do know is that they were all there," Stauffer said.

[In the summer, it often happens that cases of O157:H7 disease are
associated with poorly cooked hamburger (or sometimes other food
contaminated with cattle feces) or related to a petting zoo, but
readers should also remember that water -- either drunk or swum in --
may also be a vehicle for transmission. It is not stated, however,
whether _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from the water at the lake or
if just a high coliform count was found. It would be also interesting
to know how close the lake is to any cattle and if there had been a
lot of rain prior to the outbreak. - Mod.LL
