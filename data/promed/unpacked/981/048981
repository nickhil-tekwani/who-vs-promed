Hong Kong will cull 6000 pigs after African swine fever [ASF] was detected in an animal at a slaughterhouse close to the border with China, the 1st case of the disease in the densely populated financial hub.

"In order to minimise the risk of ASF virus spreading from the slaughterhouse, all pigs in Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse will be culled so that thorough cleansing and also disinfection could be conducted," Sophia Chan, Secretary of the city's Food and Health Department, said late Friday [10 May 2019].

She added that the pig detected with ASF was imported from a farm in the southern mainland Chinese province of Guangdong.

Pork is a staple of Chinese cuisine. Every day, Hong Kong imports around 4000 live pigs from China with only around 200 pigs coming from local farms in the crowded city. After ASF spread across more than half of China's provinces last year [2018], Hong Kong imposed import bans from any Chinese farms where the virus were detected.

With some of the world's most densely populated streets, Hong Kong remains on high alert to diseases. In 2003, some 300 people died during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS).

Chinese officials have said hundreds of thousands of pigs were culled in a bid to stop its spread -- an effort that has also seen restrictions placed on moving pigs from affected areas.

The virus is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs and wild boar.

Mainland China has suspended the transport of all live pigs to Hong Kong, causing pork prices to soar by as much as 40% on Saturday [11 May 2019], after the city confirmed its 1st case of African swine fever.

Pork traders said on Saturday evening they would stand guard overnight to prevent officials from entering the city's main slaughterhouse to cull some 6000 pigs that they believed were safe for consumption.

The transfer of at least 3500 pigs, which were to be processed at the city's 3 slaughterhouses, was halted temporarily, while the closure of the 2 main abattoirs meant there were no local pigs supplied to the market either.

Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said the suspension was part of an established mechanism. "We have already discussed this with mainland authorities ... the importing of live pigs will be automatically stopped at the sites found with any confirmed cases of African swine fever," Chan said.

There were no pigs supplied to the city's slaughterhouses on Saturday [11 May 2019], according to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. No pigs, local or from the mainland, would be supplied on Sunday [12 May 2019] either, according to the department's official forecast.

Officials on Friday [10 May 2019] ordered the culling of at least 6000 pigs at the government-owned Sheung Shui slaughterhouse -- which supplies 80% of the city's pork -- so the site could be thoroughly disinfected. But the cull was suspended after pork traders protested against the move, urging more tests on the batch.

The order followed the revelation on Friday [10 May 2019] that a pig imported from Zhanjiang in Guangdong province was infected with the virus. The batch with the sick pig had already been released to the market, but posed no health risk to humans and thoroughly cooked pork is safe for consumption.

The government did not make clear how long operations at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse would be suspended for, or when mainland authorities would resume imports of fresh pork.

The Tsuen Wan slaughterhouse, which is privately owned, also decided to temporarily stop operations after the news broke, according to lawmaker Steven Ho Chun-yin, who represents the agriculture and fisheries sector. But pork traders on Saturday [11 May 2019] lashed out at the government for ordering the pig cull, asking officials to spare the livestock unless they had tested positive for African swine fever.

"This batch of pigs was certified safe both by mainland and Hong Kong customs authorities, while the infected pig came from the batch on 2 May 2019 -- it's now already 11 May. I don't see why we need to kill them," said Hui Wai-kin, secretary general of the Pork Traders General Association of Hong Kong. Hui urged the government to carry out a quick test, which would only take 4 hours, instead of "blindly killing innocent pigs."

Hui said the industry would suffer losses of up to HKD 18 million [USD 2.3 million], based on an estimate that each pig cost HKD 3000 [about USD 380].

Chan said the government had agreed to compensate traders based on market prices. A pork industry representative said traders would "protect their property" and stand guard at the slaughterhouse overnight, unless the government could prove the batch was infected.

The representative also said they were prepared to launch a legal challenge against the government's decision, after talks on how to handle the 6000 pigs broke down late on Saturday [11 May 2019].

Undersecretary for Food and Health Dr. Chui Tak-yi said officials were willing to continue to talk with traders, but said the cull was a "strict and resolute" necessary measure to prevent the disease from spreading or becoming endemic.

The sudden shortage forced pork prices to surge, while some stalls had to close during the weekend.

A manager at a butcher's shop in Mei Foo said he had increased prices by 40%, after having to settle for buying 8 pigs from the Tsuen Wan slaughterhouse on Friday [10 May 2019] instead of his usual order of a dozen from Sheung Shui.

"We don't really have a choice. If the stock becomes more expensive at source we have to push up the prices for our customers too," said the manager, who asked to remain anonymous. The store would have to close on Sunday [12 May 2019], as they were unable to buy pork from the Tsuen Wan abattoir.

Another buyer, who had rushed to stock up on pork, said: "This is a big problem. Any respectable Chinese household needs pork bone to make soup at least twice a week. What are we going to do without any?"

In December [2018], the city introduced new safety measures in response to the virus' spread across mainland China, including stricter rules on culling livestock and considering a faster turnover of livestock at the government-run slaughterhouse. Also in December, 20 mainland Chinese pig farms halted supplies to Hong Kong as the fever swept the mainland, with at least 92 outbreaks of the viral infection reported.

[On top of the immense losses caused by the ASF internally, China's exports may be affected as well. Though the US and Canada haven't banned imports of plant-based feed from China, some US experts have recommended quarantining such imports from China, to be released only after at least 20 days.

As commented by subscriber David Thomson, perhaps a reasonable place to look might be the international natural hog casings trade, in particular, origin substitution within that trade. Other experts were of the opinion that discussions addressing feed stuff imports from ASF-affected countries should include the containers/bins/bags these commodities are been transported in, which may become vehicles for ASF virus transmission and thus should be disposed of by the farmer and not be reused. - Mod.AS
