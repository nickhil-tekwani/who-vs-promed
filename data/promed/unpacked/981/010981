[1] Case update
-----------
20 May 2018 Congo DR: The return of Ebola: Death toll rises to 26 in Democratic Republic of Congo as deadly fever reaches city of more than one million amid warning it could hit 8 more countries.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5750539/Ebola-death-toll-26-new-Congo-outbreak-not-global-emergency.html
[The Ebola death toll in the Congo DR has risen to 26, with 8 neighbouring countries also at risk as the deadly disease plagues the region. The country's health ministry announced another death this morning, with 4 new cases of the deadly disease confirmed.

The World Health Organisation declared the risk of the disease spreading within the Congo as 'very high', after 46 cases of hemorrhagic fever were confirmed, 21 confirmed as Ebola, 21 probable and 4 suspected. It has not yet branded the outbreak a world health emergency (PHEIC), but Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi and the Central African Republic are all in danger.]

[See URL for history of Ebola outbreaks and map showing countries at risk. More cases are slowly being confirmed. Rapid identification of cases seems crucial to the ring vaccination plan. - Mod.LK]

20 May 2018: Epidemiological situation
https://mailchi.mp/4ca363db302b/ebola_rdc_20mai?e=e31272c28f [in French]
[The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 18 May 2018:
- A total of 46 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 21 confirmed, 21 probable and 4 suspected.
- The index case has not yet been identified; investigations are in progress.
(The next updated figures will be published this [Mon 21 May 2018]).

Remarks
- Numbers harmonized with WHO and field teams.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News about the Ebola response
Vaccination
- This [Mon 21 May 2018], the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, will launch the 1st vaccination campaign against Ebola Virus Disease in Mbandaka. This is the 1st time in the history of the Congo DR that vaccination will play an integral part in the government's response plan to respond to an Ebola epidemic [outbreak]. The priority targets that will be vaccinated on [Mon 21 May 2018] are all health professionals who are directly exposed to confirmed cases of Ebola. Subsequently, people who have been in contact with confirmed cases of Ebola and contacts of these contacts will also be vaccinated to break the chain of transmission of the virus.
- The Minister of Health will be accompanied by Mrs. Kim Bolduc, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in the Congo DR, Dr. Allarangar Yokouidé, WHO Representative in the Congo DR, Tajudeen Oyewale, Deputy Representative of UNICE in the Congo DR, and Seth Bekeley, the CEO of GAVI.
- On [Sat 19 May 2018], the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa validated the vaccination protocol sent for examination by the Ministry of Health and the WHO.

[Everyone's hope seems to be riding heavily on the promise of the experimental rVSV ZEBOV vaccine. It is equally important to implement control measures shown to be effective in the West African outbreak, e.g., avoid contamination with bodily fluids from infected individuals by wearing protective covering and disinfecting thoroughly; perform burials using safe procedures; quarantine infected individuals, etc. - Mod.LK]

20 May 2018 Ebola outbreak: Congo DR to start vaccination campaign
https://www.npr.org/2018/05/20/612859111/ebola-outbreak-Congo DR-to-start-vaccination-campaign
[... Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organization stated: "As of today [Mon 21 May 2018], we have shipped to the Congo DR 7500 doses of vaccine. More vaccines are available if needed. This is not a general vaccination. It is a targeted vaccination. So people who are eligible to be vaccinated will be people who have been identified as high-risk individuals who have been in a close contact with those who have been tested positive for Ebola virus (ring vaccination)... Also, those who will receive vaccination are health workers and the responders. So we consider that for each confirmed case of Ebola, there will be between 100 and 150 people who will be eligible for vaccination. ..."]

20 May 2018: Congo [Congo DR] to begin Ebola vaccinations on [Mon 21 May 2018]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/congo-to-begin-ebola-vaccinations-on-monday-idUSKCN1IL0EV
[The WHO is sending 7540 doses of the vaccine developed by Merck to Congo. It is also in talks about a 2nd vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson. More than 30 health workers with experience administering Ebola vaccines are being deployed from Guinea to help with the campaign in Congo [Congo DR]. Logistical difficulties remain, especially the need to keep the vaccine 80 deg C below freezing -- approx. -112 deg F -- in a humid region where daytime temperatures hover around 30 deg C -- approx. 86 deg F --and power supplies are erratic. A government spokesman said late on Sat 19 May 2018 that Congo's partners had promised to make available 300 000 doses of vaccine.]

[It is not clear what would trigger use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The final Phase 1 clinical trial data was published in JAMA (Winslow RL, Milligan ID, Voysey M, et al. Immune Responses to Novel Adenovirus Type 26 and Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara-Vectored Ebola Vaccines at 1 Year. JAMA. 2017;317(10):1075-1077. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.20644). The data showed that Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies' investigational "prime-boost" Ebola vaccine regimen induced a durable immune response in 100 percent of healthy volunteers one year following vaccination.

This heterologous prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen contains 2 components: Janssen's AdVac®technology (based on adenovirus type 26) and MVA-BN® technology from Bavarian Nordic A/S (based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara). These vaccines both use a viral vector approach, where a benign virus is modified to safely express key proteins of the target virus, in this case Ebola virus. Prime-boost vaccination is an established approach for the prevention of several infectious diseases. Janssen's investigational Ebola vaccine regimen was developed in a collaborative research program with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

21 May 2018. Ebola outbreak: experimental vaccinations begin in Congo DR
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44194065
[At least 26 people are believed to have died in the current outbreak. Health workers were among the 1st to receive the vaccine on [Mon 21 May 2018]. One of the most immediate obstacles to the immunisation campaign is the country's unreliable electricity supplies, as the vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 deg.C [approx. -76 to -112 deg.F]. Initial stocks of the vaccine have arrived in Mbandaka city, but they must now be transported through densely forested areas to reach remote rural areas where many cases have been reported.

A further issue is that, as the vaccine has not yet been approved, its use is dependent upon informed and signed consent from all patients. This means that translators will need to be brought in to aid communication between health workers and local communities.]

[All the issues above are major obstacles. Additional issues include identification of cases, as there appears to be no rapid testing to date, and how effective ring vaccination will be in an urban area. Nonetheless, vaccination in conjunction with safe practices is the best bet for the country to get ahead of the outbreak. - Mod.LK]

[Healthcare workers in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province and home to 1.2 million people, will be the 1st to receive the vaccine, followed by contacts of confirmed Ebola cases, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Tarik Jašarević said. The vaccination drive is expected to reach rural Bikoro, the epicenter of the outbreak, by Thu 24 May 2018.]

20 May 2018 Nigeria: Ebola outbreak: water, hygiene cost-effective to disease control - WaterAid
http://www.tribuneonlineng.com/ebola-outbreak-water-hygiene-cost-effective-to-disease-control-%E2%80%95wateraid/
[Following the recent Ebola disease outbreak in the Congo DR, WaterAid Nigeria has identified access to water, sanitation and hygiene as a cost-effective method for controlling the spread of the disease. WaterAid Country Director, Dr ChiChi Aniagolu-Okoye ..., quoting from a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), explained that in Nigeria, 29 percent of hospitals and clinics in the country do not have access to clean water while the same percentage do not have safe toilets and 16 percent do not have a hand wash facility.

"About 1 in 5 deaths of newborn babies in the developing world are caused by infections with a strong link to dirty water, poor sanitation and unhygienic conditions; and Nigeria has one of the largest numbers of neonatal deaths worldwide. Out of all water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions, hygiene promotion, and particularly handwashing with soap, has been identified as the most cost-effective disease control intervention"...]

[Having access to clean water would address many health issues. This should be a priority goal for world health. - Mod.LK]
