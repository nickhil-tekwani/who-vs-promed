Seven people have died of leptospirosis in eastern Kazakhstan.
-------------------------------------------------------
Ust-Kamenogorsk, 3 Dec 1998: As a result of an infectious disease,
leptospirosis, seven people have died and 600 people are infected in
East Kazakhstan Region. The chief sanitary inspector Valeriy Yakupov
said this in an interview with Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency.
Yakupov said that such a number of cases of leptospirosis could be
explained by the 1997 forest fires which destroyed 92 hectares of
forest and caused rodents to migrate to built-up areas. Yakupov said
that poultry and domestic animals might also communicate the
infection. Moreover, it may also be communicated through foodstuffs
and water.
According to Yakupov's opinion, the number of registered cases can
soon be expected to increase, because fresh prophylactic work will
reveal a latent form of the disease. In all 40 -50 cases of
leptospirosis are being registered daily in Ust-Kamenogorsk which has
become the basic nidus of the infection. He noted that this disease
worsens chronic conditions such as tuberculosis and kidney diseases.
He noted that nine of the 13 pathogenic organisms [strains of
leptospirosis known to science were found in East Kazakhstan Region.
He underlined that at present traditional antibiotics and antibiotics
of a new generation as well as detoxication therapy are being used.
Moreover, the Kazakh Anti-plague Institute provided specific tests
which allow one hundred people to be examined at the same time.
Programmes of prophylactic measures were worked out at Regional and
city levels. The sale of perishable foodstuffs without appropriate
certificates in shops, markets and administration buildings is
prohibited.

[Mystery solved. The text is very similar to the Chinese news agency
report, except that here the word "plague" is replaced by
"leptospirosis." I should have checked GPHIN earlier - Mod.JW
