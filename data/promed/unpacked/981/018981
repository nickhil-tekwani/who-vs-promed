["Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a poxviral disease with significant morbidity in cattle. Although the mortality rate is generally low, economic losses result from loss of condition, decreased milk production, abortions, infertility, and damaged hides. The causative virus seems to be spread mainly by blood-feeding insects, such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes or ticks, and outbreaks can be widespread and difficult to control.

"Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a member of the genus _Capripoxvirus_ and the family Poxviridae. It is closely related antigenically to sheeppox virus and goatpox virus. Although these 3 viruses are considered to be distinct viral species, they cannot be distinguished by routine serological tests.

"There is no evidence that LSDV can infect humans.

"LSD was first reported in Asia and the Pacific region in 2019 in north west China, Bangladesh, and India. During the northern summer of 2020, LSD has continued its spread across continental Asia with many members in south and south east Asia confirming outbreaks." (https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/)

Since 2019, lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been reported in the Asia and the Pacific Region for the following countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Hong Kong (SAR-PCR), India, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, and Viet Nam. - Mod.CRD
