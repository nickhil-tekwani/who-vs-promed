The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the recall
of "7 Uzlov" brand herring because of possible botulism contamination.
The FDA said Krasniy Oktyabr Inc. of New York initiated the recall
after determining packages of herring of the Special Ambassador "7
Uzlov" might be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, which can
cause a potentially fatal foodborne illness.
The recalled herring was distributed to retail stores in New York
City in metal round containers bearing UPC code: 4-60556-000153. It
is a product of Russia. Consumers with questions can contact the
company at 718-858-6720.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. The
issue in this recall is not specifically mentioned. - Mod.LL]
