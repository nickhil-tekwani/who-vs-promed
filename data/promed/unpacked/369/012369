At least 4 deaths from 25 cases of leptospirosis disease have been recorded in Davao Region from [1 Jan to 2 Apr 2022], according to the Department of Health (DOH) - Davao on [13 Apr 2022].

Based on the latest data of DOH presented by assistant regional director Dr Gerna Manatad, 2 of the 4 deaths caused by leptospirosis were from Davao del Norte, while 1 each from Davao City and Davao Occidental.

The 25 cases of leptospirosis were also found to be most prominent in Davao City with 18 cases, followed by Davao del Norte with 4 cases, Davao de Oro with 2, and 1 in Davao Occidental.

The remaining provinces, namely, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental, have 0 cases so far.

"Based on our monitoring there are areas with flooding due to the low-pressure area (LPA) situation, brought about by the bad weather, we are also looking into leptospirosis cases," said Manatad.

Meanwhile, the recent data of the January to April 2022 cases of leptospirosis have decreased compared to the same period in 2021 wherein DOH recorded a total of 35 cases. Of this, Davao City and Davao del Norte still had the highest number of leptospirosis cases with 22 and 11 cases respectively. One case each was recorded in Davao de Oro and Davao del Sur.

In terms of the death cases, one died in Davao City from January to April 2021.

According to DOH, leptospirosis is a deadly disease caused by _Leptospira_ bacteria which can enter the body through wounds when in contact with floodwaters, vegetation, and moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats.

Manatad said people are more prone to contracting leptospirosis during typhoons and flood seasons. "Because of the circumstances in the way of transmitting the disease, especially during flooding and typhoon, that would really make our people vulnerable and contaminated with leptospirosis," she said. Its symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, yellowish body discoloration, dark-colored urine and light stools, and low urine output. In some severe cases, leptospirosis may also result in liver involvement, kidney failure, or brain involvement.

Prevention and control of leptospirosis include avoiding swimming or wading in potentially contaminated water, especially flood water; use of proper protection like boots and gloves; draining potentially contaminated water, and rat pest control.

[Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or freshwater contaminated with _Leptospira_ in the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

The leptospirosis outbreak reported in the news article above is occurring following flooding in the Davao Region, situated in the southeastern portion of Mindanao. It comprises 5 provinces: Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, and Davao Occidental (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_Region).
