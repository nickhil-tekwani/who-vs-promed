Viet Nam: avian influenza situation - WHO Update 6
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today [Wed 26 Jan 2005] reported 2
further laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian
influenza in Viet Nam. The 1st newly reported case is a 35-year-old woman
from the southern province of Dong Thap. She developed symptoms on 14 Jan
2005, was admitted to the hospital on 20 Jan 2005, and died the following
day. The 2nd newly reported case is a 17-year-old boy from the southern
province of Bac Lieu. He was hospitalized on 10 Jan 2005 and died on 14 Jan
2005. These additional cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December
2004 to 10. 9 of these cases were fatal.
The recent family cluster in northern Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
As announced previously, a family cluster in northern Viet Nam has been the
focus of intense investigation. The cluster involves 3 brothers. Of these,
Vietnamese authorities have identified influenza A (H5) virus infection in
2: a 46-year-old man and his 42-year old brother. The older brother
developed symptoms on 26 Dec 2004 and died on 9 Jan 2005. The younger
brother was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on 12 Jan 2005 and has
now fully recovered. He is known to have provided bedside care for his
older brother during a period of critical illness.
The source of infection for the 2 brothers remains undetermined, and
investigations are ongoing. The 3rd brother, aged 36 years, was
hospitalized for observation only, did not develop symptoms, and remains in
good health. Results of tests, conducted as part of the investigation, are
pending. Clinical specimens for the 2 confirmed cases are being sent to a
WHO collaborating center for further characterization.
Surveillance for further cases among health care workers, other family
members, and residents in both communities where the brothers lived has so
far found no evidence of additional cases. If limited human-to-human
transmission has occurred, all evidence at this stage suggests that the
chain of transmission ended after a single person was infected.
Preventing transmission during care by family members
-----------------------------------------------
Further sporadic human cases and occasional family clusters can be expected
considering the current spread of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza in poultry in some Asian countries. Experience to date indicates
that possible human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly during
prolonged close contact of a family member with a patient who was
critically ill. WHO has issued guidance on the precautions that can be
taken in health care facilities to minimize opportunities for transmission
of H5N1 virus infection from patients to close contacts, including health
care workers and family members.
Rapid detection and investigation of clusters of H5N1 cases, closely
related in time and place, are key surveillance activities that can provide
an early alert to possible changes in the transmissibility of the virus.

[As of Wed 26 Jan 2005, the WHO states that the cumulative number of
confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in East
Asia since 28 Jan 2004 is 54 (17 in Thailand and 37 in Viet Nam), of whom,
41 have died (12 in Thailand and 29 in Viet Nam).
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_01_26/en/>
These figures are more conservative than some of the recent reports
emanating from local sources. In particular, avian influenza virus
infection of the 3rd (youngest brother) in the family cluster in northern
Viet Nam is not confirmed, nor is the report that the 3 had consumed one or
more meals together which included raw poultry products. - Mod.CP]
