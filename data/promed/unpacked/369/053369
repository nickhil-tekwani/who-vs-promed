Abstract
--------
"Between 16 Nov 2019 and 15 Feb 2020, 36 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) virus outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry (n=34), captive birds (n=1) and wild birds (n=2), in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, Czechia and Ukraine; one HPAI outbreak caused by a simultaneous infection with A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) was reported in poultry in Bulgaria, and 2 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5) virus outbreaks were reported in poultry in the United Kingdom and in Denmark. Genomic characterisation of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses suggests that they are reassortants of HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from Africa and LPAI viruses from Eurasia. It is likely that this reassortment occurred in wild migratory birds in Asia during the summer and then spread to eastern Europe with the autumn migration. This is the 1st time that wild bird migration from Africa to Eurasia has been implicated in the long-distance spread of HPAI viruses to the EU. Given the late incursion of HPAI A(H5N8) virus into the EU in this winter season (1st outbreak reported on 30 Dec 2019), its overall restriction to eastern Europe, and the approaching spring migration, the risk of the virus spreading further in the west via wild birds is decreasing for the coming months. Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) viruses detected in the Bulgarian outbreak reveals that these viruses are both related to the 2018-19 Bulgarian HPAI A(H5N8) viruses and not to the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses currently circulating in Europe. An increasing number of HPAI A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N5) and A(H5N6) virus outbreaks in poultry in Asia were reported during the time period for this report compared with the previous reporting period. Single outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N8) virus were notified by Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Furthermore, in contrast to the last report, HPAI virus-positive wild birds were reported from Israel and one of the key migration areas in northern China. Two human cases due to A(H9N2) virus infection were reported during the reporting period." - Mod.CRD
