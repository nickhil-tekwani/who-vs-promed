Population growth and an increase in testing may be to thank for rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases in Washington state and Clark County, according to Kari Haecker, Clark County Public Health program manager for STD/HIV prevention. "The higher population you have, the more STDs you're going to have," Haecker said, adding that population growth in Portland is also a factor. "Disease does not stop at the [Columbia] river."

The screening guidelines put out by the Centers for Disease Control also changed in 2015, so more people are being tested. There's also the concerted effort by Clark County Public Health to interview every person who tests positive for gonorrhea. "We're getting their sexual partners, so we're getting more people tested and treated," she said.

In Clark County, the rate of occurrence for gonorrhea [in 2017] is 108.5 cases per 100 000 people. That's up from a rate of 85.9 in 2016. Rates of syphilis and herpes are also increasing, with 7 cases and 64.8 cases per 100 000 people respectively in 2017. Those rates were 4.6 and 50.1 in 2016. Chlamydia, however, saw a slight decrease. The rate of occurrence last year was 393.8 per 100 000 compared with 414.7 in 2016.

Haecker attributed the decrease in chlamydia to the effectiveness of expedited partner therapy. If someone in a heterosexual relationship is diagnosed with chlamydia, they can get a prescription for treatment for themselves and any partners. Since those partners were able to receive treatment without being checked, the number of cases isn't being fully reported, Haecker said.

Consistent and correct condom use is still the best way to prevent disease, she said. Talking to your partner also helps. "If you have a new partner possibly getting tested before engaging in sexual activity so if you have something you can take care of it before passing on to someone else (is also recommended)," Haecker added.

[Clark County, with a population of 425 363 residents, is in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Washington and located across the Columbia River from the city of Portland, Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Washington). The largest city in Clark County is Vancouver, on the north bank of the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, opposite Portland on the southern bank and the largest suburb of Portland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington). A map showing the location of Clark County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Clark+County,+WA.

The above news report says that the increasing rates for gonorrhea and syphilis in Clark County, Washington State are being attributed in part to increased testing for these STDs as a result of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines in 2015. These 2015 guidelines recommended more frequent STD screening (i.e., for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at least annually for sexually active MSM and at 3-6-month intervals for men who have sex with men (MSM), including those with HIV infection if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sexual partners have multiple partners (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/screening-recommendations.htm). Also, for sexually active MSM, gonococcal testing at all sites of contact (urethra, rectum, pharynx), regardless of condom use, is recommended. Sexually active women, including pregnant women, under 25 years of age and sexually active women age 25 years and older if at increased risk, should be tested for gonorrhea and retested 3 months after treatment; and all pregnant women at the 1st prenatal visit should be tested for syphilis and retested early in the 3rd trimester and at delivery if at high risk (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/screening-recommendations.htm).

The other factor cited for the rising incidence rates is the population growth that has occurred in Clark County and the nearby city of Portland, Oregon. Larger cities have disproportionately larger burdens of STD incidence, which could be due to the disproportionate presence of larger high-risk sexual networks in these locations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624619/). Clark County, with a population of 471 000 residents in 2017, grew by an average 18 365 new residents per year between 2014 and 2016 (http://www.columbian.com/news/2018/jan/21/more-growth-on-the-horizon-for-clark-county/). The Portland metro added nearly 40 000 people each year in 2015 and 2016, according to the Census Bureau, but growth slowed in 2017 (http://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/index.ssf/2018/03/portland-area_population_growt.html). - Mod.ML
