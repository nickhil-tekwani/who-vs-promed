Public health authorities have reported and confirmed 4 cases of food-borne botulism related to the consumption of smoked ham. The small outbreak took place after the consumption of homemade smoked ham in Macedo de Cavaleiros, a town in the [Bragança district in the] northeastern region of Portugal, after a meal on 19 Jul 2017. 6 persons were exposed and 4 reported symptoms consistent with foodborne botulism.

The 1st 2 patients, a middle-aged man and a pregnant woman, were admitted at Vila Real hospital. A 3rd patient, a middle-aged woman was later admitted at a hospital near Lisbon. The 4th patient, the latter's sister, was evaluated and discharged at Sao Joao Hospital Center, in Porto.

All patients developed symptoms in the 1st 36 hours following ingestion, with all manifesting blurred vision, dry mouth, and dysphagia. The 3rd patient's most prominent symptoms were nausea, extreme vomiting, and constipation. The 4th patient also had prodromal diarrhea.

Microbiological investigation confirmed the presence of botulinum toxin B in the stools of 3 patients and in the serum of all patients.

By 4 Aug 2017, all patients had been discharged and were [being] followed in an outpatient setting. None required antitoxin or mechanical ventilation.
