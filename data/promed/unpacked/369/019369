As you might imagine I have several patients that suffer the symptoms of
Pfiesteria poisoning. I wonder if it is possible to answer these questions:-
Have all the known cases been exposed to the live organism or have some
been at some distance from the presumed source of infection?
One of the articles mentions a typical pattern on an 'advanced brain scan',
what was this scan and what is the pattern?
Is there any diagnostic method available?
Has there been any advance on the mechanism of toxicity?
Are there any naturally occuring proteins with sequence homology?
I would appreciate any light you could shed on these questions.
[Although, research in humans has yielded definitive results yet, you be
able to piece together some clues to question by looking at the following
website, which was referenced in an earlier posting. If anyone has answers,
please let me know. - Mod pc.

Is human Pfiesteriosis another emerging human infection, caused by a
toxin-producing organism? Do the described skin sores represent a
Pfiesterial infection? If so, by what life form of Pfiesteria? Ameboid?
Can Pfiesteria become invasive and cause lesions elsewhere in the body?
Liver, for example, or lungs, or brain? If so, can it produce toxin in
those locations?
As precedents, quite a few other organisms can cause skin sores, Buruli
ulcer, for example. Amebae can become invasive, producing liver abscesses
and meningitis. And humans are heirs to quite a few toxin-producing
organisms such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae and assorted Clostridia.
Does ANYBODY know the answers to those questions, or is ANYBODY working on
them? It's about time we got a handle on the human side of this little
beastie.
