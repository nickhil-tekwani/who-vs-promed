Avian Influenza surveillance in humans as of 27 Sep 2004
Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Diseases Control, Ministry of Public
Health
----------------------------------------------
Bureau of Epidemiology on 27 Sep 2004 at 6:00 P.M. had received the reports
of 162 influenza or pneumonia patients from 32 provinces in the avian
influenza surveillance network since 1 Jul 2004. The preliminary
investigation results summary are as follow:

1. 12 new cases were reported today [see Table 1 at URL given above].

2. 19 cases are under investigation; 12 cases are new reports and 7 are
old cases [see Table 2 at URL given above].

3. Suspect cases reduced to 2.

4. One probable case, upgraded from suspect case, an 11-year-old female.
She was the daughter of the dead confirmed case from Nonthaburi, had onset
on 2 Sep [2004], and died on 8 Sep 2004

5. 2 more confirmed cases upgraded from suspect cases are: (1) a female,
32 years old, whose laboratory results showed influenza H5N1. Her onset was
on 16 Sep 2004 with pneumonitis; now she is recovering, no fever, normal
breathing. She is receiving treatment in Kampaengphet hospital; (2) a
female, 26 years old, resident of Nonthaburi, a sister of the case in
Kampaengphet, had onset 11 Sep 2004, and died on 20 Sep 2004. Laboratory
results from Siriraj hospital showed influenza H5N1. Therefore, confirmed
cases are 3.

Avian influenza  situation in Thailand 28 Sep 2004

2 new cases confirmed
-------------------
Since yesterday, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed 2
new cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans. The cases are a 26-year-old
woman, who died on 20 Sep [2004], and her 32-year-old sister, who remains
hospitalized in stable condition.

These new cases bring the total in Thailand confirmed since early September
to 3. Altogether, Thailand has reported 15 cases, of which 10 were fatal,
since the 1st human cases were detected in January of this year [2004].

Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in a family cluster

The most recent cases are part of a family cluster of 4 cases under
investigation to determine whether human-to-human transmission may have
occurred. Immediate investigation of any possible human-to-human
transmission is always needed to determine whether transmission has been
efficient and sustained. Such a situation would be cause for alarm, as it
might signal the start of an influenza pandemic. Inefficient, limited
human-to-human transmission may occur on rare occasions and is in line with
what is known, from epidemiological and laboratory investigations, about
the possible behaviour of the H5N1 virus.

The initial case in the family cluster was an 11-year-old girl who died of
pneumonia on 8 Sep [2004]. Thai authorities regard her as a probable case
of H5N1; laboratory confirmation is not possible as no specimens from this
patient are available for testing. The girl, who lived in the northern
province of Kamphaeng Phet, resided with her 32-year-old aunt, whose
infection has been confirmed. Both patients are known to have had contact
with dead chickens.

The girls 26-year-old mother, whose infection is also now confirmed,
resided in the Bangkok area, but provided bedside care for her daughter
while hospitalized, up to the time of the childs death. The mother fell
ill upon her return to Bangkok, where she died on 20 Sep [2004].

Thai officials have concluded that the mother could have acquired the
infection either from some environmental source or while caring for her
daughter, and that this represents a probable case of human-to-human
transmission.

The family cluster also includes the 6-year-old son of the aunt of the
initial case. He was hospitalized but is recovering, and samples are being
tested.

Surveillance for additional cases, among health workers and in the wider
community, has been greatly intensified in the province, and hospitals
nationwide have been placed on heightened alert for further cases.

While the investigation of this family cluster provides evidence that
human-to-human transmission may have occurred, evidence to date indicates
that transmission of the virus among humans has been limited to family
members and that no wider transmission in the community has occurred.
Continued vigilance is needed to determine whether the epidemiological
situation in humans remains stable.

Clinical samples taken from cases in the family cluster were immediately
shared with a laboratory in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.
Virus isolated from these samples will undergo genetic and antigenic
analysis to determine whether the virus has evolved and, more specifically,
whether it has acquired genes that allow improved transmissibility among
humans.

Bird flu transmitted between humans in Thailand
----------------------
A 26-year-old Thai woman who died of acute pneumonia on 20 Sep 2004 was a
"probable" case of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus,
the Thai Ministry of Public Health confirmed on Tuesday.

All 40 previously confirmed human cases of the virus since 2003 were
apparently caught from sick birds. But the World Health Organization fears
the virus could cause a lethal pandemic if it gains the ability to pass
easily from person to person.

The Thai ministry's statement stressed that the probable case of
human-to-human transmission followed prolonged, close contact between the
woman and her sick daughter, who also died from bird flu. The virus did not
show an ability to spread easily, as human flu does, which is required for
a pandemic.

But research on the virus's recent evolution shows it has become steadily
better at replicating in mammals in the past few years. It may now be
learning to spread between them.

Destroying chickens
-----------------
An 11-year-old [girl] fell ill with flu symptoms on 2 Sep [2004], in a
village in the northern Thai province of Kamphaeng Phet. She lived there
with her aunt and a few days earlier had helped to destroy some dead chickens.

Her mother, who was working near Bangkok, came home to care for her
daughter in hospital. But the girl died on 12 Sep [2004]. [Her mother] went
back to Bangkok, also developed flu, and died 8 days later.

Thai officials have now confirmed that her lungs contained H5 flu virus.
The Thai ministry said it could not rule out her having somehow picked up
the virus "in the environment" while in Kamphaeng Phet, but says it is
"probable" that she got the virus from her daughter. [The mother] had no
known contact with sick birds.

The girl's aunt got sick a day after [the girl's mother], and more than 2
weeks after destroying the sick birds. This is much longer than flu's
incubation period, so she too might have acquired the virus from her
relatives rather than the birds. She is in hospital, and confirmed to have H5.

Suspected Cases
--------------
The aunt's 3-year-old son has now recovered from suspected H5 flu, but 9
more people in the province are suspected cases, including a 13-year-old
who has died.

In a joint statement on Monday, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
and the World Organization for Animal Health called the avian influenza
epidemic in Asia "a crisis of global importance."

They stated that "recent outbreaks in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia,
and Malaysia show that the virus continues to circulate in the region, and
will probably not be eradicated in the near future".

The 2 agencies called for more research into how wildlife, domestic ducks
and pigs help spread the virus, as "a permanent threat to animal and human
health continues to exist".

Thailand Has Probable Human Bird Flu Transmission
-----------------------
Thailand said on Tuesday it had found its 1st known probable case of a
human being infecting another with bird flu, but insisted it was an
isolated incident that posed little risk to the greater population.

The government said a 26-year-old woman who died on 20 Sep [2004] could
have caught the H5N1 virus in the village where her daughter lived but
probably was infected by the 11-year-old girl while looking after her in
hospital.

"It would have been due to close and prolonged face-to-face exposure," the
government statement said, adding that no health workers at the hospital
had fallen ill.

The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention had been part of the investigation of the case from the
beginning and agreed it "would not pose a significant public health risk,"
the statement said.

The mother's death took to 10 the number of Thais killed by the H5N1 virus.
In Vietnam, 20 people have died of the disease.

Experts have long feared the H5N1 bird flu virus, which swept through much
of Asia early this year, could mutate into a form that could be passed from
person to person and set off a pandemic like the one in 1918, which killed
20 million people.

But, they say, the H5N1 virus would have to go through an animal -- most
likely a pig, although cats can also get it -- capable of harboring the
human influenza virus with which it could merge to forge a virus that could
trigger a pandemic.

The experts agreed "there is no evidence to suggest that the virus has
mutated," the statement said.

Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra called an emergency meeting of
provincial governors on Wednesday to beef up measures against the disease,
a government spokesman said.

"Fluke" Discovery
--------------
CDC expert Scott F. Dowell said the Thai case was a "fluke" in that the
mother and daughter lived apart, whereas in families living under the same
roof it was impossible to tell whether infected people caught bird flu from
chickens or from each other.

Suspicions of person-to-person transmission in Hong Kong in 1997, when the
H5N1 virus first appeared, and in Vietnam this year could not be
substantiated for that reason, he said.

"Because the mother lived in a separate city, it was much easier to be
confident that the likely mode of transmission or the probable mode of
transmission was person-to-person," he said.

"What appears to have happened so far is a well-documented episode of
transmission in a family cluster after prolonged, close contacts. It
doesn't necessarily tell us that anything has changed about the virus and
about the way it transmitted."

The daughter died on 8 Sep [2004] in the north-central province of
Khampaeng Phet, to which the mother had traveled from her job on learning
the girl was ill.

The mother then went back to work and died soon after. An aunt, with whom
the girl lived while her mother was away working, was confirmed on Monday
to have the H5N1 virus, but was reported to be recovering.

The girl and the aunt both had contact with infected chickens in the
village. Fowl were still dying in the village when he visited it at the
weekend, said Charal Trinvuthipong, head of the Department of Disease Control.

International organizations are deeply worried about the disease, probably
carried across Asia by migrating water fowl that infected domesticated
birds, forcing the slaughter of tens of millions of fowl in an effort to
prevent its spread.

Thailand and Vietnam, the worst affected, have said several times they had
control of the epidemic. However, it broke out again in July, proving how
hard it is to stamp out the virus.

"The avian influenza epidemic in Asia is a crisis of global importance,"
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the world animal health
organization OIE said in a statement.

[At this point, evidence suggests human-to-human transmission in the above
discussed family cluster. Information available to date suggests the most
recent confirmed case (the mother of the 11-year-old girl who died), did
not have direct contact with ill avians, and furthermore the aunt who died
(the case confirmed in yesterday's reports), who did have a history of
contact with ill avians, had onset of illness greater than 2 weeks after
known avian contact, suggestively outside of the usual range of the
incubation period. In addition, her son had an influenza like illness and
is now recovering, with laboratory studies still pending.

As mentioned in the above newswires, there was suspicion of limited
human-to-human transmission in prior outbreaks involving avian influenza
activity. See prior postings Avian influenza, human - Netherlands (12)
20030425.1011, and, Influenza, human, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong) (11)
19971208.2449. In prior instances, human-to-human transmission was
suspected but was not sustained (see refs below). Active surveillance for
influenza-like illness in Thailand has been increased to country-wide
(previously it was limited to provinces with known avian influenza
activity). We await further information on the genetic analyses of the
H5N1 virus identified from these 2 current cases.
