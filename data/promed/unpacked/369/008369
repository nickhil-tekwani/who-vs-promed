["Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1 (SHV-1), a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the family Herpesviridae. The virus is generally handled in BSL-2 laboratories. The virus infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, of a variety of mammals (such as dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, foxes, minks, etc) except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural host, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks old, which die from encephalitis). In consequence, the pig is the only species able to survive a productive infection and therefore serves as the reservoir host. In pigs, the severity of clinical signs depends on the age of the pig, the route of infection, the virulence of the infecting strain and the immunological status of the animal. Young piglets are highly susceptible with mortality rates reaching 100 per cent during the 1st 2 weeks of age. These animals show hyperthermia and severe neurological disorders: trembling, incoordination, ataxia, nystagmus to opisthotonos and severe epileptiform-like seizures. When pigs are older than 2 months (grower-finisher pigs), the respiratory forms become predominant with hyperthermia, anorexia, mild to severe respiratory signs: rhinitis with sneezing and nasal discharge may progress to pneumonia. The frequency of secondary bacterial infections is high, depending on the health status of the infected herd. In this group of pigs, the morbidity can reach 100 per cent, but in cases of the absence of complicated secondary infections, mortality ranges from 1-2 per cent. Sows and boars primarily develop respiratory signs, but in pregnant sows, the virus can cross the placenta, infect and kill the fetuses inducing abortion, return to oestrus, stillborn fetuses. In the other susceptible species, the disease is fatal, the predominant sign being intense pruritus causing the animal to gnaw or scratch part of the body, usually head or hind quarters, until great tissue destruction is caused. For that reason, the disease was named in the past: mad-itch.

"Focal necrotic and encephalomyelitis lesions occur in the cerebrum, cerebellum, adrenals and other viscera such as lungs, liver or spleen. In fetuses or very young piglets, white spots on liver are pathognomonic of their infection by the virus. Intranuclear lesions are frequently found in several tissues.

"Aujeszky's disease is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries have successfully completed eradication programmes -- for example, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and many member states of the European Union.

"The disease is controlled by containment of infected herds and by the use of vaccines or removal of latently infected animals. Stamping out has been or is used in several countries usually when the infected farms are small or when the threat to neighbouring farms is very high in free countries". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.02_AUJESZKYS_DIS.pdf.
