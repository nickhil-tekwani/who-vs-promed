The Ministry of Emergency situations in Kazakhstan reported a foot &
mouth disease [FMD] outbreak in cattle in the Karaganda region. As
revealed on Thu [19 Apr 2007], 38 cattle have been found sick with
FMD in the village Kengir in the Karaganda region. The affected
cattle were kept in 14 private farmsteads, reported the press-service
of the Ministry of emergency situations.
At present, the sick animals are isolated while vaccination of
healthy animals is being carried out and disinfection barriers
established at the entrance to the village of Kengir, in line with
the relevant legislation. Three teams have been involved in the above measures.

[An FMD outbreak was last recorded in the Karaganda region of
Kazakhstan in 2001, when 130 head of cattle contracted the disease.
Kazakhstan borders Kyrghyzstan, where FMD outbreaks were recorded
during 2006. - Mod.NP]
[Official notification of the outbreak, including epidemiological
details on the affected animals and particularly the serotype of the
causative agent, is anticipated. The 2006 suspected outbreaks of FMD
in neighboring Kyrghyzstan remained unnotified to the OIE.

In the past, FMD was detected several times also among Kazakhstan's
wild ruminant species, the saigak antelope (_Saiga tatarika_). Two
populations of saigak, a species of commercial value, exist in
Kazakhstan: those belonging to the Ust-Yurt populations and those
belonging to the Volga-Ural populations. The size of the saigak
population in the recent decade has been maintained at 250 000 - 275
000. - Mod.AS]
