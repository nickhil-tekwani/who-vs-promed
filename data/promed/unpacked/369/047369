A cholera outbreak in Malawi has so far killed 9 people, health authorities
announced, as the government braced for a possible major outbreak after
torrential rains last week left 15 000 people homeless.
Habib Somanje, the ministry of health's controller of preventive health
services, said the country was prepared to handle 30 000 cases of cholera
this year, which has so far affected 8 of Malawi's 28 districts. Last year
1000 people died from cholera, the worst outbreak the country has
experienced. But the number of cases treated so far this year has fallen
sharply compared with the same period last year.
Only 400 cases of the waterborne infectious disease have so far been
registered following the onset of summer rains in September 2002, compared
with 3000 at this time last year. Somanje attributed this year's decline in
cholera cases to a nationwide awareness campaign.
The majority of Malawians do not have access to clean drinking water, and
half of the country's illnesses are conveyed by water.

New cholera case found in South Africa
--------------------------------------
A man with cholera symptoms died in South Africa on Sun, 12 Jan 2003,
possibly bringing the death toll from an outbreak in the OR [? - Mod.SH]
Tambo municipal area to 9, the Eastern Cape provincial health department
said. The 67 year old man has not yet officially been confirmed to have had
cholera, said spokesman Sizwe Kupelo.
He described the outbreak as "under control," the South African Press
Association reported on Monday. 3 people remained in hospital by Monday,
while 2 were being treated at a clinic. There has been a drop to nearly
zero of people visiting clinics with cholera symptoms, Kupelo said. For
this reason, temporary clinics set up in tents at some rural areas have
been removed.
Kupelo said the wife of the man who died was also ill. She developed
cholera symptoms on Thursday, but only visited a clinic on Monday. "This
indicates a need for our awareness campaign to be strengthened," he said.
Kupelo said Eastern Cape health MEC [? - Mod.SH] Bevan Goqwana was having a
meeting with all health district managers in the OR Tambo district to
discuss ways to stop the disease from spreading and stepping up the
awareness campaign.

Cholera campaign to target big hotels
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Kampala City Council (KCC) have directed food
dealers in the city including hotels, to access health fitness certificates
issued by the city authorities. The directive targets top hotels and small
food joints that serve the biggest section of people in Kampala.
The state minister for health in charge of general duties, Mike Mukula,
said this on Mon 13 Jan 2003 after meeting the Parliament social services
committee and city council division heads. "The ministry of health and KCC
have issued a directive to all food dealers to have a fitness certificate.
The directive should come into effect on 15 Feb 2003. We are giving them a
grace period that starts on 15 Jan 2003," Mukula said.
This directive follows one that targeted vendors selling home-made passion
fruit juice and water in polythene bags. The directive was issued after it
was discovered that food was a risk factor at the onset of the outbreak
reported on 25 Nov 2002.
Mukula warned that all food dealers who did not abide with the directive
would face closure. "If the city authorities fail to close down those who
fail to adhere to the directive, then the ministry will come in," he said.

decrease cholera

Cloth filter could cut cholera deaths
--------------------------------------
Simply filtering drinking water though cloth from old clothes can cut new
cholera cases in half, researchers have found. The technique was tested in
Bangladesh, where it could save many lives.
Scientists have long known that the bacteria that cause cholera live in a
mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationship with tiny aquatic organisms
called plankton. Researchers from the US National Science Foundation
decided to test the theory that filtering plankton out of drinking water
would also removed the cholera bacteria.
They found that an old sari cloth, folded at least 4 times, was as
successful as specially designed nylon filters at removing plankton from
water. The scientists then tested the effectiveness of both sari cloth and
nylon filters at preventing new cholera cases in Bangladesh villages over
an 18 month period. Villages trained to use sari cloth experienced about
half the historic average of new cholera cases. The nylon filter produced
marginally less impressive results.
The researchers say that not only does the use of old sari cloth and
similar fabrics worn in other parts of the world, appear to be an effective
way to combat cholera, the material is cheap and convenient to obtain. Lead
researcher Dr Rita Colwell told BBC News Online: "The method can save
thousands of lives during massive epidemics, particularly those of children
under the age of 5."
Dr Claire-Lise Chaignat, coordinator of the World Health Organization's
global taskforce on cholera control, said the technique sounded "very
promising". She said: "Cholera affects only the poorest of the poor, who
have hardly any access to safe water or proper sanitation. "A simple method
of cleansing water for these people would be very interesting."
The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences [the abstract of the article from the 14 Jan 2003 PNAS is shown
below. - Mod.LL]
Colwell RR, Huq A, Sirajul Islam M, et al. Reduction of cholera in
Bangladeshi villages by simple filtration
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0237386100v1>
Based on results of ecological studies demonstrating that Vibrio cholerae,
the etiological agent of epidemic cholera, is commensal to zooplankton,
notably copepods, a simple filtration procedure was developed whereby
zooplankton, most phytoplankton, and particulates >20 micrometers were
removed from water before use. Effective deployment of this filtration
procedure, from September 1999 through July 2002 in 65 villages of rural
Bangladesh, of which the total population for the entire study comprised
approximately 133 000 individuals, yielded a 48 per cent reduction in
cholera (P < 0.005) compared with the control.
