At the end of 2009, 6 food poisoning outbreaks caused by staphylococci
were reported in France. Soft cheese made from unpasteurized milk was
found to be the common source of the outbreaks. Staphylococcal
enterotoxin type E was identified and quantified in the cheese using
both official and confirmatory methods of the European Union Reference
Laboratory (EU-RL). To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of food
poisoning outbreaks caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin type E in
France.

Introduction
------------
Staphylococcal food poisoning is one of the most common food-borne
diseases worldwide (1) resulting from the ingestion of staphylococcal
enterotoxins preformed in food by enterotoxigenic strains of
coagulase-positive staphylococci, mainly _S. aureus_. As
staphylococcal enterotoxins are heat stable, they may be present in
food when _S. aureus_ are absent (2). Moreover, not all strains of _S.
aureus_ are enterotoxigenic. Therefore, a conclusive staphylococcal
food poisoning diagnosis is mainly based on the detection of
staphylococcal enterotoxins in food. To date, 21 staphylococcal
enterotoxins have been described: staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A
(SEA) to SElV all possess superantigenic activity whereas only some
(SEA to SEI, SER, SES and SET) have been proven to be emetic (3).
These toxins are produced by enterotoxigenic strains of
coagulase-positive staphylococci (mainly _S. aureus_) in food with
high protein content.

In October and November 2009, 6 household staphylococcal food
poisoning outbreaks were notified in 6 French metropolitan
administrative districts. During the investigation, which was carried
out by interviewing cases specifically focussing on food consumed, it
became clear that a soft cheese made from unpasteurized cow milk was
the likely common and single source of these outbreaks as all cases
had eaten the same cheese. Cheese samples were available from 6
outbreaks and the staphylococcal food poisoning diagnosis was
confirmed through (i) the high count of coagulase-positive
staphylococci, (ii) the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin E in
the incriminated cheese type and (iii) the detection of the see gene
in coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates from the suspected cheese
samples.

Methods
-------
Epidemiological data:
All the epidemiological data concerning these outbreaks (number of
cases, symptoms, location, type of potentially incriminated food) were
collected by interviews or questionnaires by the local health
authorities (DDASS). At the same time, the tracing of incriminated
food was performed by the local services of the French Ministry of
Food, Agriculture and Fishery.

Counts and characterization of coagulase-positive staphylococci strains:
Coagulase-positive staphylococci were counted in suspected cheese
samples by laboratories involved in food surveillance using the
standard method EN ISO 6888 part 2 as described in the relevant
European Union (EU) legislation (4). Coagulase-positive staphylococci
isolates were tested for enterotoxin genes by PCR targeting the _S.
aureus_ 23S rRNA gene and biotyped as described by Kerouanton, et al.
(5). The isolates were tested for sea-e, seg-j, ser and sep genes
using 2 multiplex PCR assays according to the procedures of the EU
Reference Laboratory (EU-RL) for coagulase-positive staphylococci. The
isolates were also typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
according to Kerouanton et al. (5).

Sample preparation and immunoenzymatic detection of staphylococcal
enterotoxins:
The detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin types A to E was performed
according to the EU-RL screening method for coagulase-positive
staphylococci (6). This method consists of an extraction step followed
by dialysis concentration and an immuno-enzymatic detection using the
Vidas SET2 kit (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Staphylococcal
enterotoxins were quantified according to the EU-RL confirmatory
method which uses a quantitative indirect sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in order to separate and quantify
staphylococcal enterotoxins type A to E (6).

Results
-------
Epidemiological information:
Between 29 Oct 2009 and 14 Nov 2009, 6 outbreaks comprising 23 cases
with gastrointestinal symptoms were reported through the network for
mandatory notification of food-borne outbreaks, in 6 French districts
(Figure 1, [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

A total of 23 persons of 26 persons who had consumed cheese (attack
rate 88.5 percent) suffered from nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps
and diarrhea, in some cases associated with fever. The period between
the ingestion of the cheese and the onset of symptoms ranged from 1
hour 15 minutes to 8 hours. The investigation, performed by the
Directorate General for Food of the Ministry of Agriculture using
interviews and/or questionnaires, showed that a soft cheese made from
unpasteurized cow milk distributed in supermarkets was the most likely
source of food poisoning. 3 cheese batches (I, II and III), produced
during weeks 40 and 41 (2009) by the same producer and coming from a
single milk storage tank, were involved in the six outbreaks (Table 1
[for table, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

Counts and characterization of coagulase-positive staphylococci strains:
More than 150 000 colony-forming units (CFU) of coagulase-positive
staphylococci/g were isolated from cheese samples from the 3 batches
involved in the outbreaks. No cheese samples were available for
outbreaks 4 and 5. No coagulase-positive staphylococci could be
detected in the cheese sample from outbreak 6 as this cheese had been
heated before consumption. 5 to 10 coagulase-positive staphylococci
isolates from each batch were analyzed (total number n=20) and
characterized. The isolates were all typed as _S. aureus_ by a
species-specific 23S rRNA-targeted PCR test. All were found to carry
the see gene and none of the other se genes tested. 4 isolates were
further characterized. They harbored a non-host specific biotype
profile, K-beta-CV:C, named NHS5 at the EU-RL, and showed the same
PFGE pattern which was distinct from all other PFGE patterns available
in the EU-RL database, including the pattern from the reference
SEE-producing strain, FRI 326 (data not shown).

Using immunoassays to detect staphylococcal enterotoxins in samples:
The EU-RL screening method using the qualitative and combined Vidas
SET2 test detected SEA to SEE in the 3 cheese batches involved in the
outbreaks. Moreover, the EU-RL confirmatory method detected and
quantified SEE amounts ranging from 0.36 to higher than 1.14 ng/g,
including the cheese sample from outbreak six where coagulase-positive
staphylococci could not be detected.

Discussion
----------
As unpasteurized cow milk cheese was the common and single food
associated with all outbreaks according to the epidemiological
investigation, they were obviously incriminated in the food poisonings
described here. Moreover, the etiological agent could be determined
because of (i) the symptoms of the cases, (ii) the high number of
coagulase-positive staphylococci recovered from remains of cheese
incriminated in the outbreak and (iii) the amounts of staphylococcal
enterotoxins recovered from cheese samples. In outbreak number 6, the
cheese had been cooked before consumption, explaining why no
coagulase-positive staphylococci were recovered from this sample.
Indeed, the coagulase-positive staphylococci were killed by the heat
treatment whereas the staphylococcal enterotoxins, known to be heat
resistant, remained active to cause a food poisoning outbreak and were
actually detected in this sample.

The only type of staphylococcal enterotoxin detected in all food
samples was SEE. This finding was reinforced by the fact that all
tested coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates were found to carry a
single se gene, 'see'. This is the 1st staphylococcal food poisoning
outbreak where SEE has been confirmed as the causative agent in France.

The involvement of SEE seems to be also rare in other countries: to
our knowledge, this staphylococcal enterotoxin has been associated
with only a few outbreaks. They were reported between 1960 and 1971 in
the USA (7) and UK (8) and a single case was analyzed later on in the
UK (9). Otherwise, the most frequently staphylococcal enterotoxin type
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks worldwide is SEA,
associated or not with other staphylococcal enterotoxins (2). This is
in agreement with the results observed by Kerouanton, et al (4)
showing that SEA was the most frequently found (69.7 percent) among 31
French staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks analyzed between 1981
and 2002; out of 178 coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates tested
for se genes, the most frequent gene was sea followed by sed, seg, sei
and seh. The genes seb and sec were less frequent, and see gene was
not found.

Moreover, the present study appears to be the 1st one where SEE was
not only detected but also quantified in the food vehicle. In outbreak
number 6, SEE amount found in cheese sample was equal to 0.45 ng/g.
Considering that symptomatic persons ingested a portion of about 200 g
(data obtained from the cases interviewed in outbreak number 6), the
total amount of ingested SEE could be estimated to 90 ng. This dose is
in accordance to those estimated in previous staphylococcal food
poisoning outbreaks where SEA and/or SEA/SEH were confirmed as the
causative agents (1).

Considering that the coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates from
the contaminated cheese samples showed the same se gene pattern, the
same NHS5 biotype, the same PFGE profile and also the same antibiogram
(data not shown), it can be considered that the same _S. aureus_
strain involved in the 6 outbreaks came from the same origin. However,
due to the non host-specific biotype detected, it was not possible to
determine whether the contamination was from human, bovine or
environmental source. In a previous French study (10), this NHS5
biotype was found in 8.5 percent of 2021 _S. aureus_ isolates from 5
types of raw milk cheeses; it was at the 4th rank after bovine-, NHS4-
and NHS3-biotypes among the 20 distinct biotype profiles observed,
indicating that its presence is not unusual in this food category.

Finally, this study illustrates that the French national surveillance
system is able to detect rare events. The staphylococcal food
poisoning outbreaks linked to SEE ingestion described here were
quickly identified through a close collaboration between the Health
Emergency Mission, the National institute for public health
surveillance and the EU-RL with laboratories involved in food
surveillance for coagulase-positive staphylococci and staphylococcal
enterotoxins and the good cooperation of all parties involved. The
rapid recall of contaminated cheese batches by the French Ministry of
Food, Agriculture and Fishery prevented further cases. Due to the
distribution across Europe of the incriminated type of cheese, the EU
Member States were informed by the Rapid Alert System for Food and
Feed (RASFF).
