[Re Mod.JW's comment "the sarin attack in Tokyo was preceded by at
least one trial, and the typhoid incident in Oregon years ago
appeared to be a trial run" -- see ref. above
The organism involved in the 1984 Rajneeshee use of
biological agents was _Salmonella typhimurium_, not _S. typhi_.

[I stand corrected. The disease caused in approx. 1000 people was
salmonellosis, not typhoid - Mod.JW
