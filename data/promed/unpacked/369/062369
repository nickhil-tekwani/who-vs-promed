FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, BOVINE - BOLIVIA

Three foci of FMD were confirmed [the source doesn't say by whom] on 29 Jan
2007 in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, across the border from the
states of Mato Grosso (MT) & Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) in Brazil [see map URL
below]. These are the 1st outbreaks in Bolivia in 3.5 years [see ProMED
refs. below].
Brazil immediately banned the importation from Bolivia of all meat, meat
products and canned meat, but there is an illegal cross-border trade that
is difficult to control, that could bring in the disease.
On 31 Jan 2007 at a meeting of the World Animal Health Organization (OIE)
in Paris, Brazil was hoping to recover the status of "Areas free of FMD
with vaccination" for the 2 states, lost in 2005 when outbreaks occurred in
MT & Parana states (see ProMED refs. below).
