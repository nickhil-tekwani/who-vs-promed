The Pocomoke River's ecology may make it particularly vulnerable to
Pfiesteria piscicida. The Pocomoke has been the site of recent fish kills.
Robert Magnien, who leads Maryland's efforts to monitor the health of the
Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, hypothesizes, according to this story,
that as the Pocomoke changes from a deep, narrow waterway to one that is
shallow and broad, it creates
an environment that attracts fish and nurtures _Pfiesteria piscicida_.
JoAnn Burkholder, a North Carolina State University researcher who first
dentified the microorganism was quoted as saying, "The set of circumstances
he's describing fits really well with our understanding of Pfiesteria's
biology and ecology." [The Nuese River in North Carolina, which also is a
site of fish kills related to Pfiesteria, becomes similarly broad and
relatively shallow as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean. I can personally
attest to the slow flow rate of the river at Camps Seafarer and Seagull,
where children and slow maturing adults attend summer camps. The flow
characteristics of the river may just be the most important factor in the
epidemiology of _Pfiesteria piscicida_. - Mod. pc]
