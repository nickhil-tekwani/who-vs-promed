Plague was confirmed this week in an Elmore county child. The child is recovering after receiving antimicrobial treatment. "Plague is spread to humans through a bite from an infected flea. People can decrease their risk by treating their pets for fleas and avoiding contact with wildlife," said Sarah Correll, DVM, Central District Health Department epidemiologist. "Wear insect repellant, long pants, and socks when visiting plague affected areas."

It is not known whether the child was exposed to plague in Idaho or during a recent trip to Oregon. Plague has historically been found in wildlife in both states. Since 1990, 8 human cases were confirmed in Oregon and 2 were confirmed in Idaho.

Plague in humans is rare, but occurs naturally in some rodent populations, including ground squirrels in Idaho. Fleas spread the disease between animals. The disease can also be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or their fleas. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare and this case was not a risk to others.

Symptoms of plague usually occur within 2 to 6 days of exposure and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is also a painful swelling of the lymph node [called a bubo - Mod.LL] in the groin, armpit, or neck. Plague signs in cats and dogs include fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw of pets. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can greatly reduce the risk of death in people and pets.

Plague was identified in 2015 and 2016 in ground squirrels in both Elmore and south Ada counties. However, this season [2018], no ground squirrel die offs or unusual behavior has been reported by state wildlife officials.

[The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case are not stated in the report but it is likely to have been bubonic plague. Of late, 2015 was a "banner year" for _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA with 15 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.

The following was extracted from: Prentice MB, Rahalison L. Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207, with the citations removed:

"Some plague cases (10-25 per cent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteremia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteremia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites."

Elmore county, Idaho which was named after the Ida Elmore mines, producer of silver and gold in the 1860s is located south of Boise and in the southwestern part of the state. Its location can be found on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmore_County,_Idaho. - Mod.LL
