Two recent cases of infection in children in Grey Bruce have been
linked to raw milk products, public health officials said yesterday,
18 Mar 2007.
A 2-year-old was taken to hospital with yersiniosis, a
gastrointestinal infection, after drinking raw milk on her family
farm, according to a statement from Hazel Lynn, the local medical
health officer.
Another infant was confirmed to have listeriosis, an infection that
causes flu-like symptoms, which seems to have come from raw milk
cheese consumed by the baby's mother, Dr. Lynn said, adding that the
infant seems to be recovering.
Women with newborns should not consume raw milk or non-pasteurized
dairy products in order to avoid infecting their babies, Dr. Lynn said.

[The association of listeriosis with unpasteurized cheese is well
known. The infection has also been reported to cause infection from
pasteurized milk. A well-reported example of this is an outbreak of
45 cases of listeriosis from contaminated pasteurized chocolate milk
(1). The report highlights, even with pasteurized milk, that
- dairies should monitor final products for spoilage and for
pathogens, including _Listeria monocytogenes_;
- expiration dates should be based on these tests;
- high standards of plant sanitation must be maintained; and
- consumers should always store their milk at 4 deg C (39.2 deg F) or
less and should consume the products before their expiration dates.
Indeed, since _L. monocytogenes_ may well contaminate milk
exogenously, other studies have underscored (for example, reference
2) the importance of good quality silage [fermented, high-moisture
forage to be fed to cattle and sheep. - CopyEd.MJ], good milking
techniques, and barn hygiene in diminishing the risks of
contamination of raw milk with _L. monocytogenes_.
The other pathogen, probably _Yersinia enterocolitica_ (the species
is not mentioned), parallels _L. monocytogenes_ in its ability to
exogenously contaminate raw milk. Both, in addition, are able to
replicate at refrigerator temperatures and have contaminated
non-pasteurized as well as pasteurized milk (3, 4). An earlier
outbreak of yersiniosis was associated with contaminated chocolate
milk similar to the listeriosis outbreak already cited. (5).
Contamination of raw milk clearly also occurs including these 2
pathogens (6) and pasteurization should substantially decrease the
risk of transmission. It is important to note that pasteurized milk
is not sterile and can possibly contain these and/or other pathogens,
and that post-pasteurization contamination can occur. Consumers
should follow the guidelines about storage at 4 deg C (39.2 deg F) or
less and use prior to expiration date.
