Manitoba woman dies from hantavirus
-------------------------------
Hantavirus, a rare illness spread by deer mice, has claimed its first
Manitoba victim.
After five days of flu-like symptoms, a 27-year-old woman from southwestern
Manitoba checked into the Brandon General Hospital on 5 Jul 1999. She had
difficulty breathing. Within 6 hours, she died. Hantavirus was confirmed as
the cause of her death on 9 Jul 1999.
Susan Roberecki, acting chief medical officer of health for Manitoba, said
she does not yet know how the woman contracted the disease. The department
will spend the next couple of weeks tracing the woman's activities to find
out where and how she may have come into contact with the disease. They will
trap mice in the area to see whether they carry hantavirus.
Elise Weiss, medical officer of health for Brandon, said the woman's family
and friends so far do not appear to have any symptoms of the disease.
Roberecki said hantavirus is not contagious, and cannot be spread from pets
to livestock.
"It's not a panic situation," said Roberecki. "This has been around for a
long time. This is a rare disease." However, she said people who live or
work in places where there are mice should be careful and wear protective
clothing and masks when cleaning up
rodent urine, feces or nests.
People who develop flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, muscle aches and shortness of breath within 6 weeks of being
exposed to mice droppings may want to see a doctor.
Hantavirus infection was first identified in the southern United States in
1993. Since 1994, 32 cases have been confirmed in Canada. Twelve of those
people died. Most of the cases have been in Alberta.
