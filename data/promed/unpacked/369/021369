On the Europa "Midday Express Web site at:
<http://europa.eu.int/en/comm/spp/me/midday.html>
where the EU Commission midday briefings are posted daily, today's briefing
is rather more informative than the Reuters story on FSNet and
significantly it does not use the word "safe".
The EU Commission briefing reads as follows:
Commission rejects criticisms of the decision on the UK Date Based Export
Scheme
Reacting to certain criticisms regarding the decision on the Date Based
Export Scheme the European Commission stressed the sound scientific basis
for this decision and totally rejected suggestions that the decision was
motivated by political or economic considerations. This scheme has been
scrutinised very carefully by the Scientific Steering Committee who have
delivered two opinions on the subject, firstly in December 1997 and finally
in February 1998. The modifications to the scheme suggested by the
Scientists in December 1997 were fully introduced and the final proposal
meets all of the requirements and recommendations of their opinion of
February 1998 which were put forward as the approach which would give
maximum guarantees in relation to the protection of human and animal
health.
The Commission considers it necessary to repeat the main elements of the
scheme which guarantees that no BSE infected meat can be exported ie : this
scheme will apply only to deboned meat and meat products obtained from
animals born after the 1 August 1996 (the date on which it is considered
that the meat-and-bone meal ban in the UK was fully effective) and which
are over six months and under thirty months of age.
The scheme also includes the slaughter and destruction of offspring from
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) infected animals and verification
that the dam of the animal concerned has lived for at least six months
after birth and not developed BSE. Strict rules on the identification and
traceability of animals and meat are also included. It should be stressed
that meat from animals over thirty months of age will continue to be
excluded from all markets including the domestic UK market.
Furthermore it is important to point out that no UK beef can be exported
until such time as the Commission has been satisfied on the basis of an
inspection that all aspects of the scheme are being completely applied.
Note: the two opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee are available
on the internet site:
