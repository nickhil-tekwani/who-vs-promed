New case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever found in DR Congo
-----------------------------------------------------
A new case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been confirmed in northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo, 4 months after the end of the country's last outbreak.

The National Institute of Biomedical Research said on Saturday [23 Apr 2022] that a 31-year-old male was detected in Mbandaka city, the capital of Congo's Equateur province.

The patient's symptoms began on [5 Apr 2022], but he did not seek treatment for more than a week. He was admitted to an Ebola treatment centre on [21 Apr 2022] and died later that day [21 Apr 2022], the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.

"Time is not on our side," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.

"The disease has had a 2-week head start and we are now playing catch-up," Moeti said.

The WHO said that efforts to contain the disease are already under way in Mbandaka -- a crowded trading hub on the banks of the Congo River where people live in close proximity. The city has road, water and air links to the capital Kinshasa.

Congo has seen 13 previous outbreaks of Ebola, and Mbandaka has contended with 2 -- in 2018 and 2020.

The Ebola outbreak in 2018-2020, in the east of the country, killed nearly 2300 people, the 2nd-highest toll recorded in the history of the hemorrhagic fever.

The last outbreak, also in the east of the country, infected 11 people between [October and December 2021] and killed 6 of them.

["There have been 14 Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1976. The new outbreak is the 6th one since 2018 -- the most frequent occurrence in the country's Ebola history, according to the UN health agency.

"Previous outbreaks in Equateur Province were in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 recorded cases, respectively.

"Community vaccination set to kick-off
-------------------------------------
"WHO informed that the deceased patient received a safe and dignified burial, which involves modifying traditional funeral ceremonies to minimize the risk of contagious fluids infecting attendees.

"Health authorities are also identifying contacts to monitor their health and disinfected the health facility where the patient was treated.

"Moreover, plans to kick off vaccination in the coming days are underway with stockpiles of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine already available in the cities of Goma and Kinshasa.

""Vaccines will be sent to Mbandaka and administered through 'ring vaccination strategy -- where contacts and contacts of contacts are vaccinated to curb the spread of the virus and protect lives", WHO highlighted.

""Many people in Mbandaka are already vaccinated against Ebola, which should help reduce the impact of the disease," added Dr. Moeti. "All those who were vaccinated during the 2020 outbreak will be revaccinated."

"Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. Case fatality rates have varied from 25%-90% in past outbreaks." (from UN News 23 Apr 2022, https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1116762)

The DRC has had more Ebola outbreaks than any other country since the virus was first discovered near the Ebola River in the DRC's northern region in 1976. For this reason, the country should have the expertise and facilities to handle a new outbreak. The vaccine -- rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine -- is highly effective and already available in Goma and Kinshasa. Nonetheless, the 2-week delay before the patient sought help at a treatment center will complicate containment of the virus, especially considering Mbandaka city is a crowded hub on the banks of the Congo river. - Mod.LK
