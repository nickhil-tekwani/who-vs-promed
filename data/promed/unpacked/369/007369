Thirteen bison on a farm in northeastern British Columbia died of naturally acquired anthrax, a bacteria that the Agriculture Ministry says can remain dormant in certain soil conditions for many years. The animals are thought to have contracted the disease from exposure to dormant anthrax spores in the soil of a feeding site on a farm near Fort St. John, the ministry said in a statement.

"This is the 1st documented case of anthrax in livestock in BC," said Jane Pritchard, the province's chief veterinary officer. "It was quite shocking when we actually got the 1st test that suggested it was anthrax. We repeated that twice more because it's that unusual. We basically did every test we possibly could do to try and rule it out until we had access to the molecular test."

The animals began dying last week [week of 15 Oct 2018], samples were sent to the lab on Friday [19 Oct 2018], and the diagnosis was made Monday [22 Oct 2018], she said.

The disease has been reported in the Peace River region of Alberta, and that same soil goes right across the border into BC, Pritchard added. "The spore of the bacteria of this disease has a preference for certain soil conditions, and those are the conditions that were present in British Columbia in this area." A disturbance in the soil or unusual weather conditions could have brought the spores up to the surface, causing the animals to be exposed to them, she said.

She said the bison corpses were placed on a brush pile and burned.

The ministry statement said the site is no longer being used, and the farm has reported no other losses in its remaining herd of 150 animals. A vaccine for anthrax for livestock is available, and the ministry said exposed animals can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. It said anthrax can affect humans, although it's very rare, and there is no indication that anyone in contact with these animals has been infected.

[Fort St. John is in northeast British Columbia (BC), north of Dawson Creek, and right on the border with northern Alberta (see http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/bilingual/bc_new.pdf).

Anthrax, whether in livestock or wildlife, has not been seen in BC before. This is a singular event. Depending on the farm facilities, it should be possible to vaccinate the remaining 150 animals. This is late October [2018], well past the 1st frost, in an area not dense with livestock. The account says "bison," and as it is so far north, these might be wood bison, not plains bison. While some bison might have migrated west out of Alberta, my 1st speculation, in the present general absence of Canadian anthrax, is that, as these are farmed animals, they might have been exposed to purchased hay that was cut on a contaminated pasture. This is not the time of year to get anthrax from grazing, maybe in Texas, but not in northern BC and from an undocumented presumed-contaminated site if the disease has not been seen in BC before. Genomic analysis should give a fair indication of where the infection came from, presumably in Alberta. I look forward to what my informed and experienced Canadian veterinary colleagues have to say on this event.

Canada has gone really quiet on reports of anthrax outbreaks. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] announced in August 2012 that it will no longer investigate or quarantine anthrax-infected premises, collect or submit samples for testing, or even perform anthrax testing, as of Mon 1 Apr 2013. The Canadian government initiated subsidy payments of some CAD 500 [USD 490] each in the early 1960s to farmers reporting outbreaks of livestock anthrax. And they also provided some 3 years of herd vaccinations. This proactive activity resulted in the immediate public appreciation of anthrax across the prairies, where it had been lurking in plain sight since the 1920s. It has been very successful, and one of the benefits has been the emergence of a uniform response. But latterly, CFIA found that the ranchers were not bothering to vaccinate their herds annually, but instead were waiting until there was an outbreak and then would use the federal funding. This did little to reduce the incidence.

I hold the Canadian federal and provincial veterinary services in high regard, but I must admit to have been holding my breath to see how the coming anthrax seasons turn out. Frankly, there is an enzootic risk across the prairies, especially in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and outbreaks are best prevented by aggressively advising the ranchers to vaccinate their stock each spring, especially on ranches that have had recent outbreaks or whose neighbours were affected. - Mod.MHJ
