A medical check at the Malad cattle pound [area where unclaimed cattle are
kept. - Mod.JW] yesterday revealed that 18 of the 79 animals there were
suffering from the highly contagious foot & mouth disease (FMD).
The revelation has put the BMC [probably Bombay Municipal Corporation] health
administration and the state animal husbandry department on high alert.
A group of 11 medical staffers, summoned by the BMC, reported that at least 8
animals (6 cows and 2 buffaloes) have an advanced form of FMD.
"They have developed maggots in their legs and ulcers in the mouth. 10 others
have developed ulcers in their mouth -- a symptom of the 1st stage of FMD,"
said Dr RR Kokane. Other vets whom Mid-day spoke to said it was very rare that
such a large incidence of the viral infection had gone undetected for so long.
The doctors cautioned that the disease would spread quickly among other
animals if immediate measures were not taken to treat the cattle. "Infected
animals must be isolated and treated immediately. Unaffected cattle must be
vaccinated with anti-FMD vaccines," said Dr Ashish Sutar.
"Cattle that have maggots in their legs must be treated with penicillin and
potassium permanganate and anti-maggot oil. The dressing should be changed
everyday," added Sutar.
The BMC is taking the doctors' advice seriously. Joint executive health
officer of the BMC Dr A.S. Patkar said a medical team would be revisiting the
cattle pound over the next 2 days to vaccinate and treat all animals.
"The animals at the pound will be quarantined," said BMC's executive health
officer Dr JV Telang.
BMC sources said unhygienic conditions at the shelter and lack of food were
reasons for the spread of FMD. Bhavin Gahtani of NGO Karuna Parivar complained
that the BMC was neglecting animals at the cattle pound and should hand them
over to NGOs for maintenance.

[ProMED did not post a single one of those 2004 outbreaks, since FMD is
endemic in India. However, this report may serve as a reminder to our readers
of the disastrous situation of FMD in India. - Mod.JW]
