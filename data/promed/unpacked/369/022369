A rabid cat has sent a woman and 4 of her neighbours to hospital in
the Bulgarian town of Novi Iskar. The [animal] bit its owner on Sat
[17 Feb 2007], and her husband quickly killed it, [but didn't take
the corpse to health authorities for testing, until 2 days later.]
Tests showed that the cat was rabid and the town is now under high
alert. People are worried that the cat may have infected children or
any of the neighbours' pets it came in contact with.
Authorities in the town have already stocked a large quantity of
anti-rabies vaccine, fearing more cases may [appear].

[Domestic cats are more often associated with human rabies than
generally supposed, being less likely to have been vaccinated against
rabies virus infection. Travellers to Bulgaria should be aware of
this risk of casual contact with domestic animals.
