Another suspected rabies victim in Tabanan Regency
--------------------------------------------------
A 4th suspected rabies victim from Tabanan regency died in Sanglah
Hospital on Wednesday [23 Sep 2009] a day after being admitted with
advanced symptoms of the killer disease. He was a 78-year-old man
from Banjar Biaung, Penebel District, who was bitten on the finger by
his neighbour's dog about 2 months ago. He was transferred from
Tabanan hospital on Tuesday [22 Sep 2009] and admitted to the
isolation ward. He died at 5:15 a.m. on Wednesday. The case is the
1st in the Penebel district of Tabanan regency, indicating that the
disease is still spreading. Tabanan's 3 earlier fatalities, 2 women
and a man, were from the Tabanan and Kedri districts.

Sanglah hospital's rabies treatment team leader Dr. Ken Wirasandhi
said the disease had appeared to be too advanced in the latest
patient, who was already exhibiting anxiety and other phobic symptoms
for the anti-rabies vaccine to be effective. All the hospital could
do was to treat him for his symptoms. The results of laboratory tests
were expected to confirm he died of rabies.

The man's 49-year-old son said his father's dog bite wound had been
cleaned when he was bitten in the middle of the night and he had
received further treatment at a health clinic the next day. "After
the wound healed there were no complaints whatsoever," said Sutantra.
But last weekend he became fevered and dizzy and was taken to the
Penebel health clinic, which referred him to Tabanan hospital. He was
admitted to Sanglah on Tuesday [22 Sep 2009]. Dr. Wirasandhi said it
was unlikely he had been given any anti-rabies vaccinations because
he was bitten before rabies vaccine was available in Tabanan.

The man was the 4th person from Tabanan [Regency] suspected to have
died from rabies since the disease broke out in south Bali in
September last year [2008], after a 10-year absence. The others were
a man, 55, and a woman, 24, from Buahan village, Tabanan, and a
woman, 47, from Banjar Pande, Kediri.

The latest death brings to 9 the number of known fatalities from
rabies. There were several other deaths in the Ungasan area of Bukit
last year before authorities confirmed rabies had re-emerged in Bali.

[2] vaccine shortage
Date: Fri 25 Sep 2009

Supplies of rabies vaccine reach critical levels
------------------------------------------------
The stock of rabies vaccine (VAR) at the island's largest hospital
RSUP Sanglah reached critical levels on Thursday [24 Sep 2009],
reported a hospital official. "As of Thursday morning, the remaining
stock is only 100 dosages of VAR," said Ken Wirasandhi, the head of
the hospital's rabies mitigation team.

The hospital itself is the island's primary medical referral facility
for people affected by the rabies epidemic. Ken expressed his concern
that the remaining stock would only last for one day. "On average, we
need 150 dosages of VAR per day," he added. Later in the day the
hospital issued a new policy [statement] asking the attending
physicians to only provide the VAR to patients that had been bitten
by dogs in recent days. The policy was apparently an effort to
conserve the supplies of the vaccine.

Ken revealed the hospital had requested for an additional supply of
VAR from the central health authority before Lebaran. "Unfortunately
there has been a delay in transporting the additional stock to Bali,"
he said, adding the roads from Jakarta to Bali had been jammed with
people traveling for the long holiday, which had hampered the
delivery of the much needed vaccine.

An increase demand for the vaccine, he stressed, had also played a
major role in depleting the stock. In the last 30 days, the hopital
has experienced a surge in the number of people requesting VAR
injections. The surge was triggered by the deaths of suspected rabies
patients in Tabanan, a regency that was previously free from the
rabies epidemic. "Many Tabanan residents, who couldn't get the VAR in
the local medical facilities have come to Sanglah to get the
inoculation," he said. "Prior to the suspected rabies related deaths
in Tabanaan, the demand for VAR was around 50 dosages per day. After
the deaths, the demand rose to 150 dosages per day, he said.

[The island of Bali is divided into 8 regencies (Badung, Gianyar,
Tabanan, Bangli, Karangasem, Jembrana, Buleleng, and Klungkung, and
one municipal city (Denpasar); see
<http://www.2indonesia.com/regency.html>. 3 of these, Badung,
Denpasar and Tabanan, are adjacent and must now be considered
confirmed or probable rabies epidemic areas. Little progress appears
to have been made in containing the outbreak. The case described
above appears to be the 4th human case of suspected rabies in Tabanan
Regency. Official confirmation of the diagnoses in all 4 cases is
awaited. The situation regarding the control and treatment of rabies
virus infection in the island of Bali remains dire. Travellers
intending to visit the Island of Bali should seek advice on how best
to protect themselves before embarking on their journey.

Merritt Clifton has appended the following comment which relates to
the above press reports. "I was notified at 7:21:18 a.m. Malay
Peninsula Standard Time, on Sat 26 Sep 2009, that Sanglah Hospital
had completely exhausted its stock of VAR. The circumstances leading
to running out of VAR are described in the press reports in the Bali
Times and the Jakarta post.

"The frequency of administration of post-exposure rabies vaccination
in rabies-endemic parts of India is about 1 per 66 humans per year.
My personal dog censusing in various parts of India and Bali
indicates that the number of dogs in Bali relative to humans is
probably slightly lower [than in India], and is certainly not higher.
Based on these findings, the Bali human population of 3 151 000
should experience about 47 824 bites per year that require
post-exposure vaccination. The Bali rate of administration of
post-exposure vaccination however, appears to be about 15 percent
higher than my projection, even though human rabies deaths are
occurring before victims, for whatever reason, are not receiving VAR.

"What this signifies to me is that the Bali dogs are biting at an
abnormally high frequency. This in turn may be an indication that
rabies is becoming endemic to the populated part of the island."
