The Georgia Aquarium said Sunday [18 Apr 2021] its Asian small-clawed otters tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The aquarium said the otters are "doing well" and expected to make a full recovery.

The Georgia Aquarium said in a statement that officials believe the disease was transmitted to the otters by an asymptomatic staff member, despite health and safety protocols in place.

Aquarium officials said the otters began exhibiting mild respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny noses, and mild lethargy. Some even had a cough.

Aquarium staff removed the otters from the exhibit. Georgia Aquarium animal health and care teams are currently caring for them.

The risk of animal-to-human transmission is incredibly rare, the statement said, and the Asian small-clawed otters at the aquarium do not have direct contact with guests.

Georgia Aquarium is currently open to the public with limited attendance. All guests are required to wear masks and consent to a contactless temperature screening. Admission is staggered in 30-minute timeslots.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in several carnivores of 3 families (Order Carnivora), canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, pumas/cougars, and snow leopards), and mustelids (ferrets and mink, and now Asian small-clawed otters, _Aonyx cinereus_).

While ferrets and mink belong in the Mustelinae subfamily, otters are in the Lutrinae branch of the mustelid family. The otter subfamily consists of 13 species that are all semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. This group of cases represents the 1st report of COVID-19 in an otter species. - Mod.PMB
