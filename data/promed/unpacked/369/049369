Measles outbreak in Rybinsk
-----------------------
Measles had not been diagnosed in the Rybinsk region [Yaroslav Oblast] for more than 15 years, until 27 Mar 2012 when 9 cases of measles, 3 of them children were diagnosed. An analysis of the contacts of these patients revealed 30 foci of infection embracing family, workplace and place of residence. It was estimated that around 700 people may have been exposed to infection. The Rybinsk city authorities have responded by enhanced surveillance of measles vaccination requiring mandatory vaccination of health workers, teachers, and employees in trade and services. Heads of schools and d hospitals are required to contact parents who previously declined to have their children vaccinated, and to offer vaccination.

Measles on Merseyside: Outbreak 'largest since MMR introduced'
------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of measles on Merseyside is the largest in the North West since the MMR vaccine was introduced, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has said. There are now 113 confirmed cases of the illness and another 43 cases are being looked at. Twenty-eight people needed hospital in-patient treatment and 3 of these, 2 adults and a child, were extremely ill but have now recovered.

The HPA is urging parents to ensure children are fully vaccinated. Two doses of the MMR vaccine give protection against measles, mumps and rubella. The HPA declared an outbreak of the illness last month [February] after 6 people needed hospital treatment. It said most cases were in children who had not been given the MMR vaccine -- which was introduced in 1988 -- and babies and toddlers too young to be vaccinated.

Approximately 29 of the confirmed cases are in teenagers and young adults who were not vaccinated as children and 27 cases are in children under the age of 13 months who were too young to be vaccinated.

Dr Roberto Vivancos, a specialist with the HPA's Cheshire and Merseyside Health Protection Unit, said: "Measles is highly infectious and anyone who has not previously been vaccinated is at risk when it gets into a community, as it has done here. In this outbreak we have seen measles spreading amongst unvaccinated children, teenagers and young adults and affecting infants and toddlers who are too young to be vaccinated. Our advice to teenagers and young adults is to arrange vaccination now. Speak to your family doctor. It's not too late. Our advice to parents is, arrange to have your children vaccinated regardless of their ages. If you are not sure if they have been immunised in the past, check with your family doctor."

Kiruhura 19th district to file measles cases
------------------------------------
At least one person has been confirmed dead and 38 others hospitalised following an outbreak of measles in Kiruhura, the district health officials have said. The District Health Officer, Dr Ivan Kaggwa, said they received reports of the outbreak last week when one child had already died of the disease and they later ascertained that other 38 are affected.

He said measles has hit Kanyaryeru and Kinoni sub-counties in Nyabushozi County. The dead child was from Rwaburondo Village in Kinoni. Dr Kaggwa said in Kinoni, they have registered 30 cases, 6 cases in Kanoni and 2 in Kanyaryeru.

"We have taken the blood samples of these children to the Entebbe Virus Centre for testing but as a medical doctor, the signs tell me this is measles so we are doing all the best we can to see this disease does not spread further," Dr Kaggwa said. District officials suspect that the outbreak could be as a result of new immigrants in Rwoburondo in Kinoni Sub-county, who could have come with unimmunised children.

"In July last year [2011], more than 50 families were resettled in Rwoburondo Village in Kinoni where the epidemic has originated from. We suspect that these people had not immunised their children and this could be the origin of the disease," a source in the district, who did not want to be mentioned because it is not authorised to speak to the press, said.

Dr Kaggwa said they have routine immunisation at 46 centres in the district and that a measles case was last reported in the district in 2009. He added that the affected children are being treated in their homes to avoid further spread of the disease. Dr Kaggwa said they are going to seek permission from the Ministry of Health to carry out massive immunisation in the district before next month when there will be a national mass immunisation.

Measles outbreak in Yemen
-----------------------
More than 150 children in Yemen under the age of 5 years have died from measles virus infection since the middle of 2011, the United Nations said Thursday [29 Mar 2012]. "A total of 3800 new measles cases were reported between January 2011 and early March 2012," according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA]. "If left unchecked, the epidemic could infect an estimated 30 000 children and cause 5000 deaths per year."

The UN Central Emergency Response Fund authorized USD 5 million for an immunization program. Of that, the agency said, USD 2.6 million will come from the World Health Organization, and USD 2.4 will be budgeted by the UN Children's Fund [UNICEF]. "The steep increase in measles incidents over the last 3 and a half months is due to the decline in immunization coverage and disruption in access to basic social services in most parts of the country during the civil unrest," OCHA said earlier this month. "Mortality due to measles is already very high and will increase further, especially if compounded with a rise in acute watery diarrhea and increasing rates of malnutrition."

Many families in Yemen are on the run from the nation's internal warfare, the UN said. Among the dangers in Yemen, the UN said, are "car bombs and the use of cars in suicide attacks, numerous incidents of gunfire in Sana'a and Aden, assassinations and military operations, with many deaths and injuries. There is also an increase in the rhetoric of threats. Following the recent election of a new president, many actors are actively positioning for strength and political influence."

Measles "is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person," according to the U.S. National Library of Science. "Sneezing and coughing can put contaminated droplets into the air." Among the complications of measles, according to the U.S., are bronchitis, encephalitis, ear infection and pneumonia.

Fitchburg officials working to confirm suspected case of measles at school
--------------------------------------------------------------
Health and school officials are taking precautions Tuesday [27 Mar 2012] after what officials described as a "low suspect" case of measles at South Street Elementary School. Schools Superintendent Andre Ravenelle described "low suspect" as unconfirmed case but officials are taking precautions to be safe. He said word was sent out to parents on Tuesday [27 Mar 2012] explaining the situation.

He said the South Street staff and students who are not immunized or who cannot show proof of immunization willnot be allowed to attend school Wednesday [28 Mar 2012]. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has advised that all staff and students including teachers, aides, cafeteria, maintenance and administration from South Street Elementary School buildings be given the following directive:
- People who were born in 1957 or after must produce a note from their doctor stating they have received MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations or have a positive titer for the disease;
- Individuals not able to produce evidence of immunity must be excluded from the school building from Wednesday through Fri 13 Apr 2012.

Measles is described as a "very contagious illness caused by a virus," which can be easily spread by coughing and sneezing, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The virus was nearly eradicated in the United States and Canada because of effective vaccination, but rates have begun to rise in recent years. Symptoms typically begin eight to 12 days after exposure to the virus, and can include the following: bloodshot eyes, cough, fever, light sensitivity, muscle pain, an itchy rash -- typically beginning on the head and spreading to other areas -- runny nose, eye irritation, sore throat and small white spots inside the mouth. Those without complications, such as pneumonia, tend to recover fully after treating symptoms and getting bed rest, the National Library of Medicine's website explains.
