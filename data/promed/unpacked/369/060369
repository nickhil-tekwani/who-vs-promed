Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) caused by whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses
has a dramatic impact on cassava production in Africa. A severe CMD
epidemic, caused by a recombinant strain of East African cassava mosaic
virus (EACMV-UG), has been spreading steadily from north-central Uganda
into East and Central Africa. The virus presents a significant threat to
cassava cultivation on the continent. EACMV-UG, in mixed infection with
African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), leads to severe disease symptoms,
decline of the crop and often results in complete loss of harvestable
roots. Various distinct begomoviruses implicated in CMD have been reported
from significant cassava growing regions in Africa, revealing a complex
virus situation. Some of these begomoviruses cause severe disease symptoms
in cassava. However, only in mixed infections of the recombinant strain
EACMV-UG and ACMV has an epidemiological significance been demonstrated.
Accordingly, a virus survey was conducted in 2002 in the major cassava
growing regions in southern Sudan. Leaf samples were taken and stem
cuttings established in the field at the Agricultural Research and
Technology Corporation, ARTC, Wad Medani, Sudan. Total DNA extracts from
leaves were subjected to differential PCR using specific primers for all
ACMV and EACMV species and strains defined to date. Of 14 samples with
conspicuous CMD symptoms, 13 contained the severe form of the recombinant
EACMV-UG strain. Using several infected cassava samples, this finding was
confirmed by sequence analysis of PCR amplicons obtained from DNA A genome
fragments (rep gene, intergenic region and coat protein gene). ACMV was
found in one sample as a single virus infection and in 2 other samples in a
mixed infection with EACMV-UG.
Detection of EACMV-UG in almost all of the samples tested provides evidence
for the potential epidemiological significance of this virus in the
occurrence of CMD in southern Sudan.

[Cassava is among the most common crops in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting
for over 50 per cent of world production with over 90 million tons of fresh
product, more than any other crop in Africa. Cassava is vital to the
livelihood of over 200 million people and plays a key food security role
for rapidly expanding rural and urban populations and has huge potential
for commercialization, income generation, and poverty reduction.
Cassava production in Africa faces new challenges from CMD. Disease has
spread in recent years, bringing increased risk of food insecurity to
millions of rural and urban households, particularly in eastern Africa.
Research and extension programs have helped limit the geographic spread of
CMD, but the potential magnitude of the problem threatens to overwhelm
these efforts.
CMD continues to be prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the
ECA (Economic Commission for Africa) sub-region and is regarded as the most
important disease, causing between 20 and 90 per cent crop losses based on
the cultivar, viral strain and environmental factors. Deterioration in the
status of CMD is a fact in East Africa, Uganda, DR Congo, and Kenya. Plants
infected via white fly-transmission dominate affected areas. Lower leaves
of infected plants look apparently healthy, while leaves above the point of
1st infection show severe symptom expression, drastic reduction in leaf
size with marked distortion. Plants harbor numerous adult white fly
[_Bemisia tabaci_ (Bt)] populations on young shoots and large nymph
populations on the lower surface of the apparently healthy lower leaves.
Lack of alternative propagation stock in disease-infected areas leaves
farmers no choice but to use material from the previous harvest of infected
plants as planting stock for the next generation. Environmental factors
favoring the development and fecundity of Bt enhance disease spread, and
spread of CMD is therefore highly linked to the vector.
To alleviate the situation, a number of African countries (Kenya, Burundi,
and Madagascar) have made significant progress in selecting
resistant/tolerant clones, which are being evaluated within their different
ecological zones.
The research discussed in this piece was completed in 2002, and normally I
would not post a piece that took almost 3 years to be published in "New
Disease Reports, but I believe that it is important to recognize new virus
threats to the food security of Sudan and other African countries.
