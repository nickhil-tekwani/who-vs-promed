According to Ukrainian swine industry groups, several porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) cases were registered in different regions of Ukraine since spring of 2014. The disease is not on the OIE list of notifiable terrestrial and aquatic animal diseases, although its economic impact on production is significant. According to Ukrainian veterinarians, the disease is highly contagious and destroys 100 per cent of young piglets infected, which causes a major brake in the production cycle. PED outbreaks in Ukraine have had an average length of 4 to 7 weeks, at which point, if not properly contained, the farm could relapse with a subsequent outbreak. During the outbreak period, average losses can be calculated at approximately 78 piglets per each hundred sows with average production halt at 4 weeks. To date, Ukraine's Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service (VS) do not recognize the danger of the PED virus epidemic. When contacted by FAS/Kyiv, they claimed the disease is not registered in the country. It should be noted that the disease is not on the OIE list of reportable diseases, which may be influencing VS's position on acknowledging the PED epidemic [see comment]. FAS/Kyiv has also been in contact with the largest swine producer association, the Swine Breeders of Ukraine (SB), and discovered that SB members have reported 3 to 4 cases of PED this year [2014]. Additional cases are known in non-member farms.

Swine farmers in Ukraine are on alert, and as a result, have reportedly increased biosecurity practices as a preventive measure. Special attention has been paid to disinfecting trucks and tightening critical inspection points such as entry ways/exits. According to internet sources, the disease spread in Ukraine accelerated in November/December 2014. Most of the comments on Ukraine's situation are provided by renowned international veterinarian consultant to the animal production industry: Dr John Carr. Dr Carr is considered one of the world's experts on the PED virus. While Ukraine is not a major producer or exporter of pork products, according to Dr Carr, a PED virus outbreak in several sow farms in Ukraine could lead to the deaths of 30 to 35 million pigs in Europe, and have a major impact on global pig production numbers. Dr Carr was invited to Ukraine by SB in spring 2014, but later continued his private consultancy practice on individual infected farms. In November, Dr Carr spent 10 days in Ukraine visiting 3 farms with PED outbreaks. Although "still struggling to get [it] (the virus) typed because the Ukraine does not have the technology and obviously the people in Ukraine have some slightly other issues to worry about," he mentioned in an interview to "Siemens Says" (a respected Canadian agribusiness news blog) [http://www.siemenssays.com/2014/11/27/harry-siemens-talks-dr-john-carr-world-livestock-animal-welfare-consultant-re-pedv-outbreak-europe/]. "Normally, I'd send my samples to Russia, but they are not quite talking to me at the moment either, making this situation a bit awkward."

Dr Carr has dealt with PED outbreaks in different parts of the world for over 20 years and has experience spotting the virus as early as 1972. According to Dr Carr, the PED virus types found in Ukraine are alike those found in China (since 2010) and the United States (since 2013), but different from earlier EU cases. Dr Carr warns that he "suspect(s) this is the beginning of the European outbreak." He warns that his professional estimation is that the PED virus will kill 25 to 35 million pigs over the next 18 months. Dr Carr adds that "of the 3 big farms I have in Ukraine, 2 are under control, and the other one is getting under control," and categorises the impact of Ukraine's outbreaks as more serious than what he had encountered in Asia. Dr Carr claimed to have lost as much as 10 000 pigs in just 4 days in farms he has worked in, and added that bigger farms would have larger problems.

Although information on impacted farms in Ukraine is not publicly available, the size of the losses is confirmed for at least one of the top 5 largest Ukrainian swine producers in the country who is currently struggling with the disease. Farm managers, hog producers, and farm workers should tighten up biosecurity practices as the best line of defense against this highly contagious strain. They should also work in concert with other farms in neighboring communities. This might be easier said than done, as half of the Ukraine's swine production is in backyard farms.

In 2014, Ukrainian farms were unable to dodge the impact of this previously unknown disease which is now on its 2nd epidemic wave. Some farmers have made additional mistakes by inseminating available sows in an attempt to return to target swine population numbers too quickly. The PED virus' impact on farms may last for as long as 18 months.

Highly virulent Asian-American porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus [PEDv] has spread to Europe. The disease is extremely infectious; a thimbleful of manure from an infected pig unit is sufficient to infect the entire British pig population.

It is impossible to guarantee Asian-American PEDv will not arrive in Britain on a traveller's shoes or clothes, or on the wheels of a lorry, says the National Pig Association [NPA]. Therefore all pig-keepers must consider themselves personally responsible for ensuring it does not get onto their own farm. Producers should pay special attention to vehicle biosecurity. In particular, no pig lorry should be allowed onto any pig farm unless it has previously been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, says NPA.

The highly virulent strain of PEDv is not in the European Union yet but it is in the Ukraine, which borders the European Union countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. It was discovered in mid-Ukraine by internationally known British vet Dr John Carr, who has now had the strain sequenced in Britain to confirm his suspicion that it is the virulent Asian-American strain, and not the European strain.

Dr Carr cites a well-run commercial 5000-sow unit in Ukraine where about 30 000 piglets died over a matter of weeks, equivalent to the loss of 6 weaned pigs per sow per year. He warns that with such high mortality, it is essential to be concerned for the mental health of all stockpeople when a unit breaks down with Asian-American PEDv. His worry now is that the highly infectious disease could easily spread to the European Union. He stresses it is essential that no live pigs are imported into the United Kingdom from countries with PEDv and he warns that all pig producers should introduce impeccable transport biosecurity routines.

The European Food Safety Authority has confirmed the disease has no zoonotic capacity and is therefore harmless to humans. But in the United States it has wiped out over a 10th of the pig population in the past 2 years, causing up to 100 percent mortality in piglets on infected pig farms.

However, the Canadian pig industry has demonstrated it is possible to control the spread of PEDv if the disease is identified quickly and no movements on or off the infected unit are allowed by the farmer concerned. Working on the Canadian model of early identification and total industry cooperation, the English Pig Health and Welfare Council has been formulating a contingency plan since April [2014] and this is due to be rolled out soon.

Meanwhile the statutory pig levy paid by English pig-keepers is funding free testing of diarrhoea samples at government animal health laboratories, to help ensure the disease is picked up promptly if it arrives on a British pig farm.

[Though not listed by the OIE, the diagnosis of PED in Ukraine should have been reported to the OIE as an emerging disease. Such notifications have been submitted by other countries into which the new, highly pathogenic strain of this virus ("novel swine enteric coronavirus") has been introduced, such as the USA, Canada, Japan, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Taiwan and Ecuador. According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, an "emerging disease" means "a new infection or infestation resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection or infestation spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health."

During the last OIE World Assembly of Delegates in May 2014, member countries exchanged views on events related to porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). To gather the latest knowledge on the disease and provide guidance to member countries, OIE published, in September 2014, a technical fact sheet titled "Infection with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea virus (Aetiology, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Prevention and Control, References). See at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_factsheet_PEDV.pdf.

PED is restricted to porcines. It is not zoonotic. For further background, subscribers are referred to Mod.CRD's commentary in the archived post 20140910.2763771.

Official confirmation and information on prevention and control measures undertaken by the Ukrainian authorities are requested. - Mod.AS
