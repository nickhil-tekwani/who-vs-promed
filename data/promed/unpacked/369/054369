[C] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak -
Update 13; 28 Mar 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_28/en/>
China joins WHO collaborative network
At a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO
investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia announced several
steps forward in the governments commitment to join international efforts
to contain a newly emerging infectious disease.
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/2003_03_28/en/>
The WHO team of 5 experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an
outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 Nov 2002.
Experts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak
and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first
surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13
countries on 3 continents.
The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese
Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials
from Guangdong Province.
In the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case
definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and
concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from
mid-November 2002 until 28 Feb 2003 were indeed cases of SARS.
As reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join
the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its
further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within
days to participate in 3 global electronic networks set up by WHO to
facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and
medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and
characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and
management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works
best to prevent its spread.
WHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on
Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this
week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in
the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new
disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward.
One of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of
understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which
also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve
understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some
outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others.
Progress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members
in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the
causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species
barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more
lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new
virus first began to cause disease in humans.
China released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday,
significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday,
officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks
in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi.
China has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic
reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted
electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health.
According to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a
few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in
operation.
Update on cases and countries:
As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been
reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new
deaths have occurred.
No reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce
a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO.
With 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains
the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases
include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States
of America (6).
Viet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a
row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate
introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held
further transmission at bay.
Some patients recovering
To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong,
17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore.

[A] Figures on atypical pneumonia 28 Mar 2003
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 28 Mar 2003, a total of 425 people with pneumonia symptoms have
been admitted to public hospitals. The 58 additional patients reported
today include 4 healthcare workers and 34 patients from Amoy Garden. The
remaining 20 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
As at today, 25 patients have been discharged from hospitals. A total of 45
patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.
The breakdown of figures is as follows:
Total Admissions (The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 153 (153)
12 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 272 (272)
13 of the patients were discharged
Total admission 425 (425)
25 were discharged

[B] Health Surveillance for airline passengers 28 Mar 2003
A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) on 28 Mar 2003 called on
passengers who had travelled from Beijing to Hong Kong in flight CA 111(Air
China) on 21 Mar 2003 or in flight CX 510(Cathay Pacific) from Hong Kong to
Taipei on the 21 Mar 2003 to call DH's hotline for atypical pneumonia (2961
8968) for health advice and surveillance.
The plea was made as DH's investigation found that 4 Taiwan passengers who
had taken these 2 flights developed symptoms of SARS during their stay in
Beijing. Investigation also revealed that they went to Beijing on flight
CA 112 on 15 Mar 2003. A number of passengers in flight CA 112 were
confirmed to have contracted with atypical pneumonia earlier this week. It
is suspected that the 4 Taiwan passengers contracted the disease from a
73-year-old passenger in flight CA 112 on their way to Beijing.
DH has informed the Airport Authority and the 2 airlines concerned. Advice
was also given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplanes. DH is
tracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 2 flights, for
surveillance purposes.
The spokesman reminded members of the public who have respiratory symptoms
including fever, chills, malaise, and cough to avoid traveling by plane
before recovery.
[These advisories are consistent with the now global recommendation for
pre-boarding screening of airline passengers for symptoms compatible with
SARS coming from areas with known local transmission. These cases do not
as yet suggest a more widespread easier transmission, as sitting close to
an individual who is actively coughing for several hours on an airline
flight would still be classified as "close contact". - Mod.MPP]
[C] Enhanced measures to control infectious disease 28 Mar 2003
A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) on 28 Mar 2003 called on
members of the public who have paid visits to Metropole Hotel on 21-22 Feb
2003 or the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) on or after 1 Mar 2003,
excluding staff working in PWH, to contact them for health surveillance.
The spokesman said in order to enhance measures to control atypical
pneumonia, DH has converted 4 clinics into designated medical centres (DMC)
for daily surveillance of contacts of confirmed atypical pneumonia cases.
The 4v DMC are Pamela Youde Child Assessment Centre (Shatin); South Kwai
Chung Jockey Club Polyclinic; Shek Kip Mei Health Centre, and Sai Ying Pun
Jockey Club Clinic. They will be operated from 9 am to 5 pm daily, starting
31 Mar 2003.
The spokesman said that people who are identified to be close contacts of
patients suffering from atypical pneumonia are required to report each day
for check-up at one of these DMCs for 10 consecutive days. "Surveillance
of the health condition of these individuals will be made accordingly. If
they have developed symptoms of the disease, they will be admitted to
hospital for isolation and treatment. People who had close contact with
these patients should stay at home as far as possible and should not go out
unless it is absolutely necessary," the spokesman said. [This appears to
be a contradiction, as in order to report to one of the 4 designated DMCs,
these individuals will be leaving their homes and travelling to the DMCs,
many of whom might be travelling by public transportation. - Mod.MPP]
DH will send letters to all close contacts to ask them to attend one of the
DMCs for check-up. To ensure that every close contact would be put under
health surveillance, DH will set up a special hotline 187 2222 to answer
enquiries from this group of people. The hotline will be operated between 2
PM and 6 PM 29 Mar 2003 and from 9 am to 5 pm from 30 Mar 2003 onwards. DH
has the power to enforce these mandatory measures whenever necessary.
Close contact means persons having cared for, having lived with, or having
had direct contact with respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person
with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Close contacts are, therefore,
mainly household contacts and those caring for the case. Social contact
implies persons who have had contact with an individual with severe acute
respiratory syndrome but do not fit the definition of close contact.
All co-workers and all visitors of cases in hospitals are social contacts.
If these social contacts had direct contact with respiratory secretions and
body fluids of a case, they are classified as close contact. Social
contacts with symptoms will be advised to attend one of the DMCs.

<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5700>

As of 28 Mar 2003, a total of 86 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. Of the additional patients, 7 were close contacts of
SARS cases: 4 hospital staff and 3 family members. These 7 cases are traced
back to the index cases. The remaining case is a new index case who
returned to Singapore from a trip to Hong Kong and Beijing, China.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.
To date, 25 patients have been discharged from hospital, 2 have died, and
the remaining 59 patients are hospitalised. All the patients are stable
except for 12 patients who are in serious condition.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new disease for which the
cause has not yet been determined. People may perceive the risks of being
infected by SARS differently. Some are complacent, while others overreact.
Singapore has taken extra precautionary measures, beyond WHO's recommended
control measures, to ensure that the spread is contained. These include
isolating all suspected and SARS patients in TTSH, enhanced infection
control measures for hospital staff, and instituting home quarantine
measures for those who have come into contact with people diagnosed with
SARS. The key strategy is to identify suspect cases once they show symptoms
of the disease and isolate them to prevent transmission to more people. The
closure of schools is to allay the concerns of parents. We will step up
efforts to help the public understand the nature of SARS and how they could
help us in our efforts to minimise the risk of community spread.

Update #13 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
-------------------------
As of 28 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 37 individuals who
have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario
and British Columbia. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian
cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact
with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The
information contained in this update is based on the best available
information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario: 35 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family
contacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who
have cared for these cases.
British Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after
returning from travel in southeast Asia.
Manitoba: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after returning from
travel in southeast Asia.
On 27 Mar 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended new
measures, related to international travel aimed at reducing the risk of
further international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The measures proposed by WHO on the screening of passengers presenting for
international travel are under active consideration by Health Canada.
Health Canada has discussed this issue with the local airport authority in
Toronto, and we are putting together a plan. Health Canada is hoping to
have something in place in Toronto over the course of the weekend.
It is important to note that airlines operating international flights in
and out of Canada have been carrying out long-standing procedures to
prevent sick passengers from getting on airplanes.
Health Canada has deployed 5 epidemiologists to assist Toronto Public
Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of SARS
cases currently under investigation.The department has also provided
guidelines for infection control and recommendations on actions for public
health settings.

[A] Singapore - flight attendant: from CNN Online:
<http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/28/asia.sars/index.html>
Several Asian nations are clamping down on travelers in an effort to curb
the spread of a deadly pneumonia virus that has killed at least 50 people
worldwide.
Underlining the call, Singapore Airlines confirmed on Friday that a flight
attendant had developed symptoms of SARS probably contracted from a
passenger on a Frankfurt-New York flight 2 weeks ago. No other passengers
or crew had shown symptoms and the plane had been disinfected, an airline
spokesperson told CNN.
The WHO has called for stringent screening of air travelers at the places
hardest hit by the mystery virus, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto,
Hanoi, Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, and China's southern Guangdong
province. Hong Kong and Taiwan were among the countries to announce new
health checks for travelers. All travelers in the former British colony
will be required to fill out health declaration forms at all departure and
arrival points. Staff will be posted at checkpoints to detect travelers
exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Similar measures were in place for
travelers arriving in Taiwan, Health Department Director Twu Shing-jer said
on Friday. Around 10 000 Taiwanese journey to and from China, Hong Kong and
Macau each day, Twu added.
[This is part of the mounting evidence behind the recommendation for
pre-boarding screening of airline passengers for symptoms of SARS.
Recognizing that we are very early in our understanding of this disease and
risks associated with transmission, current measures -- while they may seem
draconian -- are justifiable until more is known. - Mod.MPP]
