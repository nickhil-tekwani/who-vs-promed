Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system of mammals, including humans. Once clinical signs appear, rabies is almost always fatal in animals and people. In Canada, the animals that most often transmit rabies are bats, skunks and foxes.

Rabies is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals Act. All suspect cases must be reported to the province for follow-up. All suspect rabies cases are verified in a CFIA rabies laboratory.

A table shows that 5 rabies cases were confirmed in Canada in March this year [2021], from 135 samples submitted from across the country. [This table has been converted to a summary. - Mod.TG].

Quebec reports rabies in an arctic fox.
Ontario reports rabies in a bat and in a skunk.
Manitoba reports rabies in a bovine.
Northwest Territories reports rabies in a red fox.

In 2021, 12 positive cases have been confirmed in Canada, out of 367 samples submitted.

Five people have possibly been exposed to rabies after a raccoon tested positive for the virus this week in the Beauregard community. Veterinarian Dr Gary Hunt tells News 3 that a dog was exposed when it killed the raccoon on Sun 11 Apr 2021. Hunt received the test results on Thu 15 Apr 2021. The individuals are undergoing rabies prophylactic treatment, and the dog is quarantined.

Homer Bruce, the Lee County rabies officer, said in a news release that the dog had previous rabies vaccinations and was boosted at the time of treatment. Bruce said keeping up to date on vaccines is critical to community safety: "The key here is the pet had a previous rabies vaccination. This is so important in protecting your pets from rabies and thereby protecting humans from exposure through their pets. Alabama Law requires all dogs, cats and ferrets to be vaccinated at 3 months of age and annually thereafter unless they receive a 3-year vaccine. The 1st rabies vaccination is only good for one year regardless of which vaccine your pet receives. I ask everyone to please check their pet's rabies vaccination status and to get them boosted immediately if they are not up to date. Contact your veterinarian if you can't determine your pet's vaccination status. Please call 334-745-0060 if you have questions."

Rabies is a human infection occurring after a transdermal bite or scratch by an infected animal, like dogs and cats. It can be transmitted when infectious material, usually saliva, comes into direct contact with a victim's fresh skin lesions. Rabies may also occur, though in sporadic cases, through inhalation of virus-containing spray [such as a sneeze, and droplets may reach the eye. - Mod.TG] or organ transplants.

Pet owners need to have their animals registered and vaccinated under Alabama law.

Animal bite victims should immediately wash bites with soap and water for at least 10 minutes and receive appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if needed from trained health workers.

[3] USA: North Carolina - bobcat, human exposure

The Pender County Sheriff's Office [PCSO] confirmed that a bobcat, having attacked a couple, was killed and has tested positive for rabies.

A North Carolina family readying to begin their morning commute experienced a violent encounter with a bobcat in the driveway of their Burgaw home. The incident was captured on a security camera, and by Fri 16 Apr 2021 afternoon had racked up more than 10 million views.

The bobcat, which was later killed, was also confirmed to have rabies, underscoring the need to keep pet vaccinations up to date, the PCSO said. The 9 Apr 2021 incident occurred in the Creekside Subdivision in Burgaw, the PCSO confirmed.

In the video, an unidentified man can be heard offering a morning greeting to a neighbor jogging past his home. In his hands appear to be a cake and a beverage. "I need to wash my car," he says, unlocking the vehicle. A bird can be heard in the background along the sleepy street scene as the morning sky takes on the color of a new day. That's about the time all hell broke loose.

A woman approaching the passenger side of the vehicle with a pet carrier in hand then lurches forward into the frame as a loud feline yowl and her blood-curdling scream cut through the otherwise tranquil suburban scene. "Run, baby! Run!" she seems to yell to her husband, as the bobcat grips tight to her back. The man runs around the vehicle, grabbing the cat away from her, exclaiming "oh my god, it's a bobcat!" in disbelief before flinging it feet away from his body into the grass of the manicured front yard.

The dramatic footage of the incident may be viewed at: https://twitter.com/Evi3Zamora/status/1382781106269818884. The animal had attacked another person before the incident caught on video, PCSO Capt James Rowell said, the Charlotte Observer reported.

"Any unvaccinated pets should be vaccinated immediately," PCSO warned neighborhood residents following the incident. "Your pets and other domestic animals can be infected when they are bitten by rabid wild animals. When spillover rabies occurs in domestic animals, the risk to humans is increased."

On 27 Apr 2021, the Vineland Health Department announced that it was searching for a fox after reports of it attacking at least 3 people and chasing 2 others in the area of Riviera Boulevard. The behavior of the fox led officials to suspect it was rabid.

Vineland Health Department officer Robert Dickinson said in a news release that homeowners should check their pets for wounds of unknown origin. Residents in the area are also being asked to be mindful of any animals exhibiting strange behavior, signs of illness, or undue aggression. "We do not know at this time how long the fox has been ill, if it has attacked any other wildlife, or if there are other foxes which could be rabid as well," Dickinson added.

Individuals who may have come in contact with or had their pets come in contact with the fox are encouraged to contact the Health Department at 856-794-4131.

[Regardless of where you are, keep your guard up regarding animals. They may follow you into a house of worship, or spring out at you from behind a parked vehicle.

Rabies is a serious disease. Vaccinate your pets against this deadly disease. If your pet is without the vaccine and is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be euthanized. If you keep your pets up to date on the rabies vaccine, you can prevent the pet's death, and perhaps save your own life, or certainly save yourself the necessary shots of post exposure.

If you are bitten by an animal, wash the bite site with soap and plenty of water, and seek medical attention. You may require a series of vaccine shots called post exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

If your vaccinated pet is bitten, wash the wound and take your pet to the veterinarian. A booster rabies vaccine is usually required.

If your pet is not vaccinated but is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be humanely euthanized. There is no treatment for an animal which has not been vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG
