CDC update: 41 new measles cases in US, 880 total
---------------------
Measles continues to spread across the United States, with 41 new cases confirmed in the past week, according to an update today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

From 1 Jan through 17 May [2019], the CDC has recorded 880 measles cases in 24 states, the most since 1994 and easily the most since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. Many of the cases are part of 10 outbreaks (3 or more cases) ongoing across the country, including large outbreaks in New York, California, and Washington state.

Of the new cases, 32 likely occurred in New York. As of 13 May [2019], the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC Health) has reported 498 cases, up from 466 last week, in ongoing outbreaks in Brooklyn and Queens. Those outbreaks are tied to unvaccinated members of the Orthodox Jewish community in those boroughs.

"These outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring," the CDC said, referring to all 10 outbreaks.

On 9 Apr [2019], the New York health commissioner ordered the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine compulsory, punishable with up to USD 1000 in fines.

Over the weekend, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) confirmed the city's 1st case of measles this year [2019] and said the patient may have exposed people [at various locations noted in the URL above. - Mod.LK] "Measles is a serious yet preventable disease through a safe, effective, and universally available vaccine," said CDPH commissioner Julie Morita, MD in a press statement. "Chicagoans should make sure their children and family members are up-to-date on vaccines now. Vaccination is the best way to protect against measles."

CDPH said Chicago has one of the nation's highest vaccination coverage rates, with about 94% of children 19 months to 3 years old receiving at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

New Mexico also reported its 1st measles case in 4 years, in a one-year-old child, according to a story published late last week [week of Mon 13 May 2019] by the Associated Press (AP).

PAHO update
------------
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) also released an update on measles activity in the Americas. A total of 12 countries have reported cases in 2019: Argentina, the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, the USA, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Since 1 Jan 2018, Brazil has reported more than 18 000 suspected cases, of which 10 424 have been confirmed, with 73 of the confirmed cases occurring this year [2019]. The country also reported 12 measles deaths in 2018.

[3] Washington (King County, Puget Sound)
Date: Tue 21 May 2019

https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/seventh-person-confirmed-to-have-measles-in-king-county/


The number of measles cases in King County continues to grow. A woman in her 30s is the 7th recently confirmed measles case in the Puget Sound region and the 4th person in the county to contract the virus this month [May 2019]. She likely came in contact with the virus at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to Public Health Seattle and King County.

The recent cases of measles in King County are likely connected to a person with measles who was at the airport on the morning of 25 Apr [2019]. There isn't currently an increased risk of contracting measles at Sea-Tac Airport, according to a news release from Public Health. You can check Public Health's website at https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health.aspx to see a list of places that people with measles went before seeking medical attention.

A Pierce County man was diagnosed with measles 12 May [2019], and 4 other Western Washington residents were confirmed to have measles 15 May [2019].

Issaquah High School was closed 16 May [2019] so school officials could confirm employees' immunization records after a staff member was diagnosed with measles. Eleven teachers and 20 students won't be allowed back until 31 May [2019] because they haven't been vaccinated or can't prove that they have been vaccinated, according to the Issaquah School District. After a student at Bothell's North Creek High School contracted the virus, 10 students are being kept away from campus until 3 Jun [2019].

Measles was thought to have been eradicated in the United States in 2000. The virus has surged back recently in the USA and around the world.

The King County measles cases popped up shortly after officials in Clark County declared an end to an outbreak that began 3 Jan [2019] and infected 71 people there. Most of the Clark County cases occurred in children who were not immunized. During the Clark County outbreak, one case was reported in King County.

The Washington state legislature responded to the Clark County outbreak by limiting exemptions for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. The new law, which takes effect in July [2019], doesn't allow parents to opt their children out of the MMR vaccine for personal or philosophical reasons.

Healthcare professionals and people who study vaccinations say that laws allowing fewer exemptions are an important tool in fighting measles and getting a population to what is called herd immunity -- meaning at least 95% of the population is vaccinated -- thus protecting people who can't be immunized because they are younger than one year old or have health issues that don't allow for immunization.

[4] Maine: 25th state
Date: Wed 22 May 2019

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-measles/maine-becomes-25th-u-s-state-to-report-measles-case-idUSKCN1SS1FJ


Maine became the 25th US state to confirm a case of measles amid the country's worst outbreak of the disease in a quarter century, as state medical officials on Wednesday [22 May 2019] reported that a child was infected but is now fully recovered.

The afflicted school-aged child from Somerset County, whose measles case was confirmed on Monday [20 May 2019], was vaccinated and had no complications while the disease ran its course, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The report comes as measles cases have erupted across the country, with federal health officials reporting on Monday [20 May 2019] that 880 people have contracted the disease so far this year [2019].

Health experts say the virus has spread among school-age children whose parents declined to give them the vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. A vocal fringe of US parents cite concerns that the vaccine may cause autism, despite scientific studies that have debunked such claims.

Although the virus was eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning the disease was no longer a constant presence, outbreaks still happen via travelers coming from countries where measles is still common, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC said last month [April 2019] that 72% of the people infected with measles were unvaccinated. Of the others, 10% had one of the 2 recommended vaccine doses, while the status of the remaining 18% was unclear, the agency said.

"The best protection against measles is vaccination," Maine state epidemiologist Dr. Siiri Bennett said in a statement, adding that even when vaccinated individuals become ill, the severity of the disease is reduced, and its spread is less likely.

The incidence of measles in Finland has increased over the last year, says the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). While 11 cases of measles were diagnosed in the country in 2017, the number rose to 16 in 2018. All infections were contracted abroad.

According to THL, the increase in the number of infections reflects the spread of the disease elsewhere in the world, including Europe. "Over the past 12 months, tens of thousands of measles cases have been reported in European countries," Taneli Puumalainen, senior physician at THL, said.

In Finland, measles was introduced by those who had been abroad and then spread, mostly to family members. The biggest risk of a broader spread of measles last year [2018] was in Ostrobothnia, Western Finland, where an unvaccinated child contracted the disease in an area where the vaccination coverage was low.

The school city in Febus reported Monday evening [20 May 2019] a case of measles within the ranks of the institution's students.

The Febus school district is not immune to measles cases reported in recent days in the region. In an email sent Monday night [20 May 2019], the secretariat of the school confirmed the case.

"Several cases of measles have been reported in the region in recent weeks, and this contagious disease presents complications only in rare cases, mostly in untreated or frail patients, the school district reported to us today. The student was taken care of by a doctor," announced the institution.

"This is a 2nd-grade student, a boarder, and this is the only case at the moment. We are following the procedure laid down by the Regional Health Agency," headmaster Philippe Dubourg said, adding that teaching has not been affected. "[The outbreak is] without major risk for most of the population."

Two hospitals in Wallonia have reported at least 30 cases of measles infections since the start of the year [2019], raising concerns of a possible outbreak in the region.

The Jolimont and Tivoli hospitals, located in the city of La Louviere, have together treated between 30 and 35 patients infected with measles, raising concerns over a spike in the number of people infected in the past 3 weeks. By contrast, both hospitals told regional daily La Gazette that they usually treated 1-2 measles cases per year.

While some of the patients treated included infants less than a year old -- who cannot be vaccinated that young -- Sandrine Milas, an infectious disease specialist in Tivoli's hospital, said that many of the patients were adults who had not been vaccinated properly, or at all.

"Between 1970 and 1985, the disease started spreading less, so a big part of the public was not vaccinated or only received one dose of the vaccine," Milas told regional broadcaster ACTV, adding that some people "thought they had received the vaccine."

The reports come after the World Health Organisation said that in the 1st 2 months of 2019, 34 400 cases of measles had been reported in 42 European countries, with the majority of cases located in Ukraine, Albania, and Romania.

While medical staff in both hospitals said that none of the patients had so far needed to be admitted, they raised concern over a possible outbreak over summer holiday travels.

[8] Nigeria (Borno state)
Date: Wed 22 May 2019

https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-children-are-still-dying-measles-borno-state


Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) teams have treated 2922 children for measles in Borno since November 2018 as part of the organization's response to a spike in cases of the potentially deadly disease. But a lack of vaccination coverage among the most vulnerable people in the region, coupled with a lack of capacity among health actors to respond to the outbreak, raises serious concerns. "Since I started practicing as a doctor in 2016, I have not seen such high numbers of measles cases in Maiduguri," says Dr. Abdullahi.

Most children suffering from measles in Borno come from internally displaced populations and the communities that host them. The decade-long conflict in northeastern Nigeria has displaced thousands of people, both within their country and across borders. The disruption and chaos have left nearly 2 million people dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival.

The ongoing measles outbreak is due partly to insufficient routine vaccination, which has left thousands of children at risk of getting infected. In the 4 months from January to April [2019] alone, MSF teams treated 2343 children with measles. And the number of cases in April [2019] was 4 times higher than in January [2019]. There are so many patients that all 73 isolation beds at Gwange Hospital, in the west of Maiduguri, are full.

"We are all working in crowded wards," says Dr. Theresa Chan, MSF medical team leader at Gwange. "The enthusiasm exhibited by the staff is the reason why we've been able to cope so far."

"She started sneezing and had a high fever," explains the mother of a 3-year-old girl who was treated at Gwange. "The inside of her lips turned red, and she was constantly vomiting. I was so worried, and I thought she was going to die." After nearly a month of treatment, the girl recovered and was taken home by her grateful mother.

Many are not so fortunate. Some children die from measles due to complications such as severe acute malnutrition, malaria, and pneumonia. In both the State Specialist Hospital and Gwange Hospital, MSF has recorded 58 deaths since January [2019]. But this is only part of the total death toll.

"It is unacceptable that there are still high numbers of children passing away from such a treatable disease," says Caroline Masunda, MSF medical team leader in Maiduguri. "It has brought a lot of loss and a lot of sadness to the community."

To encourage uptake of services and limit the number of complicated cases that increase the mortality rate, the population must have access to free primary health care in Maiduguri. MSF is also urgently calling for better, faster coordination between all actors, including Nigerian authorities, UN agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, to provide routine vaccination to children across northeastern Nigeria to protect them against measles and prevent future outbreaks.

MSF has been working in Nigeria since 1996 and has had a permanent presence in Borno state since 2014. MSF teams provide lifesaving medical care in northeastern Nigeria, running projects in Gwoza, Maiduguri, Monguno, Ngala, and Pulka, while [MSF] emergency teams respond to disease outbreaks and other urgent humanitarian needs.

[9] Australia (Melbourne): ex Viet Nam

https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/melbourne-measles-cluster-traveller-infects-baby-and-five-adults-with-disease-20190522-p51pvb.html


A baby is among 6 Victorians who have contracted measles after being infected by a traveller visiting from Viet Nam. It is the largest cluster of measles in the state since March last year [2018], with the newly infected patients taking the total number of measles cases in Victoria to 22 so far this year [2019]. The infant, who is less than 12 months old, is not seriously unwell.

Another 27 babies and toddlers were potentially exposed at the childcare centre the infected baby attends and were taken to Monash Medical Centre on Wednesday [22 May 2019] to be immunised with immunoglobulin in a bid to stop them developing the disease.

The man, aged in his 30s, attended family events in Mornington on 4 May and St Kilda on 5 May [2019]. He was put in isolation in hospital after returning to Viet Nam.

The latest 6 patients, who would have caught the disease at the family events, may have infected other people across Melbourne before they were showing any symptoms.

Dr Bone said there may be further cases to come from the same cluster and urges anyone with symptoms to see a GP or emergency department, but to call ahead before visiting to avoid the further spread of infection. She said it was the biggest cluster of measles in the state since March last year [2018], when 9 people developed the illness in an outbreak connected to Melbourne Airport.

Another adult diagnosed this week -- who has visited Bendigo and Echuca -- is not connected to the other cases but was infected by another overseas traveller who visited in April [2019].

The 5 adults infected at the start of May [2019] are mostly people born after 1966 who only had one of the 2 vaccines.

Latest figures from the Australian Immunisation Register show 95.7% of Victorian 5-year-olds are now fully immunised.

Almost all the cases in Victoria this year [2019] involved people who were not fully immunised against measles, had travelled overseas, or had been in contact with travellers from overseas.

[10] Approach to attitude change

Source: Science Alert [abridged, edited
https://www.sciencealert.com/experiment-suggests-how-to-make-70-percent-of-vaccine-hesitant-people-change-their-thinking


A new study has shown it's possible to persuade members of our community who oppose vaccines to change their opinion by confronting them with the costs of their hesitation.

Many people around the world have never seen iron lungs, smallpox scars, or the blindness caused by measles. For some, not seeing these physical reminders makes it harder to weigh up the risks and benefits of vaccination.

Researchers from Brigham Young University in the US surveyed nearly 600 students with diverse positions on vaccination and found that meeting a person with 1st-hand experience of a vaccine-preventable illness could provide an opportunity for a rethink.

[Citation: Johnson DK et al.: Combating Vaccine Hesitancy with Vaccine-Preventable Disease Familiarization: An Interview and Curriculum Intervention for College Students. Vaccines. 2019; 7(2): 39. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020039.

Abstract
"In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed vaccine hesitancy in its top 10 threats to global health. Vaccine hesitancy is a "delay in acceptance or refusal to vaccinate despite availability of vaccination services." Urban areas with large amounts of vaccine hesitancy are at risk for the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Many vaccine-hesitant (VH) parents may be unfamiliar with the consequences of VPDs and thus might be swayed when confronted with the symptoms and dangers of VPDs. As such, we sought to educate college students (future parents) in an urban vaccine-hesitant hotspot by assigning them to interview family or community members who had experienced a VPD. Student vaccine attitudes were assessed by surveys before and after the interviews. Vaccine-hesitant students who conducted a VPD interview but received no additional vaccine educational materials were significantly more likely (interaction term p less than 0.001) to become pro-vaccine (PV) (68%) than students who conducted an autoimmune interview and received no additional educational materials. Additionally, students whose interviewees experienced intense physical suffering or physical limitations or students who were enrolled in a course with intensive VPD and vaccine curriculum had significantly increased vaccine attitudes. This suggests that introducing students to VPDs can decrease vaccine hesitancy."
