Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are more likely to have developed the disease through incidence transmission, rather than a new treatment-related acquisition, according to recent research published in The Lancet [1].

"This mechanistic model of tuberculosis treatment and drug resistance suggests that existing notifications are most consistent with today's [multidrug-resistant (MDR)] tuberculosis epidemic being predominantly (greater than 80 percent) an epidemic of MDR transmission. A preponderance of transmission is consistent with both reported MDR tuberculosis epidemiology and historical successes in MDR tuberculosis control," Emily A. Kendall, MD, from the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore [Maryland, USA], and colleagues wrote.

"If, as our model suggests, only a small proportion of MDR tuberculosis incidence results directly from previous treatment, then incremental improvements in drug-susceptible tuberculosis treatment are unlikely to bend the epidemic curve of MDR tuberculosis in most settings. By contrast, expansion of MDR tuberculosis treatment availability, along with improvement in MDR tuberculosis treatment outcomes, has tremendous potential to limit the spread of MDR tuberculosis in the future."

Kendall and colleagues evaluated national tuberculosis data from several countries to estimate the incidence of MDR in 2013 related to MDR transmission instead of treatment-related acquisition, according to the abstract. They found that 3.5 percent of MDR tuberculosis was developed through new tuberculosis notifications, while 20.5 percent of MDR tuberculosis was developed through re-treatment notifications. Further, they estimated that resistance transmission accounted for 95.9 percent of incident tuberculosis cases (95 percent UR; 68-99.6 percent) and 61.3 percent of incidence MDR tuberculosis cases (95 percent UR; 16.5-95.2 percent) in previously treated patients, according to the abstract.

Bangladesh had the lowest notification data at 48 percent (95 percent UR; 30-75 percent), and Uzbekistan had the highest notification data at 99 percent (95 percent UR; 91-100 percent), according to the abstract.

"If the current MDR tuberculosis epidemic is to be controlled, expanding effective MDR tuberculosis treatment while developing novel rapid drug susceptibility tests and more tolerable, less resource-intensive drug regimens should be prioritized by the global public health community," Kendall and colleagues wrote.

[The news report refers to an article recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine (see reference 1 above). The authors of this study point out that the "prevalence of MDR is generally much higher in patients with tuberculosis who have previously received tuberculosis treatment than in patients who have not received treatment. This disparity is widely assumed to suggest that a large proportion of MDR tuberculosis arises from selection of drug resistance mutations during previous ineffective tuberculosis treatment, as opposed to [person-to-person] transmission of pre-existing MDR strains."

To the authors' knowledge, this study is the 1st to estimate the proportion of incident MDR tuberculosis that is a result of person-to-person transmission of MDR strains. Using WHO national tuberculosis notification data, the authors created a transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic to estimate the contribution of person-to-person transmission of resistance to incident MDR tuberculosis cases. Subject to limitations of model-based analyses, they found a predominance (greater than 80 percent) of MDR tuberculosis transmission as the cause of new MDR tuberculosis cases. If correct, the study's conclusions imply that to control the current MDR tuberculosis epidemic will require rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of MDR tuberculosis, with the development of rapid drug susceptibility testing and more effective MDR TB drug regimens.

The study's abstract is reproduced below:

Summary
-------
Background
----------
"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis can be acquired through de-novo mutation during tuberculosis treatment or through transmission from other individuals with active MDR tuberculosis. Understanding the balance between these 2 mechanisms is essential when allocating resources for MDR tuberculosis. We aimed to create a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic to estimate the contributions of treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance to incident MDR tuberculosis cases.

Methods
-------
"In this modelling analysis, we constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic, allowing for both treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance. We used national tuberculosis notification data to inform Bayesian estimates of the proportion of each country's 2013 MDR tuberculosis incidence that resulted from MDR transmission rather than treatment-related MDR acquisition.

Findings
--------
"Global estimates of 3.5 percent MDR tuberculosis prevalence among new tuberculosis notifications and 20.5 percent among re-treatment notifications translate into an estimate that resistance transmission rather than acquisition accounts for a median 95.9 percent (95 percent uncertainty range [UR] 68.0-99.6) of all incident MDR tuberculosis, and 61.3 percent (16.5-95.2) of incident MDR tuberculosis in previously treated individuals. The estimated proportion of MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission varied substantially with different countries' notification data -- ranging from 48 percent (95 percent UR 30-75) in Bangladesh to 99 percent (91-100) in Uzbekistan. Estimates were most sensitive to estimates of the transmissibility of MDR strains, the probability of acquiring MDR during tuberculosis treatment, and the responsiveness of MDR tuberculosis to 1st-line treatment.

Interpretation
--------------
"Notifications of MDR prevalence from most high-burden settings are consistent with most incident MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission rather than new treatment-related acquisition of resistance. Merely improving the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis is unlikely to greatly reduce future MDR tuberculosis incidence. Improved diagnosis and treatment of MDR tuberculosis -- including new tests and drug regimens -- should be highly prioritised." - Mod.ML]
