A 55-year-old HCV and HIV positive IV drug user was hospitalized at the university hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen on 5 Jul 2012 with what was perceived as an infected, possibly extravascular, injection of heroin in the left groin.

Initially, his CRP was normal, and he had no fever, but on the following day (6 Jul 2012), he became septic, febrile, and suffered a cardiac arrest. He was immediately resuscitated, intubated, and transferred to the ICU. During the day, the swelling of his left thigh increased, and his abdomen also became very swollen and hard. Although without any intestinal sounds, he had no aspirates, and an ultrasound and CT only showed considerable edema of the retroperitoneum, and an attempt of a peritoneal tap from what was believed to be ascites was dry. The patient was hypotensive and did not respond adequately to either noradrenalin or fluid, and he [was] oxygenating his blood insufficently on 100 percent O2.

Initial antibiotic treatment was with meropenem and ciprofloxazine, but the patient remained obviously septic. Ultrasound of the left leg did not reveal compartment syndrome nor abscess formation. On the suspicion that he might have anthrax, clindamycin was added.

Blood culture revealed on 7 Jul 2012 typical gram positive bacteria in chains, confirmed later to be _Bacillus anthracis_. The patient later that same day died from an irreparable shock.

This is the 1st confirmed case of injection related anthrax in Denmark, and the relevant authorities are now trying their best to prevent further cases among the i.v. addict community.

[We are very grateful to Dr. Thybo for notifying us. It is greatly appreciated. Now we must wait to see what the PCR investigations reveal as to the possible origin of this anthrax strain and for the forensic/police investigation as to where this contaminated heroin came from. The pathology of this case is not what we normally expect with such injection related lesions. - Mod.MHJ
