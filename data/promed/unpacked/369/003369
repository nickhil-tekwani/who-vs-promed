A syphilis outbreak in south-central Oklahoma creates yet another strain on the state's public health system. Public health providers juggle addressing the [COVID-19] outbreak, the worst pandemic in a century, the onset of flu season, and existing staffing issues.

Over the past 6 months, we've gotten pretty familiar with terms we hadn't heard regularly before, like contact tracers and infectious disease intervention specialists. But they're not new. Before the coronavirus, many of Oklahoma's workers in that sector had their eye on another disease: syphilis.

From 2014 to 2018, Oklahoma experienced a more than 8-fold increase in the number of syphilis cases among women, according to data from the state department of health's sexual health and harm-reduction service. And since 2014, Oklahoma has seen nearly 3 times more babies born with [congenital] syphilis.

In Carter County, near the Texas border in central Oklahoma, public health officials began prioritizing that bacterial infection [syphilis] more than a year ago. Even with mitigation efforts, the county has been experiencing severe outbreaks. "Our rate, it seems, here in Carter County compared to last year [2019], we're up 900%," said Mendy Spohn, the state department of health's regional administrative director for the area.

Carter County is home to Ardmore, one of the state's worst-hit areas in the opioid epidemic. Public officials began ringing alarm bells about a year ago about a burgeoning influx of heroin, which many attributed to a crackdown on opioids. Rebecca Burton is a public health nurse who has been serving that area for 26 years. She said that surge in drug use has likely caused the county's syphilis diagnoses to skyrocket, as dealers accept sex in lieu of cash payments.

Responding to a syphilis outbreak also requires contact tracers. Infection specialists and contact tracers track infections in communities. They talk with people who have contracted diseases to investigate who else might have been exposed, then get in touch with those people to explain their risk. Needless to say, those specialists and contract tracers have been busy since the coronavirus struck Oklahoma.

"The fact that the spike started right as COVID started, I think that contributed to our ability to stay on top of it," Spohn said. "Because the State of Oklahoma kind of repurposed our disease infection specialists to help us with contact tracing for COVID. That took priority at the time. And I think that you can see that that had some impact. I can't say that that's the complete answer as to why that happened. But I do feel like it shows the importance of your disease and intervention specialists and especially with sexual health. And how important they are."

The coronavirus is just one of the strains that Carter County's health department and the ones around the state are facing. It's October, which means flu season. In a normal year, without a global viral outbreak and a local bacterial outbreak, flu season means busy season. "Right now, we have a line of cars behind our building waiting for testing. Tonight, we will have a line of cars waiting for their flu vaccine. In the middle of that, we have a family planning clinic. We're doing phone-based WIC (Women, Infants and Children nutrition assistance) interviews. Becky (Burton) and a couple of other nurses are running 2-hour syphilis or STD visits for some of these people. Because that's how long [the] interview and some of the process can take."

[According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2018 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/syphilis.htm), "the P&S [primary and secondary] syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. This rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis has been primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM account for the majority of P&S syphilis cases, and estimated rates are substantially higher among MSM, compared with women or men who have sex with women only (MSW). The number of cases among MSM has continued to increase, but within the last 5 years, cases among MSW and women have increased substantially as well. The increase in syphilis among women is of particular concern because it is associated with a striking and concurrent increase in congenital syphilis. These recent trends highlight the importance of national syphilis surveillance to understand the current epidemiology of syphilis in the United States and to focus prevention efforts."

"In 2018, the total case count of reported syphilis (all stages combined: P&S, early non-primary non-secondary, unknown duration or late, and congenital) was the highest recorded since 1991."

During 2017-2018, the P&S syphilis rate increased 16.4% in the Midwest, 15.6% in the South, 15.4% in the West, and 10.1% in the Northeast (Figure 36, Table 27). During 2014-2018, the proportion of primary and secondary syphilis cases that reported injection drug use within the past 12 months doubled among women and MSW but decreased slightly among MSM cases.

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Carter County, with a population of 47 557 (2010), is in south-central Oklahoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_County,_Oklahoma); its county seat is Ardmore, with an estimated population of 24 698 in 2019 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardmore,_Oklahoma). - Mod.ML
