The number of cases of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in the 7 high-risk
districts of Uttar Pradesh has shot up with the arrival of the
monsoon, despite the extensive immunisation undertaken by the
government to control it. The state has already seen 79 more cases and
10 more deaths due to encephalitis till 5 Jul [2011], as compared to
last year [2010].

According to reports received by the Medical and Health Department,
last year [2010] the state recorded 371 cases and 67 deaths from acute
encephalitis syndrome (AES), while this year [2011] the number of
cases has already reached 450 and deaths 77. Similar is the case with
JE. Until 5 Jul 2010, the state had seen merely 5 cases and one death
from JE, but this time the number of JE cases is already 20, with 3
deaths.

The worst affected districts are Gorakhpur with 111 cases and 21
deaths of AES so far, closely followed by Deoria (109 cases and 15
deaths), and Kushinagar (103 cases and 22 deaths). JE cases have also
been reported from these 3 districts along with Basti,
Siddharthanagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, and Maharajganj.

[This is a JE virus endemic area, and so with the onset of the annual
monsoon season, it is not surprising that cases of infection by this
virus are occurring. It would be of interest to know the vaccine
coverage of the large populations in these areas. Again, as in reports
from previous years, there are reported this year (2011) cases of JE
virus infection, mixed with cases of "acute encephalitis syndrome"
(AES) of undetermined etiology.

The 28 Jul 2010 edition of The Pioneer
(http://www.dailypioneer.com/272045/Mystery-virus-besets-east-UP.html)
quoted the director general (medical & health), Dr RR Bharti as
saying, "When even the local unit of the National Institute of
Virology (NIV) Pune, based in Gorakhpur, failed to arrive at any
conclusion [about the etiology of non-JE virus AES cases], Bharti
requested the Union Health Ministry to intervene. A team of Union
Health Ministry officials and scientists from the Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR) -- along with Bharti and Dr SP Ram -- visited
Gorakhpur on Saturday [24 Jul 2010]. However, they also failed to
diagnose the viral strain causing deaths of children in the region.
"At times, it shows symptoms of an enterovirus [meningitis?] but not
uniformly, so we cannot arrive at any concrete conclusion," said
Bharti (see ProMED-mail archive no 20100728.2535).

There was no indication in any of the previous reports of AES cases
that samples were sent to any of the WHO world reference centers to
determine the etiology involved in these AES cases. Without a
diagnosis, it will not be possible to develop a rational prevention
strategy.
