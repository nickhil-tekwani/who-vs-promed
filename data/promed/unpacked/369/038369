Antibody tests showed Tuesday [30 Aug 2005] that chickens at 7 more farms in
Ibaraki Prefecture may have been infected with a bird flu virus of the H5
strain in the past, the prefectural government said.
Chickens at 2 farms near the 7 in the town of Ogawa have already tested
positive for antibodies to the virus.

"There is a possibility that the infection route of this bird influenza
outbreak might be the result of unauthorized application of a vaccine", said
Prof Hiroshi Kida from Hokkaido University, chairman of the government's
poultry diseases subcommittee.
Japan had detected bird flu cases in 28 farms in Ibaraki and one farm in
Saitama since June 2005, by serological tests that indicated an H5 past
infection. In 7 farms, a virus was detected.
Gene sequencing by the National Institute of Animal Health showed that the
Japanese virus had 94 to 97 percent [identity] with virus strains from Mexico
and Guatemala.
The source of the virus introduction remains obscure: no live chickens are
known to have been imported; no import, manufacturing, or use of bird flu
vaccine has been allowed. The use of bird flu vaccine is illegal and subject
to criminal prosecution. There is only a stockpile for emergency use, which
has not been authorised so far.
The study showed differences between the Japanese strain and strains used in
vaccines sold abroad.
Some farmers absolutely denied having used such vaccines.

[According to Japan's recent update to the OIE, sent on 23 Aug 2005, 3 newly
detected foci in Saitama and Ibaraki prefectures have been caused by low
pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtype H5N2. The affected populations
showed little or no clinical signs of the disease.
The use of an inactivated vaccine will cause serological reactions, but (if
properly inactivated) not lead to virus isolation. The official Japanese
follow-up report mentioned virus isolation among the laboratory findings.
Hence, the possibility of a vaccine-related incident seems remote, unless a
deficient, poorly inactivated vaccine (or a live vaccine?!) was used.
