Rift Valley fever is spreading rapidly in the Eastern Cape [province]
and has reached as close to Nelson Mandela Bay as Humansdorp and the
Tsitsikamma area. Senior manager and director for veterinary services
in the Eastern Cape, Dr Cedisa Mnqeta, said there were now 45 farms
in the province which had tested positive for the fever and more test
results were outstanding. There have also been 8 confirmed human
cases in the province. Rift Valley fever can be spread to humans by
handling animals and their blood, and by mosquitoes.

The latest outbreak of the disease has just been confirmed on a
Tsitsikamma dairy farm and the Eastern Cape Veterinary Services
believe this outbreak is potentially very serious as it is unlikely
mosquitoes will die out over winter in this area. Mnqeta confirmed
that farms which tested positive for Rift Valley fever are in the
Cradock, Humansdorp, Middelburg, Hofmeyr, Steynsburg, Graaff-Reinet,
Jansenville, and Tsitsikamma areas.

Of the 8 confirmed human cases, 2 were veterinary services staff
members, 5 were farm workers who worked with animals and one was a
township resident suspected of coming into contact with diseased
meat. There are almost 200 confirmed cases in the country.

Agri Eastern Cape has warned farmers to take preventative measures,
such a vaccinating livestock to prevent the disease from spreading,
which would impact negatively on the province's agricultural economy.
The manager of veterinary services in the western region of the
Eastern Cape, Dr Jane Pistorius, said it was important that farmers
vaccinate their stock, even in areas to which the disease is not
expected to spread. She expressed concern that many farmers did not
report possible outbreaks of the disease because of the fact that
China had stopped importing South African wool because of the disease.

[The number of human cases of Rift Valley fever in Eastern Cape
province was reported on Sun 9 May 2010 to be 13 (one of whom was a
fatal case) in contrast to the figure of 8 given in this report. The
reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Indeed, overall this report
lacks quantitative data to support its content.
