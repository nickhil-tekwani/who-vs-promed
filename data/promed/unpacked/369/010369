For the year 2006 in Bavaria, 63 cases of avian influenza in wild
birds have been confirmed by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI).
During the week of 13 Apr 2006 (2:00 PM) until 21 Apr 2006 (12 noon),
the following new cases were confirmed:
No. / Municipality / Administrative or City District / Regional
District / Species / Date H5N1 confirmed
63 / Burghausen / Altoetting / Upper Bavaria / Gadwell Duck / 20 Apr 2006
62 / Oeberau / Town of Straubing / Lower Bavaria / Falcon /20 Apr 2006
61 / Oberottmarshausen / Augsburg / Schwabia / Owl / 13 Apr 2006
60 / Strasslach-Dingharting / Munich / Upper Bavaria / Owl / 13 Apr 2006
So far in 2006, 6452 wild birds have been handed over to the Bavarian
Agency for Health and Food Safety; 5698 of them have already [by
21Apr 2006] been tested for influenza A, and the 81 samples that were
influenza A positive have been sent to the Friedrich Loeffler
Institute (FLI) for further testing. The FLI has confirmed 63 samples
as H5N1 positive, 17 as H5N1 negative, and 1 has yet to be determined.
In addition to avians, 277 carnivores (martens, foxes, cats) have
been sent to the LGL; 269 have been tested for influenza A virus. One
influenza A positive sample has been forwarded to the FLI, where it
was found H5N1 negative.

[Though the incidence (or, rather, detection rate) of H5N1 infection
in wild birds in Bavaria continues to maintain a constant pace (3-5
cases per week), the spectrum of the affected/detected birds seems to
shift from aquatic birds to raptors. Explanatory attempts from
ornithologists will be welcomed.

of the journal Science, dedicated to Influenza. A review titled
"Global Patterns of Influenza A Virus in Wild Birds", by Bjorn Olsen
and 6 co-authors, including maps, can be found on pages 384-388. The
authors discuss available data and identify important gaps in the
current knowledge regarding H5N1 in wild birds. - Mod.AS]

[2] Norway - vaccination, penguins

Fri 21 Apr 2006, 8 penguins became the first birds in Norway
vaccinated against bird flu after an aquarium won an 8-month battle
with health authorities, a newspaper reported.
"The safest birds in the Nordic region," declared a headline in
Bergen's Tidende newspaper. The paper said the birds were among the
first in northern Europe to get the vaccine.
The Bergen Aquarium, in western Norway's main city, had been trying
since October 2005 to get government authorization for the vaccinations.
The Norwegian Food Protection Authority, which must approve such
cases, refused since no outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain have been
found in Norway and it frowns on overuse use of vaccines.
On Friday, the authority relented and granted approval. But after 2
of the 8 birds were vaccinated, it withdrew the permit, only to give
the final go ahead a few hours later.
"When we had already vaccinated 2, they said go ahead and do the
rest,"Aquarium director Kees Ekeli was quoted as saying. He said the
agency was changing its rules so that "zoos and aquariums are not
treated the same as farmers with 25 000 hens."
The vaccine does not guarantee the birds won't contract H5N1 but
helps protect against influenza.
According to the Norwegian news agency NTB, the first bird vaccinated
was 9-month-old Pingrid Alexandra, whose name plays on that of
Norway's future queen, Ingrid Alexandra.
Pingrid Alexandra promptly threw up, while the other birds did not
appear to have an adverse reaction.

[If the above information is accurate, Norway has become, to the best
of our knowledge, the first European country which allowed (albeit,
on an extremely restricted basis) vaccination of avians in spite the
fact that no H5N1 infection, in wild or domestic birds, has been
recorded within its boundaries. This might have been done within the
provisions of Section 3, articles 56-57: preventive vaccination, in
the European Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 Dec 2005 on Community
measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC.
It may be assumed the vaccine used was, in line with the EU
provisions, an inactivated H5N2 "DIVA" (Differentiating Infected
from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine; see 20050307.0680,
20030428.1047. Such vaccines are currently commercially available. - Mod.AS]

[3] France, wild birds

2 more swans have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu in France, authorities in the affected region said.
The swans were found this week in Saint-Paul-de-Varax in the Ain
region of southeast France, some 45 km from the city of Lyon.
A national laboratory on Friday confirmed they were infected with
H5N1, the Ain region's prefecture said.
Anti-bird flu protection and surveillance zones were put in place for
10 km around the spot where the 2 dead swans were found. The measures
will be in place for a month.
The Ain is the epicentre of French efforts to combat bird flu,
recording 65 of the 66 cases of H5N1 found so far in 2006 in tests on
more than 14 000 dead wild birds in France.
The other case was in the Bouches-du-Rhone region further south.

[4] UK (Scotland): restrictions lifted
Date: Sat, 22 Apr 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

Some bird flu restrictions, imposed after a dead whooper swan at
Cellardyke in Fife tested positive for a strain of the H5N1 virus,
have been lifted.
The measures, limiting the movement of poultry and eggs in parts of
eastern Scotland, were introduced on 5 Apr 2006.
Tests since then have established that no further cases have been found.
The immediate 3-km protection zone will lapse, but a 10-km control
zone on the movement of poultry and captive birds will not be removed
until 1 May 2006.
The final restrictions will only be lifted if there are no further
positive tests for the virus. So far tests for the virus -- which
can be passed to humans -- on all dead birds across Scotland have
proved negative.
First Minister Jack McConnell announced the lifting of the
restrictions to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday [20 Apr 2006].
Vets now believe the swan which had the virus died before it could
spread the disease. But the discovery of the bird at Cellardyke
harbour prompted fears of a possible outbreak of bird flu in Scotland.
Restrictions followed and local farms were warned not to transport
poultry or eggs in or out of the area.
The Scottish Executive intends that the Wild Bird Risk Area -- east
of the M90/A90 stretching from the Forth Bridge to Stonehaven -- will
lapse on 1 May, subject to a veterinary risk assessment. [For a
detailed map, see
<http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/915/0026441.pdf>. - Mod.AS]
The restrictions on the movement of birds are also due to end on that date.
In making the announcements, Mr McConnell praised the work of vets
and other officials who, he said, reacted quickly and effectively to
what could have been a serious outbreak. He said people had responded
"calmly and reasonably".
"I think we all know the damage that can be done when people panic,"
said Mr McConnell.
