New cases of foot and mouth reported
-----------------------------------------
There have been 2 new cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] located
in Cyprus. According to reports the new cases are in the Dromolaxia district.

Speaking on CyBC state radio the Chief Veterinary officer Charalambos
Kakoyiannis added that 9000 clinical samples had been taken from
livestock by the authorities. [This may refer to serum samples. - Mod.AS]

[Are these findings indicative of "outbreaks?" According to reliable
sources, they are just indicative of sporadic positive serology (in
one flock, one seropositive animal and in the other flock, 19
seropositives). Both flocks are in the Survelliance Zone.

The background to the creation of the antibodies may be sought in
several directions, one of them being past (unauthorised)
vaccination. Another scenario: the introduction of vaccinated animals
(from abroad or from the Turkish-controlled part) into the affected flocks.

Since the start of the event, all findings have been serological,
affecting a small number of sheep within flocks in the Larnaca area
(the villages Dromoxala and Koshi). PCR and probang-sampled tests
were negative. Except the 1st suspected sheep, which had slight
buccal changes initially (and, most probably, rightly so) regarded to
be bluetongue-related, no other animals showed any symptoms reminiscent of FMD.

Not a single suspected case has been recorded in the 9 bovine farms
(1822 animals) and 76 sheep-and-goat farms (15 561 animals) within 3
km of the index farm. Similarly, no suspected cases have been
detected within the 10 km zone, including 11 023 bovines in 61 farms,
75 758 sheep-and-goats in 430 farms, and 8000 sows and 70 000 piglets
in 26 farms.

According to data presented in Brussels on 19 Nov 2007, the national
Cyprus veterinary laboratory had tested, up to the above date, a
total of 7064 serum samples. 6729 of them were sampled from sheep and
goats, in 209 samplings (124 NSP positive), 69 from cattle in 13
samplings (all negative) and 266 from pigs in 53 samplings (all negative).

On 5 Nov 2007, Cyprus submitted an immediate notification on FMD to
the OIE, pertaining to 2 "outbreaks." An update is due.

This strange event has been characterised by EU-dictated cullings and
other control measures; convincing evidence for a circulating virus
is still lacking. - Mod.AS]
