Follow-Up on Outbreak of Bat-Transmitted Human Rabies in Para State, Brazil
----------------------------------------------
To follow up on the outbreak of bat-transmitted human rabies detected in
the city of Portel, state of Para, Brazil, in January 2004, the last report
on 8 April [2004] indicates that 8 cases have been confirmed since our update
of 2 April, bringing the total to 13 cases of confirmed human rabies. Another
4 people are considered suspected cases (see Table 1), of which 2 have died.
Test results will be available shortly.
Among the new confirmed cases, the 1st occurred on 2 March [2004] (instead of
4 March, as indicated in last week's update) and the last on 1 April [2004]
(instead of 26 March).
This situation constitutes the largest reported outbreak of human rabies
transmitted by bats in the entire country. The causes of this extremely
rare event are currently being investigated by the Department of Health of
the state of Para, the Department of Health Surveillance and the state
Department of Agriculture. The bat attacks occurred mainly during the
months of September and October 2003. In the meantime, these episodes have
been frequent in the rural area of the Acuti Pereira River, where the
affected persons reside. Initial evaluations indicate the existence of more
than one colony of bats in the affected localities.

Ruled out 3 / 0
Total 20 / 15
Note: The number of deaths is included in the number of cases.
There are ongoing investigations of new cases and of prevention, control,
and treatment activities among the human population either affected or at
risk. In addition, there has been continued vaccination of dogs and cats in
the affected area, which has been extended to include 3 nearby cities
considered at risk. Other domestic animals are also being vaccinated.
