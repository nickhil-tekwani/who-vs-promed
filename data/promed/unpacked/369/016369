[Cases continue to occur in Saudi Arabia but at a lower level than during the months of October and November (2014). This most recently reported cases is in Najran, where there have been 2 other cases reported this month (a 28 year-old expat male reported on 2 Dec 2014 reported as recovered on 17 Dec 2014, and a 61 year-old Saudi male reported on 8 Dec 2014 and reported as having died on 14 Dec 2014 -- see ProMED-mail posts below for further details). All 3 cases from Najran this month (December 2014) had a history of animal exposure and denied contact with known or suspected MERS-CoV infected individuals in both the healthcare environment and the community. It would clearly be of interest to see results of testing of the animals these individuals had contact with to see if these animals were MERS-CoV infected and if so, with virus that is genetically related to the virus identified in these cases.
