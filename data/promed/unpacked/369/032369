The occurrence of citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) continues to drop in Brazil to only 0.46% of the orange trees, the lowest rate in the last 20 years. In the early 2000s, the incidence reached 46.8%. CVC causes early ripening and reduction in size of fruits, which can lose up to 75% of their weight, leading to a decrease in productivity.

Fundecitrus highlights the importance of the knowledge acquired in recent years and the rigorous management measures adopted. CVC is considered a success story to be followed for the management of greening, which in 2021 reached the highest level ever recorded in the citrus belt since 2004, with 22.37% of orange trees affected.

[Citrus variegated chlorosis
----------------------------
Variegated chlorosis of citrus (CVC) is caused by _Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf), which clogs the xylem of plants, leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. The bacterium causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive (also called 'olive quick decline syndrome'); peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; lucerne dwarf; and leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. Several subspecies of Xf have been proposed, and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seedborne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and, therefore, Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors but may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the pathogen and its main vectors are of serious international quarantine concern.

Citrus greening
---------------
Citrus greening (CG) is one of the most damaging diseases of the crops, affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening), or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause symptoms similar to greening disease in citrus; coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been recorded (see ProMED posts 20180214.5629251, 20190329.6392077). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology, and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. CG is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, as well as chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods or biological control of vectors is being trialled. Antibiotics are used occasionally to treat CG (see for example, ProMED posts 20181119.6154764, 20190320.6377319), but are subject to strict regulations in most countries.

In South America, citrus in colder areas has been found less affected by CG (ProMED post 20201207.7999673), possibly due to vector insects in colder temperatures being less active. However, elsewhere citrus psyllids have been found at increasing altitudes (ProMED post 20161129.4660906), potentially due to increasing overall temperatures due to warming climates.
