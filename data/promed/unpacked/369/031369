Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire - WHO Update 5
--------------------------------------------
As of Mon 24 Sep 2001, the Ministry of Health has reported 169 cases,
of which 22 are laboratory confirmed, and 20 deaths in 20 districts of
the country. In Abidjan, a total of 42 suspected cases, of which 7 are
laboratory confirmed and 7 deaths have been reported.
The immunization campaign targeting 2.9 million persons began at 2
p.m. on Fri 21 Sep 2001. Approximately 775 000 persons have been
immunized in 3 days (21 to 23 Sep 2001). Active surveillance is taking
place and surveillance programmes for adverse events following
immunization have been established, along with vector control
activities.
Two million doses of vaccine were delivered to Abidjan during the
week of 17 Sep 2001 to complement the existing stocks of 300 000
doses. Vaccine stocks are projected to run out on 28 Sep 2001. An
additional 600 000 doses are needed and WHO is working closely with
its partners to purchase the vaccine.
WHO has launched an appeal to dispatch these crucially needed
vaccines for the mass immunization campaign.
