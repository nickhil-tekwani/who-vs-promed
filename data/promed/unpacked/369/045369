-----------------------------------------------
The commentary to the above post included the following redundant segment, which was erroneously included:

"Most strains of the capripox virus causing the disease entity termed by the OIE as "sheep pox and goat pox" cause the disease either in sheep or in goats; however, there are some strains that will infect both species." The segment should be deleted.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Nick Honhold for kindly pointing out this error, which the moderator regrets.

PPRV, a morbillivirus, affects both sheep and goats.
