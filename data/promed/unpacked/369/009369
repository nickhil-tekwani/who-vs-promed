Possible Transmission of Dengue Virus by Blood Transfusion
---------------------------------------------------
A shipment of dengue fever [virus-contaminated] blood from Hong Kong has
arrived in Australia, officials from the Chinese territory have warned.
Today's alert comes after 2 people in Hong Kong contracted the potentially
fatal illness from the same batch of blood sent to Australia.
There was no immediate comment from Australian health authorities. Hong Kong
has reported 36 cases of dengue fever since an outbreak began in September
2002. The blood sent to Australia is now feared linked to that outbreak.
Hong Kong officials are checking whether other dengue fever patients in the
territory have contracted the disease from donated blood, said Jacqueline
Cheuk, a Hong Kong government spokeswoman.
The cases of the 2 patients mark the first time the disease has spread from
medical blood use in Hong Kong. It is normally contracted from mosquito
bites. The growing number of cases has raised fears of an epidemic in Hong
Kong, prompting the government to try to exterminate mosquitoes.

Australia Not at Risk from Dengue Virus Contaminated Blood
-------------------------------------------------
Australian blood supplies would not be affected by a shipment of dengue
[virus-contaminated] blood from Hong Kong, federal authorities said today.
Hong Kong health officials issued a warning after 2 people there contracted
the potentially fatal disease from a batch of blood sent from Hong Kong to
Australia for screening.
Therapeutic Goods Administration spokeswoman Kay McNiece said no blood from
Hong Kong was used in the Australian supply. "Australia is self-sufficient
with blood," she said. "There is no suggestion that blood from Hong Kong or
anywhere else would get into the Australian blood supply." She stressed that
while CSL and the Red Cross provided blood services to Hong Kong, no
overseas blood was used in the Australian system.
"Australia does provide a service to Hong Kong, which is done by CSL
laboratories, to import blood from Hong Kong to screen and make blood
products, and then export those products back to Hong Kong," she said. "This
process is totally segregated from the production of Australia's blood
supply. In addition, the Red Cross Blood Service tests some blood for Hong
Kong and sends it back. But again, this is totally segregated from the
Australian blood supply."
Hong Kong has reported 36 cases of dengue fever since an outbreak began in
September 2002. The blood sent to Australia was feared linked to that
outbreak.

PATIENTS GIVEN DENGUE-INFECTED BLOOD
Two patients have been given blood infected with dengue fever after the
disease worked its way into Hong Kong's blood transfusion supply. One
patient later died of cancer, while a 72-year-old woman was infected with
dengue fever after receiving blood during an operation at Queen Mary
Hospital, health officials said last night.
Some of the contaminated blood was sent to Australia but was recalled before
it was used, the Hospital Authority said.
The blood came from a 17-year-old Ma Wan resident, who developed symptoms on
18
Jul 2002. A day earlier he gave blood through one of Hong Kong's Blood
Transfusion Service centres. He was confirmed as a dengue case on 7 Oct 2002
and the Hospital Authority was alerted about his blood donation.
The elderly woman received the donor's red blood cells on 24 Aug 2002. She
developed a fever on 27 Aug 2002 and was transferred to Tsuen Wan Hospital.
She was discharged on 1 Oct 2002, a spokesman for the Department of Health
said. Tests were done on her earlier this week and yesterday the diagnosis
of dengue fever was confirmed. [Some critical information is missing here.
Local transmission of dengue was first recognised on Ma Wan island (see
refs. below). If she was a resident there, she could possibly have got
dengue from a mosquito bite -- autochthonous transmission of dengue was
recognised only in September 2002, but cases could presumably have been
missed earlier. But if she is not a resident & has no travel history, it
would be reasonable to conclude that she got the virus from the
transfusion. - Mod.JW]
"While it is uncommon to be infected with dengue fever through blood
transfusion, there is a probability that the patient receiving the red blood
cells was infected through blood transfusion," the Hospital Authority said.
The authority appealed to donors to inform the Blood Transfusion Service as
soon as possible if they had symptoms of dengue fever after donating blood.
The dengue virus might be present in the blood of infected individuals from
one to 2 days before onset of symptoms to 5 days after onset. The virus can
stay in stored blood for weeks, as happened in this case.
The service screens for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and Human
T-lymphotropic virus. The authority insisted no country with incidents of
dengue fever was testing donated blood for dengue fever, but promised staff
at the Blood Transfusion Service would remain vigilant.
As well as the elderly woman, a 36-year-old man who worked in Ma Wan was
confirmed as having contracted dengue locally, bringing to 20 the number of
such cases in the current outbreak. A new imported case was also detected
yesterday, taking the number of such
cases to 16 this year.

[Taken together, these reports indicate that blood donated in the Hong Kong
SAR was sent to Australia for routine screening and, after return to the
Hong Kong SAR, was used in medical treatment. Subsequently 2 patients
receiving transfusions of this blond contracted dengue fever. This appears
to be the first report of the transmission of dengue virus infection by
transfusion of virus-contaminated blood. While this is a feasible route of
transmission of dengue virus, in view of the transfusion-associated cases of
West Nile fever recently reported in the United States (see refs. below), it
is a rather surprising event, since dengue virus has only recently appeared
in Hong Kong, and the probability of transfusion of blood from a viremic
donor would be expected to be very low. It is not clear whether infectious
dengue virus has been isolated directly from the suspect blood donation. If
correct, the observation has implications for blood donation practice in
other parts of the world where dengue virus is more prevalent. Further
details are awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
