SUMMARY SITUATION REPORT
Issued on 3 Sep 2007
This information is an update on information provided on 1 Sep 2007,
which should be referred to for background information.
1. Key Points
Equine Influenza (EI) was 1st detected at Eastern Creek Quarantine
Station (ECQS), Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on 17 Aug
2007. Sick horses were seen on 22 Aug 2007 at Centennial Parklands
Equestrian Centre (CPEC) in Sydney.
There are currently 134 infected premises (IPs) in Australia; 19 of
these are in Queensland (Qld) and the remainder in NSW. There are
currently more than 240 dangerous contact properties (DCPs) being
assessed and more than 200 are in NSW. The number of new IPs is still climbing.
The disease is expected to continue to spread within the population
of racehorses at Randwick racecourse in Sydney. State-wide horse
movement bans remain in place in Queensland, New South Wales, and the
Australian Capital Territory. Other jurisdictions have partially
lifted their movement bans. Non-essential gatherings of horses
continue to be discouraged in all states and territories. Almost all
IPs continue to be detected on the basis of tracing information.
2. Current Situation
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory has identified the virus as
H3 Equine Influenza.
New South Wales
Restricted areas (RAs) have been amalgamated. There are 10: Sydney
Metropolitan and its Environs, Centennial Park and Redfern, Broughton
(near Gerringong), Hornsby, Hunter Valley and Tamworth, Lake
Macquarie, Mount Hunter (near Camden), Moree, Parkes, Terry Hie Hie
(south-east of Moree). There are potentially 4 new RAs to declare.
Queensland
There are 19 IPs in Queensland, 42 DCPs. The IPs are near Warwick,
Minden, Rosewood , Brisbane west, Tamborine and Goondiwindi.
Neighbours of all IPs and DCPs are being contacted as a part of
strategy to address lateral spread risk.
Other jurisdictions
Surveillance activities in all states continue unchanged. Suspect
cases of EI must be reported to state authorities. It is an offence
not to report.
3. Response
State and local disease control centres have been established in NSW
and Qld with forward command posts in relevant locations. These
centres are coordinating and managing the response in each state.
