No fewer than 2000 cases of measles have been reported in the 20 local
government areas of Bauchi State. A World Health Organization (WHO)
Consultant, Dr. Habu Dahiru, made the disclosure during an in-house
training for members of the Bauchi State Chapter of Journalists
Initiatives on Immunization Against Polio, (JAP) in Bauchi.

Dahiru said Bauchi, Katagum and Toro local government areas had the
highest number of cases, making it alarmingly high compared to
reported cases in the same period last year [2010]. He described the
outbreak as alarming, considering the morbidity ratio which increased
in the last few months. Dahiru also said surveillance indicated that
the outbreak had spread to children who were above the initial target
of under 5 years, a development he said called for urgent attention by
all concerned medical and health authorities in order to check its
spread.

He stated that WHO and other donor agencies including UNICEF [United
Nations Children's Fund] were always ready to intervene. He called on
journalists to support the campaign through regular reports in the
media, as well as enlightening members of the public on the need to
cooperate during the immunization and vaccination exercise, which was
scheduled to be held later in the month [January 2011].

The WHO consultant pointed out that fixed units had been put in place
in all health facilities across the state for vaccination, while
mobile units would go from house to house to vaccinate children under
5 years. In her presentation on the overview of measles in Nigeria and
Bauchi State in particular, Mrs. Mojishola Afolabi of WHO said the
situation was still redeemable with concerted efforts by all the
medical and health stakeholders, pointing out that the involvement of
journalists in the Integrated Measles Campaign (IMC) would be of added
advantage, as people would be made aware that the disease was around
the corner. Afolabi added that the IMC would be done alongside the
normal [poliovirus] Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) in order to ensure
that the state maintained its zero WPV [wild poliovirus] status
attained since September 2009, when the last case was recorded in
Dambam Local Government Area.

Executive Chairman of the Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development
Agency Dr. Musa Mohammed Dambam confirmed the outbreak but gave
assurances that enough vaccine was expected from the National Primary
Healthcare Development Agency as well as other donor agencies for the
IMC later in the month [January 2011]. Musa Dambam also expressed
worry that the situation had been made more difficult with the
infection of people of older ages by the disease, thereby increasing
morbidity by 2.0 percent, assuring, however, that the situation would
soon get back to normal, calling on journalists to join in the
campaign through their various media organisations.

[The Global Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, was a long-term
commitment and partnership among leaders in public health and
supported the goal of reducing measles deaths globally by 90 percent
by 2010 compared to 2000 estimates. Considerable progress toward that
goal was achieved, but recently in some parts of Africa, and in
Nigeria in particular, there has been a resurgence of measles during
the past year [2010]. It is hoped that the situation in Bauchi state
can be contained and reversed by an aggressive vaccination campaign.
