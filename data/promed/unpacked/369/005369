It is feared that the dreaded mosquito-borne chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) is making a comeback after a 2-year absence. Reports of
people falling victim to chikungunya are coming in from rural areas.
Scattered rains around the country are encouraging the spread of the
virus, according to a Health Ministry official.

Dr. Hasitha Tissera, consultant community physician of the
Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, said laboratory tests
conducted in November and December last year [2008] revealed more
than 3000 cases of CHIKV in 4 districts: Ratnapura, Moneragala,
Ampara and Polonnaruwa.

Dr. Tissera said areas not affected during the 2006 CIHKV outbreak
may be vulnerable this time around because of the current weather
conditions and that people in urban areas where the virus was
prevalent in 2006 might enjoy a degree of immunity.

"As a result of the rains, areas not affected in 2006 may be affected
this year [2009]," Dr. Tissera said. "Because a large number of CHIKV
cases were reported in urban areas in 2006, we expect a long-term
immunity to help control the spread of the disease."

"Steps must be taken to stop the disease from spreading," he said.
"All breeding spots where rain water can collect should be
eliminated. 90 percent of the breeding of these mosquitoes takes
place in man-made receptacles, such as discarded tires, flower pots,
bird baths, broken coconut shells, plastic containers, as well as in
blocked drains. Only 5 percent of the breeding takes place in natural
breeding conditions."

[There is no indication in this report of how many cases of
chikungunya virus infection there have been or are suspected to be so
far in 2009, where they have occurred, or whether any have been
laboratory confirmed. ProMED would appreciate receiving this
additional information as it becomes available.
