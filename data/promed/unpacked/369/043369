A new vaccine against meningitis introduced five months ago has slashed
cases of the infectious disease in Britain by 75 percent among babies and
teenagers, the government said Tuesday. "This is welcome news for parents
and children. We are the first country in the world to have this new
vaccine. It puts the UK in the forefront of tackling this devastating
disease," Public Health Minister Yvette Cooper said in a statement.
The vaccine is for meningitis C which accounts for 40 percent of cases of
the disease and claimed the lives of 150 people in Britain in 1998. So far,
the campaign has been limited to the highest risk groups because of short
supplies of the vaccine, manufactured by Wyeth Vaccines, part of American
Home Products Corp (AHP.N). Britain hopes to extend the program to all
children under five by the summer.
"I hope that all parents take up the chance to have their children
protected when their invitations arrive. A second vaccine has been licensed
and is now being distributed. We aim to offer the vaccine to all young
people under 18 by the autumn -- a target of 15 million children," Cooper
said.
The Department of Health figures show that from December to March, cases
[caused by group C meningococci in 15- to 17-year-olds fell by 77 per
cent. Instead of the 70 cases expected by government health officials there
have been only 16 confirmed cases. The numbers were equally good for
babies under one year old. From the beginning of January to the middle of
March only 10 cases were reported from an expected 37 cases, a drop of 73
percent.
The UK is [reported to be the first country that has it available for
patients.
The drug was approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration in February
but it is not yet readily available in the United States.
When the vaccine was tested in a clinical trial of 19 000 children it was
100 percent effective in preventing the disease.
