The coronavirus is continuing to stalk the world at an astonishing clip, racing past a grim succession of pandemic milestones in 2022: totals of 300 million known cases around the world by early January, 400 million by early February and, as of Tuesday [12 Apr 2022], half a billion. There have almost certainly been far more infections than that among the global population of 7.9 billion, with many going undetected or unreported, and the reporting gap may only grow wider as some countries, including the United States, scale back official testing.

"That's dangerous," Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, and formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent interview. "If you don't test, then you don't know what variants you have."

Regional officials with the World Health Organization (WHO) recently urged African countries to ramp up testing and contact tracing, and called for some countries in the Americas to double down on efforts to increase vaccination and testing as cases remained higher in Europe. (Britain, for instance, has ended free testing.) A WHO analysis also recently estimated that 65% of Africans had been infected with the coronavirus as of September 2021, nearly 100 times the number of confirmed cases on the continent.

The number of new cases reported around the globe each day has been declining for some time now; the average over the past week has been about 1.1 million cases a day, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. That's about 32% fewer than 2 weeks ago.

But over the course of the pandemic, countries with limited public health resources may only have detected and confirmed a tiny fraction of the cases in their populations. And more recent figures may miss many at-home rapid test results that are never officially reported. Many people with infections are never tested at all because they have no symptoms, or lack access to testing, or want to avoid the consequences of a positive test result, or choose not to for other reasons.

Coronavirus deaths have also been declining. The world reported about 3800 a day on average over the past week, 23% fewer than 2 weeks ago. Still, the director-general of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recently said that the world remains in the acute phase of the pandemic, and many health experts agree.

Experts' warnings have not stopped many nations from dropping their pandemic precautions almost completely in the 2 months since the global case count surpassed 400 million. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines in late February [2022] suggesting that most Americans could stop wearing masks, and no longer needed to maintain social distance or avoid crowded indoor spaces.

"What's happening globally and in the United States," Dr. Mokdad said, "is that people basically gave up. They just want to go back to normal life."

[2] Long COVID neuropathology

Abstract
--------
Neurological manifestations are a significant complication of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but underlying mechanisms aren't well understood. The development of animal models that recapitulate the neuropathological findings of autopsied brain tissue from patients who died from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are critical for elucidating the neuropathogenesis of infection and disease. Here, we show neuroinflammation, microhemorrhages, brain hypoxia, and neuropathology that is consistent with hypoxic-ischemic injury in SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates (NHPs), including evidence of neuron degeneration and apoptosis. Importantly, this is seen among infected animals that do not develop severe respiratory disease, which may provide insight into neurological symptoms associated with "long COVID." Sparse virus is detected in brain endothelial cells but does not associate with the severity of central nervous system (CNS) injury. We anticipate our findings will advance our current understanding of the neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infected NHPs are a highly relevant animal model for investigating COVID-19 neuropathogenesis among human subjects.

Discussion
----------
While SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenic processes are poorly understood, this work reveals infected NHPs are a viable animal model for understanding the neuropathogenesis and potential long-term consequences of infection. We also provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying CNS disease, which was seen even in the absence of severe respiratory disease and may suggest that vascular leakage and hypoxic brain injury is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Neuronal degeneration and activation of caspase 3 observed in this study supports this notion and indicates non-reversible neuronal injury may be significant to individuals suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC [or long COVID]). Finally, our findings and conclusions presented herein suggest the need for long-term neurological follow-up of persistently symptomatic convalescent patients.

[3] Omicron subvariants
[A] WHO: BA.4 and BA.5
Date: Tue 12 Apr 2022 19:21 IST
Source: DNA [edited]
https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-who-tracks-two-new-omicron-sub-variants-ba4-and-ba5-2945743


The World Health Organization (WHO) Monday [11 Apr 2022] said that it is tracking a few dozen cases of 2 new sub-variants -- BA.4 and BA.5 -- of omicron. The global health body said it is assessing whether the 2 new variants are more infectious or dangerous. The WHO is already tracking BA.1 and BA.2 -- now globally dominant -- as well as BA.1.1 and BA.3.

Both BA.4 and BA.5 are sister variants of the original BA.1 omicron variant. Only a few dozen cases of BA.4 and BA.5 have been reported to the global GISAID database, according to WHO.

The WHO said it had begun tracking them because of their "additional mutations that need to be further studied to understand their impact on immune escape potential." Viruses mutate all the time, but only some mutations affect their ability to spread or evade prior immunity from vaccination or infection, or the severity of disease they cause.

Meanwhile, BA.2 variant of omicron now represents nearly 94% of all sequenced cases and is more transmissible than its siblings. However, the evidence so far suggests it is no more likely to cause severe disease.

The UK's Health Security Agency said last week BA.4 had been found in South Africa, Denmark, Botswana, Scotland and England from 10 Jan 2022 to 30 Mar 2022. All the BA.5 cases were in South Africa as of last week, but on Monday [11 Apr 2022] Botswana's health ministry said it had identified 4 cases of BA.4 and BA.5, all among people aged 30 to 50 who were fully vaccinated and experiencing mild symptoms.

Date: Tue 12 Apr 2022

The Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness announced on Monday [11 Apr 2022] the discovery of a new COVID-19 variant, health authorities said. "Our scientists have been investigating new coronavirus mutations detected in Botswana," said Dr Christopher Nyanga, Permanent Secretary from the Botswana Health Ministry.

Dr Nyanga said that on further analysis and verification, the mutations, which had been detected in 4 people in Botswana, had been noted as a new sublineage of the omicron variant. "The preliminary finding of this new sublineage in Botswana has been designated as omicron BA.4 and BA.5. The 4 cases are currently being monitored to gather more information about the potential impact on disease spread and severity."

The ministry said the foursome comprise residents and non-residents aged between 30 and 50 years, 2 being non-residents who had a recent travel history.

[[Related] BA.4:

"Countries detected: South Africa (30 including 21 in Gauteng), Botswana (3), Denmark (3), United Kingdom (2)

"Mutations differing with respect to BA.2:
S: L452R, F486V
ORF7b: L11F*
N: P151S*
nuc: G12160A
*These 2 don't always seem to be picked up; G12160A is a better marker outside the spike.

"In addition, there might be reversions ORF1a:F3201L and S:R493Q, but someone with more expertise can weigh in on whether these are real.

"Notably, 452 and 486 are 2 of the biggest antigenic sites that are not already hit by BA.2 mutations; 452R might knock out some of the same antibodies that 446S does in BA.1.

"This lineage has risen quickly to a large proportion of BA.2 in Gauteng. The sample sizes are very small, but as there are signals that prevalence is rising again in South Africa, I think this is worth keeping an eye on."

[C] Omicron XE: Japan ex USA
Date: Tue 12 Apr 2022
Source: CNBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/12/new-omicron-xe-variant-detected-in-japan-as-uk-cases-rise-.html


Key points:
- Japan's health ministry said Monday [11 Apr 2022] that the new XE variant, first detected in the UK, was found in a woman in her 30s who arrived at Narita Airport.
- The XE subvariant is a so-called recombinant, or mix, of 2 earlier omicron strains, BA.1 and BA.2.
- 1125 cases of XE have so far been detected in the UK, almost double the previous count, according to the latest statistics from the UK Health Security Agency.

Japan has reported its 1st case of omicron XE -- a new COVID-19 strain first detected in the UK -- just as British cases of the subvariant rise.

The XE variant was found in a woman in her 30s who arrived at Narita International Airport from the US on 26 Mar 2022. The woman, whose nationality was not immediately disclosed, was asymptomatic, Japan's health ministry said Monday [11 Apr 2022].

It comes as cases of the new strain have almost doubled in Britain, according to the latest statistics from the UK Health Security Agency.

As of 5 Apr [2022], 1125 cases of XE had been identified in the UK, up from 637 on 25 Mar [2022]. The earliest confirmed case has a specimen date of 19 Jan of this year [2022], suggesting it could have been in circulation in the population for several months.

XE has since been detected in Thailand, India, and Israel. It is suspected that the latter Israeli cases may have developed independently. The US has not yet reported any XE cases.

"We continue to monitor cases of the recombinant XE variant in the UK, which currently represents a very small proportion of cases," Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said in a statement.

On Sunday [10 Apr 2022], the UK reported 41 469 new COVID cases, with a 7-day average of 59 578 cases. As such, XE likely accounts for only a small percentage of total COVID cases currently.

How worried should we be?

Early estimates suggest XE may be more transmissible than earlier strains, having so far demonstrated a slightly higher growth rate than its predecessor.

UKHSA data shows XE has a growth rate of 9.8% above that of BA.2, while the World Health Organization has so far put that figure at 10%.

However, experts say they expect it to wane in severity even as it spreads more easily. XE has so far not been declared a variant of concern.

"XE seems to be moving in the same direction as BA.2, having an increased transmissibility to BA.1 but being less severe," Jennifer Horney, professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware, told CNBC.

"It is the devil we know, so to speak. [It is] essentially a reshuffling of the same deck of cards," added Mark Cameron, associate professor in the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University.

XE contains spike and structural proteins from the same virus family, i.e., omicron, meaning that it should, theoretically at least, behave as omicron has done before. Existing vaccines and immunity should, therefore, provide some level of protection against infection.

"Recombinants that contain the spike and structural proteins from a single virus (like XE or XF) are fairly likely to act similarly to [their] parental virus," Tom Peacock, virologist at Imperial College London's Department of Infectious Disease, wrote in a thread of tweets in mid-March [2022]. XF refers to another recombinant previously detected in the UK in February [2022].

However, other recombinants containing spike and structural proteins from different virus families continue to emerge. That includes the XD subvariant, recently discovered in Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark, which contains delta structural proteins and omicron spike proteins and which Peacock described as "a little more concerning."

As such, all new emergences need to be closely monitored, especially in their early phases, to ensure they don't evolve into something more serious.

"The virus is still capable of evolving, recombining and developing a new branch of its family tree," Cameron said.

"The key takeaway is that for each of these variants and subvariants, risk of hospitalization and death appears to be, on average, lower where vaccination rates are higher, indicating that vaccination, including a 3rd dose, should be effective in reducing risk for severe disease," added Stephanie Silvera, professor of public health at Montclair State University.
