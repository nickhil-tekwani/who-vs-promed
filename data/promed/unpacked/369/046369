Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry warned on Tuesday [11 May 2010] that
authorities in Turkey had tightened border controls for fear of a
spread of measles from its northern neighbour.

"Travellers with measles symptoms, such as fever, rash and coughing,
will be provisionally banned access into Turkey and should refrain
from travelling," the Bulgarian Ministry said in a statement. The
authorities in Turkey had taken the preventive measures in order "to
limit the risk of spread" of the disease, it added.

A measles epidemic broke out among Bulgaria's Roma population in
April 2009 but only gained strength in recent months. So far, it has
affected 18 000 people, including 20 who died of the disease,
epidemic consultant Mira Kozhuharova told AFP. The rapid spread of
the disease among Roma children and adolescents was due to the fact
that many of them lacked the obligatory vaccinations, she added.

Bulgaria's last measles epidemic in 1992 affected some 22 000 people.

[The Roma people are an ethnic group with origins in South Asia
(probably northern India) who are widely dispersed, with their
largest populations now in Europe, especially Central and Eastern
Europe. As a consequence of their distinctive culture and
semi-nomadic lifestyle, they have rarely been fully integrated into
the healthcare systems of their host countries and have remained a
reservoir of infection for childhood diseases such as measles. It is
ironic that the travel ban imposed by the Turkish authorities as a
consequence of the outbreak of measles in Bulgaria is isolating the
Roma from their historic roots in south Asia.

Tourists and others intending to travel to Turkey via Bulgaria should
be informed of these entry restrictions.
