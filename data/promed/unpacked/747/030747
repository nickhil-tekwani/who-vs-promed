Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 21 Jan 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Jan 2021
Report date: 28 Jan 2021
Date submitted to OIE: 28 Jan 2021
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 2 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: Zoonotic potential under investigation
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak location 1: Walenstadt, Walenstadt, Sarganserland, Sankt Gallen
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: This case was detected in the frame of a research project on pet animals of owners who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The project is in the responsibility of the Clinical Laboratory of the Vetsuisse Faculty (VSF) of the University of Zurich (UZH).

Outbreak location 2: Zurich
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: This case was detected in the frame of a research project on pet animals of owners who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The project is in the responsibility of the Clinical Laboratory of the Vetsuisse Faculty (VSF) of the University of Zurich (UZH).

Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with owner
Epidemiological comments: These cases were detected in the frame of a research project on pet animals of owners who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The project is in the responsibility of the Clinical Laboratory of the Vetsuisse Faculty (VSF) of the University of Zurich (UZH). The Swiss government does currently not recommend to test cats for SARS-CoV-2 but supports research to increase knowledge in the field. For the time being, COVID-19 continues to be treated as a human disease with the main route of transmission between humans.

Control measures
Measures applied: Quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute for Virology and Immunology (IVI) (national laboratory) / Cats / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 27 Jan 2021 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet "Questions and Answers on COVID-19" (last updated 22 Jan 2021), available at https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/:

"Can animals be infected with SARS-CoV-2?
"Yes, several animal species have demonstrated susceptibility to the virus through experimental infection, and in natural settings when in contact with infected humans. There is also evidence that infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings through contact, such as mink to mink transmission, and mink to cat transmission. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for animal and human health, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, and biomedical research. However, not all species appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, findings from experimental infection studies show that poultry and cattle are not susceptible to infection. Up to date information on the susceptibility of different animal species can be found here https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/EN_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2.pdf."

"What precautionary measures should be taken when humans suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 are in contact with animals?
"As a general good practice, appropriate and effective biosecurity measures should always be applied when people have contact with groups of animals, eg, on farms, at zoos, and in animal shelters. People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus should minimise close direct contact with animals, including farm, zoo or other captive animals, and wildlife.

"Companion animals
"There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2. However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals. As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.

"Farmed animals
"Handling farmed animals susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 can carry additional risks when large numbers of animals are kept in close contact. Risk management strategies depend on the species and the circumstances under which the animals live and are cared for. Refer to the specific OIE guidance (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Draft_OIE_Guidance_farmed_animals_cleanMS05.11.pdf) for further recommendations.

"Wildlife
"A wide range of mammalian species may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The OIE has developed guidelines (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/A_WHSG_and_OIE_COVID-19_Guidelines.pdf) for people engaged in wildlife work in the field to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."

"More information about the SARS-CoV-2 events in animals reported by countries to the OIE can be found here https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/" (last updated 28 Jan 2021). - Mod.CRD
