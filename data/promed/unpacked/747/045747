A new subcutaneous parasite [believed to be _Capillaria_ spp.] was
discovered in Ulyanovsk, Volga Region. Physicians misdiagnosed the
infection as a tumor. It is not known how _Capillaria_ could have reached
as far north as central Russia [see comment below].
Parasitologist Viktor Kiselev suggests that it was caused by eating dried fish.
Other theories point to raw or semi-raw food, or perhaps this unknown
parasite was carried by birds and fish and has adapted to life in a closed
reservoir.

[Few human parasites cause macroscopic cutaneous nodules that can be
mistaken for tumors. _Capillaria_ spp. is not one of them and has not been
reported outside the Philippines and Thailand. Some Capillaria species may
be found in saltwater fish, but not in fresh-water fish. From the limited
information in this report, it is unclear why fish has been proposed as the
source of infection. One possible diagnosis is Sparganosis, which is
caused by a cestode occasionally infecting man. It migrates through the
tissues and sometimes can be found inside a skin cyst. Infection is
transmitted from drinking water infected with invertebrates hosting an
intermediate stage of the parasite. - Mod.EP]
