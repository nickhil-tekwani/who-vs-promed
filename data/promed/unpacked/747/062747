----------------------------------------------------------------------
In October 2012, a severe yellowing disease was found on greenhouse and plastic house tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_) plants in Beijing [province]. The disease incidence varied from 5 to 80 percent in each of 6 fields. The lower leaves showed symptoms of interveinal chlorosis, leaf brittleness, and limited brown necrotic flecks, similar to symptoms induced by _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV) and _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) (2 members of genus _Crinivirus_, family _Closteroviridae_). A large number of whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_) were also observed.

Leaf samples were taken from 8 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic tomato plants in 2 plastic houses. Nested reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed to test the presence of ToCV and TICV. With ToCV primers, a 463 bp fragment was amplified from the 8 symptomatic samples but not the 2 asymptomatic samples. There was no amplification with TICV primers from any sample. The amplified fragment showed 99 percent nucleotide sequence identity with ToCV isolates from Japan, Spain, Florida, and Greece. The presence of ToCV was confirmed by amplification of an 848 bp fragment covering the coat protein (CP) gene of ToCV. The CP had 97 to 99 percent amino acid sequence identity to the above-mentioned four ToCV isolates.

Additionally, virions were isolated from symptomatic samples and their lengths were estimated to be about 800 to 850 nm by transmission electronic microscopy.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV on tomato in mainland China. Tomato is one of the most widely cultivated crops in China and the spread of ToCV may cause significant economic losses. Further information on the prevalence and incidence of ToCV is required to assess the potential impact of this virus.

[_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; genus _Crinivirus_) has been reported from Europe and a number of locations in other parts of the world. Besides tomato, it can also affect capsicum and some solanaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs, as well as some ornamental and weed species in other families. Symptoms on tomato leaves include irregular chlorotic mottle, interveinal yellowing, necrotic flecks, and possible distortions. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and flowers, but fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of photosynthetic area. Significant yield losses occur as a result, but symptom severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and are also similar to those of the related _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV).

ToCV is transmitted by a number of whitefly vectors, including _Bemisia tabaci_, and outbreaks are usually associated with high vector populations. Disease management of whitefly transmitted viruses is difficult and includes vector control, removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance, and clean planting material.

Whiteflies have been reported to transmit over 100 virus species and are a common problem in glasshouse grown crops. Multiple infections with viruses sharing these vectors are not unusual and may result in symbiotic enhancement of symptoms (synergism) of the co-infecting viruses.
