I would like to clarify the location of this event. It was not in the
canton or city of Neuchatel (in German: Neuenburg) in Switzerland. In
contrast, it seems from the name of the park "Wuhrlochpark" the
incident happened in the city of Neuenburg (am Rhein) in Germany,
close to the French border and some 50 km [30 mi] from the Swiss
border.

I just wondered about this report as we experienced an outbreak of
Newcastle disease in the canton of Neuchatel this December
[2011][ProMED-mail appreciates this notification of this other
outbreak, which occurred in layer hens, and will be covered in a
separate ProMED-mail report. - Mods.PMB/MPP].
