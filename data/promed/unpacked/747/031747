Denmark: Increase in hepatitis A Virus Infection in MSM
-------------------------------------------------------
A review of notifications to the Department of Epidemiology in the Statens
Serum Institut (<http://www.ssi.dk/sw379.asp>) has revealed a cluster of
cases of hepatitis A virus infection acquired in Denmark among men aged 18
years or older (1). 28 cases in men have been notified so far in 2004. Of
the 20 patients from the greater Copenhagen area, at least 16 are men who
have sex with men (MSM). At least 5 Swedish men have also been infected
with hepatitis A virus in Copenhagen. In the past 5 years, the median
number of notified cases of hepatitis A acquired in Denmark each year among
men aged 18 years or over was 8 (range 6-11). Because of missing or delayed
notifications, a full overview of the current outbreak has not yet been
achieved. An increased incidence of syphilis has also been observed among
MSM in Copenhagen (2), but a possible association between these 2 outbreaks
has not yet been established.
Close contacts of infected cases, primarily household members and sexual
partners, should receive immunoglobulin or hepatitis A virus vaccine as
quickly as possible. Non-immune MSM who are not in a monogamous
relationship should receive vaccination against hepatitis A, preferably
together with hepatitis B vaccination. To prevent further spread, it is
important that the MSM community is made aware of this outbreak and of
routes of infection.
Outbreaks of hepatitis A among MSM have previously been reported both in
Copenhagen and abroad, acquired in places such as saunas (3, 4, 5). The
most recently described outbreak in Denmark was in 1991 (6). Studies have
established risk factors for infection with hepatitis A among MSM. Examples
of these risk factors are recent anonymous sexual partners, oral-anal sex
or digital-anal sex, as well as visiting certain bars or saunas. Social
contact of a non-sexual nature and secondarily contaminated foodstuffs may
also contribute to infection. In the current outbreak, no particular risk
factors have so far been found. Danish HIV/AIDS organisations are currently
launching a nationwide information campaign about sexually transmitted
infections, which includes hepatitis A virus infection.

The Netherlands: Increase in hepatitis A Virus Infection in MSM
--------------------------------------------------
It is unusual for an upsurge in hepatitis A incidence to be seen in spring
or early summer in the Netherlands. A recent increase in the number
of notifications of hepatitis A virus infection has, however, been
detected through the Dutch data collection system for notifiable diseases.
Men who have sex with men (MSM) appear to be particularly affected. [The
Number of notifications of hepatitis A among MSM in the Netherlands for the
period 1999 to 2004 is presented in the text, but cannot be reproduced here].
In 2004, there have so far been 99 notifications of hepatitis A virus
infection acquired by men aged 18 years or older, compared with 37 during
the same period in 2003. Among the notifications in 2004, 31 reported
homosexual sex as a risk factor for hepatitis A. Information about
patients' sexual behaviour is not yet a standard requirement of
notification of hepatitis A across the country, and therefore hepatitis A
cases acquired by this route of infection could be underestimated at
present. In 2003, there was just one notification with sex between men as a
risk factor over the same period of time. However, the current outbreak is
not unusual; a similar increase in hepatitis A infections in MSM was seen
in 2001. The recent outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum in MSM (1) has
increased awareness of sexually transmitted infections in the MSM
community, and so sex between men may now be being recorded more often as a
risk factor for transmission.

[Recent reports of hepatitis A virus infection in ProMED-mail (see below)
have featured infection by water-borne and food-borne routes
of transmission; contamination of drinking water supplies being the most
frequent source of infection. However, since hepatitis A virus is present
at high concentration in faeces during the acute phase of the disease,
cases of hepatitis A virus infection among practising male homosexuals is
not surprising. Fortunately hepatitis A virus infections are not
persistent, and hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease. - Mod.CP]
