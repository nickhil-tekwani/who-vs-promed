About message "BSE - FRANCE (07)"
be careful, the translation of the French article is not correct (possibly
from an automatic translation) : one striking example : tail (queue) is
translated as neck.

A really minor detail: "la base de la queue" means the basis of the tail
(not the neck).
Also, I do not think that the pruritus necessarily indicates affection of
the skin, as someone suggested. It is more likely that such intense pruritus
is a neurological manifestation, as well.

In the provisional English draft of 'Un cas de tremblante sur un boeuf,'
'La demarche etait mal assuree; les membres posterieurs etaient vacillants
et trainaient sur le sol.'
is translated as
'The sequel was assuredly bad; the posterior limbs were flailing about and
pointed skyward.'
It should be:
Its gait was uncertain (or unsteady); its hind legs were wobbly and
dragging on
the ground.

"Manger de la vache enragee" may have a much less sinister derivation. My
tattered recollections of meat inspection suggest that, especially before
uniform humane slaughter methods, an animal which had to be chased around
its pen by its captor -- or vice versa -- would certainly be "stressed ante
mortem" and thus have depleted muscle glycogen, resulting in a poorer rigor
mortis and meat of poor quality and shelf life. Not everything is
microbiology!

[I think that this thread can be safely cut. A few days ago the moderators
were much taken up with an internal discussion as to whether our postings
were too dry and inhibited comments and contributions. We were mistaken.
