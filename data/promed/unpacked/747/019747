The Vietnamese Ministry of Health has instructed local health
watchdogs to curb the spread of a deadly pig-borne disease that has
killed 2 people since early this year [2007].
The Viet Nam Institute of Tropical and Contagious Diseases reported
Wednesday [18 Jul 2007] it had admitted 21 patients with the deadly
disease, caused by the _Streptococcus suis_ bacterium, since early
2007. Of the 21, 2 have perished and 2 others were still in critical
condition, the institute said.
_S. suis_ is a bacterium found in many parts of the world where pigs
are raised. It is most prevalent in domesticated pigs, but is also
occasionally found in wild boars, horses, dogs, cats, and birds.
People who slaughter sick pigs or process and sell the contaminated
pork would be susceptible to the disease, said Nguyen Huy Nga, head
of the Ministry of Health Prevention Bureau. They usually manifest
high fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, followed by meningitis,
subcutaneous hemorrhage, toxic shock, and coma in severe cases.

epizootic that is currently decimating Vietnamese swine, and to which
no human cases have been ascribed. - Mod.JW]
[Human _S. suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis that
occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating cooked
meat or organs from infected pigs poses no risk and person-to-person
spread does not seem to occur. In humans, the organism has been
reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also toxic shock --
if the pathogen produces the appropriate toxins --, and less
commonly, endocarditis.
The Viet Nam Institute of Tropical and Contagious Diseases is a Hanoi
Hospital to which the 21 patients were admitted (see
<http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/6220732.html>).
It is not stated if the Vietnamese cases were epidemiologically
linked, or if the isolates were genotypically related.
Most cases of _S. suis_ infection have been sporadic, but a human
outbreak has been reported from China (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no06/05-1194.htm>
and reviewed in ProMED-mail's "_Streptococcus suis_, porcine, human -
USA (NY) 20070223.0668)." - Mod.ML
Pig infection
-------------
According to the data of Iowa State University Centre for Food
Security and Public health, _S. suis_ is carried asymptomatically by
many pigs, but more virulent strains can cause serious disease. _S.
suis_ infection in pigs may cause -- in the animals -- sporadic cases
of polyarthritis or peracute meningitis and septicemia in suckling
pigs. More often, _S. suis_ causes acute meningitis, with high
mortality rates, in recently weaned and growing pigs. The symptoms
may include depression, anorexia, fever, trembling, incoordination,
opisthotonos, convulsions, and blindness. Labyrinthitis, otitis
interna, and otitis media can lead to deafness and possibly
vestibular dysfunction. In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes
pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in pigs.
