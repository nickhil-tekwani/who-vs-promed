Minister says there isn't an outbreak of polio
----------------------------------------------
The Minister for Family and Women's Promotion, Dr. Genoveva Lino,
said that the reported cases of polio in the country do not
constitute an outbreak and that the situation is under control.
"Angola does not have an outbreak of polio, because the situation is
under control," said Genoveva Lino, on the sidelines of a visit to
Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, where it is within the celebrations of
the African Women's Day, which is Saturday [7 Aug 2010].

The official stressed that "the program of vaccination for prevention
of polio is done regularly and it is extended to the entire country.
The Government has a multisectoral program, involving not only the
Health Ministry but all those ministries that have a direct
involvement in stabilizing the environment for the well-being of
families," he said.

Genoveva Lino said that the task of the Ministry is being responsible
for raising awareness of women to take their children for
vaccination, providing they are informed and are attentive not only
to the preventive programs of vaccination campaigns, but also that
they should follow the schedule routine vaccinations of children.

"Even though they are far from health clinics, vaccination campaigns
are carried out throughout the country, door to door," he said,
acknowledging however that the country "is now undergoing
reconstruction, and is now organizing itself, and there are still
families living in hardship circumstances."

On the other hand, Genoveva Lino said that the country there are
"many single-parent families headed by women. Therefore, they have
all the responsibility of the family," he noted, admitting that
"sometimes giving more priority to their income generating activities
and resulting in delaying the vaccination schedules for their children."

"It is with these people that we have to continue to work and wake
up," defended the minister of Family and Women Promotion.

Angola has reported 17 cases of poliomyelitis since the beginning of
the year [2010], a contagious disease caused by a virus that causes
paralysis that can be fatal, and all cases are related to the capital
city, Luanda.

[The newswire mentions 17 reported cases of polio in Angola since the
beginning of 2010. According to our last ProMED-mail posting on the
polio situation in Angola on 19 Jul 2010, this represents an increase
of 2 cases in approximately 2 weeks. (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Poliomyelitis - worldwide (14): Angola, alert 20100719.2426). The
most recent information available on the polio eradication website is
dated 27 Jul 2010, and shows 16 confirmed cases with date of most
recent onset of cases 16 Jun 2010 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).

A key activity of the polio eradication effort is "acute flaccid
paralysis" surveillance (AFP), with an expected rate of greater than
1 non-polio AFP case per 100 000 population as an indicator of a good
AFP surveillance system in a country. According to the most recent
data available on the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative website
(as of 30 Jul 2010), since the beginning of 2010, there have been 203
AFP cases reported with a non-polio AFP rate of 3.6 per 100 000
population, and 94 percent of AFP cases having adequate specimens
obtained for laboratory confirmation studies, and 16 confirmed cases.

Information not provided is the number of AFP cases still pending
laboratory results to know if there are still indicators suggesting
continued transmission of the wild poliovirus or if there is evidence
that transmission has been interrupted.
