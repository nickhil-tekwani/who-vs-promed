[Please note that there may be discrepancies between the various
sources of information due to different times of "closure" of daily
figures reported. Times of daily report closures where known are
listed in the table of contents below. Newswires may mention a
confirmed case in a location that has not been on the official
reporting entity list as the confirmation arrived after closure of
the day's report. As the number of reports has been increasing, we
are changing the format of the tables to give the cumulative cases
reported by the weeks ending on Fridays (1 May 2009, 8 May 2009, 15

Epidemiological investigation of a novel influenza A (H1N1) outbreak
detected by entry screening, Narita, Japan, 2009 -- Preliminary report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Infections Disease Surveillance Center and Field
Epidemiology Training Program, National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Tokyo, Japan]

On [24 April 2009], a group of 30 high school students (14 2nd-year
students and 16 3rd-year students) and 6 teachers from 3 schools in
Osaka travelled to Toronto via Detroit on an international exchange
program run by the city governments. Among several activities during
their stay, the participants did home stays with local families and
sat in on some classes with local high school students. On [8 May
2009], they came back to Narita airport via Detroit airport. Three
members of the group who presented with symptoms were confirmed to
have novel influenza A (H1N1) infection through [airport] entry
screening and were hospitalized in the designated hospital for
isolation. The other 33 participants, as well as 14 passengers who
had seats near the confirmed cases and 2 air flight crewmembers were
instructed to stay under medical supervision at the designated
accommodations. Among them, only one participant developed symptoms
and was confirmed to be infected with novel influenza A (H1N1) during
the period of medical supervision.

As per a request from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
(MHLW), a team from the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center and
Field Epidemiology Training Program at the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases (NIID) was dispatched and performed an
epidemiological investigation of the participants of the
international exchange program. Suspected cases were defined as those
participants of the exchange program that had high fever (38 deg C or
higher [100.4 deg F]) or at least 2 acute respiratory symptoms with
onset between [24 Apr 2009 and 15 May 2009] (Canada time). Confirmed
cases were defined as those persons who were positive for novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection that was laboratory confirmed by
real-time PCR at Narita Quarantine laboratory and NIID. These case
definitions were based on MHLW case definitions.

Four confirmed cases (3 students and one teacher) and 8 suspected
cases (all students) were detected. One school had 4 confirmed cases
and 3 suspected cases and the other 2 schools had 3 and 2 suspected
cases, respectively. The dates of onset were from [5-8 May 2009] for
confirmed cases, and from [25 Apr 2009 to 12 May 2009] for suspected
cases. Among the confirmed cases, 4 had high fever (38 deg C or
higher [100.4 deg F]) and cough, of whom 3 had a sore throat and
joint pain and either nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. One confirmed
case had abdominal pain but none of the 4 confirmed cases had
vomiting or diarrhea. Some of the suspected cases tested negative for
novel influenza A (H1N1) infection by real-time PCR, but no further
details were obtained. None of the suspected cases had high fever (38
deg C or higher [100.4 deg F]).

One of the 3 high schools sent 10 students (6 female, 4 male) and 2
teachers (both male) on the international exchange program. Of these,
there were 4 confirmed cases. Confirmed student cases were all male.
These 3 students spent a lot of time together during the exchange
program. In addition, one teacher (also a confirmed case) accompanied
one of the 3 students to see a physician in Canada. The date of onset
for suspected cases at this school ranged between [2 to 8 May 2009].
The dates of onset for the 4 confirmed cases fell within this period
([5-8 May 2009]). The likely source of infection was not discovered
through interviews of the cases and other participants on the trip.

On the afternoon of [18 May 2009], all persons under medical
supervision were released with no additional cases identified. The 4
confirmed cases have all recovered and are considered to pose no risk
of further transmission. Additionally, negative results were obtained
for all cases by RT-PCR. By [20 May 2009], all 4 had been discharged
from the hospital.

Acute respiratory symptoms included:
a. nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea
b. sore throat
c. cough
d. fever or feverishness

Interim report on clinical presentation of the novel influenza A
(H1N1) cases reported from Kobe City
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Infections Disease Surveillance Center and Field
Epidemiology Training Program, National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Tokyo, Japan and Kobe Institute of Health, Kobe, Japan]

Background
----------
On 16 May 2009, 3 cases of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection were reported from Kobe City, Hyogo, Japan. More cases have
been reported from the northern and western parts of Hyogo
prefecture, and nearby prefecture (Osaka) following to the 1st report.

As of 1:00 a.m. (JST), 19 May 2009, a total of 163 cases with
laboratory confirmation have been reported nationally.

The following report covers 43 cases, confirmed in Kobe City up to
[19 May 2009] that were hospitalized or followed up by an outpatient
clinic in order to provide information on clinical presentation of
infection for the use of diagnosis and treatment at front line hospitals.

According to the infection control law, [illness with the novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus] is categorized as a Group 2 illness, which
mandates that the case be hospitalized and treated. Because of the
legal requirements, Kobe City requested hospitalization of all cases.
The sample group of this report [is taken from cases that were
hospitalized following these legal requirements]. However, with the
rapid increase of the number of cases beyond the bed availability of
the hospital(s) combined with the fact that most of the cases had a
mild illness, this lead the Kobe City and Osaka prefectures to revise
the policy of mandatory hospitalization based on clinical indications.

We would like to forward our gratitude to the members and staff of
Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Nishi Kobe Medical Center
for their cooperation.

Clinical information
--------------------
Case description and underlining conditions:
Forty-three cases were investigated. The median age was 17 years
(range 5 to 44 years) and the majority were teenagers. Female to male
ration was 1.3 (24 female, 19 male). 31 cases had an underlying
medical condition such as chronic bronchial asthma (6 cases, 15.8
percent). No cases had diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases,
immunosuppressive condition, or malignant tumor. None of 24 female
cases were pregnant.

History of seasonal influenza vaccination and influenza infection
during the 2008/2009 season:
Information on the pre-seasonal vaccination coverage for the
2008/2009 season was available on 42 cases of whom 52.4 percent (22
cases) [had been vaccinated]. Among the cases, 7.5 percent (3 out of
40) had a history of influenza infection during the 2008/2009 season.

Rapid kit test for influenza:
Rapid kit test was performed on all 43 RT-PCR positive cases as part
of screening. The test was performed on samples taken on days 0 to 4
(median day 1) from the date of onset. 23 cases (53.5 percent) were
positive for type A influenza by this test. On the other hand, 20
cases (46.5 percent) of those later confirmed by PCR were type A
negative by the rapid test. Sampling at the early stage of disease
course might be the cause of this high negative rate. The type of the
kit used at each hospital was not investigated.

Clinical feature on admission:
High fever was observed in about 90 percent of the 43 cases. Symptoms
reported with around 60-80 percent frequency included fatigue,
feverish, cough, and sore throat. Nasal discharge, nasal congestion,
and headache were observed in about a half of the cases.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea were reported
in around 10 percent of the cases, and conjunctivitis was reported in
7 percent of the cases. No neurological symptoms were reported.

Laboratory data on admission:
Laboratory data from 20 cases was available on admission: white blood
cell count was 3200-11400 /mm3 (median 5100) CRP (C-reactive protein)
0.1-9.2 mg/dl (median 1.3). Liver enzyme data were available for 7
people: SGOT 13-64 IU/dl (median 20), SGPT 7-168 IU/dl (median 13)

No chest X-rays were taken since pneumonia was not suspected on
physical examinations.

Treatment course:
Antiviral treatment by oseltamivir was given to 19 patients and by
zanamivir inhalation to 20 out of 43 cases. The age distribution for
the treatment selection is as follows:
- one case under 9 was treated with oseltamivir;
- 13 cases (36.1 percent) of 36 teenagers were treated with oseltamivir and
- the remaining 20 cases (55.6 percent) were treated with zanamivir;
- there were 3 cases who received no medication (8.3 percent) among
the teenagers;
- 5 out of 6 cases above the age of 20 were treated with oseltamivir.
- Though the reason was not clear, one case above the age 20 was
given no medication. This case was diagnosed on day 3 of illness. The
number of days before treatment was begun was a median of one day,
ranging from zero to 4 days. Antibacterial treatment was given to 2
of the cases.

Indication of hospitalization:
The clinical presentations of almost all of the patients showed no
indication for hospitalization. No cases required mechanical
ventilation and no deaths were reported as of 19 May 2009. The
majority of the hospitalized cases were discharged shortly after
admission, and placed on medical observation at home. Long-term
outcome is unknown at this point, but the clinical presentation was
similar to seasonal influenza throughout the course of the illness.
This suggests that most of the cases have no medical indication for
hospitalization. Below is a case report on a single case that did
have an indication for hospitalization.

Case report of a 20-year-old female
-----------------------------------
16 May 2009: admission with fever above 38 deg C [100.4 deg F],
headache (+), lower abdominal pain (++), arthralgia (+), diarrhea
(+), general fatigue (+), cough (-), nasal discharge (-), sore throat
(-), nausea(-).

Physical examination on admission revealed redness of the pharynx and
lower abdominal tenderness.

Laboratory data on admission: WBC 5100/mm3, platelets 17.0 x 10
000/microliter, CRP 9.2 mg/dl, peripheral blood, and rapid test with
pharyngeal or nasal swab negative for influenza A and influenza B
viruses and influenza A (H1N1) was positive by RT-PCR.

Medication with oseltamivir and antispasmodic drug with fluids were given.

She is still hospitalized today [19 May 2009] but her clinical
condition is gradually [improving]. The cause of the abdominal pain
is under investigation.
