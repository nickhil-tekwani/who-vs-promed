Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection - WHO update 21
--------------------------------------------------------
Global surveillance guidelines
------------------------------
WHO has today issued on its website guidelines for global surveillance
aimed at monitoring the spread of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
in human and animal populations <http://www.who.int/en/>.
The guidelines include the definition of a laboratory-confirmed case of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus human infection, and describe procedures for
reporting cases to WHO. The guidelines also provide recommended procedures
to monitor changes in transmission patterns and to detect potential
human-to-human transmission.
The guidelines are intended to improve global vigilance for the further
spread of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections in humans and animals,
and for the first signs that human-to-human transmission may be occurring.
Use of standardized procedures and reporting forms will improve the quality
of information needed by WHO to advise on the most appropriate control
measures.
Situation (poultry) China
-------------------------
Chinese authorities have announced a suspected outbreak of avian influenza
A (H5N1) virus infection at a chicken farm in Tianjin. Spread to additional
farms within several provinces has also been reported. Altogether,
outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are suspected or confirmed at 39 farms in 14
of the country's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. To
date, no human cases have been reported in China.
Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission: data on 2nd sister
in family cluster in Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------------
WHO has today received the results from a study of virus isolated from a 23
year old woman (see Updates 19 and 20) who is part of a family cluster in
Viet Nam under investigation as the first possible instance of
human-to-human transmission. Virus genetic material from this woman, as for
the other case in this cluster, is of avian origin and contains no human
influenza genes.

[Since it has been reported previously that all affected members of this
family cluster had handled diseased poultry (see ProMED-mail post: Avian
influenza, human - East Asia (14) 20040205.0424), there is no positive
evidence to support a hypothesis that this family cluster originated as a
result of human-to-human transmission.
The number of confirmed human cases in Thailand and Viet Nam remains
unchanged at 23, and the number of deaths at 19 (or 18 according to WHO as
of 11 Feb 2004). No confirmed human cases have been reported from elsewhere
in the East Asian region. - Mod.CP]
