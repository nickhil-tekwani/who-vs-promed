Sindh agriculture department [AgD] has put its field staff on high alert to cope with a contagious unknown disease that is posing adverse risks to sugarcane crops. Sugarcane is suffering from an unknown complicated and contagious disease that has resulted in drying and destroying the crop at a large scale, growers said. Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) [Organisation of Agriculturalists] said the disease has appeared in some areas of Tando Allahyar district this year [2021]. It prevailed in some parts of Sakrand [district] last year [2020] over an area of 40 acres [16 ha] and in Tando Allahyar.

SAB [said] that it was a sort of fungus, which dried the roots of the plant and the plant was also dried. Experts took samples of the affected leaves to test in the laboratory. However, they have assumptions that the disease could be fusarium [see comment below]. The disease had appeared last year [2020] for the 1st time and there was no quick remedy for it. If it is further spread, there would be huge losses.

The disease could be prevalent in other parts of the province but growers might have not noticed it yet. During the investigation, it would be observed whether this disease affects one type of the sugarcane variety or other varieties as well.

[A large number of pathogens can affect sugar cane and several are present in the region. The symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis. The problems may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors.

Speculation in the report above of a 'fusarium' disease being possibly involved may refer to pokkah boeng (PB), caused by different fungi of the _Fusarium fujikuroi_ species complex. PB is currently considered a threat to the crop in the region (ProMED post 20200717.7582937). PB affects sugar cane and related grasses (_Saccharum_ species and hybrids) as well as sorghum. It is a re-emerging disease with recent major yield losses in sugar cane producing regions including India, China, Brazil, and South Africa. PB is also considered an emerging disease of sorghum in India (for more information on PB see previous ProMED posts in the archives and links below).

Nevertheless, reliable diagnosis of all potential pathogens involved, preferably by laboratory analysis (as has apparently been instigated in Sindh) will be essential for determining any causes or factors that may be involved in the problems so that suitable management strategies can be designed for the affected farmers.
