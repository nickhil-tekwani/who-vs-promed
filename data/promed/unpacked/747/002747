FAO and IGAD alert for countries in Eastern Africa - 15 Feb 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite persistent and prolonged dryness in the eastern part of [Eastern Africa], above-average, heavy rainfall and floods occurred in some areas of the region, creating suitable environmental conditions for vector dynamics.

New hotspots [for Rift Valley fever (RVF) occurrence] are forecasted in western Kenya and South Sudan, while persistent hotspots are predicted in the eastern areas of the Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, small areas of Ethiopia, large parts of South Sudan, parts of Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and western Yemen. Suitable areas are predicted in proximity to irrigated lands, swamps, and/or high density of susceptible livestock. The rainfall forecast for the period February-April 2022 highlights above-average rains in the region, particularly in April, suggesting that the risk remains high in those countries.

Therefore, FAO and IGAD are advising the countries to increase the awareness of stakeholders; improve preparedness at national, subnational, and community levels to safeguard livestock, livelihoods, and public health, especially for exposed and vulnerable communities (farmers, pastoralists); and improve coordination with public health and environment services for managing the risk of RVF outbreaks.

Countries should ensure that
- an RVF contingency plan with standard operating procedures for outbreak control exists;
- staff are equipped and trained to implement the plan in case of outbreak;
- proper safety/protection measures are in place for first responders/staff;
- staff at all levels (national and/or subnational) are aware of specific high-risk areas;
- risk-based/targeted surveillance is conducted in the high-risk areas;
- additional actions should be taken to increase the awareness of stakeholders in at-risk areas.

In case of any inquiry on the subject, including the need for technical support or information on the at-risk areas, you may wish to contact FAO (Ricarda Mondry and Charles Bebay) and IGAD (Solomon J. Muchina Munyua and Guleid Artan).

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease.

Humans are susceptible to RVF virus (RVFV) and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible. For additional information, please refer to OIE's manual.

Timely preventive animal vaccinations have been traditionally recommended when an upsurge of RVF was forecasted/expected; this involved, in particular, the most susceptible species -- sheep -- followed by cattle and goats. Vaccination after the commencement of the epizootic has been regarded as of lesser value or contraindicated. It will be useful to note if the said policy has undergone modifications. - Mod.AS
