[1] Variant names
Date: Sat 7 Aug 2021
Source: The Telegraph [edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/variants-could-named-star-constellations-greek-alphabet-runs/


New coronavirus variants could be named after star constellations once letters of the Greek alphabet are exhausted, a senior World Health Organization official has suggested. In an interview with the Telegraph, Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical chief for COVID-19, said the UN health agency was already looking at new names for mutations amid fears there will be more concerning variants than the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet.

That system was introduced in late May [2021], and so far 11 mutations have been named: 4 variants of concern, including delta and beta; 4 variants of interest, such as eta and lambda; plus epsilon, zeta, and theta, thought to be "of interest" but since downgraded. But as the coronavirus continues to mutate, it is possible there will be more key strains than available letters.

Dr Van Kerkhove said star constellations are the current frontrunner to follow the Greek alphabet, suggesting we could one day see variants known as Aries, Gemini, or Orion. Several alternatives have already been dismissed, including Greek gods and goddesses, partly due to concerns about pronunciation. "We will possibly run out of the Greek alphabet, but we're already looking at the next series of names," said Dr Van Kerkhove, who first requested a colloquial naming system last year [2020] to prevent variants being linked to places, a practice deemed discriminatory by WHO. "We're actually considering star constellations," she added. "We were going to go with Greek gods or goddesses, and I said please, please, don't make me say that publicly."

The next choice -- which won't affect the scientific names of SARS-CoV-2 variants -- could be announced "relatively quickly". Currently the virus evolution working group and WHO's legal team are double checking proposals to "make sure we don't upset anyone with these names", Dr Van Kerkhove said.

It comes as efforts to track new variants are ramped up across the globe, amid concerns that a mutation could emerge that evades existing vaccines. "It's a real threat," said Dr Van Kerkhove. "It's certainly possible that you could have mutations that will evade our countermeasures... and that's why it's so critical that we just don't rely only on vaccines, that we do everything we can to really drive transmission down."

Speaking from WHO's headquarters in Geneva after her 1st holiday since the coronavirus emerged 19 months ago, the epidemiologist added that a dangerous new variant is more likely to emerge in 3 instances: in areas with intense transmission rates; in animal populations, for instance in mink farms; and in places with high vaccination rates where the virus is still circulating widely. Yet gaping "blind spots" in the global surveillance network remain, with much of the world still relying on patchy testing and limited sequencing capacity, especially in Africa and parts of South America, Dr Van Kerkhove said, pointing to a map hanging in her office.

Accelerating efforts to close these gaps will be essential, not just to curb the spread of concerning new variants before they become dominant, but to better prepare for 'disease X', an as-yet-unidentified pathogen with the potential to trigger another pandemic. "Our blind spots are reducing, but there's a long way to go," Dr Van Kerkhove said. "We're trying to harness the world's energy, expertise, capacities, and financing -- because there's a lot of money in this area right now -- to make sure we support and nurture what has started.

"It's a catalytic moment right now in terms of surveillance, in terms of sequencin: not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for the next 'disease X' and for all these emerging and re-emerging pathogens that we're tracking," she added. "The next 'disease X' is out there, so how do we leverage this traumatic experience that the world is going through for infectious pathogens?"

But variants are not what keeps Dr Van Kerkhove awake at night; "it's complacency" reinforced by a sense of endlessly "screaming into the wind. It's the notion that it's over for some and not for others, that the 'haves' can just go back to their lives, and forget about the 'have nots,'" she said. "I feel incredibly frustrated right now that we're in this situation that we're in 19 months in, when we know what to do when, we know how to do it, we just don't have the collective will to," Dr Van Kerkhove added. "And then, on the other hand, I feel very hopeful because I know that we can do this, I know that the global community could actually come together and get to a point where we remove the severe disease, the deaths. I feel very extreme in this situation, with just extreme hopefulness and, you know, deep despair," she said. "I wish I knew [when the pandemic would end]."

[A rather depressing report, planning for a future with more variants than we have letters in the Greek alphabet. But star constellations? At least the Greek alphabet provides some sense of order of discovery. Of course, it could also proceed in alphabetical order of constellations. - Mod.LK]

[2] Bangladesh: vaccination of Rohingya refugees
Date: Tue 10 Aug 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/10/bangladesh-rohingya-refugees-covid-vaccine


The government of Bangladesh and aid agencies have started vaccinating Rohingya refugees against coronavirus as a surge in cases raises health concerns in the sprawling, cramped camps where more than one million people who fled Myanmar are sheltering.

The highly transmissible delta variant is driving an infection surge across Bangladesh, with about 20 000 infections and 200 deaths recorded so far in Cox's Bazar district, the southern region bordering Myanmar where the 34 refugee camps are located.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said a national positivity rate of about 30% indicates the spread of COVID-19 is much higher, especially given the sheer number of people living in these camps.

The government's civil surgeon's office in Cox's Bazar and aid agencies began the vaccination campaign on Tuesday [10 Aug 2021] across 34 camps alongside Bangladesh's national vaccination effort. About 500 Bangladesh Red Crescent staff and volunteers joined the health workers for the campaign in collaboration with the UN refugee agency, according to a statement from the international body.

Rohingya community leaders, frontline healthcare volunteers in the camps, and Rohingya older than 55 are in the 1st group to be vaccinated. More than 65 000 of the nearly 900 000 refugees will be vaccinated in the 1st cohort, the UN high commissioner for refugees said in an email to the Associated Press news agency.

Bangladesh has reported more than 1.3 million infections, including 22 897 deaths from COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

More than 700 000 Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2017 as a harsh military crackdown was waged against the ethnic group following an attack by rebels. Other Rohingya have lived in refugee camps in Bangladesh following earlier waves of persecution. The 2017 crackdown included rapes, killings, and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed as ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the United Nations. While Bangladesh and Myanmar have sought to arrange repatriations, the Rohingya are too fearful to return home.

"Millions of refugees worldwide are exposed to violence, family separation, culture loss, and exile. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposes these populations to a new threat, one that could prove to be more devastating than the events forcing them to flee their homelands.

"Refugees are vulnerable to COVID-19 (1), as they live in conditions that disproportionately increase their risk of contagion. For example, in densely populated refugee camps, social distancing is challenging, and if basic sanitation is lacking, proper hand hygiene is close to impossible (2). Projections in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, which hosts over 600â€‰000 Rohingya refugees, suggest that a COVID-19 outbreak could exhaust medical resources and overwhelm camp hospitals within 58 days, which would lead to a rise in deaths from other infectious diseases, such as malaria (2). Although limited evidence exists on whether infectious diseases increase the risk of COVID-19, the World Health Organization anticipates that people who have both COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if tuberculosis treatment is interrupted (3). This prediction is alarming, considering that tuberculosis and malaria are highly prevalent in refugee populations, as are noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (4,5), known to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19. This situation is compounded by language barriers that refugees face in host communities and their limited access to healthcare for obtaining health information, testing, and treatment, which some may even avoid out of fears of being deported (4).

"The refugees' fear of being isolated in quarantines and separated from their families, or even killed to slow the pandemic, can explain why aid workers in Rohingya camps report minimal testing among residents with COVID-19 symptoms (6). COVID-19-related stigmatization adds to this challenge. Fears of refugees in the general public may be compounded by COVID-19 fears, increasing discrimination against these groups. The social stigma associated with COVID-19 may encourage illness concealment, delay early detection and treatment, increase distrust in health authorities, lower the likelihood of compliance, and prolong recovery (7).

"While empirical studies are needed to understand the extent and nature of stigma in refugees with COVID-19, news media reports from refugee-sending countries, such as Iraq, indicate that stigma is a major barrier to prevention and treatment (8)."

[3] South East Asia

Parts of South East Asia are still grappling with high COVID-19 activity, with Thailand today [Tue 10 Aug 2021] reporting a record daily high for deaths and Viet Nam still reporting high daily totals.

Thailand today [Tue 10 Aug 2021] reported nearly 20 000 cases, with a record single-day high for deaths at 235, according to Nikkei Asia (https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Thailand-scrambles-for-COVID-19-antiviral-as-vaccines-run-short). Bangkok is currently the country's epicenter, and some experts worry that Thailand's cases haven't peaked yet. The country's vaccine rollout has been rocky, and Thailand's pharmacy trade group has warned the health ministry about possible shortages of the antiviral drug, favipiravir.

Thailand is receiving USD 5 million in aid from the US government to help in its battle with COVID-19, Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said yesterday [Mon 9 Aug 2021] on Twitter (https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1425075681038323713). He also noted that the United States is providing USD 50 million for Myanmar, which is also experiencing a humanitarian crisis complicated by a virus surge.

Viet Nam is still reporting high daily case numbers, with 9323 new infections reported yesterday [Mon 9 Aug 2021], according to VN Express (https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-adds-9-323-cases-to-covid-19-tally-4338111.html). The main hot spots are Ho Chi Minh City, followed by 2 provinces in southern Viet Nam, Binh Duong and Dong Nai.

In other South East Asia developments, some countries are phasing out China's Sinovac vaccines due to concerns that they are less effective than other vaccines, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/covid-vaccines-delta-china-asia/2021/08/10/24d0df60-f664-11eb-a636-18cac59a98dc_story.html). For example, in the middle of July [2021], Thailand announced a plan to mix doses, giving people who had received their 1st dose of Sinovac a 2nd dose of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. And health workers fully vaccinated with Sinovac are receiving a 3rd booster dose of AstraZeneca or one of the 2 mRNA vaccines. Cambodia's government said it will offer AstraZeneca booster shots to those who received 2 Sinovac doses.

In early June [2021], WHO announced emergency listing for Sinovac, and Chinese officials recently announced that the country will donate 2 billion vaccine doses this year [2021], along with USD 100 million to support COVAX activities.
