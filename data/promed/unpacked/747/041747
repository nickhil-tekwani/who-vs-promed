UNPLEASANT EVENT NOW ENDED (REPEAT)
*******************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

[We apologise to those who have already seen this, but it appears
that this explanation did not go to our ProMED-Digest readers, so it
is being reposted for their benefit - Mod.JW]

On Sunday 27 Sep 1998 someone managed to send out a booby-trapped
SPAM email to all the subscribers of ProMED-mail. This should not
happen, because sending a message to the list requires a password,
held by only 4 people (Director, Managing Editor & 2 moderators).
Because of the way the email header was constructed, anyone who used
the REPLY command to respond to the email ended up sending an email
to ALL the subscribers of ProMED-mail. Then other subscribers, not
realizing what was happening, sent out responses and requests for the
SPAM to stop, thus adding to the SPAM.
Please NEVER use the REPLY command when responding to any SPAM
emails. Rather use the COMPOSE command and manually type in the
address of the person you want to send an email to.

***********
This event, now ended, was doubly distressing for us, first because
of the cost in connect time & stress for our subscribers, but also
because so many seemed to think we had done this on purpose! You
should all know by now we NEVER do that kind of advertising. It
should also have been obvious that it was not a ProMED-mail post
since it did not carry the tag PRO> at the start of the Subject
line, and did not come from ProMED-mail as Sender.
For anyone who is still angry enough to wish to unsubscribe, you may
do so by sending to <majordomo@usa.healthnet.org> the text:
unsubscribe promed
We are very sorry this happened, and of course our technical support
at SatelLife/HealthNet is taking steps to prevent a recurrence.
