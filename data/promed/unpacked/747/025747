For the 1st time, the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) virus has been discovered in Alberta. On [Tue 8 Jan 2019], Alberta Pork reported on their website the virus, which causes diarrhea and vomiting in pigs, has been found on a 400-head hog operation in the province.

They say the virus is spread by the fecal-oral route, with the most common source being infected feces coming onto the farm from various surfaces that can transmit the disease. The virus can also cause up to 100% mortality in nursing pigs according the organization.

The 1st Canadian PED case was confirmed in Ontario back in 2014, and has since been reported in Manitoba, Quebec and Prince Edward Island.

Alberta Pork says strict biosecurity protocols are critical during this outbreak, and producers should think about enhancing biosecurity on-farm and during animal transportation.

They say they're working closely with Alberta Agriculture and Forestry to investigate this outbreak and prevent the disease from spreading any further.

The PED virus poses no threat to human health and this incident has not caused any food safety concerns.

[Since its appearance in the United States in April 2013, PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in the US. Infections with these novel SECD (swine enteric coronavirus disease) viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

PEDv causes severe dehydration and diarrhea in pigs and is generally fatal in young animals. It does not transmit to humans or other animals and is no risk to food safety.

However, diseases such as this impact all the workers with ill and dying piglets and pigs. While biosecurity is important, it can also take a toll on workers through investigations into where a biosecurity lapse could have occurred.

Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases. Viruses are impossible to see, and what cannot be seen can more easily slip through a biosecurity protocol. Someone forgets to wash the boots or the truck. It almost takes 2 people at a time to remember to do it every time until it is always a habit.

This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long lasting effect on the price of pork in the providence and the nation. We certainly hope this situation is resolved and does not spread. Furthermore, we hope this not a new strain of the virus representing an impending outbreak in other areas.

In 2017 there was a ProMED-mail posting, Porcine epidemic diarrhea - North America (03): Canada (MB) vaccination 20170616.5111001, discussing a vaccine against this disease. We have not heard if this vaccine is intended to be used in this outbreak or if the vaccine is too expensive or not efficacious. - Mod.TG
