About 9 persons have been allegedly hospitalised as the dreaded monkeypox disease hit Delta state.

Sources told our correspondent on [Thu 19 Oct 2017] that 6 of the affected persons were from Agbor, where the state governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, hails from.

A doctor at the Federal Medical Centre Asaba, who confirmed the development to The Punch said the remaining victims were from around the state capital.

It was gathered that the victims were diagnosed of the disease on [Wed 18 Oct 2017], adding that their blood samples have been collected for tests.

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr Nicholas Azinge denied the outbreak of the disease in the state.

In a short message to our correspondent, Azinge said, "Not true! There is no case of monkeypox in Agbor, not even any patient with a high suspicion of it."

[The monkeypox situation in Nigeria generally, and Delta state specifically, remains unclear. Although ProMED-mail posted a report indicating cases in Delta state among 74 suspected cases nationally, no case numbers for the state were given. The report above imprecisely indicates that there are "about" 9 cases, but the Delta state Commissioner for Health denies that there are any cases. Perhaps the results of tests done on the blood samples taken from cases will help to clarify the situation in Delta state by confirming or by ruling out monkeypox in these cases.
