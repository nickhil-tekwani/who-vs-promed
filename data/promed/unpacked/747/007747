A herpesvirus that turns tongues purple has emerged as one of the biggest
killers of young captive Asian elephants. The disease - discovered only
about a decade ago but not confirmed as a herpes virus until 1995 - has
baffled researchers, who can't yet culture it or identify which elephants
could be carriers. There are 2 viruses: one is fatal to young Asian
elephants, one to African. Both viruses have been found in African
elephants, though only one is lethal to them. The death rate is high; 21
of the 24 Asian elephants in which a virus was confirmed died. Virus has
been found in 2 African elephants that died.
Medication has mixed results. Of the 6 Asian elephants treated with
famciclovir, a human anti-herpes drug, 3 have survived.
Clinical signs include a purple tongue; ulcerated mouth; lethargy;
diminished appetite; and body swelling around the head, neck and front
legs. Ever-active baby elephants might have to be trained to stand still
and open wide so keepers can get a complete view of the inside of their
mouths, not just their tongues.
The transmission route is unclear. No one knows how elephants transmit the
fatal virus to each other or which animals have been exposed or could be
carriers. One form of the virus has been found on the skin of African
elephants, and researchers suspect that those elephants could be
transmitting it without falling victim to it. However, fatal infections
have felled Asian elephants with no African contacts, prompting researchers
to also wonder whether some Asian elephants could be latent carriers.
Youth is a risk factor. Asian elephants most at risk are those under 10
years old that have moved to another facility, been housed with an African
elephant, or have traveled between facilities with a history of the
infection. Some - but not all - of the infection's victims were transferred
to different facilities several months before the virus erupted. Some
veterinarians suspect stress could be a factor, although they concede
stress is hard to measure. Two U.S. elephants that survived the virus were
both still with their mothers and nursing; one animal in Europe was not.
Researchers recommend that all young elephants be monitored daily and
trained for blood sampling and potential oral and rectal drug treatment.
"They'll look completely healthy, then look a little off and in a few
hours, they'll be in the throes of the disease," says Dr. Dennis Schmitt, a
Southwest Missouri State University veterinarian and elephant expert. The
infection is acute from the onset and can destroy the animal's vital
organs, especially the liver and heart, within a matter of days - or
sometimes just hours. A purple tongue - a sign of hemorrhaging and a lack
of circulation there - is the classic omen of a full-blown infection.
Of the 26 cases confirmed so far, 21 of the Asian elephants have died,
according to the latest findings, which Dr. Richard Montali, Washington
National Zoological Park, presented last month at the International
Elephant Foundation Research Symposium in Vienna, Austria. A similar herpes
virus also has killed 2 African elephants.
Although herpes has not been found among elephants in the Dallas or Fort
Worth zoos, it has shown up at the Houston Zoological Gardens. Three
elephants born there died from herpes just months after being transferred
to other zoos in Chicago, Canada and Germany, Dr. Montali says. However,
Houston zoo veterinarians had no proof that the disease actually was in its
herd until New Year's Day 2000, when 6-year-old Singgha, an Asian, died
just 7 hours after the first signs of infection were identified. "Keepers
said she was absolutely normal the day before," says Houston's chief
veterinarian, Dr. Joe Flanagan. Once they identified the problem, they
tried to treat her with famciclovir but were unsuccessful at saving her.
Today, the elephants' tongues are checked twice a day, and the zoo keeps on
hand a day's worth of famciclovir.
It has been identified in herds throughout the United States and in Europe
and the Middle East. There have been unconfirmed reports of it among
captive elephants in India, and there is evidence of the virus in wild
African elephants, Dr. Montali says. So far, it has not been found in wild
Asian elephants.
Most types of herpes usually stay dormant in nerve roots and are carried
for life. Although this virus has been found in harmless skin lesions and
nodules of African elephants, its effect on Asian elephants is much more
sinister. In the Asians, it strikes the endothelial cells lining
capillaries, with disastrous consequences to vital organs. Eventually, it
destroys the heart. Once symptoms appear death is rapid.
"Herpes usually doesn't manifest itself like this," Dr. Montali says. "It
usually doesn't kill its host."
Veterinarians at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which cares for
63 Asian elephants, the largest herd in North America, are testing
famciclovir on 6 healthy Asian elephants under 6 years old. They hope to
mimic the dose levels that work in humans. "We don't know what's too high
or too low," says Dr. Ramiro Isaza, a Kansas State University professor and
part-time Ringling veterinarian who is coordinating the study. Nor do the
researchers know how often the drug should be given or what its absorption
rate is.
