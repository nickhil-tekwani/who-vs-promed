ProMED-mail has learned that there is a cluster of influenza A H5N1 cases
being investigated in Hong Kong. This cluster includes an index case and at
least two close family contacts, providing the first evidence of more than
one infection within a family setting. Although the possibility of
independent introductions cannot be excluded, the onset of illness in the
apparent secondary cases followed the index case by 3-4 days. This may be
evidence of human-to-human transmission. The Hong Kong Department of Health
has now formally recognized this possibility.
The total number of cases now is 9, not all confirmed as H5N1.
Paired serum samples from suspect cases now are being tested. Results
should provide indication of further spread of this virus or lack of such
spread, which is what we all hope for.
