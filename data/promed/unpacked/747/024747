The deaths of 2 patients in a [Queensland] hospital have been linked to an outbreak of the _Streptococcus_ [group] A bacteria. A bacterial outbreak at a Brisbane private hospital has killed 2 patients and infected at least 2 others, forcing authorities to lock down part of the facility. Greenslopes Private Hospital, on Brisbane's south, had last night [night of 12 Dec 2013] isolated its rehabilitation unit from the rest of the facility and suspended all admissions.

Two men, aged in their 90s, have died from the streptococcus A infections with another 2 patients testing positive to the bacteria. Authorities are testing all patients and staff in the unit for the bacteria, including those who had been discharged in the past 2 weeks. Queensland Health has been notified of the infections and the deaths of the 2 men.

_Streptococcus_ [group] A is a bacterium often found in the throat and on the skin. People can carry the bacteria without becoming sick and some develop minor symptoms such as a sore throat. But in rare cases the bacteria can invade the bloodstream or the lungs and can cause severe, life-threatening illnesses, particularly in the elderly. A Greenslopes Hospital spokeswoman said _Streptococcus_ [group] A could be spread from person to person via respiratory droplets and close contact with someone carrying the bacteria. "Most people who come into contact with Group A _Streptococcus_ remain well and symptom free,'' she said. The spokeswoman said once identified, the infection could be successfully treated with antibiotics.

Patients and visitors to the Greenslopes hospital rehabilitation unit since [29 Nov 2013] are advised to phone 3394 7826.

[The following is mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, nosocomial - China: (HK) 20081231.4135:

Group A streptococci (GAS, also known as _Streptococcus pyogenes_) are an uncommon but important cause of nosocomial infections. GAS can be highly contagious and prior ProMED-mail posts -- archive numbers 20080206.0484 and 20050308.0692 -- have reported spread of group A streptococcal disease in health care settings among susceptible patients and health care workers.

The news release above does not state whether the cases had any underlying diseases, such as open wounds, recent surgery, diabetes, or immune deficiency, which would make patients particularly vulnerable to GAS infection, though the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk for invasive GAS infections, which tend to be more severe and may be complicated by shock, multisystem organ failure, and death.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm). Epidemiologic studies in the US suggest that a significant percentage of the serious sequelae of group A streptococcal infections are associated with a relatively small number of specific emm/M protein types.

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948, http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192, http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911). Molecular analysis of the isolates will aid documenting a common source outbreak. The source of a nosocomial outbreak may be an asymptomatic patient or even a healthcare worker who carries GAS either in the anus, vagina, skin, or pharynx and can shed the organism into the immediate environment despite proper gowning and gloving (see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056612.htm). - Mod.ML
