Students in 4th and 5th high school grades of the Escuela Normal Doctor Pedro Molina located in La Alameda, Chimaltenango, became ill yesterday, 10 Apr 2014, after they had consumed chicken, beans, and rice, allegedly in poor condition.

The affected students pointed out that on 9 Apr 2014 they went to the capital to watch a play, and that it was the food transported on the grill of the buses that made them I'll. They said that at the end of the cultural activity they had their lunch and noticed that the beans and rice had a bad taste, and that the chicken was not of a normal consistency, but they ate the food because they were hungry.

School master Axel Montufar said that on the early morning of 10 Apr 2014, 4 students started with vomiting, diarrhea, and headache; however, within minutes, the discomfort was evident in 335 young people. The ill were evaluated, 185 were transferred to the National Hospital in Chimaltenango and the rest received attention on campus.

In the hospital, some young people were hydrated orally; others, intravenously. One student said that on the day of the activity no food was consumed in the capital, and therefore it is likely that the lunch was the cause of the illnesses.

Hospital epidemiologist Edgar Barrier said that the respective analysis to determine which microorganism caused the problem are being done, although it is believed to be either _E. coli_ or _Salmonella_.

"We will give some suggestions to the cooks, to take precautions at the time of preparing the food," he said. Gladis Lopez, director of the school, reported that there are 688 students at the school, and all of them eat there. Lopez said that the catering company was contracted by the Ministry of Education and the board of parents, so they will have to request an explanation from the supplier.

The students treated at the hospital were discharged from hospital already.

[With an incubation period of greater than 12 hours, it is likely that a preformed toxin illness was not the cause here but, as suspected, a microbe itself at work. Besides bacteria such as those mentioned as well as _Campylobacter_, viral causes of gastroenteritis have not been excluded. - Mod.LL
