NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS - OIE
FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, CAPRINE - TAIWAN
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of FMD in goats in Changhwa prefecture has been reported. The
date of the incident is 7 February and 22 one or two day old kids have
died, showing typical tiger heart lesions with alveolar emphysema. The
remaining 248 goats on the farm have been destroyed. Results of the DNA
sequencing indicate 99.4% similarity to O/Taiwain/99. These goats were
vaccinated for FMD on 26 January. All milk from the farm was destroyed,
strict hygiene procedures and quarantine with 3 km of the farm and redouble
emphasis on mass vaccination has been instituted.
[For reasons the vaccination program may have failed, please see Mod.TG
comments in second posting in this thread: Foot & mouth disease, caprine -
Taiwan (02) 20000226215511. It is important for our readers to understand
time ordering of events in this outbreak and our coverage of it. This
present report gives details on the first outbreak in goats reference in
two posting Foot & mouth disease, ovine - Taiwan 20000217203007 Yes, you
read correctly, it did say ovine. In these two postings, a case of Foot IN
Mouth Disease occurred because goats were reported to be sheep. The record
was kindly set strait by Kenichi Sakamoto in our corrected posting: Foot &
mouth disease, ovine - Taiwan: CORRECTION 20000218203251.
Ah, that feels good! Since I also suffer from Foot in Mouth Disease from
time to time, I have been itching to use that particular pun. Seriously,
the good news contained in this report is that we still have a single FMD
virus circulating in the cattle and goat populations - O/Taiwan/99. It is
possible to have multiple strains circulating in a given geographic area,
complicating the vaccination requirements.
The bad news is that FMD spreads incredibly rapidly and movement from
cattle to goats complicates a stamping out policy, raises the question of
the immune status of pigs and holds the potential for spread into deer
populations in the mountains. The newly reported outbreak in goats,
details of which may be reported by OIE in the next few weeks, makes the
situation even murkier- see Foot & mouth disease, caprine - Taiwan (02)
20000226215511. Furthermore, the two caprine outbreaks are separated by
some 150 km. Clearly, animal health officials have lost the first round.
With FMD, you can't lose too many rounds before being knocked out. Given,
Taiwan's previous suffering with FMD in 1997, we wish them better luck with
the continuing rounds of vaccinations, stamping out and quarantine. - Mod.PC
AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS, EQUINE - SOUTH AFRICA
---------------------------------------------
On 8 Feb 2000, a horse died acutely in Malmesbury district, the Western
Cape. The farm is located in the surveillance or buffer zone for AHS in
South Africa. The free zone has NOT been involved to date. Vaccination and
movement control has been instituted around the affected farm. Diagnosis
was by ELISA at Ondersteroort Veterinary Institute, the OIE reference
laboratory for AHS.
