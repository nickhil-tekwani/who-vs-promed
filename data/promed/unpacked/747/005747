Eastern equine encephalitis reported in Baldwin horse
-----------------------------------------------------
A horse from the area south of Fairhope has tested positive for Eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE), the Baldwin County Health Department announced
on Friday. Rachel Jennings, an environmentalist with the Health Department,
said that no human cases have been detected through the department's
ongoing surveillance for the mosquitoborne virus.
"This is the first indication of anything that we've had this year
[2004],"Jennings said. "Nobody should panic, nobody should not go outside,
but they should wear their repellent and avoid times when mosquitoes are
going to be particularly bad; that is, at dawn and dusk."
According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
EEE, although rare, is regarded as one of the more serious mosquitoborne
diseases in the United States, with a fatality rate of about 35 per cent
among humans. Of those who survive, about 35 per cent will have mild to
severe brain damage, CDC says. There is no EEE vaccine for humans, and
there are no drugs considered effective against the disease, according to CDC.
According to the Health Department, EEE and other mosquitoborne viruses
such as West Nile virus are transmitted from bird to mosquito to bird.
Occasionally, when bird hosts are scarce, the same mosquitoes will take
blood from mammals, including humans and horses, occasionally transmitting
the disease.
Dr J P Lofgren of the Alabama Department of Public Health said people
shouldn't wait until EEE or West Nile are detected in their area to start
taking precautions against mosquito bites. "The take-home lesson is that
one needs to assume that once mosquitoes are out, they're in every
community and there exists some risk of some kind of disease," Lofgren
said. West Nile virus, which is less deadly than EEE, is the most common
mosquitoborne illness in this area, Lofgren said.
In 2003, the Alabama Department of Public Health reported finding EEE in 26
Alabama counties, including Mobile and Baldwin. Among those were 39 horses
and 2 human cases, including an Escambia County youth who died from the
infection. Lofgren said it is almost impossible to predict what will happen
this year.
Dr Albert Corte of Daphne, a veterinarian, said that in his experience, EEE
is uniformly fatal to horses, with less than 24 hours elapsing from the
first signs until the horse is down and unable to rise. "There are reports
that the animal can survive," Corte said. "I have not seen it to be true
here; never with triple-E, and I've been practicing for 40 years." [Earlier
ProMED-mail reports suggest 50 to 90 per cent equine case fatality rate.
Any reliable figures available? - Mod.SH] Corte said he recommends that
horse owners have their animals vaccinated against EEE, Western equine
encephalitis and West Nile virus. "At this point in time, recommendations
are that horses be vaccinated at least twice a year for Eastern and Western
encephalitis," Corte said. "That is an old recommendation and it is still
current. West Nile virus, it is recommended that they be vaccinated at
least 3 times."
Jennings said the department has stepped up its mosquito control efforts in
the area where the virus was detected. "We have already sprayed the area,
and we will probably wait a few days and then make sure we spray the area
again," she said. "We already have a sentinel chicken flock there; so far
those have been negative. We will probably go down and set some mosquito
traps, and will also be stepping up our larvicide efforts in that area as
well."

[This is early in the year for EEE to be making an appearance. There is a
combination vaccine for Eastern equine, Western equine, Venezuelan equine
encephalitis, West Nile virus, and tetanus (VEWT-WN). The 2 or 3
vaccination routine is good protection against a preventable disease for
horses. Although there are those who may believe they are too far north or
not in a region where Venezuelan equine encephalitis could be, it is also a
bioterrorism agent and this combination vaccine may be good insurance.- Mod.TG]
