Pneumonia that kills over 90 000 children every year in Pakistan is taking shape of an epidemic among local population, as after setting in of winter the allied hospitals in town [Rawalpindi] have been receiving 80 to 120 child patients with pneumonia per day.

Data collected by 'The News' reveal that out of 800 to 900 child patients visiting paediatrics outpatient departments of the 3 teaching hospitals in town, nearly 500 to 550 are being reported with upper or lower respiratory tract infections.

Two of the 3 teaching hospitals, including Holy Family Hospital [HFH] and Benazir Bhutto Hospital [BBH], that have complete paediatrics departments are admitting 50 to 60 child patients with severe pneumonia per day and the number of cases is continuously on the rise.

Soon after fall in temperature, the incidence of both the upper and the lower respiratory tract infections has increased among children and nearly 60 percent of all cases being reported at the paediatrics departments are with upper respiratory tract infections including colds, sore throat, runny nose, cough, fever, flu, and other respiratory symptoms, said Head of Paediatrics Department at Rawalpindi Medical College Professor Dr Rai Muhammad Asghar while talking to 'The News'.

He added that of the cases of respiratory tract infections, nearly 20 to 30 percent are being reported with lower respiratory tract infections including mild or severe pneumonia. Majority of cases being reported with pneumonia are of infants around the age of 6 months, he said.

To a query, he said almost all child patients of severe pneumonia are being admitted to the paediatrics departments of BBH and HFH. The HFH has a 120-bedded ward and BBH has a 100-bedded ward though not less than 300 patients are undergoing treatment at the two hospitals. Majority of the admitted patients are with severe pneumonia, said Professor Rai.

He added after the setting in of winter, the number of child cases with complications of asthma and wheezing is also on the rise. There may be a number of causes behind spread of respiratory tract infections among local population but the most important fact is that these can be avoided through proper preventive measures, he said.

He said that parents should be made aware of the fact that pneumonia is one of the top killers of children below 5 years of age and its incidence should not be taken as lightly because through prevention and in time management of the cases, more than 70 percent of the deaths caused by it can be avoided.

He explained that fast breathing and lower chest wall indrawing are the main symptoms of pneumonia that may be because of 2 major organisms, including [the] bacteria _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ [and] _Haemophilus influenzae_. A patient of severe pneumonia suffers from difficulty in breathing with severe respiratory distress along with central cyanosis in which colour of hands and feet particularly gets bluish, he said.

To a query, he said a patient of severe pneumonia must need admission to the hospital while simple pneumonia patients can be treated at home.

Talking of preventive measures, he said children below 5 years of age must be administered pneumococcal vaccine and _H. influenzae_ type B (Hib) vaccine, which is available under the Expanded Programme on Immunization.

Both vaccines are available at the allied hospitals free of cost, said Professor Rai.

He added that to avoid upper and lower respiratory tract infections, children should be protected from cold by using proper warm clothing while infants should be breastfed at least for 2 years. Parents should prevent children getting wet to avoid pneumonia and the environment of the children should be kept clean. Children and infants must be kept in rooms having proper ventilation, he said.

[Rawalpindi's large hospitals are seeing hundreds of patients daily with acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) with the onset of winter; about 70 to 80 percent of the illnesses are upper RTIs, but nearly 20 to 30 percent are lower RTIs, including mild to severe pneumonia; 50 to 60 children with severe pneumonia per day are requiring hospitalization. The majority of patients with pneumonia we are told are infants around the age of 6 months. However, no etiologic agents have apparently been identified as yet.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in infants and young children is most commonly due to viruses. The most common are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and influenza virus, which occur in the colder months of the year. Enteroviruses occur during the warmer summer months. RSV is highly contagious: almost all children are infected with the virus by 2 years of age. RSV spreads rapidly among children during outbreaks. Even after recovery, infants and children can continue to spread the virus for 1 to 3 weeks. RSV most commonly causes upper RTIs (such as a cold-like illness, bronchitis, or croup), but lower RTIs (such as bronchiolitis, which is inflammation of the small airways of the lungs, or pneumonia, which can become life-threatening) more likely occurs in infants. The risk of severe RSV infection is greatest for premature infants, children with heart or lung disease, immune deficient children, and children under 8 to 10 weeks of age. Some children with severe RSV are treated with an aerosolized drug called ribavirin. There is no vaccine to prevent RSV infection, but palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent RSV infections during RSV season in infants and young children who have a higher risk for serious illness caused by RSV.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is also more common in children under 5 years of age, but HMPV-positive infants are older than RSV-positive infants, although the severity of illness is similar to that of RSV. Of bacterial causes, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ are frequently associated with outbreaks of community-acquired pneumonia in school-aged children. Further information concerning this outbreak would be welcomed from knowledgeable sources.
