------------------------------------------------------------
Response from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center:
3 mallard ducks (_Anas platyrhynchos_) collected by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) from this mortality event were necropsied at the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Gross and microscopic lesions in the lungs were consistent with acute aspergillosis. Additionally, _Aspergillus fumigatus_ was confirmed on fungal culture of the lung.

We have thus determined the cause of this avian mortality event to be acute aspergillosis, and we have documented this event in WHISPers (https://whispers.usgs.gov/event/200989), the Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership -- event reporting system. Birds feeding on waste grain contaminated with spores of _A. fumigatus_ is a suspected cause of acute avian aspergillosis outbreaks (https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/2001096).

[Birds feeding in water rich in organic matter may often be colonized by fungi. _Aspergillus_ species are ubiquitous saprophytic molds with worldwide distribution. The disease they cause is called aspergillosis and is the commonest opportunistic mycotic infection of the respiratory tract in birds, causing high morbidity and mortality.

Development of avian aspergillosis is through inhalation of spores during feeding or other activities in which the spores could be aerosolized. Lesions are usually localized in the respiratory system but may also be distributed in kidneys, liver, and other organs. - Mod.PMB
