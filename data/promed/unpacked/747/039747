Something worth considering might be _Datura stramonium_ toxicity. _D. stramonium_ is a relatively common field crop weed, has significant volumes of comparatively small (black) seeds that can be very toxic and would likely be hard to detect in a flour product.

I have seen it clinically once in pigs fed gradings from cereal crops as a limited part of their diet. On that occasion, the seeds were concentrated by the grading process and were easily detected in the gradings that were being fed.

[There are a number of common names for the _Datura_ spp., including angel's trumpet, devil's trumpet, jimsonweed, moon trumpet, and thorn apple, to name a few.

Some species of _Datura_ can be attractive and planted in yards for decoration. It can be a very attractive plant and often grows much like a shrub would. It frequently ranges from 2 to 4 feet tall (60-120 cm). In a field, it could accidently be harvested, but the timing would need to be when the plant was mature.

The plant has an almost worldwide distribution and is very adaptable to many climates and habitats.

There are a number of species with slight differences in the shape of leaves or flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents, in slightly different proportions. Photos may be seen at http://www.wildflowersofontario.ca/jimsonweed1.jpg and http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/images/10292.jpg. The thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at http://i1.treknature.com/photos/11556/datura_metel04.jpg.

The memory tool for jimsonweed intoxication is "red as a beet, dry as a bone" (flushed, hot, red skin) and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in Wonderland, for its hallucinogenic properties). The seeds have been collected by addicts trying to get high because of their hallucinogenic properties. A variety of _Datura_ species are sold ground as herbs and have proven to be dangerous. So while an extract or tincture of the boiled seeds may provide some hallucinogenic properties, it may also have fatal effects.

The plant contains a tropane alkaloid (a belladonna alkaloid). These alkaloids are similar to atropine and scopolamine. The plant contains 0.45% to 2.0%. Humans and frequently animals are affected by this plant.

The most common clinical signs are subnormal temperatures, mydriasis, restlessness, muscular twitching, convulsions, tachycardia, incoordination, and paralysis; death can result from respiratory paralysis.

Treatment usually includes activated charcoal to reduce gastric absorption of the toxin and physostigmine to reverse the effects of the toxin. However, in some cases gastric emptying may be necessary.

Many varieties are used as ornamentals and often are planted in gardens and around walkways. The wild plants may be controlled with appropriate herbicides. - Mod.TG
