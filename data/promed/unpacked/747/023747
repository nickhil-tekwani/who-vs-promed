Late blight found in Maryland
-----------------------------
Late blight, the fungus that devastated tomato crops on the East
Coast last summer [2009], has been found on tomato plants in Maryland
in a St Mary's County greenhouse. The University of Maryland (UM) has
sent representatives to determine whether this is the strain that hit
Maryland last year [2009], or a more virulent strain that can
over-winter. They will also check if the blight has spread beyond the
greenhouse where the plants were grown from seed.

Jon Traunfeld, UM, said the late blight that hit in 2009 can only
survive on plant material and cannot endure winter cold. So if
gardeners and farmers did a good job of cleaning up, they should be
able to start the 2010 season disease-free. However, if there were
potatoes left in the ground over winter, the blight can survive on them.

Organic gardeners were especially hard hit in 2009 because there is
no effective organic fungicide to combat late blight. "Copper spray
just doesn't do it," Traunfeld said. He also advises to purchase
tomato plants from Maryland. It is possible that plants imported from
southern states, where tomato plants can survive outdoors all winter,
may carry infection.

Blight again threatens tomatoes
-------------------------------
A problem that surfaced last year [2009] is a concern again. Tomato
blight is expected to make a return appearance. In 2009, blight
destroyed millions of dollars worth of tomatoes in the eastern US,
including Ohio. Cornell University's Meg McGrath said another
outbreak is likely this year [2010]. Late blight has already hit
gardens in Florida and Louisiana, but farmers and gardeners can cut
their losses by isolating plots, removing remnants of last year's
plants and inspecting for signs of disease.

Because blight already has been found in some areas of the South,
Ohio farmers and gardeners are being advised to be on alert, said
Sally Miller, Ohio State University (OSU). "Especially if the weather
continues to be cool and rainy. We can't predict how bad the issue
could get this year [2010]." She said the best way to avoid it is to
buy seedlings from local nurseries and to make sure the plants are
healthy. Infected plants should be pulled up, placed in plastic bags
and thrown away.

The US Department of Agriculture didn't investigate the cause of the
[2009] outbreak. But pathologists suspect mass-produced tomato plants
shipped to big-box stores from the South were the source, because
blight was found on tomato seedlings at garden centers for the 1st
time and the same strain was found in 23 states, McGrath said. 2009
was unusual in that late blight arrived early in the season and
thrived throughout the unusually cool, wet summer, she said.

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like
organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop
loss. To a lesser extent, it can also affect other solanaceous crops
such as aubergine (eggplant) and capsicum. The pathogen can affect
leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato causing spots, lesions, and
rotting, and in potato it affects leaves as well as tubers. The
disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few
days. It is spread by contaminated plant and other material, wind,
and water. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be
even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and includes
phytosanitary measures, removal of solanaceous weeds and volunteer
crop plants serving as pathogen reservoirs, limiting free moisture in
the crop, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material
(tomato transplants, potato seed tubers), and fungicide sprays of
crops. Crop rotation with non-hosts may reduce available inoculum.
While commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late
blight, development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by
the adaptability of the pathogen, with new strains evolving all the time.

In the 2009 epidemic in the US (multiple ProMED-mail posts listed
below), late blight on tomato was initially reported in January in
Florida, but subsequently also in many other states both in tomato
and potato. Alabama was suspected to be the source of the infected
tomato seedlings (ProMED-mail post 20090519.1875) that were thought
to have started the outbreak.
