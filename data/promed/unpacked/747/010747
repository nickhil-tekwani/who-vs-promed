Re: Al-Wijam disease, date palm - Egypt: 1st report 20110519.1512
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the preliminary results of our study, the occurrence of Al

Wijam disease in date palm of Egypt cannot be conclusively verified.

This is because we could not detect the causal agent by electron
microscopy in affected plants. Moreover, no DNA sequencing has been

performed yet to support the occurrence of Al Wijam disease in
Egypt.

Thank you for posting this follow-up as a clarification.
