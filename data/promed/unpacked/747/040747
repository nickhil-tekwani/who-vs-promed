Two more animals have died of the equine condition "seasonal pasture
myopathy" or "atypical myopathy" in Carinthia, Austria. Seven horses
have recently died of the condition in Austria. The reasons for the
deaths are currently being discussed, and winter food supplies are
thought by many to be the cause.

The illness is a worry for horse owners around the country. Since
Wednesday [16 Nov 2011], 2 more horses have succumbed to the disease
with 7 already having been handed over to veterinary services. The
animal rendering association has also reported an increase in animal
numbers but will not provide exact figures.

Little is known about the disease itself, which initially affects the
horse's muscles and eventually its breathing. According to Kurt Sick,
head of the state office for veterinary research, one of the most
significant causes is the weather. Frost and warm daytime temperatures
can promote the spread of the disease.

"It often comes down to the freezing of the grass. It is possible that
when this happens, toxic substances are released from the grasses and
fungi," explained Sick. As well as the bacteria, poisonous plants such
as the sycamore maple and the oak may also play a role.

Sick has encouraged people not to panic. He has advised horse owners
to ensure that the animals spend the majority of their time in pasture
as well as giving them hay to eat. Riding school teacher Maria
Fleischhacker also supports these actions as preventative measures,
suggesting that if there is enough hay in the pasture, the horses will
not have to find food elsewhere.

[Earlier this year (2011), researchers in Switzerland suggested that
_Clostridium sordellii_ toxins could be suspected as the possible
cause of equine atypical myopathy (EAM). Final evidence is still
awaited; see ProMED mail post 20110410.1139. - Mod.AS]
