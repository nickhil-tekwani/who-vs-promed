2 horses die from eastern equine encephalitis
---------------------------------------------
A serious disease that can affect humans has killed 2 horses in Lake
County, Florida. Lake County health officials report the horses died
from problems caused by eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

Mosquitoes spread the disease, which means it can also be spread to
humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says EEE can
cause vomiting, disorientation, seizures, coma, or even death in
severe cases. It's one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted
diseases in the United States.

Health officials are asking folks to take precautions. They're
recommending people get rid of any standing water around their homes.
They also say people should keep their pools chlorinated -- to kill
any mosquitoes. They also recommend using mosquito repellent, wear
protective clothing, and stay indoors when mosquitoes are most
active.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is a mosquito transmitted disease. Horses
acquire the disease from mosquitoes. People acquire the disease from
mosquitoes. Horses cannot transmit the disease to human beings.

There is a vaccine for horses. In regions, such as Florida where it is
not particularly cold and killing frosts are rare, it is especially
important to vaccine the horses every 4 to 6 months. The protection
wanes in about 6 months, but the mosquitoes may still be around.

Sadly, it is often a fatal infection for the horse. It can also be
fatal to human beings. People should heed the warnings from the health
department. â€“ Mod.TG]
