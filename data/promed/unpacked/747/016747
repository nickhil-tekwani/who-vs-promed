Notes from the field: Fatal anthrax pneumonia in welders and other metalworkers caused by _Bacillus cereus_ group bacteria containing anthrax toxin genes -- US Gulf Coast States, 1994-2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2020, CDC confirmed 2 cases of pneumonia (one fatal) in welders caused by rare _Bacillus cereus_ group bacteria containing anthrax toxin genes typically associated with _Bacillus anthracis_. _B. cereus_ group bacteria are gram-positive facultative anaerobes, often toxin-producing, that are ubiquitous in the environment and reside naturally in soil and dust (1). _B. cereus_ can also be found in food, and although infection typically causes illnesses characterized by diarrhea or vomiting, _B. cereus_ can have other clinical manifestations (e.g., pulmonary, ocular, or cutaneous). Among 7 persons in the USA reported to be infected with _B. cereus_ group bacteria containing anthrax toxin genes resulting in pneumonia since 1994, 5 patients died and 2 had critical illness with prolonged hospitalization and recovery (2-5). All persons with pneumonia were welders or other metalworkers who had worked in Louisiana or Texas (Table) [for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL]. In addition to the 7 pneumonia cases, a cutaneous infection with _B. cereus_ group bacteria containing anthrax toxin genes has been reported in a patient with an anthrax eschar in Florida (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156987).

Understanding the extent to which _Bacillus_ species other than _B. anthracis_ carry anthrax toxin genes and whether their geographic range extends beyond the USA Gulf Coast states is limited. Furthermore, little is known about why these highly fatal pneumonia cases have only been detected among welders and other metalworkers. Long-term exposure to welding and metalworking fumes is associated with various forms of lung injury that can cause changes in lung function and increase susceptibility to pulmonary infections, including fatal pneumonia (https://www.sjweh.fi/article/625; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713611032). An investigation by CDC at one patient's worksite in Louisiana (patient F) identified a bacterial isolate in a soil sample that genetically matched a clinical isolate from the patient. However, it is unclear why only one person at each worksite became ill and what environmental or host risk factors might have facilitated the exposure and infection.

Several actions can decrease risk for lung injury or infection, including anthrax pneumonia caused by _B. cereus_ group bacteria, among welders and other metalworkers. Because of the association between welding or metalworking and pulmonary infections or injury, it is important that employers educate workers regarding hazards associated with welding and measures they can take to minimize potential exposures. Welding and metalworking employers, trade associations, and unions might consider targeted outreach to increase workers' awareness about pulmonary infections, including anthrax, especially those workers in the USA Gulf Coast states. In addition, employers should conduct a hazard assessment at worksites and consider the use of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved respirators as part of a written respiratory protection program (Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 29 CFR Sect. 1910.134. https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/directives/cpl-02-02-054, https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource.html).

Clinicians should consider _B. cereus_ group bacteria in the differential diagnosis when treating welders and other metalworkers with severe, rapidly progressive pneumonia or other anthrax-like disease (https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/treatment/index.html). _B. cereus_ group bacteria identified on culture are not always contaminants; when _B. cereus_ with anthrax toxin is suspected, laboratorians and clinicians should pursue additional testing through their state Laboratory Response Network laboratory (https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/). Regional health departments and the Laboratory Response Network serve pivotal roles in pathogen detection and procuring anthrax antitoxin for confirmed cases.

[ProMED has previously posted about such cases. In 2017, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (_Bacillus cereus_, anthrax-like infection: identification advice Archive Number: 20171003.535848) noted such strains in Africa: "An unknown strain of _Bacillus cereus_ causing anthrax-like disease was 1st isolated in a dead chimpanzee in Cote d'Ivoire in 2001 and again in 2002. Following in 2004 and 2006, researchers isolated samples from another chimpanzee and a western lowland gorilla further east in Cameroon. Although anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, tests showed the isolated strain was a form of _B. cereus_ carrying plasmids that were identical to the virulence plasmids found in _B. anthracis_. The new strain was named _B. cereus_ biovar (bv) anthracis."

The 2004 PNAS report (1) described _B. cereus_ G9241, one of several past isolates of the organism, causing unusually severe lung disease and which was very similar to _B. anthracis_. G9241 had been isolated from a Louisiana welder in 1994. In 1996, 2 additional cases in Texas metal workers were reported as well as an environmental isolate (2). One of the isolates was clinically indistinguishable from the Louisiana case. The clinical isolates possessed a capsule, but it was not the anthrax poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. The Texas cases were described in clinical form in 2007 (3). Further evaluation of the G9241 strain, interestingly, found that despite producing its virulence factors, the strain behaved more like the attenuated toxigenic nonencapsulated Sterne strain in rabbits and mice (4).

With these cases seemingly localized to Texas and Louisiana in the USA, an additional isolate was, as noted above, found from a cluster of anthrax-like deaths that occurred in Cote d'Ivoire among wild chimpanzees in 2001 and 2002 (5). This strain had the typical _B. cereus_ chromosomal background with the typical anthrax virulence plasmids. Importantly, the isolate did not contain the 4 _B. anthracis_-specific prophage regions and also did not have the classical nonsense mutation in the regulator gene P1cR. The highly monophyletic anthrax clade all contain these features (6).

These isolates seem, once again, to nominate Mother Nature as our world's best bioterrorist. Microbiologists and clinicians should be aware of these strains especially in the population described in the posting.

Of note, the Table in this MMWR post describes 2 cases from 2020. The genetic makeup of these 2 more recent cases is not included. Also the table has a footnote reporting "Recent taxonomic updates have subdivided the _B. cereus_ group into an additional 9 species
(https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.001821).

Whole genome sequence analysis suggests these isolates would be
classified as newly described _Bacillus tropicus_."
