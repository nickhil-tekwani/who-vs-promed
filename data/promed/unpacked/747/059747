The outbreak of FMD in Corrientes is indeed a
terrible blow to FMD eradication in Argentina but
hardly surprising, given the proven circulation
of virus O in the region. It just gives strength
to the idea that full eradication in the Southern
Cone can only be achieved with a region-wide
effort, well beyond meetings and institutional
declarations.
With regard to your statement that Brazil is the
most likely source, I consider it premature and
it certainly goes against the geographical risks.
It is disturbing that we keep saying that
transparency is the basis for surveillance
systems -- but then the countries that do report
new outbreaks in their free-zones are perceived
as the main sources of risk. In fact, those are
probably the ones the pose a lower risk to other
countries in the region.

[San Luis del Palmar is about 200 km east
southeast of Corrientes in the northeast of
Argentina. Obviously, there are questions about
how FMD got there from Brazil, as that is the
most likely source. Clearly though, the most
important issue is how to stamp this outbreak out
before a very costly vaccination campaign is
again necessary. - Mod.PC]
This statement is unwarranted. The city of San
Luis del Palmar, in the province of Corrientes,
is 25 km away from the border of Paraguay, and
280 km from the Brazilian border. You can check
this out at
<http://www.corrientes.gov.ar/turismo/images/Planos%20Estadistica/localidades%20y%20rutas-iterac.htm>
If one were going to speculate, the "most likely
source" for this outbreak would be Paraguay, and
not Brazil. Incidentally, the recent FMD outbreak
in Brazil also occurred near the Paraguayan
border in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
The 2nd moderator stated -- more wisely -- that,
"How the disease arrived there can only be
speculated upon at this point."

[As Dr. Zerbini has pointed out, there is FMD in
Mato Grosso do Sul and, as both letters point
out, the source of the outbreak in Argentina is
not known. ProMED-mail has been covering
outbreaks in both Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana.
Hopefully, as the epidemiology on how the disease
arrived in Argentina is established, it will be
shared with ProMED-mail.
It is concerning to the entire region to realize
that positive serology for FMD has been
established in areas of Brazil but has not been
reported to the OIE. This only increases the
difficulty of controlling the disease. - Mod.TG]
