Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the City of Detroit, and counties of Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Sanilac, Washtenaw, and Wayne.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Over the past few weeks, the share in this cohort represented by MSM has increased suggesting a spillover into the MSM community, which may serve to substantially boost the number of cases. As compared to the southern California outbreak, Michigan has a substantially lower number of homeless involved and more substance abusers. - Mod.LL]

Michigan has 14 times more hepatitis A cases than it did last year [2016] at this time, say epidemiologists with the state Department of Health and Human Services. The outbreak, which is mainly in southeast Michigan, has sickened 457 people. Of those, 370 have been hospitalized and 18 have died.

The outbreak is complicated. There is no single source such as food contamination -- and many groups of people are at risk, including homeless people, drug users, people who are neither, and now there are more cases among men who have sex with men.

Until October 2017, only 10 men who have sex with men had contracted hepatitis A. Then, in October 2017, there was a sudden spike of 11 additional cases.

The state is urging doctors and hospitals to vaccinate at-risk patients, but officials say resistance is too frequently a problem. Some hepatitis A patients have left the hospital while still infectious. Some people living with a hepatitis A patient have refused the vaccine and then gotten sick themselves, and some hepatitis A patients have refused to disclose the names of family and close friends, which means health officials can't contact these individuals to inform them they should get the vaccine or early treatment.

The outbreak is still considered a regional epidemic, rather than statewide, although a small number of cases have occurred in Sanilac, Ingham, and Lapeer counties.

Officials are still trying to determine if the virus causing the outbreak is more aggressive than usual. Hepatitis A is very easily spread via lax hygiene and close proximity.

In the last week 26 more cases are reported with 1 more death. More than a 1/3 of the cases had neither homelessness nor substance abuse risk factors. It is possible that subclinical hepatitis A in food handlers may be responsible for some of the cases with no clear risk factors. Mandating hepatitis A vaccination among food handlers, as done in San Diego County, should be a consideration in Michigan. - Mod.LL
