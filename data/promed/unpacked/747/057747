India: Andhra Pradesh on high alert after 2 encephalitis deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Warangal are on high alert after 2 children died and
6 others developed encephalitis, raising fears of a possible epidemic.
Encephalitis is a viral infection of the brain transmitted by culicine
mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water, mostly in paddy fields, and
proliferate in summer and during the monsoon season.

Though curable if detected early, unhygienic living conditions, coupled
with delayed medical care, often [result in epidemics]. Andhra Pradesh is
particularly prone to Japanese encephalitis virus infection, the deadliest
form of encephalitis, but, much to the relief of doctors, in 2004, a much
milder strain was [diagnosed]. "It is not Japanese encephalitis. We have
conducted tests, and preliminary reports indicate that it is another
[encephalitis virus]," said a local health official. Doctors say children
are most prone to the disease because of their inadequate immunity to it.

The deadly [Japanese] encephalitis virus [infection exhibits a particular]
pattern by striking every alternate year. Patients run the risk of slipping
into a coma. The 1st symptoms of the disease are severe headache followed
by unconsciousness. Vaccination is the only [protection against Japanese
encephalitis virus infection]. The vaccine has been effective in
eradicating encephalitis within approximately 25 countries.

[Most of this report deals with the characteristics of Japanese
encephalitis virus infection and its control through vaccination, although
it is suggested that the outbreak may be due to another virus, or, perhaps,
an atypical milder strain of Japanese encephalitis virus. Further
information would be appreciated to clarify the diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
