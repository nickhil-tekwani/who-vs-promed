Because West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in North America,
and cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission
season, ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and
human cases in the US states and Canadian provinces for the current
reporting period. Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus
detection in birds, mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines as well
as a breakdown of human disease cases for 2008 can access that
information on the following sites:

West Nile season appears to be mildest in 7 years
-------------------------------------------------
The West Nile virus season is on track to be the mildest in 7 years,
with less than a third the number of serious cases as last year's
total, U.S. health officials said. As of Tuesday [7 Oct 2008], there
were 368 severe cases, with 18 deaths, according to preliminary
reports. Mississippi and California were hardest hit, together
accounting for nearly half the cases.

Most West Nile infections are reported in August and September, so
health officials believe the worst of the season is probably over.
It's not clear why this season has been so mild, said officials at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's the fewest cases
since 2001, when the mosquito-borne virus was still emerging in the
United States and was only reported in 10 states.

Mosquitoes often pick up the virus from birds they bite and then
spread it to people. Perhaps the weather in some areas of the country
was not as favorable for mosquito-breeding as in years past, some
experts said. West Nile virus was 1st reported in the United States
in 1999 in New York, then gradually spread across the country.

About one in 5 infected people get sick. One in 150 will develop
severe symptoms including neck stiffness, disorientation, coma and
paralysis. For all of 2007, more than 1200 cases of severe West Nile
illness were reported, with 124 deaths. The peaks occurred in 2002
and 2003, when severe illnesses numbered nearly 3000 and deaths surpassed 260.

[It would be interesting to know if populations of _Culex_ mosquito
WNV vectors are lower, if WNV antibody prevalence in wild bird
reservoirs is higher than in previous years, or if there has been
selection for WNV that is less virulent for humans. - Mod.TY]
