Brussels Commission suspends EU poultry imports from the USA after avian
influenza outbreak in Texas
----------------------------------------------
Following the confirmation of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI)
outbreak in Texas (USA), the European Commission adopted the proposal from
EU Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne to suspend the
import of live poultry, eggs, and pet birds from this country into the
European Union (EU) with immediate effect until 23 Mar 2004. Avian
influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can cause severe
economic damage to the poultry industry and can, in exceptional cases, be
transmitted to humans.
Commenting on the decision, David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and
Consumer Protection said: "This immediate ban is designed to protect the
high health status of the European poultry flocks. I have put the ban in
place until 23 Mar 2004 but will keep it under review."
Yesterday, the US authorities have confirmed an outbreak of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (AI) in a poultry flock in the State of Texas
(Gonzales County). The detected AI virus strain is different from the
strain currently causing the epidemic in Asia and probably poses inferior
public health risk to the Asian one.
However, in view of the risk of animal disease introduction into the EU,
immediate action is appropriate. The Commission therefore decided to
suspend the imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered
game, hatching eggs, eggs for human consumption, and birds other than
poultry (pet birds) from all of the USA.
These actions, adopted by the Commission today, enter immediately into
force. They are for the moment applicable until 23 Mar 2004. In the
meantime, the US authorities should provide the EU with detailed
information on the situation and the measures taken to bring the disease
under control. In the light of the information received in the next days,
further appropriate proportionate measures could be proposed.
The adopted Commission decision and the disease situation in the USA will
be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and
Animal Health scheduled for 2-3 Mar 2004.
The EU is a major importer of eggs and day-old chicks from the USA. In
2003, approximately 9 million eggs for a value of 20 million Euros have
been imported. This represents about 25 percent of the total imports of
eggs in the EU. In the same year, approximately 450 000 day old chicks for
a value of 2.5 million Euros (about 50 percent of the total imports in the
EU) have been imported from the USA. The EU does not import poultry meat
from the USA, because the current treatment of poultry carcasses in the USA
is not accepted by the EU.
