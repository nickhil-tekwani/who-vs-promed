_Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis outbreak among Norwegian tourists
returning from Crete and Karpathos
-------------------------------------
Norway's Statens institutt for folkehelse (National Institute of
Public Health, NIPH) has recently noticed an unusually high number of
cases infected with _Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis after a stay in
Crete or Karpathos.
The national reference laboratory for enteropathogens at NIPH has
noticed a particular cluster of cases infected with _Salmonella_
serotype Enteritidis. An unusual property of the strain isolated from
these patients is that it does not produce gas when fermenting
glucose. The phage type is 14b or variant 14b (typing has been
performed on only 11 isolates so far).
By 24 Sep 2001, 37 cases returning from holidays in Crete and 6 from
Karpathos, an island east of Crete, were reported to NIPH. Of the
tourists from Crete, 27 stayed in the Chania district, on the west of
the island. The median age of cases was 31 years, with an equal number
of male and female cases. All cases had symptoms of gastro-enteritis.
The onset of symptoms in the first case was 24 Jul 2001, but cases are
still occurring.
NIPH is currently conducting an investigation of this suspected
outbreak. The source of infection has not yet been identified. The
institute has established contacts with the public health authorities
in Greece and with the Enter-net surveillance hub.
