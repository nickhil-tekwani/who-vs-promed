Poultry producers have been reminded of the risks of pigeons spreading Newcastle disease (ND) following a disease outbreak in Sweden. The Swedish outbreak was reported last month [October 2018] at a large commercial farm on the western coast, which held 5000 laying hens. Presence of ND, which led to egg drop and eggs without shells but no increase in mortality, was caused by a virulent avian avulavirus type-1 (formerly Avian Paramyxovirus-1), according to PCR and gene sequencing.

Sweden does not allow vaccination for ND, with the industry willing to take the consequences of single outbreaks from time to time.

The UK's Animal and Plant Health Agency [APHA; sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, the Welsh Government and the Scottish Government] said avian avulavirus tupe-1 is highly variable in its ability to infect different avian species and can cause differing severity of the disease.

Following further laboratory investigations, the latest poultry ND outbreak in Sweden has been shown to be pigeon paramyxovirus. The pathotype sequence is indicative of virulent Newcastle disease, similar to that found in pigeons found dead in the same county in September [2018]. This implicates wild birds as the source of virus introduction into the commercial farm of fully susceptible non vaccinated birds. It also confirms that the virus is not the same as the Newcastle disease virus genotype isolated in Belgium in recent months [see 20180705.5890099. - Mod.AS].

APHA said sporadic cases of the pigeon variant in poultry in European countries, which do not vaccinate poultry against Newcastle disease virus, do not affect the UK's risk status but the Swedish case was a timely reminder of the potential threat posed by pigeons. However, [APHA] has reduced its risk level from medium to low with regard to the Belgium outbreaks in the summer. The Belgium situation is now controlled with disease-free status declared on [18 Oct 2018].

[Sweden reported the mentioned ND outbreak in Västra Götaland County on 26 Oct 2018; the report indicated that the 'source of the outbreak or origin of infection' was 'unknown or inconclusive'.

The current media report is based upon DEFRA's 'preliminary outbreak assessment' (Ref: VITT/1200 ND in Sweden), published on 9 Nov 2018. The assessment says: "Following further laboratory investigations, this latest poultry ND outbreak in Sweden has been shown to be pigeon paramyxovirus [pAAvV-1 (formerly pPMV1)]. The pathotype sequence is indicative of virulent AAvV-1, similar to that in pigeons found dead in the same county at the end of September 2018. Wild birds as the source of virus introduction into these commercial premises of fully susceptible non vaccinated birds are strongly implicated." The document, which includes a map presenting the affected region in western Sweden, also confirms that "this virus is not the same as the Newcastle Disease virus genotype isolated in Belgium in recent months"; see https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/755179/poa-nd-sweden.pdf.

In 2017, Sweden reported 3 outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND); the event started on 13 Aug 2017 and was declared as resolved on 29 Nov 2017. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=24590.

Sweden has, for many years, applied a strict non-vaccination policy as regards ND; Sweden also has the status as a non-vaccinating country as regards ND according to EU legislation.
