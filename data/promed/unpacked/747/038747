Australia's first importation of Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD) vaccine takes
place today, with the product on it's way from Spain.
Producers have been pushing for several years to be allowed to use the
vaccine in areas where the disease is leading to significant sheep losses.
The vaccine was to be imported a couple of months ago, but hit a number of
hurdles, which were overcome at the end of last week.
Brusce Reynolds reports CSL will be importing the Spanish vaccine, which
will be [used in trials] at 2 properties on the central tablelands of New
South Wales. This is being undertaken through the national OJD management
program to determine if it is feasible to manage the disease. Around 50
other producers will also be permitted to use the vaccine to lower losses
from the disease. Those producers will pay for the treatment, which will be
closely managed by New South Wales Agriculture, as the vaccine creates
major lesions on sheep and humans. Researchers will examine how effective
the vaccine is in reducing the level of infection on properties, and the
economic losses producers are encountering.
