Declaring that the nation's worst foot-and-mouth [FMD] outbreak was
over, the government yesterday [24 Mar 2011] announced a new measure
to tighten its oversight of the livestock industry, requiring farmers
to apply for permits to operate cattle and pig farms starting next
year [2012].

Following a discussion with the ruling Grand National Party, the Lee
Myung-bak administration yesterday [24 Mar 2011] admitted that it
failed to properly handle the FMD outbreaks at an early stage. The
disease, which swept across the nation except for Jeolla and Jeju
since November [2010], cost the government 3 trillion won [USD 2.7
billion], Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said in a press conference
yesterday. "Fortunately, the situation has calmed down now," Kim said.
"No more outbreaks were reported since 26 Feb 2011, and the number of
animals culled in the infected areas is rapidly decreasing."

The government has lowered the alert level for the disease, Kim said,
adding that authorities are now able to control the situation.
Starting next year [2012], only farmers who have proper facilities and
who have completed education programs on epizootic preventive measures
will be given permits to operate cattle and pig farms. The government
said the permit system will be adopted for large-scale farmers, while
small-scale farmers will need to register with their local
authorities, detailing their farming of chickens, ducks, cattle and
pigs. The government said more details on the permit system, including
who will be considered large-scale farmers, will be determined by the
end of next month [April 2011].

Under the new plan, the government will also hold farmers accountable
for outbreaks after conducting probes on their fulfillment of
prevention efforts. A new standard of compensation will also be used
to take into account the outbreak time, period, and scope of loss,
rather than paying uniform compensation based on the number of culled
animals.

Farmers will also be required to partially pay for vaccinations.
Local governments will also be required to help pay for culled animal
disposals. Conspicuously missing was a plan to impose a ceiling on the
number of animals that can be raised on large-scale livestock farms.
Government sources said earlier this month [March 2011] that a plan to
change factory-style farming practices was being considered as a way
to prevent disease outbreaks.

At the time, however, officials also expressed political jitters over
such a radical measure, because major livestock farmers are
influential people in the industry and their rural areas.

According to the Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries [FAFF], Yoo Jeong-bok, the government will continue routine
vaccinations for some time. "This does not mean, however, that we will
completely give up on going back to the status of being FMD-free
without vaccinations," he said.

The government also vowed to tighten its monitoring of disposal sites
where culled animals were buried around the nation in order to prevent
environmental contamination.

"We will complete all construction works at the disposal sites to
prevent any impact on underground waters and the nearby environments
by the end of March 2011," Kim said, adding that the FMFF Ministry
will continue monitoring the areas under the supervision of the Prime
Minister's Office.

According to Minister of Public Administration and Security Maeng
Hyung-Kyu, 416 of the 4600 disposal sites around the nation need
reinforcement work. "As of today [25 Mar 2011], 95 percent of the
construction is completed," he said.

The government also adopted a new manual to more quickly counter an
outbreak. As soon as an epizootic outbreak is confirmed, the highest
level warning will be issued, and all transportation to farms around
the nation will be stopped. Fertilizer and animal feed deliveries will
be controlled for a certain period to prevent the spread of the
disease.

The Agriculture Ministry, local governments, health authorities,
military and police will form a joint task force to assure a quick,
early response. Military support for quarantine efforts will also be
included in the new system.

An annual disinfection and quarantine drill is planned for every
local government, and immigration procedures will be tightened for
livestock workers going on overseas trips.

According to the government, a special education program for foreign
workers on farms will also be offered, as the number of migrant
workers in the livestock industry is rising.

The government said 150 outbreaks were confirmed in 11 cities and
provinces, and nearly 3.48 million animals were culled since the 1st
outbreak in November 2011. More than 158 000 were cattle, and nearly
3.32 million were pigs. Nearly 1.975 million people participated in
the battle against FMD, including 489 140 public servants and 338 862
soldiers. Eight public servants died, some from exhaustion.
