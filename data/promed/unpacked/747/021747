2 cases of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria have been recorded in November 2015 in Penza [Oblast, region]. Both men brought the infection with them from Goa (India).

20 days after returning from India they felt ill, with chills, headache, high temperature of 38 deg C [100.4 deg F] followed by periods of normal temperature. Assuming that they had the flu they took taken antipyretics and did not seek medical care. However, after 10 days, the temperature increased to almost 40 deg C [104 deg F] and the 2 patients were hospitalized.

Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus _Anopheles_ ("malaria mosquitoes"). It is characterized by fever, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly [enlarged liver & spleen], and frequent relapses. The incubation period ranges from 10-20 days to 6 months. In connection with the 2 cases, the National Health Service has informed travel agents of the need to inform tourists who travel to Goa that there is risk of malaria.

[Due to growing international migration and the reorientation of the flow of Russian tourists in Southeast Asia [since the attack on Russian tourists in Egypt], the risk of importation of exotic infections, including various types of malaria, dengue fever, and chikungunya will only grow. It should be noted that a malaria vaccine for its specific prevention does not exist. Meanwhile, several vaccines are now undergoing clinical trials and may appear soon in the pharmaceutical market. Currently chemoprophylaxis is recommended. - Mod.NP

There is a discussion of whether it is justified to recommend malaria prophylaxis to tourists visiting Goa. ProMED-mail has not reported malaria from Goa since 2008. If other countries have recorded malaria in tourists returning from Goa, we will be happy to post this information. - Mod.EP

An English lady I know well was diagnosed with _P. vivax_ malaria after we visited Goa in early 2011. She stopped prophylaxis early because the pills made her ill.

WHO & CDC still recommend malaria prophylaxis for most places in India including New Delhi.
