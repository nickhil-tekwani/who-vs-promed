Two British babies have contracted a rare life-threatening disease triggered by eating honey. The boys, aged 3 months and 5 months, had to be put on life-support machines suffering from infant botulism. Both had been feeding badly and showed typical symptoms: a floppy head, drooping eyelids, and constipation. They were treated only after an expensive medication [a hyper immune botulism immunoglobulin - Mod.LL] was flown in from the USA.

The incidents, confirmed last week, have prompted public health chiefs to warn that infants under one year of age should not be given honey. The younger boy had eaten honey, while the older one had been given a homeopathic treatment that may have contained honey, which can carry [spores of] the potentially deadly bacteria.

The identities of the babies treated and the hospitals involved have not been disclosed. But according to the latest health protection report from Public Health England, the 5-month-old was diagnosed in late December 2013 in central or southern England. He may still be in hospital, because recovery can sometimes take 6 months. He had taken the homeopathic remedy before becoming ill, though tests on it showed no trace of botulism.

The 3-month-old was treated at a children's hospital in northern England and has recovered. His mother admitted giving him honey at home, though tests on what was left in the jar also failed to detect the bacterium.

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the USA. In many cases, the source of the spores is not found, although honey has been a common vehicle. Babies being breastfed as the only source of food may also develop the illness.

A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial note (with references removed) from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified" (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5202a1.htm). - Mod.LL
