State officials say that 2 viruses spread by biting flies threaten to
kill thousands of the state's deer but it shouldn't substantially
affect hunting season.
The viruses cause hemorrhagic disease, known as blue tongue or black
tongue, and could kill 10 percent to 20 percent of the state's 1.1
million deer.
The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) is attempting to track
the effects of the disease. (People can report sick or dead deer at
(919) 733-7291).
The disease is spread by midges and has been found this year in 31 of
the state's 100 counties, mostly in the eastern and central parts of
the state. The disease has been reported in Alamance, Davidson,
Guilford, Randolph, and Rockingham counties.
The disease has not been reported in Forsyth County this year, but
Kate Pipkin, a biologist with the NCWRC, said it probably will be
found there soon. The disease is reported in a new county every
couple of days, she said.
Some infected deer show no symptoms, while others may become bloated
or thin. The disease can make the animals weak and feverish and can
cause hoof, mouth, and internal lesions.
The disease appears almost every year in the Southeast, but the
recent rain could make this year particularly bad.
"A dry summer followed by wet weather late in the season can cause a
surge in the midge population," said Evin Stanford, deer biologist
for the WRC. That was the pattern during outbreaks in 1994, 1999, and
2000, he said.
Nevertheless, deer hunters should have no shortage of targets. "I
don't think this is going to impact our hunt very much this year,"
Pipkin said. "There are plenty of deer." The state's deer population
has remained at about 1.1 million for the past 10 years, she said.
Bow season for deer has already begun and lasts until 8 Nov 2002 for
the state's central region, including Alamance, Davidson, Guilford,
Randolph, and Rockingham counties. Muzzle-loading season is 9-15 Nov
2002, and gun season runs 16 Nov 2002 - 1 Jan 2003.
There are no human health risks from the disease, according to the
commission. There also is no way to stop it. "There is nothing that
can be done to prevent outbreaks or the spread of the disease,"
Stanford said. "... The disease will run a natural course and
probably subside after the first frost."
The viruses can be transmitted to other animals that also chew a cud,
such as sheep, cattle, goats, and antelope. Sheep can become ill,
although most livestock does not.
Charles Kirkland, a veterinarian and director of the state's
livestock health programs, said his office has not received any
reports of hemorrhagic disease among livestock.

[Both Bluetongue (BT) and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are
vector-borne viral infections that affect deer and other ruminants in
North America. The viruses are closely related members of the
_Orbivirus_ genus. Of the (at least) 24 serotypes of BT virus (BTV)
and 10 serotypes of EHD virus (EHDV), only 4 BTV and 2 EHD types have
been associated with clinical hemorrhagic diseases in natural or
experimental situations. ProMED would appreciated receiving detailed
information on the reported cases in deer, with special reference to
laboratory confirmation and virus identification.
