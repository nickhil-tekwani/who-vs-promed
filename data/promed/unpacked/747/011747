Orange rust attacks 200 hectares [494 acres] of sugarcane fields
----------------------------------------------------------------
The presence of orange rust was confirmed in "some locations" in sugarcane plantations supplying Ingenio Presidente Benito Juarez [sugar refinery]. Specialists from the Colegio de Postgraduados [institution dedicated to sustainable management of natural resources, food, and quality of life] detected the disease early this year [2012] in the Chontalpa area [in the state of Tabasco] and issued a warning to cane growers.

To combat the disease infected canes have been uprooted. This is a radical step, but necessary when orange rust appears. The most significant outbreaks have been found on 200 hectares [494 acres] of cane fields in 2 villages.

The leader of more than 500 000 sugarcane growers in the region said that the remedy is to replant the area with a new variety more resistant to the disease. This means that about 33 000 hectares [81 545 acres] must gradually be replaced by new plants.

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop. Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool autumns, and by rain. The rust spores are rapidly spread by wind, as well as by mechanical means and with contaminated materials. Disease management includes fungicides and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in 2000, a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most widely grown sugarcane cultivar. The disease was reported for the 1st time in the western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457), and it is not clear whether this was a similar scenario with emergence of a new strain of a previously unrecognised endemic pathogen, or whether the pathogen was actually introduced to the US at that time.

Orange rust has been reported since then from additional countries in the Americas. Characterisation and comparison of fungal isolates from the different areas would be needed to clarify whether these reports represent the spread of the same fungal strain from Florida; are due to separate incursions from the same or different sources; or represent separate mutation events detected as a result of increased vigilance in the region.

In 2008 the disease was detected in Mexico's neighbour Guatemala (ProMED-mail post 20080605.1795), followed by its 1st report from Mexico in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100426.1342; states of Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Veracruz). The item above adds another affected state of that country.

The related species _P. melanocephala_ causes brown or common rust. Colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain.
