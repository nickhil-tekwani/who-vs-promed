SOCIAL NETWORK THEORIES RFI
===========================
Subject: Social networks and infectious diseases
I was wondering if anyone knew of any applications of social network
theories in infectious disease research? I am aware of its use in disease
outbreak investigations and its use with HIV transmission among injection
drug users but I'm most interested in the use of social networks in defining
infectious diseases that have firm and long term footholds in communities.
Thanks for any help.
