WHO reports 6 human H5N1 avian influenza cases during past 6 weeks
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) summary and assessment on Friday [26 Apr 2013], from 12 Mar to 26 Apr 2013, there were a total of 6 new laboratory confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The cases were from the following countries: Bangladesh (1), Cambodia (1), Egypt (2), and Viet Nam (2). The UN agency says that after investigation, the 6 cases are considered sporadic.

So far this year [2013], Cambodia has reported 10 cases of the lethal virus in humans, resulting in 8 fatalities. Health authorities say cases do not seem to be linked directly, and most had contact with sick poultry in their villages. Since 2003, there have been 628 laboratory confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection officially reported to WHO from 15 countries, of which 374 died (about 60 per cent).

According to WHO, the H5N1 virus subtype (different from the H7N9 strain circulating in the current China outbreak) is a highly pathogenic AI virus, which first infected humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong SAR, China. Since its widespread re-emergence in 2003 and 2004, this avian virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, resulting in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths.

The case fatality rate for H5N1 virus infections in people is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Clinically, in many patients, the disease caused by the H5N1 virus follows an unusually aggressive clinical course, with rapid deterioration and high fatality. Like most emerging disease, H5N1 influenza in humans is poorly understood.

The incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that for normal seasonal influenza, which is around 2 to 3 days. Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2 to 8 days and possibly as long as 17 days. WHO currently recommends that an incubation period of 7 days be used for field investigations and the monitoring of patient contacts. Initial symptoms include a high fever, usually with a temperature higher than 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], and other influenza-like symptoms. Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some patients.

One feature seen in many patients is the development of lower respiratory tract early in the illness. On present evidence, difficulty in breathing develops around 5 days following the 1st symptoms. Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a crackling sound when inhaling are commonly seen. Sputum production is variable and sometimes bloody.

[All these recent human cases of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection have been recorded in detail in ProMED-mail during the past few weeks. Robert Herriman's review serves to remind us, however, that the H7N9 avian influenza virus is not the only avian influenza virus threatening the human population. These 2 avian viruses interact differently with the human population and their control will necessitate different strategies. - Mod.CP
