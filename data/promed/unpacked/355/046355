The existing livestock movement restrictions within a radius of 8km of
the confirmed infected premises near Brentwood in Essex have been
extended by MAFF by the Declaration of an Infected Area. The movement
restrictions now apply within a radius of 16 km. The 8km movement
restriction areas are still in place around contact premises in Great
Horwood in Bucks, the Isle of Wight and Woodchester Parish near Stroud in
Gloucestershire.
An isolation notice has been served on a contact premises in East
Yorkshire traced via Selby market. MAFF have not imposed movement
restrictions around this farm whilst investigations continue.
A suspect case has been reported in a beef bull at an abattoir in
Guildford. Samples have been taken for diagnosis and 8km movement
restrictions have been imposed around the abattoir. Investigations
continue today at the farm of origin.

Third case confirmed
--------------------
A third case of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has been confirmed in cattle
on a farm in Great Warley, near Brentwood in Essex. There is an infected
area already in place around the farm. MAFF are in the process of
reviewing whether this needs to be amended in the light of this latest
outbreak.
This case is expected to be caused by drift from the infected Cheale
farm next to the abattoir where foot and mouth was first identified.
There have now been 3 confirmed FMD incidents: (1) pigs in lairage at
Cheal's abattoir, (2) a bull (reported to have been in been in lairage),
on the adjacent farm, and now (3) cattle on a farm about one and a half
kilometres away from the abattoir.
An 8km movement restriction area has also been placed around a farm in
Heddon-on-the-Wall in Tyne and Wear. This follows reports of highly
suspicious disease in a number of pigs on the premise. This case is
linked to the first confirmed outbreak in an abattoir in Essex.
Further investigations continue into the source of the outbreak and the
likely spread. A number of premises have also been placed under
restrictions as MAFF investigate movements in and out of the abattoir in
Essex.
Restrictions have today been lifted on the Chitties abattoir in Guildford
following veterinary investigations today.
Farmers are advised to continue to be extremely vigilant and check their
stock regularly for signs of disease. Any disease should be reported to
the farmers vet or local animal health office.
Note:
The first 2 cases of Foot and Mouth Disease were confirmed on 20 Feb 2001
in an abattoir and a nearby farm south of Brentwood in Essex.

In a proactive move, Ireland's Department of Agriculture announced it was
investigating a truck in County Cavan in connection with an outbreak of
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in Britain.
The truck is thought to have crossed into Cavan, near the border with
Northern Ireland, from the north, having earlier made a delivery to the
British abattoir where an outbreak of FMD has been uncovered.
"It is possible the truck may have delivered pigs (to the abattoir) from
Northern Ireland and then come back to the North with another cargo,"
Department of Agriculture spokesman Paul Savage said.
An examination of sheep carcasses, thought to have been brought into
Northern Ireland by the truck, had revealed no traces of FMD, according
to the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture.
A source at the department said officials were aware of all the truck's
movements in Northern Ireland and were satisfied the vehicle had been
disinfected properly at all stages of its journey.
Three farms in Northern Ireland which had made deliveries to the abattoir
were sealed off last night. Officials said initial clinical tests at the
farms had shown no traces of FMD.
"But we have taken samples and they need to be tested," Northern
Ireland's chief veterinary officer Dr. Bob McCracken said.
Savage said people working at ports, veterinary outfits and meat plants
in Ireland had been put on alert for signs of the disease, which is
extremely infectious and affects cattle, pigs sheep and goats.
The Irish Farmers Association (IFA) praised the Department of Agriculture
for its swift response to the British outbreak, and said with vigilance
the disease could be kept off the island.
There have been no reported cases of FMD in Ireland since 1941. Symptoms
of the disease are blisters in the animal's mouth causing salivation, and
on the feet causing lameness.

Britain Bans Meat Exports
-------------------------
The government expanded the exclusion area around a slaughterhouse where
pigs were found infected with Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Thursday, one
day after exports of British meat, milk and livestock were banned.
Britain suspended exports on Wednesday, and the European Union quickly
announced its own ban on British exports to other member countries until
March 1. The United States, Canada, Australia and Singapore also
suspended their imports of affected products.
The highly infectious disease is not regarded as a danger to humans but
could cause serious damage to British farmers, already hurt by last
summer's outbreak of classical swine fever and the long-running mad cow
crisis (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE).
Farmers' leaders met with government officials Thursday to discuss ways
of containing the outbreak, the first in Britain in 20 years.
The disease was discovered Monday in 27 pigs at a slaughterhouse at
Little Warley in Essex county, northeast of London. The exclusion area
around the abattoir was expanded to 10 miles and controls set up around 5
farms, from Yorkshire in the north of England to the Isle of Wight off
the southern coast, that supplied pigs to the slaughterhouse.
Officials were checking on livestock at farms within a 2-mile area of
the exclusion area.
FMD affects cloven-footed animals, including sheep, goats and cows. It is
not usually fatal but can cause weight loss and reduced dairy production
in cattle. It can spread quickly through the air.
The Food Standards Agency said transmission to humans is extremely rare
but possible if a person is in close contact with an infected animal. It
said human beings cannot catch the disease by eating meat or drinking
pasteurized milk. [It presents similar to a mild cold in human beings. -
Mod.TG
The EU said it would review its ban at a 27 Feb 2001 meeting of the Standing
Veterinary Committee.
The carcasses of more than 1000 pigs slaughtered at the affected
slaughterhouse since Monday would be destroyed, director Paul Cheale
said. The government said a further 300 pigs and 60 cattle had been
slaughtered at the abattoir.
Veterinary officials said it could take several weeks to determine the
source of the infection. Tests showed the strain identified in Britain
was similar to 1 that caused outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Mongolia
and Russia, chief veterinary officer Jim Scudamore said.
The last FMD outbreak in Britain occurred in 1981. An outbreak in 1967
led to the slaughter of more than 400 000 animals. A repeat of such a
slaughter would be a devastating to British farming.

Wearside producers have cause for concern
-----------------------------------------
Livestock farmers in the north east are worried tonight as MAFF throws an
8 km cordon round a a cull sow collector-and-feeder in the area. MAFF
have used the words "highly suspicious" in connection with this case.
Although the particular farm does not itself fit the description, it is
nevertheless in a region which has a number of swill feeders and also a
number of allotment-type units
A number of livestock producers, particularly pig producers, are soon to
be showered with Form Ds and this may result in speculation by local
farmers and media. It should be noted Form Ds are a precaution.
Observation would indicate they are not used in cases where any real
suspicion exists.
Currently MAFF are visiting farms which supplied the 27 pigs which became
infected with Foot and Mouth whilst in lairage, and also farms that sent
animals before the outbreak. The likelihood is all but one of these farms
will check out as clean.
Nevertheless the farms will receive a Form D, which specifies certain
safeguards:
 Isolate your susceptible animals
-- Detain them on a specified part of the premises
-- Display a FMD warning at the main entrance to the premises
--Copies of the Form D will be sent to the officer in charge of FMD
center if the premises to which the notice relates are in an Infected
Area; or the Divisional Veterinary Manager if the premises are elsewhere,
the local authority, the police.
You must not:
--Move any animal into or out of the place to which the notice relates
except under the authority of a licence granted by a veterinary
inspector, or permit any animal to stray into or out of the place.
-- Permit any animal in the place to which the notice relates to come
into contact with any animal outside that place.
--After tending any animal in the place to which the notice relates, or
otherwise coming into contact with any such animal, leave that place
without first having thoroughly cleansed and disinfected your hands,
footwear and outer clothing or, in the case of outer clothing, having
left it at such place.
-- Drive or remove any vehicle or machine out of the place to which the
notice relates without first having thoroughly cleansed and disinfected
it.
-- Discharge slurry originating from any animal in the place to which the
notice relates by means of equipment which produces a jet or spray,
except under the authority of a licence granted by an inspector of the
Ministry, and in accordance with such conditions as may be specified.
-- Move or cause or permit to be moved out of the place to which the
notice relates any animal product, carcass, poultry, poultry carcass,
milk, milk product, fodder, litter, dung, slurry utensil, pen, hurdle, or
other thing, except under the authority of a licence granted by an
inspector of the Ministry. "Milk' includes cream, separated milk, skimmed
milk, buttermilk and whey, and "milk produce" includes butter, cheese,
yoghurt and any
other product the main constituent of which is milk.
-- Move or cause or permit to be moved into or out of the place to which
the notice relates any embryo, ovum or semen except under the authority
of a licence granted by a veterinary inspector of the Ministry, and in
accordance with such conditions as may be specified therein.
The occupier of any premises on whom this notice is served shall:
-- Erect and maintain in a conspicuous place at the main entrance to
those-premises a notice consisting of the words 'FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE -
KEEP OUT' in block letter at least 10cm high.
-- Destroy, so far as he is able, any rats on those premises.
-- Maintain a footbath containing a disinfectant approved for use against
FMD in some convenient place at every exit from the premises, and renew
such disinfectant daily or more frequently as necessary to maintain a
clean solution.
Period of notice: Typically 3 weeks.
