Two goats died due to anthrax near Tindivanam [in Villupuram, Tamil Nadu state] on Friday night [20 Dec 2013]. This incident occurred just 2 months after the animal husbandry department vaccinated the livestock at Nolambur village near Tindivanam following reports of several goat deaths at that time. On Friday, 2 more goats from the same village died.

The villagers recognised symptoms of anthrax in the goats and alerted the animal husbandry officials, who inspected the carcass and confirmed that the goats had died of anthrax. As a preventive measure, a medical camp was set up and the team vaccinated about 1200 goats.

As there are chances that the disease can spread to human beings, the local administration officials also visited the place and created awareness among the villagers on the precautionary steps to be taken. An officer from animal husbandry said, "The disease might have spread through the goats, which were not given vaccine in the previous medical camp. It is also possible that the disease could have spread through new goats brought from other places."

[The previous outbreak in this part of Tamil Nadu state started in Villupuram district [see ProMED-mail archive no 20130905.1926240] and the report was then just of bovine cases. This might explain why the goats in the area were not vaccinated. Tamil Nadu regularly has outbreaks of anthrax in their livestock, not infrequently in animals downstream of the tanneries there, with scant attention paid to goats and sheep. For example, in 2007 there were 12 outbreaks with 24 cattle and 1 case involving a sheep or goat; in 2008, 11 outbreaks, 24 cattle, 4 sheep and/or goats; in 2009, 4 outbreaks and just 25 cattle affected; in 2010, 10 outbreaks affecting 32 cattle and 4 separate outbreaks affecting 23 sheep and goats; in 2011, 4 outbreaks and 11 cattle only; and in 2012, 12 outbreaks and 23 cattle. At this time there are no OIE anthrax reports since June 2013; in January 2013 there were 3 bovine outbreaks in Tamil Nadu affecting 7 animals, and a single February outbreak in sheep and/or goats affecting 3 animals.

As livestock herds and flocks can be mixed while grazing the risk to the smaller ruminants should not be ignored, especially as any cases therein will just add to the soil contamination, facilitating the probability of future outbreaks. And browsing goats will find bush leaves which have been contaminated by vomiting blow flies after they had fed on a contaminated carcass.
