I am writing regarding article #20170704.5150904 which was published on 2017-07-04.

In the moderator comments, it was presumed that in Canada there are Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) testing requirements for horses that are moved across provincial borders. In fact, there are no interprovincial testing requirements in place at this time. The CFIA is unable to impose testing requirements for domestic movements in the absence of declaring a primary control zone for EIA. This was a concept that was put forth by the CFIA in a 2015 discussion paper, as well as in a 2016 working group report. These documents were shared with the national equine industry organizations, the national veterinary association and the provinces.

Currently, imposing and enforcing testing requirements for horses within Canada are industry responsibilities (e.g. event organizers and/or premises owners). When a positive EIA case is identified, the CFIA responds with disease intervention strategies to help control the spread of the EIA virus.

[I am very appreciative of Carolyn's correction. Very important. But it does indicate a weakness in the Canadian control system, that there are no interprovincial testing requirements when transporting horses. It is left up to the horse owners and event organizers, and the CFIA responds retrospectively. It goes a fair way to explaining the frequency of this disease in the Canadian prairies. Or put another way it is like depending on abstinence instead of contraception. - Mod.MHJ
