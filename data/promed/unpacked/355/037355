Experts warn that gonorrhoea is on the rise, and Britain is to blame for more than half of all cases across Europe. The number of people with the sexually transmitted infection went up by 17 percent across Europe in 2017, with 240 new cases diagnosed every day.

More than half [55%] of all cases of gonorrhoea in 2017 were in [the UK], [10% in France, 9% in Spain, 8% in the Netherlands, 9% in Sweden/Belgium/Ireland, and 9% in 20 other EU countries.]

It follows a decline in cases in the previous year [2016], according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [1].

There were 49 156 cases of gonorrhoea confirmed in the UK in 2017, making up 55 per cent of the European total of 89 239. It's also 5 times as many as 2nd-placed France with 9177 recorded diagnoses of gonorrhoea, despite having the same population as the UK. Gonorrhoea -- also known as "the clap" -- is the 2nd most common STI in the UK after chlamydia.

Gianfranco Spiteri, of the ECDC, said: "One thing the constantly high rate of reported gonorrhoea cases in Europe tells us is that people keep having sex with new and casual partners without condoms, which makes it easy to pass on an infection that is increasingly resistant to the common antibiotic treatment options."

Figures show that there were 558 155 confirmed cases of the STI across Europe between 2008 and 2017.

The increase follows an overall trend over the last decade in which 20 of the 28 EU countries consistently reported an increase in gonorrhoea cases. Since 2008, France and Portugal experienced a 6-fold increase, while Denmark and Ireland now record more than 3 times as many confirmed cases. Some countries noted striking year-on-year increases of more than 40 percent, like Finland and Sweden.

More than 44 500 Brits were diagnosed with the infection in 2017, while 78 million are infected globally every year, according to the World Health Organisation. "Many infections are not diagnosed due to lack of symptoms or limited access to diagnostics or simply are not reported," [said] Gianfranco Spiteri, European Centre For Disease Prevention and Control expert. Experts found men who have sex with men accounted for almost half of the gonorrhoea cases in 2017.

They added that the rise in cases among women is "concerning" as untreated gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or cause infertility. Spiteri added: "We have to bear in mind that the numbers we see do not even show the true extent of the gonorrhoea epidemic in Europe. Many infections are not diagnosed due to lack of symptoms or limited access to diagnostics or simply are not reported. If you are at risk, make sure to get tested regularly."

Gonorrhoea is on the rise, as 240 new cases are diagnosed every day. Gonorrhoea is a bacterial infection which spreads through all forms of unprotected sex, as well as by sharing unwashed or unprotected sex toys. According to the NHS, the bacteria which cause gonorrhoea can sometimes infect your throat and eyes, as well as the more common locations of the cervix, urethra and rectum. Pregnant women can pass the infection on to their baby, which can cause blindness if it isn't treated in time. The signs of a gonorrhoea infection can vary between men and women. In women, symptoms can often include unusually watery or off-colour vaginal discharge, as well as burning pain when urinating. Less common symptoms in women include pain in the lower gut and bleeding between periods or after sex.

"Key facts
-----------
- A total of 89 239 cases of gonorrhoea were reported by 27 EU/EEA Member States for 2017.
- The overall crude notification rate was 22.2 cases per 100 000 population.
- Rates of reported gonorrhoea infection vary considerably across Europe, with higher rates reported in northern Europe.
- Men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for almost half of the reported cases (47%) in 2017.
- The overall notification rate increased in 2017 following the slight reduction seen in 2016."

Discussion
--------------
"With 89 239 cases reported in 2017, gonorrhoea is the 2nd most notified sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the EU/EEA after chlamydia. The overall gonorrhoea notification rate once again increased in 2017, following the slight decrease in 2016. Increasing notification rates were reported by the majority of countries with some striking year on year increases, for example, in Finland and Sweden, where the number of cases increased by more than 40%.

"The high rate of reported gonorrhoea infections across the EU/EEA indicates continuing high levels of risk behaviour. This is especially of concern considering the high levels of resistance to azithromycin reported by the latest data from the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP). The data show that the currently recommended dual treatment regimen for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) is threatened [5]. Euro-GASP data also show that resistance to cefixime and ciprofloxacin remained stable over the past years [6]. In addition, no isolates with resistance to ceftriaxone were detected in 2017. The last ceftriaxone- resistant isolate was detected in 2015.

"The increasing trend in the number of reported gonorrhoea cases in many countries continues to be mostly driven by increasing cases in MSM, but increases among heterosexual women were also marked from 2016-2017. Increases among women are worrying due to the risk of reproductive tract complications from gonorrhoea. The increase in reported cases in MSM could be related to increased risk behaviour, possibly in some cases also linked to changing sexual behaviour with use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [7,8], increased testing among MSM (particularly at extra-genital sites, a practice recommended by recent guidance) [9] and the more widespread use of nucleic acid amplification tests [10,11].

"The distribution of reported gonorrhoea cases continues to vary considerably across the EU/EEA, with rates ranging from below 1 to 75 cases per 100 000 population. The United Kingdom reported over half of the total number of EU/EEA cases in 2017. High rates (above 15 per 100 000 population) were reported in Denmark, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Spain and Sweden. This geographical pattern has been stable in recent years. The variation in rates could be linked to real differences in incidence of infection. However, there are important differences across Europe in terms of testing policies and methods, healthcare systems and access to services, the role of private healthcare providers, inclusion of data in reporting systems, and surveillance system structures.

"The majority of countries that report gonorrhoea cases indicate that most of their data on STIs are obtained from dedicated specialist services (STI clinics). It is, therefore, likely that in many countries, a proportion of cases -- for example, those diagnosed in primary healthcare -- are not captured by surveillance systems. In addition, a few countries obtain data through sentinel surveillance, which again only captures a proportion of diagnoses within the country and may target specific specialist services. Many cases are also either undiagnosed or unreported for various reasons, such as differences in the availability of diagnostics, so that the reported figures do not represent the true extent of the epidemic. Some of the increases reported over time could also be related to improvements in the coverage of surveillance systems and use of more sensitive tests. Given the above limitations, comparisons between countries should be made with caution.

Public health implications
----------------------
"Rates of reported gonorrhoea infections continue to increase in the majority of EU/EEA countries. There is an urgent need to further strengthen prevention activities aimed at increased testing uptake and testing frequency in those most at risk. This could be achieved by targeting specific risk groups with evidence-based messages and methods. Social media and dating apps should be considered for prevention campaigns in addition to traditional approaches." - Mod.ML
