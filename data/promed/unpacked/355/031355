Emergency report:
Synthesis of 2 faxes received on 20 and 22 Jan 2001 from Dr. Robert S.
Thwala, Director, Department of Veterinary and Livestock Services, Ministry
of Agriculture and Co-operatives, Mbabane.
Report date: 20 Jan 2001.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory
Date of clinical diagnosis: 10 Jan 2001.
Date of laboratory confirmation: 17 Jan 2001.
Outbreaks:
No. of outbreaks: 1
Location: Zinyane dip tank area, northern Hhohho region (24ยบ 52' S - 31ยบ 42' E)
Unlike the Macakula outbreak (see Disease Information, 13 [51, 244, dated
29 Dec 2000 and follow-up reports), the Zinyane outbreak is in the
traditionally foot and mouth disease (FMD) free area of Swaziland, although
both outbreaks are limited to the areas along the border with South Africa.
Total number of animals at risk:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 1597 / ... / ... / 191 / ...
cap / 271 / ... / ... / ... / ...
sui / 26 / ... / ... / ... / ...
Some of the grazing areas of Zinyane and surrounding dip tanks are well
fenced off and contact between grazing areas is highly minimised.
Background:
Following the confirmation of an outbreak of FMD on 22 Dec 2000 at
Macakula, 6 teams led by animal health inspectors and veterinarians were
established to intensify surveillance along Swaziland's borders west of
Komati River to Matsamo Border Gate in northern Hhohho region, with some
teams starting from Komati River and moving northwest, and the others
starting from the main road to Matsamo Border Gate and moving southeast.
During this period, starting from 26 Dec 2000, meetings were held with the
communities along the border, advising them on the necessary precautionary
measures, namely to graze their animals away from the border fences, to
stop all illegal cattle crossings to graze in either country, and to
isolate and report any suspected cases of FMD. Visual inspections were
carried out weekly with mouthing of suspect animals at all the dip tanks to
the north of Komati River and the Nyakatfo all-weather road to the junction
with the Madlangempisi/Herefords road and turning right to Matsamo Border
Gate at its junction with Matsamo/Piggs Peak road.
Diagnosis:
On 10 Jan 2001, during a stakeholders' meeting called by the Department of
Veterinary and Livestock Services and the Constituency Member of
Parliament, some suspect animals seen grazing with cattle from a
neighboring country were reported. A team dispatched to investigate
reported, that evening, 3 clinical cases in a homestead of 10 animals which
were found grazing with cattle that had illegally crossed into Swaziland.
The affected animals had lesions on the tongue, gums, and feet. These
observations were confirmed by another team on 11 January. Tissue and blood
samples were taken and all 3 animals along with those in contact - i.e., a
total of 15 animals were slaughtered and their carcasses incinerated and
buried.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute
(South Africa).
B. Diagnostic tests used: blocking ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay), typing ELISA, virus isolation (phosphokinase C) and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).
C. Causal agent: FMD virus type SAT 1. All serum samples were negative for
antibodies against SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 at less than 1.5. One tissue
sample was positive for SAT 1 on virus isolation, PCR and typing ELISA.
Policy adopted:
A stamping-out policy has been adopted, with the understanding of the
communities and their traditional and political leadership of the
implications to trade of any alternative approaches in the containment and
eradication of the disease. As in the Macakula outbreak, the Government has
assured the farmers of compensatory consideration. Activities during the
period: activities to control and eradicate the disease were based on
clinical diagnosis without waiting for laboratory confirmation.
1. Stamping-out: a total of 191 cattle at the Mhlangatane grazing area
within the cordoned off outbreak area of Zinyane were slaughtered and their
carcasses incinerated and buried, including contact animals in the affected
homesteads. Tissue and serum samples were taken before destruction of the
animals.
2. Quarantine and surveillance zones were imposed immediately:
Quarantine zone: an area 10-15 km inland from the outbreak area was placed
under quarantine. There are a total of 22 106 cattle in the quarantine
zone. This zone is delimited by the border with South Africa (36 km long)
in the northeast, the Matsamo Border Gate road and the gonini/Herefords
road in the west and northwest, and the Nyakatfo road and Komati River in
the south. For the purposes of effective control and monitoring, the use of
natural barriers and all-weather roads has been exploited.
A fence 15 km long and 5 km in from the national border and delimiting the
outbreak area within the quarantine zone is being erected to limit the
spread of the disease to other grazing areas and dip tanks further into the
interior of the country. Stock have been separated further by grazing areas.
Inspection teams are moving from homestead to homestead, mouthing and
destroying all animals that have been in contact with affected herds.
In the next week serological sampling teams will join the inspection teams
and start operating throughout the quarantine zone to clinically and
serologically determine the FMD status of the herds in the different
grazing areas and dip tanks outside the outbreak area.
Animals and animal product movements between grazing areas and dip tank
areas and into and out of the quarantine zone are prohibited and
enforceable with the assistance and cooperation of the community members
who have teamed up with our enforcement officials and members of the
security forces.
The surveillance zone extends in the area south of Komati River along the
Mananga/ Madlangempisi road to Jacks and down to Mgobodzi along the
Matsamo/Ntfonjeni main road. Active surveillance with restricted stock
movements will be applied in all 21 dip tanks in this area, which extends
for some 20-30 km from the outbreak area.
Control points manned by veterinary and security personnel have been
established at roadblocks along the boundaries of the quarantine and
surveillance zones for both searching and disinfecting of people and
vehicles passing through.
Trade implications:
1. This outbreak area is in the traditionally FMD-free area of Swaziland
that is part of the trade agreements with the European Union (EU). It
essentially spells temporary loss of trade for Swaziland with the EU,
unless it is controlled speedily. The use of vaccination would even prolong
the resumption of trade, with serious consequences for the farmers in this
area.
2. Trade in the areas outside the FMD restricted or controlled areas should
continue normally without interruption.
