Abstract
MERS-CoV is present in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. Dromedary camels are the primary zoonotic reservoir for human infections. Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of naive animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission.

[In the discussion chapter, the authors indicate that after vaccination, low neutralizing antibody titers were detected in the upper respiratory tract. Vaccine platforms aimed specifically at inducing high levels of mucosal immunity or those that induce humoral as well as cellular immunity may be required for complete protection. The response to vaccination in dromedary camels varies widely, as was demonstrated in the study by the fact that one out of the 3 camels in the vaccination group did not respond to vaccination at all. The trial involved alpacas and dromedaries born in the US; intranasal challenge with MERS-CoV yielded distinctly different outcomes in the alpaca compared to dromedary camels. Though alpacas are easier to get, future vaccination trials deserve to be performed on dromedary camels.

Although the origins and transmission of MERS are poorly understood, since the emergence of the disease in 2012, the dromedary camel has remained as the one documented source of human zoonotic infection. There is considerable circumstantial evidence supporting camel-to-human transmission, including evidence of camels and humans becoming infected with an identical MERS-CoV. Among the 1125 MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO between 1 Jan 2015 and 13 Apr 2018, 30.9 per cent were primary cases (the 1st known human case in a potential or putative chain of transmission). Among primary cases, 191 (54.9 per cent) reported direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, 164 (47.1 per cent) reported direct, physical contact with dromedaries, and 155 (44.5 per cent) reported contact with products derived from dromedaries, namely unpasteurized camel milk.

One of the measures to interrupt zoonotic transmission of MERS could be vaccination of dromedaries and/or humans. Vaccination of dromedaries should target mainly the offspring, regarded to be the main source of virus dissemination. The above report addresses one of several vaccination trials performed in recent years.

A recent review paper by Chinese researchers (ref 1) included vaccination (in humans and animals) among its topics. It was indicated that among all the functional/non-functional structural proteins of MERS-CoV (similar to SARS-CoV), the S protein is the principal antigenic component that induces antibodies to block virus-binding, stimulate host immune responses, fuse or neutralize antibodies and/or protect the immune system against virus infection. Therefore, the S protein has been selected as a significant target for the development of vaccines.

The authors review 5 MERS-CoV vaccine strategies, their development and advantages/disadvantages.
1. Inactivated virus vaccines
2. Live-attenuated virus vaccines
3. Viral vector vaccines
4. Subunit vaccines
5. DNA vaccines.

For each strategy, the process of production, references, advantages and disadvantages are presented (see table 3 in ref 1).

There are still no commercial vaccines available against MERS-CoV. To vaccinate camels, animals in which MERS-CoV infection is manifested by a mild or subclinical disease, the MERS vaccine -- when becoming certified and available -- should preferably be combined with vaccine(s) protecting against significant camel disease (for example, camel pox) in order to safeguard the cooperation of the camel owners.
