Highlights
- After the 2nd day of a 12 day vaccination campaign, 13 per cent of the targeted population in Geneina, Kerinik, Habila and Beidha in West Darfur localities were vaccinated against yellow fever.

- As of 21 Nov [2012], the total number of reported cases has reached 537, including 127 deaths (case fatality rate of 23.6 per cent). The outbreak has now affected 30 localities in Central, South, West, North, and East Darfur.

- The US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) based in Cairo, Egypt, has deployed a team to Sudan to support laboratory analysis of collected samples as well as conduct on-job training sessions at the National Public Health Laboratory starting on Sat 24 Nov 2012.

Epidemiology
- As of 21 Nov [2012], a total of 537 suspected cases, including 127 deaths (CFR 23.6 per cent), have been reported from the localities of Zalengei, Nertity, Wadisalih, Azoom, Mukjer, Bendisi, Rokoro, Um Dukhun, Nyala, Kass, Kubum, Sharq Agabal, Mershing, Rehaid Albirdy, Ed Alfirsan, Shatayia, Yassin, Elddaen, Assalaya, Genaina, Kernik, Baidha, Habila, Forbranga, Jabal Moun, Sirba, Saraf Omra, El Fashir and Alseraif. Reports of cases were received from 2 Sep 2012.

- 30 localities, out of 57, in Darfur are now affected by the yellow fever outbreak.

- About 62.7 per cent of the reported cases are from Central Darfur, 8.5 per cent are from South Darfur, 19.3 per cent are from West Darfur and 8.8 per cent are from North Darfur.

- 1.5 per cent of the reported cases are in the age group 0-1.9, 2 per cent are in the age group 2-4.9, 22.8 per cent are in the age group 5-14.9, 48.1 per cent are in the age 15-29.9 and 16.3 per cent are 30-44.9 years and 6.3 per cent are in the age group of 45 years and above.

Actions taken

- After the 1st day of a 12 day vaccination campaign, 13 per cent of the target population in Geneina, Kerinik, Habila and Beidha in West Darfur localities were vaccinated against yellow fever.

- In Zalengei, vaccination campaign started on 22 Nov [2012] while in North Darfur the campaign will start on 24 Nov 2012 in North Darfur.

- The US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) based in Cairo, Egypt, has deployed a team to Sudan to support laboratory analysis of collected samples as well as conduct on-job training sessions at the National Public Health Laboratory starting on Sat 24 Nov 2012.

- Technical support teams from FMoH remain on ground in Central, South and West Darfur to continually conduct active search for new cases, as well as entomological surveys in affected areas. Blood banks in affected areas and localities where most cases are referred to have been prepositioned with required blood units and laboratory supplies necessary for blood transfusion.

Recommendations
- As active search for cases is on-going, collection of more blood samples for laboratory testing of patients from newly affected localities should be strengthened.

- Parallel containment activities/measures should be sustained at least for 10 days, after the vaccination campaign starts.

[The end of this report states, "Parallel containment activities/measures should be sustained at least for 10 days, after the vaccination campaign starts." This is highly questionable. At the rate they are going they are not going to achieve 80 per cent coverage in 10 days, and it should go on for 2-3 weeks after it ends to allow for extrinsic incubation in the vector mosquito and the incubation period in humans. - Mod.JW

According to the report above, the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Darfur was 1st notified on 2 Sep 2012 -- nearly 3 months ago. Unfortunately, there was no vaccination campaign implemented at that time, resulting in the subsequent spread throughout Darfur, illustrating the need for prompt response early on, as was done in Paraguay in 2008. The above report indicates that there is an entomologist (or more?) on the field team. It would be of interest to know what the status of the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_ is in various locations in Darfur. One hopes that the Sudan and international health teams will remain in place until after the last cases is reported.
