From: Paul Levett <levett@sunbeach.net>

There have been a number of cases confirmed, some here in Barbados by IgM
ELISA, some at CAREC (Trinidad) by culture and/or serology. As of last
week the number was less than 50 for the year. This is in comparison to
the outbreak in 1995, when approximately 1000 laboratory-confirmed cases
were detected and many more suspected.
Dengue is an endemic disease once again throughout the Caribbean and the
number of cases we are detecting does not constitute an "outbreak". All
islands in the Caribbean are reporting dengue activity, I understand from
CAREC.
[Thanks to Paul Levett for this up-date. Apparently, there is nothing
unusual happening in Barbados with respect to dengue. However, it is
alarming to me that the situation throughout the Caribbean might be being
viewed as "usual". Indeed it might be "usual" but why should the
occurrence of any disease be accepted as usual? During the Vietnam War
President Johnson said "We could have guns and butter" and promptly cut the
funding for the _Aedes aegypti_ eradication program. Now we have a
situation in which dengue is accepted as usual throughout the Western
Hemisphere. What happened to the plans to eradicate dengue from the
hemisphere by the year 2000? Only <27 months to go.
Chapters and books are being written, seminars given, symposia held, grants
funded. Still we have dengue, which is a preventable disease if we can
summon the political and intellectual will to knock out the vector(s). An
exceedingly difficult task of course, but that's what salaries are for.
