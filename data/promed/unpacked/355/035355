On [Mon 17 Jun 2019], the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that 2 Texas horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). A Quarter Horse from Kaufman County tested positive on 9 May [2019], and a Quarter Horse from Webb County tested positive on 3 Jun [2019], the EDCC said.

In both cases, Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials have placed each horse's home facility under quarantine.

"The premises (will) remain under quarantine until requirements for release have been met," the EDCC said. "TAHC staff is working closely with owners and veterinarians to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures."

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 21 Jun 2019 a 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding from Stanton County, Kansas, had tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

"The Kansas Animal Health Commissioner was notified on 12 Jun [2019] that a horse in southwest Kansas had tested positive for equine infectious anemia," the EDCC said. "This horse was retested by state animal health officials and confirmed positive by (the) National Veterinary Services Laboratory on 19 Jun 2019. The positive horse will be euthanized."

The EDCC said there were 2 other horses on the index premises. Both horses have tested negative thus far but will remain quarantined for 60 days before they're tested again.

"This appear to be an isolated case with no outside exposure," the EDCC said.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease attacking horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit

- Progressive condition loss;
- Muscle weakness;
- Poor stamina;
- Fever;
- Depression; and
- Anemia.

There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yd [183 m] away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

[The US Department of Agriculture in 2006 published data recommendations/regulations regarding EIA in 2006. The figures in this particular document use data from 2005, or 14 years ago. In the 2006 document, the USDA stated that approximately 0.01% of the horses had EIA (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/eia and https://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/eia/eia_info_sheet.pdf).

In 2006, it was determined there were approximately 9.5 million horses in the USA
(http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/us-has-95-million-horses-most-world-report-says). If we assume both figures are correct, it means that approximately 950 horses were euthanized from EIA in 2006.

While 14 years ago 950 horses may not warrant a vaccine, the value of those horses (or more, considering the increasing price of horses) as well as the measure of heartache from losing a horse may now warrant a vaccine. Those numbers may be higher today, as I could not find a document with more recent horse-population figures or percentage of EIA-positive horses. Also, I do not know if the 95 million included the feral horses, most on federal lands, or how many feral horses are documented EIA positive.

The clinical findings and course of EIA are variable, depending on the virulence of the virus strain, viral dose, and susceptibility of the horse. After an incubation period of 15-45 days or longer in naturally acquired cases of infection, classic cases of the disease progress through 3 clinical phases. An initial or acute episode lasting 1-3 days is characterized by fever, depression, and thrombocytopenia. Because these signs can be mild and transitory, they are often overlooked. Typically, this initial phase is followed by a prolonged period associated with recurring episodes of fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia, petechiation on mucous membranes, dependent edema, muscle weakness, and loss of condition. The interval between episodes can range from days to weeks or months. In most cases, the episodes of clinical disease subside within a year, and infected horses enter the asymptomatic stage to become inapparent carriers and reservoirs of EIA virus. Many of these horses remain clinically normal.

Although the foregoing represents the most commonly described clinical course of the disease, some outbreaks of EIA can be associated with peracute infection in which the primary viral infection is uncontrolled; this can result in a very high fever, severely reduced platelet counts, and acute depression, leading to death. In view of the wide variation in response seen in natural cases of infection, it is not possible to confirm a diagnosis of EIA based solely on clinical grounds (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/equine-infectious-anemia/overview-of-equine-infectious-anemia).

While there are documents regarding the clinical signs, and some horses are euthanized based on their possible inability to recover, their perceived impending or soon-to-be impending death, or an owner's inability to care for the animal, published documents regarding natural deaths from EIA seemed unavailable or are lacking in the literature.

Consequently, I am wondering how many horses die naturally, or if we are trying to decrease the reservoir of virus so tabanid flies cannot carry the disease to another animal. Therefore, we euthanize positive horses, but what do we really know about the genetics of the tabanids and other biting flies capable of transmitting the virus? Can they genetically transmit the virus to the next generation of flies? I did not find documentation addressing such a question.

It is always advisable to use horse-approved sprays for prevention of mosquitoes and flies, and especially to prevent tabanid flies, although I have seen those be pretty aggressive. - Mod.TG
