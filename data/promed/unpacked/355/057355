3 species of wild birds have been found infected with avian influenza
H5N1 in the Danube delta, Tulcea county, Romania since early October.
This included 1 heron, 2 wild geese and a large number (reportedly,
about 140) swans. The current notification adds 7 swans and a 4th
species -- "water hen" (Common moorhen, _Gallinula chloropus_?
1st-hand identification will be appreciated).
Unfortunately, the taxonomical identity of the infected wild birds
from Romania is not yet available. A call for wild-bird
identification, signed by researchers in the Department of Virology,
Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, has been posted on 31 Oct 2005
(20051031.3181).
The final identity of the virus' neuraminidase is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
