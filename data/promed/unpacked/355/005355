Rabid bats terrify the residents of multi-storey buildings
---------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic situation in the Donetsk Oblast is near to catastrophic
because there have been 85 outbreaks of rabies in 29 regions; i.e.,
80 percent of its territory is enzootic for rabies in bats. The
latest incident happened in Konstantinovka, where bats bit 2 children
during daylight hours. This was the 3rd incident this season. City
residents are greatly alarmed; bats are roosting in the roofs of
several multi-storey buildings. Experts advise blocking all apertures
which may allow bats access to the roofspace of buildings. Bats carry
[a] highly pathogenic strain of rabies virus and the carrier state is
prolonged. Regional health protection agencies are conducting
preventive campaigns.

[It will be relevant to characterise the strain of rabies virus
prevalent in bats in the Ukraine. The different rabies-like viruses
and the different bat species found in Europe distinguish this region
from the Americas, where all bat-associated rabies cases in North
America have been caused by transmission of genotype 1 rabies virus;
i.e., classical rabies virus, and not by rabies-like viruses similar
to European bat lyssavirus types 1 & 2 (EBLV 1 and EBLV 2), which do
not seem to transmit readily to other species, and human and
terrestrial animal infections are rare.

Kuzmin et al. (Dev Biol (Basel). 2006;125:273-82) have published a
survey of bat rabies in countries of the former Soviet Union. More
than 3000 bats have been examined for lyssaviruses in the territory
of the former Soviet Union over the past 41 years (1964-2004). EBLV-1
was recorded in the Ukraine and the European part of Russia.

The novel lyssaviruses Aravan (ARAV, Kyrgyzstan, 1991), Khujand
(KHUV, Tajikistan, 2001), Irkut (IRKV, Irkutsk region, 2002) and West
Caucasian Bat virus (WCBV, Krasnodar region, 2002) have been proposed
as new lyssavirus genotypes.

All reports on rabies virus (RABV; serotype/genotype 1 classical
rabies virus) isolation from bats [in the Old World] to date are
questionable and must be corroborated.

2 human rabies cases of bat origin were registered in the town of
Voroshilovgrad, Ukraine (1977) and the town of Belgorod, Russia
(1985). The 2nd case was confirmed as EBLV-1, whereas the 1st case
was not typed.

Thus at least 5 lyssaviruses, different from RABV [classical rabies
virus] and from each other, have been recognized in the territory of
the former Soviet Union, and their potential significance for
veterinary and public health has still to be evaluated.
