Fears of a dengue outbreak are growing following the appearance of a
number of cases in the capital, Dhaka.
During the last couple of days [8, 9 Jul 2007], 8 people with dengue
symptoms have been admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Holy
Family Red Crescent Hospital, Ibn Sina Hospital, and Central
Hospital. However, 6 out of the 8 dengue-infected patients were
released from the hospitals.
The patients reside in the areas of PWD colony, Malibagh,
Mohammadpur, Tikatuli, Basabo, and Keraniganj.
According to Nasimus Siraj, chief entomologist of Dhaka City
Corporation (DCC), fumigation drives are on in the city to combat the
situation and the DCC is monitoring the situation.
DCC also intends to launch a mass awareness campaign to clean up all
areas in the city and destroy breeding places of dengue-bearing
mosquitoes. Volunteers and Boy Scouts have been requested to help the
DCC with the campaign, he added.
[Over the past] 6 years, Bangladesh has raised concerns over the
outbreak of dengue fever, which has killed 130 people. In 2006, 1423
people in Dhaka were infected with the disease and 4 of them died.
Warmer weather and heavy rains help the mosquito-borne virus spread
through the region. There is no treatment for dengue, which can cause
high fever, rash, headache, and severe muscle and joint pains. A more
severe form can cause [sometimes fatal] hemorrhagic fever.
_Aedes_, the dengue-carrying mosquito, breeds in stagnant water in
houses, construction sites, schools, and factories.

Authorities in Singapore say the number of people infected with
dengue in the island state in a single week has risen to the year's
[2007] highest level.
The National Environment Agency says more than 430 cases were
reported, well above the official epidemic level.

The outbreak of dengue fever has claimed 57 lives in Malaysia, media
reported Thursday [12 Jul 2007].
The health ministry has spent over 10 million ringgit (nearly USD 3
million) since 2004 on dengue fever prevention and control measures,
The Star newspaper said. Most of the money was spent on chemicals
including pesticides and larvicides, fogging machines, personal
protection apparatus, educational tools, and conducting training
programmes, said Auk Lee Kah Choon, parliamentary secretary of the
health ministry. "The ministry is aware of the increase in dengue
fever as a result of floods," he said.
However, Lee said the increase in dengue cases in the capital occurred
even before the 10 Jun [2007] flash floods. "The dengue fever
situation is still under control and the ministry will continue to
take steps to weed out the problem," he said.

Dengue fever has killed 182 Cambodians so far this year [2007], and
the crisis will continue to worsen unless concerted community action
is taken, the government and World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Saturday [14 Jul 2007].
"This year [2007] is particularly severe and, if present trends
continue, it will be the most serious to date," the WHO and the
Health Ministry said in a joint statement.
"Community-based larval control and elimination of mosquito breeding
sites are currently the only sustainable methods of outbreak
prevention and the only effective method of reducing the risk of
infection," the statement said.
Health officials had been working hard in anti-mosquito breeding
campaigns in high-risk areas since the outbreak, but the results were
not very satisfactory, Ngan Chantha, head of the country's anti-dengue
program, told Reuters. "It's hard to change our people's behavior.
Health workers can't do all the work, and villagers have to help
themselves, too," he said, telling Cambodians to clean containers
every 10 days to stem mosquito breeding.
The virus was expected to reach its peak during the late
August-September [2007] heavy rainy season, Ngan Chantha said.
Dengue has killed 182 out of 14 986 infected so far this year [2007],
compared with 116 deaths from 12 300 infected in the whole of 2006,
Ngan Chantha said.

<http://www.gmanews.tv/story/50507/Dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-Metro-Manila>

With the rainy season now here, the incidence of dengue has started
to rise, with hospitals in Metro Manila recording a marked rise in
cases.
Radio dzBB reported that the Rizal Medical Center in eastern Metro
Manila recorded 19 cases from 1-8 Jul [2007], most of the victims
being children. It said the patients include 4 who tested positive
for dengue, and a 10-year-old child with stage-2 hemorrhagic fever.
Most of the patients were from Pasig City, doctors said. Other
patients admitted at the Rizal Medical Center included residents from
Taguig, Pateros, Makati City, and Antipolo City.
Another hospital, the Amang Rodriguez Medical Center in Marikina
City, recorded at least 6 cases so far this month [July 2007].
Health authorities have warned residents to take precautions against
dengue, which they said is no longer a rainy-season disease but an
"all-year-round" disease.
They urged residents to keep their surroundings clean and to prevent
mosquitoes that carry the disease from breeding.

The dreaded dengue disease claimed its 1st Aklan victim on the 1st
week of July [2007] here, and cases in the province continue to rise,
bringing to a total of 78 from January [2007] to the 1st 7 days of
July of this year [2007].
Dr. Maria Magpusao, Chief of the Technical Services Division [in
Kalibo City] of the Provincial Health Office, revealed that during
the 1-7 Jul [2007] period alone, 23 cases were already reported,
while many are still coming in after the period. In June [2007], 23
cases were also reported, but the figure applies for the whole month
and not just for a week.
Dr. Magpusao said the cases may still peak in August [2007] because
it had been observed yearly that there are more cases during this
period.

Dengue deaths climbed to 4 in Negros Occidental after the demise of a
4-year-old patient in a hospital in Sagay City Tuesday [10 Jul 2007].
But health authorities feared that the figure might be higher if
reported deaths outside of hospitals are considered.
Dr. Luisa Efren, provincial health officer said, based on Ledesma's
(Ma. Estrella Ledesma, chief of hospital of the Teresita Jalandoni
Provincial Hospital in Silay City) report [that] the 4-year-old
patient was brought to the said hospital from Sagay City, 83
kilometers (51.6 mi) north of [Sagay City].
"This brings to 4 deaths recorded so far since January this year
[2007] as dengue fever cases continue to increase in the province,"
she said. Efren said the figure could be higher than 4 if some dengue
deaths that reportedly occurred in homes were verified and recorded.
The 3 deaths previously reported were all in a barangay [district] in
Hinobaan town, 200 kilometers (124.3 mi) south of Bacolod.
Efren said Ledesma told her that from 1-7 Jul [2007] alone, there
were already 26 dengue cases at the provincial hospital. "Most of
these cases came from Victorias City," she said.
Hinobaan is one of the areas being closely monitored by the
Department of Health (DOH) central office in Manila because of an
increasing number of dengue cases.

The American Samoa Department of Health says dengue fever "appears to
be escalating" in the territory, with 22 more cases identified 2
weeks ago [30 Jun 2007].
Health officials are urging island residents to take preventive
measures and the department has also launched a media campaign to
halt the increase of dengue fever cases.
Since January this year [2007], 51 laboratory-confirmed cases of
dengue fever have been reported, the Health Department said. Of
these, 22 cases have been identified during the last 2 weeks, the
department announced in a press release.

1. Background
Dengue fever is endemic in more than 100 countries; 2/5 of the
world's population (2.5 billion people) is exposed. During epidemic
phases, the attack rate is frequently about 40-50 percent, but it can
be as high as 90 percent. Each year, approximately 500 000 cases are
hospitalized, among which there is a large proportion of non-immune
young children. The dengue virus is a flavivirus of which there are 4
serologically distinct types. The infection by a given [virus]
serotype confers prolonged immunity to that serotype, but does not
ensure cross immunity to the other 3 serotypes. Furthermore,
successive infections with different [virus] serotypes expose the
patient to an increased risk of developing a severe form of the
disease, in particular the hemorrhagic form.
2. Dengue in the Pacific region
Different dengue [virus] serotypes have been responsible for
epidemics in Oceania. Nevertheless, contrary to other zones of
transmission where simultaneous circulation of several serotypes of
the virus is frequent, in Oceania (except in Australia), in general,
there is one predominant circulating serotype. This particular
dynamics is explained, at least in part, by the geographical
distribution of the Pacific Islands.
3. Current situation in the Pacific
- The last major epidemic (DEN-1) began in 2000 in Palau (Micronesia)
and then gradually spread in Polynesia and Melanesia.
- Since 2000, DEN-1 is the prevalent [virus] serotype in the South Pacific.
3.1 Cook Islands (population: 20 000)
- The last major epidemic (DEN-1) occurred in 2002, with close to
2500 cases. Its unusual magnitude can be explained, at least partly,
by the absence of circulation of this [virus] serotype in the
archipelago since the end of the 70s (the preceding epidemic in 1997
was due to DEN-2).
3.1.2 Current situation
- July 2006: 3 confirmed cases: 2 of [virus] serotype DEN-2 and one
of serotype DEN-1
- Since then, both [virus] serotypes are in circulation.
- October 2006-15 May 2007: 1383 cases (including 139
hospitalizations): 1285 from the main island of Rarotonga and 98 from
the other islands.
-The epidemic occurred within the context of higher rainfall than
normal for that period.
3.2 Palau (population (19 000)
- Between 1 Jan and 13 Jun 2007: 9 confirmed or probable cases,
including 6 hospitalizations and 4 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF). A total of 5 cases were confirmed (4 of serotype DEN-2 and one
serotype DEN-4). Travel outside of Palau was confirmed in one case.
- 14 suspected cases were also reported.
- The previous epidemics on the island were due to [virus] serotypes
DEN-1 and DEN-4.
3.3 Australia (population: 20 million)
3.3.1 Epidemiological context
The incidence of dengue remains low in Australia, and cases occur
mostly in Queensland.
- As opposed to the other countries in the region, several [virus]
serotypes can circulate simultaneously.
3.3.2 Current situation
- From 1 Jan to 16 Jun 2007, 152 cases were reported in Australia
- From the end of March to 30 May 2007, 45 cases of [virus] serotype
DEN-3 were confirmed in the area of Townsville (Queensland)
- The epidemic occurred within the context of higher rainfall than the mean.
3.4 Other states (non exhaustive list)
- American Samoa (population 58 000)
From 1 Jan to 14 May 2007: 14 cases reported. Of these, 9 were
reported between 27 Apr and 14 May 2007. In 2001, an epidemic of
DEN-1 [virus] caused 1800 cases. Over the period 2002-2006, only 3
cases of dengue were diagnosed.
- Easter Island (Chile) (population: 4000)
From November 2006 to 18 Apr 2007, 16 cases (DEN-1) reported. The
only epidemic of dengue (DEN-1) on Easter Island occurred in 2001.
Between 13 Mar and 9 May 2001, 621 cases were reported, of which 132
were confirmed (attack rate: 16 percent)
- New Zealand (population: 4 million)
To date, there is no local [virus] transmission although potential
vectors were recently introduced. The number of cases of imported
dengue in New Zealand has been increasing since 2001. For the
majority of cases, the infection originated in the Pacific Islands.
During the 1st 5 months of 2007, 78 imported cases of dengue were
diagnosed, including 60 originating in the Cook Islands.
4. Situation in the French overseas possessions (TOM-POM) in the Pacific:
4.1 French Polynesia
4.1.1 Epidemiological context
Important epidemics affect French Polynesia regularly.
- The last epidemic, in 2001, affected the 5 archipelagos of French
Polynesia. It lasted 10 months (from February to November) and the
number of cases was estimated at 33 800 (attack rate: 16 percent).
The majority of cases occurred in children of younger than 13 years
(born after the last epidemic of DEN-1). Nearly 1400 people were
hospitalized including 633 (45 percent) for a severe form of the
disease. There were 8 deaths, all of them children under 13 years of
age.
4.1.2 Current situation
- Since 2001, DEN-1 remains the circulating serotype. In 2007, a case
of imported DEN-2 was diagnosed, but it did not result in secondary
transmission.
- Since the end 2006, an increase in the number of
laboratory-confirmed cases has been observed.
- Between 1 Jan and 31 May 2007, 2680 suspected cases of dengue were
reported, of which 1208 were confirmed; 102 cases have been
hospitalized since the beginning of 2007, including 19 severe forms.
No deaths directly attributable to dengue have been reported
- Cases were diagnosed in the 5 archipelagos that constitute French Polynesia.
- During the past weeks, [dengue virus] transmission has remained important.
Several factors could contribute to this recrudescence:
- Increase in the susceptible population: people born or arrived in
Polynesia after 2001 (date of the last epidemic)
- Heavy rains between December 2006 and February 2007, in particular
on the Archipelago of the Society Islands, epidemic micro foci in
zones spared from the epidemic in 2001.
4.2 New Caledonia (population: 240 000 (2006 census)
4.2.1 Epidemiological context
Dengue epidemics in New Caledonia:
1943: DEN-2
1972: DEN-2
1976-78: DEN-1
1979-80: DEN-4
1989: DEN-3
- From 1995 to 2003, 3 serotypes were isolated.
- The last epidemic, due to serotype DEN-1, occurred in 2003: 5576
cases (2527 confirmed and 3049 hospitalizations) were notified,
including 17 deaths.
4.2.2 Current situation
- 1 Jan-18 Jun 2007: 24 cases notified
- 15 cases confirmed (DEN-1)
- Among the 24 cases, 11 were imported (10 from French Polynesia and
one from the Cook Islands).
- The majority of the cases were identified in the Southern province,
and more particularly, in the urban zone of Noumea.
- During the past 12 months, rainfall in New Caledonia was lower than
normal (appendix 1)
4.3. Wallis and Futuna (population: 15 000 (2003 census)
Note: More than 17 000 Wallisians and Futuniens live in New Caledonia
4.3.1 Epidemiological context
- Dengue epidemics in Wallis and Futuna:
1976: DEN-1, n/a
1989: DEN-3, 2361 cases
1998: DEN-2, 395 cases
2002-03: DEN-1, 2988 cases
- In 2002-03, nearly 2900 cases (including 2 deaths) were diagnosed
and 336 people were hospitalized.
- The epidemic in the archipelago lasted more than a year (September
2002-October 2003) (attack rate: 21 percent)
4.3.2 Current situation
- No probable or confirmed cases have been identified on the Islands
of Wallis and Futuna since June 2004.
- The geographical isolation of the Islands has certainly helped to
limit the reintroduction of dengue fever.
- However, the entomological indices measured during the1st 6 months
of 2007, are high in the majority of communities.
5. Comments
Since the end of 2006, a recrudescence of the cases of DEN-1 in
several Pacific Islands, in particular French Polynesia and the
neighboring Cook Islands, has been observed. This recrudescence,
related at least partly to the increase in the number of susceptible
people and to particularly abundant rainfall in this zone, should
diminish with the southern winter.
- The proportion of cases of dengue imported from the other Pacific
Islands diagnosed in New Caledonia and New Zealand underlines the
risks of diffusion within this area.
- In the Pacific, the major epidemic cycles, related to the
reintroduction of a new serotype, occur every 5 to 10 years. The last
major epidemic of dengue (DEN-1) occurred in 2000-2002.
- In this context, the existence of local transmission of dengue 2,
3, and 4 (Australia, Cook Islands, and Palau) must be followed with
attention.
