I was wondering if anyone has looked for chemical accumulation in the brain
of these animals. Or for that matter, the chemical contamination in the
liver or spleen of these beasts?
Just a thought!

I have no objective reason at all for suggesting this, but has the
possibility of a calicivirus been eliminated?? With the wholesale
distribution of RCV throughout much of New Zealand, there must have been
some runoff into rivers and then oceans. Only a thought.

[One can perceive some problems with this suggestion starting with the fact
that the affected islands are some hundreds of miles off-shore, but there
are always defaecating scavenging seabirds. - MHJ

Searching for causes of mortality among the dead sea lions certainly makes
sense. However, when a potentially pathogenic virus or bacterium is
recovered from dead animals, one cannot be certain that this organism is
statistically associated with dead animals and therefore, a likely cause of
the epidemic, without also knowing its prevalence among healthy animals.
This is why case-control studies are becoming a routine tool used during
outbreak investigations. While the idea of killing apparently healthy sea
lion pups as part of the investigation is not attractive or mainstream, it
is needed to establish the prevalence of infection with bacteria and viruses
and to describe nature and frequency of background lesions in various
tissues.
This approach seems to make scientific sense and could potentially save many
more lives in the long run than it costs in the short run. Using this
case-control approach, one could calculate risk ratios for death associated
with suspected pathogens as well as the population attributable risk for
each. This would then help target future research and prevention efforts. As
with any case-control study, consideration should be given to selection
criteria for controls (e.g. age and sex matching) as well as sample size and
power. Without use of some type of controlled study, it is unlikely that
statistically valid conclusions can be reached about the cause(s) of this
epidemic.

[I don't think that Larry is suggesting anything revolutionary in the
routine use of case-control studies in epidemiological investigations; in
fact I believe that they have been part of their traditional design since at
least the mid-60s. However there may be problems with recovering agents from
healthy juveniles a month or longer after this epidemic, or put another way
of being confident in one's negative findings, with or without serology
(which could be obtained by darting without killing pups). Also the politics
might be overwhelming. Better done at the time if done at all. All of which
is armchair epidemiology.
There is an extraordinary silence from Massey concerning these
investigations. I wonder if someone in their pathology department would be
willing to share the rule-outs from their investigations. - Mod.MHJ
