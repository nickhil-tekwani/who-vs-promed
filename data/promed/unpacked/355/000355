A total of 471 people have developed a wheat allergy after using a
type of popular green face soap and some of them have become seriously
ill, health ministry officials said Tuesday [15 Nov 2011], citing a
report by the producer.

Yuuka Co. began recalling the soap called "Cha no Shizuku" (Drip of
Tea) in May [2011] and has said the soap now on the market is safe as
it does not contain the agent that caused the allergic symptoms.

According to the official citing an accident report by the company, 66
people among the total were taken to hospital after developing serious
conditions including becoming unconscious.

Yuuka, based in Onojo, Fukuoka Prefecture, sold about 46.5 million
units of the old type of the soap, touting it as the country's
best-selling face wash in 2009. The Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare has called on buyers of the old products not to use them and
to return them to the maker.

Separate from Yuuka's report, the ministry has received reports from
medical institutions that 49 people have developed similar serious
allergic symptoms. In 19 cases the ministry could not rule out the
possibility that the use of the soap triggered the symptoms, the
officials said.

Meanwhile, the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan said it had
received a total of 938 complaints as of Tuesday [15 Nov 2011] about
health damage caused by the soap.

A mail-order soap has caused at least 471 people to suffer wheat
allergy reactions, including unconsciousness, and the distributor and
manufacturer are trying to recall millions of the bars while the
health ministry is alerting consumers to the dangers.

The allergic reactions linked to the use of Cha no Shizuku (Drop of
Tea) soap include swelling, rashes, and breathing difficulties, the
health ministry said Tuesday [15 Nov 2011], adding that at least one
case of a user falling unconscious has been linked to the product, out
of 66 people who have been hospitalized.

The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry is urging the public to refrain
from using Cha no Shizuku soap sold by the Fukuoka Prefecture-based
mail-order firm Yuuka Co. between March 2004 and last December [2010].
The soap was manufactured by Nara Prefecture-based Phoenix Co.

The number of patients surfaced this week, but Yuuka began alerting
customers in October 2010.

Of the 66 people who were hospitalized, 6 displayed symptoms that were
definitely caused by the soap, Eisuke Hikosaka of the ministry's
medicine and food division said, adding it directly caused at least
one of the patients to fall unconscious.

The number of victims was provided to the ministry by Yuuka, but there
may be more who suffered reactions.

The ministry separately collected data from hospitals but has yet to
determine if any figures are duplications. The hospital data indicated
178 users of the soap suffered allergic reactions, of whom 49 had to
be hospitalized. Of those hospitalized, 19 were confirmed to have had
reactions from using Cha no Shizuku.

Yuuka sold 46.5 million bars to 4.6 million customers between March
2004 and last December [2010]. It currently sells soap under the same
brand name, but it is now free of wheat-derived substances.

After the health ministry announced in October 2010 that wheat
degraded through hydrolysis can cause allergy symptoms, Yuuka sent
letters that month to 1.2 million customers who had used the soap,
which is green in color, for 2 years or more, according to the
National Consumer Affairs Center, which is under the jurisdiction of
the Consumer Affairs Agency.

Yuuka again sent letters to 1.4 million customers on several occasions
from January to April [2011], the center said. Yuuka and Phoenix began
May 20 [2011?] collecting the soap from wholesalers and others who had
purchased it. 10 days later, Yuuka sent letters to all 4.6 million
customers to notify them it was recalling the product and to alert
them, the center said on its website.

[It seems unusual for a soap to trigger such severe reactions in
people. Most soaps trigger such things as skin rashes, but
unconsciousness, falling, and respiratory conditions is severe and
rather unusual. In 2010 the International Institute for Quality
Selections awarded this company the High International Trophy in the
Cosmetic Products & Toiletries Selection for this product (see
http://www.monde-selection.com/en/7.4.4.7_PE_Selection_Results_2010.asp).

While many allergies can be serious, such as inhaled or consumed
allergens to peanuts. But for such severe allergies to be triggered on
contact, or perhaps from smelling the soap is unusual and I wonder
what other ingredients are in this soap. - Mod.TG]
