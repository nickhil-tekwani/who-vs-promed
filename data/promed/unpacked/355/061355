Angola: Marburg epidemic continues to spread fear in the north
-----------------------------------------------
In one of the rudimentary buildings on the hospital grounds, a Medicins
sans Frontieres (MSF) team has set up a treatment center for Marburg fever
patients. Covered from head to toe in bio-security suits, the team members
are working in extreme conditions. In addition to the inevitable fear and
the intense heat they must endure, their role is limited to accompanying
patients to their near-certain death.
Feeling hopeless against the Marburg epidemic that has gripped their
region, inhabitants of the Angolan city of Uige are either suffering in
silence, expressing their anger, or fleeing their homes. Marburg fever has
already claimed the lives of more than 280 people in the province, and new
cases are surfacing almost every day.
Faced with a disease that can be transmitted by the simplest contact with
an infected and symptomatic person, the 200 000 or so city-dwellers of Uige
want to know who is responsible, and sometimes their fears turn into wrath.
Stones have been thrown at international teams who are fighting against the
epidemic but cannot treat patients, as no cure exists; the only measure
they can take is to isolate infected persons to avoid further transmission.
As patients who enter the hospital very rarely come out alive, families are
refusing to abandon their sick and prefer to keep them hidden at home,
exposing themselves to the risk of being the next victims.
Day after day, one woman visited her husband at the Marburg treatment
center of the Uige Provincial Hospital. But back in the barrio (or
neighborhood) of Camdombe Velho, she did not dare tell her neighbors why
her husband was sick. "If I told them what he has, they would not approach
my house," she said. After spending 13 days in the center, her husband no
longer had symptoms, and he recently returned home. He is one of the 1st
isolated patients who appears to have won the battle against the disease.
Yet for many Uige inhabitants, the provincial hospital remains synonymous
for death. Not only because almost none of the confirmed cases have
survived, but also because the hospital has been one of the main focal
points of the outbreak. At 1st, children in the pediatric ward died; then
their mothers died; health staff followed - 16 lost their lives; and the
disease spread on to the staff's relatives.
"People always look for someone to blame for such deaths," said Pastor
Alberto Moises, while watching team members from MSF and WHO collecting a
body in the barrio of Pedreira. "They say that Marburg is in the hospital;
that there is a large reservoir of blood there; and that anyone who
approaches it dies," he explained. "Many people have fled to Luanda (the
capital) or to the villages."
"It's very frustrating," said Diana Pou, an MSF doctor. "We can only wash
the patients, give them food and drinks, and treat their symptoms." "We
have to tell ourselves that we are here to deal with a public health
problem, and we have to get away from a personal approach. The primary goal
is to isolate infected persons so that they don't infect others," adds Luis
Encinas, the medical coordinator.
Convincing the population that isolation is necessary is a Herculean task.
An MSF team recently organized a meeting with representatives of the
Pedreira barrio. The importance of having cases come to the hospital --
even though no treatment is yet available -- was discussed for hours. Then
a traditional healer spoke up: "I have a cure. And I have cured 5 people,"
he claimed, without being able to name any of the 5. Suddenly, all the
participants at the meeting -- including those who had seemed most
convinced of the need to isolate cases -- began demanding that the
traditional healer's cure be applied. 2 short sentences had reversed the
meeting's progress.
In addition to such setbacks, local traditions and customs can become
lethal. In preparation for a burial ceremony in the barrio of Ngana Camana
on 10 Apr 2005, the body of a woman was washed by her sister, her
sister-in-law, and her godchild. All 3 women subsequently died of Marburg
fever.
"If we prove that [she] was infected, it is clear that the virus may have
been passed on when her body was washed," said Evelyn Depoortere, an
epidemiologist at Epicentre. Dr. Depoortere is also looking into the
possibility that the woman belongs to a cluster of 5 people, all from Ngana
Camana, who may have contracted Marburg at the local health center. A WHO
team noted that needles in this center were being re-used after soaking for
only a few minutes in warm water.
"If you compare it to AIDS," said Josefa Rodriguez, an MSF psychologist,
"in Europe, after years of awareness-raising, we have managed to change
some behaviors. Here, we need people to change their customs in 2 weeks.
And no matter how hard we try, it's very hard to succeed in doing that."
In the meantime -- and despite the fact that new cases are registered
almost every day -- the inhabitants of Uige are returning little by little
to a semblance of normality. The streets, virtually deserted some weeks
ago, have gradually filled up again. People no longer cover their mouths
with horror when teams collecting bodies pass by. Accustomed to many other
hardships, the population is showing signs of stoicism.
"In Angola, we have known war," said Ligia Maria Costa Pedro, head of the
pediatric ward in the Uige hospital, "and we have come out of it and moved
on. Even though Marburg is killing a lot of people, there will always be a
few survivors." She lost 7 of her colleagues to Marburg.

[Recent reports from Angola have expressed, alternately, hope and despair.
The absence of quantitative information on cases and fatalities in the MSF
report above makes it difficult to evaluate the state of current progress
in containing the outbreak. One can only admire the dedication and courage
of those striving to achieve a successful outcome. - Mod.CP]
