Imported canine rabies: Toledo, Spain
-------------------------------------
The Spanish authorities have instituted precautionary public health measures following an incident in Toledo [Castile-La Mancha province], central Spain, on 1 Jun 2013, involving an illegally-imported dog -- subsequently confirmed to have rabies and euthanised -- that attacked several people including children in the city [1].

These 3 areas of increased risk of rabies have been delineated (based on the dog's movements prior to the incident in Toledo):
- a perimeter of 20-km [about 12-mile] radius around the city of Toledo, Castile-La Mancha province;
- the municipality of Huesca, Aragon province;
- the municipalities of Girona and Barcelona, including Barcelona city, Catalonia province.
A map of the areas affected is available on the PHE rabies incident webpage [2].

A NaTHNaC clinical update provides further information and advice for both travellers and health professionals [3].

[Canine rabies has been eradicated throughout most of Western Europe, and the majority of the population is unaware of any potential risk, such as that presented by the illegal importation of dogs from rabies endemic areas. In this particular incident, people (and other canines) may have been exposed to the imported animal before it was recognised to be rabid. While the risk of exposure is low, it is prudent that travellers to this popular holiday destination should be advised of the current situation. - Mod.CP
