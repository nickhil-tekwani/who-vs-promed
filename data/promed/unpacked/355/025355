Bird flu H5N1 virus was discovered in the northern provinces of Nghe An and
Ha Tinh that were affected by floods this month [November 2010], said
health officials on Friday [26 Nov 2010].

In Nghe An Province, Dien Chau District, nearly 600 poultries [chicken?],
infected [by] H5N1 virus, were burnt. Province health officials sterilized
breeding facilities and isolated [infected] areas.

In Ha Tinh Province, the bird flu outbreak has hit Cam Xuyen District.

Currently, because of high demand for chicken, farmers have expanded [the]
capacity of their farms. Cold weather and density of poultry farms have
caused the disease to spread widely, said health officials.

[According to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAOAIDE NEWS no 71, 16 Nov 2010,
<http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al835e/al835e00.pdf>), compiled on the basis
of information obtained up to 31 Oct 2010, the most recent H5N1 AI outbreak
in Viet Nam was reported during July 2010.

Since the start of the epizootic on 7 Dec 2006, 271 outbreaks have been
reported by Viet Nam. The most recent follow-up report, no 44, was
submitted to the OIE on 17 Aug 2010, addressing 6 outbreaks in 4 provinces;
see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9608>.
According to the report, the following control measures were applied as of
August 2010: quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out; no
vaccination (see further). The following measures were announced to be
applied: screening; zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

There seems to be some need for clarification concerning the Vietnamese
vaccination policy. According to a review published by the OIE in April
2009 (see reference below), the Government of Viet Nam introduced blanket
vaccination in designated high risk provinces, conducted twice per year.
Most of the vaccine used, reportedly contained a killed antigen based on
A/Goose/Guangdong/96 in an oil adjuvant, produced in China. It would help
to be informed if the said policy is being maintained, and in case
affirmative -- which criteria are applied to consider an area to be at
"high risk" and thus vaccinated. - Mod.AS
