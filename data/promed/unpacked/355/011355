Comment on the Embargo on Importation of _Dracaena_ spp. Plants
---------------------------------------------
[Previous posts on the presence of _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes in
shipments of _Dracaena_ plants arriving on the West coast of the USA
referred to an impending embargo. The ProMED-mail post entitled _Ae.
albopictus_, imported - USA (S.California) (02) contained the following
explanatory statement: "Accordingly, pursuant to 42 CFR 71.32(c), CDC is
implementing an embargo on the importation of _Dracaena_ shipments in
standing water, effective immediately. This embargo only affects
importation of _Dracaena_ shipments in standing water." - Mod.CP
I wouldn't mind learning more about the logic of an embargo and any other
containment operations against _Aedes albopictus_. I have seen _Aedes
albopictus_ all over the USA, especially the south. I currently live in
Kentucky and see the mosquito everywhere in great numbers. Before this, I
have seen the insect in South Carolina and Georgia. I believe it is well
established in many other states. How does an embargo [on imports from
Asia limit an organism that is clearly established here in the USA?
