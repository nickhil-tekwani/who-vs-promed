Abstract
--------
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in major neutralizing antibody-binding sites can affect humoral immunity induced by infection or vaccination (1-6). We analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) individuals that received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While previously infected individuals sustained higher antibody titers than uninfected individuals post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain than previously infected individuals 7 days after the 2nd vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination in the time-points analysed. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (e.g., B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (e.g., B.1.617.2) or with E484K (without N501Y/T). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from previously infected vaccinated individuals displayed overall better neutralization capacity when compared to plasma from uninfected individuals that also received 2 vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the impact of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity.

[2] Vaccine
[2A] Certificates
Date: Mon 19 Jul 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/19/covid-certificates-to-be-compulsory-for-crowded-venues-in-england


Vaccine passports will be compulsory to enter packed venues such as nightclubs in an extraordinary U-turn announced by Boris Johnson hours after clubs were allowed to open for the 1st time in 16 months.

In a move that provoked an immediate backlash from Conservative backbenchers and the entertainment sector, the prime minister said that from late September [2021], once all adults have had the chance to receive 2 jabs, COVID vaccine certificates would be made mandatory in England.

"I should serve notice now that by the end of September [2021], when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather," he said.

Unlike at pilot events, where customers have been allowed to show evidence of a negative test, they will have to prove they have been double-jabbed amid concerns in government about vaccine uptake among young people. Approximately 35% of 18-30-year-olds are unvaccinated, he said.

Addressing younger people directly, Johnson said: "Some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination."

Less than 18 hours after almost all COVID restrictions were formally scrapped, allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing, the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the "continuing risk posed by nightclubs". From just after midnight on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated "freedom day."

Johnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers, where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for COVID.

The prime minister spoke alongside England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead.

Vallance said hospitalisations could rise "quite a lot higher" than 1000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising, while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues.

Asked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer, Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (Sage) would have to make recommendations, which could focus on "close contact indoors."

As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging COVID cases, Johnson also announced that "a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers" would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate.

These workers, in sectors such as the police, energy supply, food production, and transport, will be allowed to leave quarantine, solely to work, if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests. Their employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return.

Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: "Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them."

Mark Harper, a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic COVID Recovery Group, suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament.

He said: "I have to say I don't welcome the minister's statement, particularly vaccine passports for crowded venues, which is effectively moving to compulsory vaccination. I do, however, look forward to the debate and the vote in parliament when he will bring forward the evidence, because I don't think that is supported by the pilots that have taken place."

Ministers had previously backed away from the compulsory use of coronavirus certificates -- which involve customers using the NHS app to show their vaccination status -- in part because of backbench Tory hostility. In a recent vote on compulsory vaccinations for care workers, 31 Conservatives rebelled.

Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose the plans, raising the possibility that Conservative rebels could defeat them when they come to parliament in the autumn. Justin Madders, shadow health minister, said: "This make-it-up-as-you-go-along government is causing more chaos when what people and businesses need is certainty. How can it be safe to go to nightclubs now, with no protective measures, if in September [2021] it will require double-jab status? It makes no sense."

The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: "Vaccine passports are COVID ID cards: unworkable, expensive, and divisive." Businesses reacted with fury. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: "What an absolute shambles ... The government's own report into vaccine passports found they were more trouble than they're worth, so what could possibly explain the about-turn, just as millions across the UK experience their 1st taste of a night out in a year and a half?"

The latest survey from the Office for National Statistics, carried out in the month to [20 Jun 2021], found that about 10% of all people aged 16-29 reported being hesitant to get the COVID vaccine, dropping to 5% for those aged 30-49 and 1% for over-50s.

[2B] Opinion: Anti-vaxxers
Date: Mon 19 Jul 2020

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/19/stop-pleading-with-anti-vaxxers-start-mandating-vaccinations/


It's time to get serious about coronavirus vaccinations. Stop pleading and start mandating.

For the past 6 months, President Biden, joined by every public health authority in the land, has been begging Americans to get vaccinated. The "pretty, please" approach isn't working. According to The Post's COVID-19 tracker, in the past week, daily reported COVID-19 cases rose 66%, COVID-related hospitalizations rose 28%, and daily reported COVID-19 deaths rose 20%. With the delta variant spreading across the country, every single state has seen an increase in cases over the past 7 days.

This is a preventable tragedy. Over 99% of COVID-19 deaths in June [2021] were among the unvaccinated. Yet even as evidence grows that vaccines are safe and effective, resistance to them is also growing. A recent Post-ABC News poll found that 29% of Americans said they were unlikely to get vaccinated, up from 24% 3 months earlier. Only 59% of adults are fully vaccinated.

There is vaccine hesitancy among many different sectors of the population, including reckless youths, granola liberals who believe in alternative medicines, and African Americans who distrust the health-care system. Some are still persuadable, but many are not. As I've previously noted, the biggest obstacle to vaccination is now Republicans, who are being fed a steady diet of anti-vaxxer propaganda by Fox "News" Channel, Facebook, and other social media, and reckless demagogues such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).

The same Post-ABC News poll found that 86% of Democrats had gotten at least one vaccine shot compared with only 45% of Republicans. Right-wingers are literally dying to own the libs. In the process, they are ensuring that deadly variants will continue to circulate, endangering school reopenings and preventing a return to normalcy.

This is madness. Stop making reasonable appeals to those who will not listen to reason. (According to an Economist/YouGov poll, a majority of those who refuse to get vaccinated say vaccines are being used by the government to implant microchips.) It's a waste of time. Start mandating that anyone who wants to travel on an airplane, train, or bus; attend a concert or movie; eat at a restaurant; shop at a store; work in an office; or visit any other indoor space show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test.

For months, Republicans have been caterwauling about vaccine passports, even obscenely comparing them to the Holocaust. All this sturm und drang obscures the fact there has been far too little use made of vaccine passports. I downloaded a New York state app on my iPhone months ago to verify that I'm vaccinated, but I've never once had to show it. Instead, many stores have signs saying that vaccinated people don't need to wear masks, but they don't verify vaccination. That provides no incentive to get your shots. Los Angeles County is also treating vaccinated and unvaccinated alike by again requiring masks for everyone. Why not just mandate proof of vaccination or a negative test?

European countries also favored a voluntary approach to vaccinations initially, but now they are moving in the direction of mandates. French President Emmanuel Macron just mandated compulsory vaccinations for all health-care workers by [15 Sep 2021] and declared that, starting [1 Aug 2021], anyone who wants to enter cafes, restaurants, theaters, long-distance trains, or shopping malls must have proof of vaccination or a negative test. This announcement prompted more than 3 million people to register for shots in just 5 days. Germany, Italy, and Spain have already raced ahead of the United States in the percentage of the population that has been partially or fully vaccinated, and France will soon overtake us too.

In the United States, the authority of state governments to mandate vaccinations is clear: it goes all the way back to a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld a Massachusetts law requiring vaccinations for smallpox. More recently, governors have used their public health powers to mandate mask-wearing and social distancing to fight COVID-19. They ought to now take the logical next step and mandate vaccinations for the use of indoor spaces outside the home.

Biden can set an example by using his authority to mandate vaccinations for airline travel and Amtrak travel and for federal employees or those who enter federal buildings. The Pentagon has not made vaccinations mandatory because they were approved only on an emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration, which is why 1/3 of the military still hasn't received a single shot. Biden can and should issue an executive order mandating military vaccination as a national security priority.

Granted, there are limits to the United States' ability to mandate vaccines because many red-state governors are unlikely to go along. But even Republicans want to fly on airplanes and visit blue states such as California, Hawaii, Nevada, and New York. Vaccine mandates will prove controversial, to put it mildly, but, like seat belt laws, drunken driving laws, and motorcycle helmet laws, they will save lives. We should not grant an unreasonable minority the power to endanger public health.

[2C] Israel: Pfizer vaccine
Date: Mon 19 Jul 2021
From: Steve Berger <steve@gideononline.com>


In recent months, numerous publications indicate that immunized individuals account for an increasing percentage of new COVID-19 cases. Often, these observations are based on semantic confusion between the terms "immunized," "vaccinated," and "immune."

A case at point is Israel, which has vaccinated over 65% of the eligible population. Assuming the local vaccine (Pfizer) is 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, at least 5% of recipients (and their physicians, families, employers) will falsely assume that they are "immune." In Israeli terms, 200 000 to 300 000 at-risk individuals now carry a "green passport," which indicates nothing more than receipt of 2 inert injections. Assured that they are now "immunized," they see no further use for face masks, social distancing, avoidance of travel, etc.

The recent introduction of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 into Israel has resulted in a troubling increase in the incidence of COVID-19 reports that many of these new patients have been "previously immunized" are used by the media and policymakers to question the effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine. Given the highly contagious nature of this new variant -- and a local demographic that now includes hundreds of thousands of "immunized" (but not "immune") individuals who may not adhere to masks, etc. -- the fact that many of the latter are becoming infected should come as no surprise.

Early serological testing of all new COVID-19 cases -- particularly those who were previously "immunized" -- will be useful to more accurately assess the effectiveness of vaccines.

[3] Azithromycin ineffective
Date: Sun 18 July 2021 12:30 IST
Source: IB Times [edited]
https://www.ibtimes.co.in/common-antibiotic-covid-19-no-more-effective-placebos-risks-hospitalization-details-838778


One of the biggest risks accompanying viral diseases such as COVID-19 is secondary bacterial infections. They can worsen the prognosis in sufferers. Therefore, antibiotics are often prescribed to individuals with viral infections, particularly respiratory illnesses. Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic to those who are battling the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Now, a new study has stated that in non-hospitalized patients, azithromycin it is no more effective than a placebo in preventing symptoms of COVID-19.

According to the multi-institutional research, San Francisco, azithromycin may not only be ineffective in reducing symptoms of COVID-19 ,but may also increase the chances of hospitalization. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

"These findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 infection," said Dr. Catherine E. Oldenburg, lead author of the study in a statement. She added: "The hypothesis is that it has anti-inflammatory properties that may help prevent progression if treated early in the disease. We did not find this to be the case."

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have turned to existing compounds to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Drugs such as remedesiver, interferon, and hydroxychloroquine have been tested as potential treatment options. Among these, only remedesiver has received approval. Antibiotics [such as] azithromycin have also been used to treat symptoms and infections accompanying COVID-19.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat a broad range of infections. These include skin infections, trachoma, Lyme disease, sinus infections, certain sexually transmitted infections such as drug-resistant tuberculosis ,and pneumonia. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and potential antiviral properties, it has been suggested that azithromycin can aid in the management of COVID-19.

However, along with the lack of data from randomized controlled trials, several studies have suggested that azithromycin may not benefit patients with the viral infection much. Studies have also stated that the antibiotic does not prevent mild-to-moderate cases of the novel coronavirus infection from progressing to hospitalization or death.

For the study, the authors randomly assigned 263 COVID-19 patients into 2 groups: placebo group and azithromycin group. 171 participants were given a single daily dose of 1.2 grams of azithromycin and 92 received a placebo. These patients were non-hospitalized and had tested positive for the novel coronavirus within 7 days prior to entering the study.

On day 14 of the trial, 50% of participants from both groups showed no symptoms. However, by day 21 of the study, 5 participants who had been prescribed azithromycin were hospitalized due to acute symptoms of the viral infection. Interestingly, none of the volunteers from the placebo group were hospitalized.

Therefore, these findings led the team to conclude that the prescription of a single dose of azithromycin did not lead to an increased likelihood of not developing symptoms. "Most of the trials done so far with azithromycin have focused on hospitalized patients with pretty severe disease. Our paper is one of the 1st placebo-controlled studies showing no role for azithromycin in outpatients," concluded Dr.Oldenburg.

[The use of empiric azithromycin for hospitalized adult COVID-19 inpatients has also been variable and inconsistent, but the following excerpt from UpToDate reflects the approach of most American infectious diseases specialists:
"Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia in select patients: For patients with documented COVID-19, we do not routinely administer empiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Data are limited, but bacterial superinfection does not appear to be a prominent feature of COVID-19."

"If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, we attempt to make a microbial diagnosis (e.g., through sputum Gram stain and culture, urinary antigen testing) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. In such settings, a low procalcitonin may be helpful to suggest against a bacterial pneumonia."
