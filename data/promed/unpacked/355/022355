The source of an outbreak of 19 cases of Legionnaires' disease in Stoke-on-Trent, England appears to be a hot tub at a wholesale store. Investigators identified an "unusual strain" of _Legionella_ bacteria on a hot tub at JTF Warehouse in the Fenton area of Stoke-on-Trent that matches samples taken from patients, according to a news release yesterday [30 Jul 2012] from the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA).

Dr Sue Ibbotson, HPA regional director, said: "We have the evidence from DNA fingerprinting of samples from the hot tub and the patients being caused by the same previously unseen strain of _Legionella_." 17 of the 18 case-patients that were confirmed as of yesterday [30 Jul 2012] reported visiting the store. Included in the 18 are 2 cases confirmed yesterday, and health officials confirmed an additional case today, according to the BBC.

A spokesperson from the area's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said in the HPA release: "HSE continues to inspect premises where we are the enforcing authority and will do so until we have eliminated those sites from our investigations and are sufficiently assured there are no other possible sources." The hot tub model was pulled from all WTF Warehouse outlets, the BBC reported.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that can grow in warm water sources, such as air-conditioning units or hot tubs. People typically contract the disease by inhaling contaminated vapor or mist.

[_Legionella_ occur naturally in lakes or other natural bodies of water. They also live in water systems associated with buildings, e.g. water storage tanks, cooling towers, fountains, and hot tubs.

There have been several outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease where the cause was traced back to a hot tub. See prior ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, spa pool - UK (England) 20060929.2787. People can be exposed not only while using a hot tub, but also by being close enough to breath in the fine spray created, e.g., during demonstrations, as apparently occurred in the Stoke-on-Trent outbreak in which 19 cases have so far been confirmed as Legionnaires' disease. One patient has died.

The news report says that an "unusual strain" of _Legionella_ has been isolated from the implicated hot tub and that patients and the genotype of the environmental and clinical isolates match, but the news report fails to say what the species of _Legionella_ is.

A hot tub (AKA spa pool or whirlpool spa) is designed for seating a small number of people in a rather confined space. The water temperature is kept between 30 to 40 C [86-104 F], the optimum temperature for _Legionella_ to grow in a contaminated hot tub. (At temperatures below 20 C [68 F], the bacteria are dormant, and at temperatures above 60 C [140 F], _Legionella_ are killed over time.) The water in a hot tub is not usually drained between uses, so it has to be continually filtered and cleaned. The piping for the air and water circulation and the filter provide a large surface area on which _Legionella_ form a biofilm, which is a thin layer of slime formed by micro-organisms in water systems that provides protection from adverse conditions.

The hot tub has a circulator pump to ensure the water flows around the occupants. Aerosols of _Legionella_ are apparently formed when the circulator agitates the water. People can inhale these infectious aerosols. Exposing the lungs to the bacteria could then lead, in susceptible people, to Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the disease or Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form.

Staffordshire is a landlocked county in the West Midlands region of England with a population of 1 047 380 (2001) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire). Stoke-on-Trent, the largest city in Staffordshire, was known for its pottery industry but is now a center for service industries and distribution centers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent).
