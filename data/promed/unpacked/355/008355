A new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was detected in a
household in Bao Thang district, Pho Moi ward, Lao Cai province on 24
Oct 2010, said head of the province's veterinary branch, Dao Duy Kien.

During an investigation on 20 Oct 2010, around 198 pigs were found to
have contracted the disease with a high fever and pustules in their
mouth and feet. The reason for the infection is poultry [see comment]
and cattle brought in from other localities.

To prevent the spread of the disease, the provincial People's
Committee sent an urgent document requesting local authorities
isolate outbreaks, implement vaccinations, and strengthen control
over trading and slaughtering cattle in the region. Customs and
border guard forces have also clamped down on the illegal import of
cattle through borders.

The province's veterinary branch also set up 2 quarantine stations in
Long Khanh on (on Highway no. 70) and Nghia Do (on Highway no. 279),
which connect to Yen Bai and Ha Giang provinces. In addition, forces
will work on shifts around the clock to control the transport of
cattle and prevent the spread of the disease.

[FMD virus does not infect poultry; mentioning poultry in the context
of FMD spread may be related to the suspicion of mechanical means of
virus transmission spread by fomites. Organic material and low
temperatures protect the virus from drying, enhancing its extended
survival on fomites, including car-wheels, animal cages, straw etc.

Detailed information on FMD in Viet Nam, where the disease is
regarded to be endemic, can be retrieved from the SEAFMD (Southeast
Asia Foot and Mouth Disease Campaign) website at
<http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd>.
Viet Nam's reports indicate that 71 FMD outbreaks have been recorded
there during the period January-September 2010, of which 40 were
sampled for laboratory tests and serotyped; all were found to be FMDV
serotype O. No outbreaks were recorded during the 3 months
June-August 2010; in September 2010, 7 outbreaks were reported, but
only one farm sampled (found to be serotype O). During 2009, serotype
A was identified in Viet Nam as well, the last outbreak in November.
A map, showing all outbreaks during any requested time-frame, is
retrievable at the URL above.

The most recent FMDV serotype O isolate from Viet Nam genotyped by
WRLFMD (Pirbright) dates back to 2008; it was identified as the
Cathay topotype. Earlier isolates (2006), were both Cathay and
ME-SA/strain Mya-98. These and additional data on Vietnamese FMD
virus history are available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm>.
It will be interesting to note which serotype(s) are currently
circulating in Viet Nam, as well as their genotyping profile. - Mod.AS]
