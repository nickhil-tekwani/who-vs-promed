Health officials from BC [British Columbia province] and Yukon are in Atlin, BC, today looking for the source of a deadly case of [a] hantavirus [infection].

The rare disease is normally spread through the urine and feces from deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].

Officials confirmed the virus was responsible for the death of a 45-year-old man earlier this month [January 2013]. He died suddenly 9 Jan [2013] at the Whitehorse hospital.

Doctor Ronald Chapman, the Chief Medical Health officer for northern BC, said the Atlin death is the most northerly case of [a] hantavirus [infection] ever diagnosed in the province. "Up until 1995, the farthest north the virus occurred in BC is up to Williams Lake, so this is certainly the farthest north."

Health officials advise people to wear gloves and masks when working around or cleaning out areas where there may be mice.

The hantavirus infection, also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), is a very rare viral disease which can be fatal.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough, which progresses to respiratory illness, the province said in a release.

The symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after exposure to [virus contaminated] deer mouse droppings.

Chapman said investigators in Atlin hope to find the source of the virus by trapping the diseased rodents. He said it's usually just one or 2 infected mice that are responsible.

Chapman said there is no cause for public concern at this point.

[Although the specific hantavirus in this case is not specified, it most likely is Sin Nombre virus. Although the report indicates that only one or 2 infected mice are responsible for this case, in some circumstances the virus may, in fact be more widely disseminated in the mouse population, as was the situation that occurred in Yosemite National Park, California, last summer (2012; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121121.1418786).

The measures recommended by the BC health officials to avoid virus exposure are prudent and should be followed. Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have occurred in Canada, mainly in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20060626.1777)
