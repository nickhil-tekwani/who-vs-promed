TULAREMIA - USA (TEXAS)

This advisory is prompted by a large die-off of rodents and rabbits
in Presidio County, Texas due to tularemia. Tissue samples from the
animals were collected and submitted to the CDC laboratory in Ft.
Collins, Colorado. The samples were positive for _Francisella
tularensis_, the bacterium that causes tularemia.
Disease Agent: _Francisella tularensis_ is a highly infectious, small
gram-negative coccobacillus. Humans and over 250 types of wild and
domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish are
susceptible to infection. A variety of ticks and small wild mammals,
including various rodents, rabbits and hares, are the natural
reservoirs of infection, although the organism may survive for weeks
or longer at low temperatures in water, moist soil or vegetation such
as hay, and animal carcasses. _Francisella tularensis_ may be
dispersed via dry or wet aerosols.
Exposure: Animals and humans are most commonly infected through
exposure to or ingestion of infected wild animals, their carcasses or
body fluids; exposure to or ingestion of contaminated water, soil, or
vegetation; or bites by infected arthropods, especially ticks and
biting flies. Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria is another potential
route of infection.
Clinical signs - Dogs: Dogs are thought to be resistant to natural
infection. Clinical disease, when it occurs, typically consists of
fever, anorexia, and listlessness. Additional symptoms may include
skin or mouth lesions, draining abscesses, enlarged lymph nodes, and
nasal and ocular discharge.
Clinical signs - Cats: Cats are thought to be more susceptible to
tularemia than dogs, but still considered fairly resistant to natural
infection. Clinical disease, when it occurs, may consist of fever,
anorexia, listlessness, skin or mouth lesions, draining abscesses, and
enlarged lymph nodes.
Clinical Signs - Livestock: Livestock, particularly sheep, are
variably susceptible to tularemia infection. Large epidemics with
high mortality have been seen in range sheep. Clinical signs are not
specific, and usually include fever, anorexia, and depression. Cough,
rapid respiration, diarrhea, and stiffness and edema of the limbs may
also occur.
Public Health Considerations: Very few cases of human disease have
been associated with transmission from pets. Transmission from pets
to humans has been documented from bites and scratches in the case of
cats and from mechanical transmission by dogs transporting the
organism on their fur into the household from infected source
material. Pets may also transport infected ticks into the household.
Transmission from livestock to humans may involve direct contact with
infected animals, animal tissues, or animal products, such as wool,
and vector transmission via ticks and other biting arthropods found
on livestock.
Diagnostic Testing: Gram stain of smears or biopsies is rarely
useful. Testing of clinical or postmortem specimens for _Francisella
tularensis_ is available on a limited basis at the CDC Vector Ecology
and Control Laboratory in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Testing typically
consists of blood culture, serology and/or microscopic examination
and culture of tissue samples (particularly liver and spleen), lymph
node aspirates, and exudates. If you plan to pursue diagnosis on a
live animal, please collect a blood sample for culture prior to
initiating antibiotic therapy. Serology results may be inconclusive
during the first 2-4 weeks after infection due to the time it takes
for antibody titers to increase to diagnostic levels.
Treatment: Treatment protocols for tularemia in animals are not well studied.
However _Francisella tularensis_ is usually susceptible to a wide range of
antibiotics, with the aminoglycosides streptomycin and gentamycin being first
choice drugs for human infections. Tetracycline, cephalosporins, and
fluoroquinolones have also been found to be effective. Relapses may occur,
usually due to incomplete course of treatment.
Infection Control: Standard Precautions should be followed.
Environmental surfaces should be decontaminated with soap and water
and a hospital-grade disinfectant. Primary prevention is directed
toward reducing the threat of transmission to animals and humans from
wildlife and the environment in high-risk areas, because eliminating
tularemia from its wild animal reservoirs is not feasible.

[Currently there is one person hospitalized with suspected tularemia.
However strong the suspicions are, the physician and the Texas
Department of State Health Services are awaiting confirmation before
making a public announcement.
I would like to acknowledge Dave Taylor, DVM, in Fort Davis, Texas
for alerting us to this outbreak.
When I telephoned the Texas Department of State Health Services, the El Paso
branch was knowledgeable and prepared for discussions. When I asked about a
large outbreak in rodents, I was told it was very large, and there was great
concern for animals and people. - Mod.TG]
