The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) reported [Tue 6 Feb 2018] that a King County facility has been quarantined after a horse tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

In an Ag Brief on the department's website, State Veterinarian Brian Joseph, DVM, said this case is unrelated to another recent EHV case in King County.

"This is a different strain of EHV-1 than the virus strain that lead to an earlier quarantine at a separate horse facility in Woodinville this past December [2017]," his statement said. "The most recent case involves a non-neuropathogenic strain of equine herpesvirus, though it is still serious and can cause respiratory problems in horses. The detection was made in a gelding that had recently been transported from Oregon. It is recovering under treatment and has not shown clinical signs of illness."

The Equine Disease Communication Center reported that the horse was transported to Washington from Oregon's Portland Meadows Racetrack.

Joseph said the previously diagnosed case at the Woodinville facility involved a neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain that led to the facility being quarantined and 7 horses being euthanized. The WSDA has not yet lifted the quarantine, he said.

"Horse owners should take precautions to protect their animals against these contagious diseases by practicing strict biosecurity," Joseph's statement said. "You should also monitor your horses for signs of illness, monitor their temperature twice a day and notify your veterinarian immediately if you have any concerns."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore - and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has confirmed a 2nd diagnosis of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) at the affected farm in central Virginia.

On [Thu 1 Feb 2018], a horse-boarding stable in Chesterfield County was placed under quarantine after a horse with fever and neurologic signs tested positive to the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV), the virus that causes EHM.

Since that time, 9 horses in the stable have developed fevers, but none exhibited neurologic signs. Veterinarians tested 3 of these horses for EHV and one tested positive. Testing for the remainder of the febrile horses will continue over the next several days. The facility will remain under quarantine for 21 days past the last positive finding of EHV.

The febrile horses have been isolated on the farm and are under veterinary care. The stable transferred 4 of these horses to the isolation unit at Marion Dupont Scott Equine Medical Center, in Leesburg, for additional care and monitoring. Because these horses were admitted under the established isolation protocol, the Equine Medical Center is not under quarantine and is admitting and treating patients normally. Neither the Chesterfield stable nor the equine medical facility poses a risk to the Virginia horse population.

Generally, VDACS advises horse owners to develop biosecurity protocols with their veterinarian for any horses that enter or travel from another farm. Such practices should include isolating returning or new horses from resident horse populations for 14-21 days. Isolated horses should have temperatures taken twice daily. Contact your veterinarian if any horse has a temperature over 101.5Â°F.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services noted that on [Tue 1 Feb 2018], a horse boarding stable in Chesterfield County was placed under quarantine after a horse with fever and neurologic signs tested positive for the equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) that causes equine herpes myeloncephalopathy (EHM). Since that time, 9 horses in the stable have developed fevers, but none have exhibited neurologic signs. Three of the horses were tested for EHV and one tested positive. Testing for the remainder of the febrile horses will continue over the next several days.

The facility will remain under quarantine for 21 days past the last positive finding of EHV.

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture has confirmed equine herpes virus, known as EHV-1, at 3 different premises in Idaho.

The disease is highly contagious among horses but poses no threat to humans.

At 2 sites a more severe, neuropathogenic strain of the disease known as EHM that results in neurological symptoms, has been confirmed.

EHM was confirmed at one premise in Jerome County and one premise in Gooding County. Both are privately owned and under quarantine, said ISDA Chief of Operations Chanel Tewalt.

EHV-1 has been confirmed at a site in Gem County. That site is also under quarantine and the disease caused an abortion in a pregnant mare.

The strain of EHV-1 affecting the mare in Gem County is non-neuropathogenic and is known to commonly cause respiratory disease and abortions in mares, according to an ISDA news release.

An epidemiological investigation into the confirmed cases is ongoing but no link has been made among the 3 operations, Tewalt said.

There are different variants of EHV-1 and EHM is a neurological strain of the disease.

"Researchers have been unable to predict when a horse carrying EHV-1 will develop EHM," Tewalt said. "But once a horse develops neurologic symptoms, they can be actively shedding virus which is a risk to other horses that come into contact with the (infected) horse."

Vaccines are available for EHV, but they do not protect against the neurologic form of the disease, Tewalt said.

According to ISDA, EHV can be found in most horse populations around the world without causing clinical symptoms.

Symptoms of EHM in horses include fever, lethargy, in-coordination, weakness in the hindquarters, incontinence and diminished tail tone, according to the news release. It is easily spread through airborne transmission, horse-to-horse contact and contact with nasal secretions on tack, feed and other surfaces.

Although it's not a threat to humans, people can spread the virus to horses through contaminated hands, clothing, shoes and vehicles.

"We encourage owners to contact their veterinarian immediately if they observe any symptoms of illness in their horses," said Dr. Bill Barton, the state veterinarian.

People can report suspected or confirmed cases of EHM or EHV-1 by calling (208) 332-8540 or (208) 332-8570.

According to ISDA, biosecurity measures that horse owners can incorporate while transporting or boarding horses include disinfecting stalls before use, never sharing water, feed buckets, tack or groom equipment, and avoiding unnecessary contact with other horses.

People who work at more than one equine facility should wash their hands and change footwear and clothing before entering each facility, the news release said.

A total of 2 horses at the University of Findlay have tested positive for equine herpes virus, though they are not showing symptoms, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture.

Those horses have been isolated and the English Equestrian Farm is under quarantine, according to a UF press release. The quarantine will last at least 4 weeks.

Classes are continuing as usual.

Equine herpes "can be spread through the air or contaminated clothing and equipment" the ODA said.

The virus can affect horses in 3 ways: "rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease of mostly young horses), abortions in pregnant mares, and the neurologic disease EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy, which can be fatal to horses."

All horses at the farm had been vaccinated against the virus.

"To prevent the spread of the virus, strict regulations and biosecurity measures have been implemented," UF said. "This protocol includes using proper disinfection and sanitizing practices and monitoring every horse's temperature. Additional horses who have exhibited fevers at the English Farm have been tested, and to date, we have not received another positive test result."

The virus is not a threat to humans, the ODA said.

The Western Equestrian Farm is not under quarantine.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) reported [Fri 2 Feb 2018] that it has confirmed equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) cases in 4 horses at separate locations around the state.

As such, the ODA has placed multiple facilities under quarantine and is actively investigating where these animals have been and what other animals might have been exposed.

The ODA confirmed that 2 of the positive horses raced at the Meadows Racetrack and Casino, in Washington, Pennsylvania. Those animals are currently under quarantine at separate facilities. One of the 2 raced at Miami Valley Gaming, near Lebanon, Ohio, on [Sat 13 and Wed 24 Jan 2018]. Testing confirms they have EHV-1 but neither animal is showing clinical signs of illness.

"Racehorse owners should take immediate precautions to protect their animals," said State Veterinarian Tony Forshey, DVM. "All owners should closely observe their horses for any signs of illness and take their temperatures daily. They should immediately contact their veterinarian if they have any concerns."

Additionally, 2 horses at the University of Findlay have tested positive for EHV. These animals are also not showing clinical signs of disease. The ODA has placed the facility under quarantine. Currently, the department does not believe these animals are connected to the other positive tests, but epidemiological investigations are underway.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

In addition to via horse-to-horse contact, EHV can be spread through the air or contaminated clothing and equipment. As such, it's important that horse owners practice strict biosecurity measures in order to protect their animals and prevent any further spread of the disease.

http://www.drf.com/news/turfway-quarantines-barn-after-horse-put-down-due-ehv1


Barn 14 at Turfway Park has been placed under quarantine by the Kentucky Department of Agriculture after a horse stabled there tested positive for the equine herpesvirus (EHV1) and was euthanized [Fri 2 Feb 2018]

State and Turfway Park officials met with horsemen [Sat 3 Feb 2018] at the track, informing them of the quarantine and the protocols in place to contain the virus. Those measures include disinfecting stalls, tack, equipment, and the starting gate. Horses can continue to ship into Turfway Park to race, though tracks such as Oaklawn Park and Laurel Park announced bans over the weekend of shippers coming from Turfway.

The quarantine at Turfway follows EHV1-related quarantines earlier this winter at Belmont Park and Laurel, both of which have since been lifted.

Many horses are latently infected with the equine herpesvirus without showing any signs of the disease, while others develop the far more dangerous neurological strain of it, which can lead to paralysis and death. More typical symptoms include nasal discharge, fever, and lethargy.

The euthanized horse at Turfway was a 3-year-old unraced gelding named Totter who was owned, bred, and trained by [PR]. He began showing signs of neurological issues last week [week of Sun 28 Jan 2018], [PR] said, and was initially treated with medication for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM). He deteriorated midweek, continually laying down in his stall on [Wed 31 Jan 2018], and the state was notified, [PR] said. On [Fri 2 Feb 2018], he tested positive for EHV1, and with his condition not improving, the decision was made to euthanize him. He had been at Turfway exclusively since October [2017], [PR] said.

[PR] said she shares Barn 14, which houses about 35 horses, with approximately 8 trainers. All horses in the barn are now isolated from the general horse population and are to be tested [Mon 5 Feb 2018] for EHV1.

State and track officials have asked horsemen stabled at Turfway to closely monitor the temperatures of their horses.

"We are taking all precautions to ensure the illness is isolated, and we will adhere strictly to the established procedures until the quarantine is lifted," Turfway Park general manager Chip Bach said.

Turfway is finalizing logistics to allow training for the quarantined horses after the general horse population there is finished training. The track hopes to have this separate training period in place by as early as [Tue 6 Feb 2018], Bach said.

The quarantine is expected to last at least 2 weeks. A barn quarantine cannot be lifted until all horses test negative for the virus.

[As one my gather, this is a very busy EHV season, if season is the right word.

If you are at equine events of any kind, including taking your animal to a hospital, be sure you are taking the animal's temperature at least twice a day. An elevation in body temperature is sometimes the only, and certainly one of the earliest signs your horse may be ill. Please remember to chart those temperatures so you are not guessing if the temperature increased by a fraction of a degree or more. This disease is highly contagious!!

Equine herpesviruses (EHV) are in the family Alphaherpesviridae and are enveloped double stranded DNA viruses. There are 5 alpha herpesviruses that infect horses (EHV-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). For the purposes of this fact sheet, we will focus on EHV-1 and EHV-4, which are the 2 that result in serious clinical disease in the horse. EHV-1 and EHV-4 used to be considered subtypes of the same virus, but are now recognized as closely related but different viruses. EHV-1 is commonly found in horse populations worldwide and was previously referred to as the equine abortion virus. Although EHV-1 is well known for causing reproductive disease, it is also known to cause respiratory and neurological disease. EHV-4 is also known as equine rhinopneumonitis virus and is most common among foals and yearlings. Although EHV-4 most commonly causes respiratory disease, it can also cause abortion and neurological disease.

The incubation period (period of time from exposure to development of 1st clinical signs) ranges from 2 to 10 days. Respiratory signs for EHV-1 and EHV-4 include fever of 102 - 107ÂºF that lasts for 1-7 days, coughing, depression, inappetence (going off feed), and nasal discharge. Abortion usually occurs between months 7 and 11 of gestation, about 2-12 weeks after infection. There is no evidence that the mare's reproductive tract is damaged, and it does not affect her ability to conceive in later pregnancies. Signs of neurologic disease for EHV-1 and EHV-4 include mild incoordination, hindlimb paralysis, recumbency (lying down and being unable to get up), loss of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin around the tail and hindlimb areas.

Transmission occurs when infected and uninfected horses come in either direct (nose to nose contact) or indirect (through buckets, clothing, blankets that are contaminated) contact with nasal discharges of infected horses. The virus can travel via aerosol (in the air) for short distances. The virus may also be transmitted by contact with aborted fetuses, placental fluids, or placentas from infected horses. Also, following infection, horses may become latent carriers of EHV; virus may be reactivated after stress or high doses of corticosteroids.

In the case of an outbreak, infected horses should be isolated from other horses. The stable should be quarantined for at least 3 weeks after signs of clinical disease in the last case subside. All stable equipment should be disinfected. People handling the infected horses should be sure to wash their hands after handling each horse, dip their shoes in a disinfecting foot bath, and change clothes before working with healthy horses. Some sources suggest that bedding be removed and burned. Barn stalls, aisles and other surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected as well. Although this virus can last for several weeks in the environment, it is readily killed by most common disinfectants; phenol based disinfectants are commonly used.
