In February 2017, Spanish plant protection officials alerted Czech authorities that ornamental _Polygala myrtifolia_ delivered to Czech and Slovak nurseries in May 2016 were potentially infected with _Xylella_. The delivery contained 56 plants distributed in 7 Czech cities, with 44 plants sold to the public in 2016. In addition, 11 plants also went to the Slovak Republic.

Sample collection and laboratory analysis is being undertaken on suspected plants from the original consignment to confirm _Xylella_ infection. Help is being sought from the public to track down additional plants from the suspect delivery and to identify possible areas of spread where they were planted.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favor the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern. The pathogen has been added to the EPPO quarantine lists.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported for the 1st time from Taiwan (on grapevine; ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205), and was also detected in Europe on olives in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497). It seems likely that that outbreak represents the 1st report of the pathogen in the European region. Recently, Xf subsp. _fastidiosa_, the cause of Pierce's disease of grapevine, was reported for the 1st time from Europe (ProMED-mail post 20160802.4387487).

It was thought initially that the source of the European incursion was due to contaminated imports of plant material. However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals (like the case mentioned above) acting as reservoir host, now suggests a much more complex scenario which may have global implications on plant quarantine. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production. Research on pathogen distribution, strains, host range and potential vectors in the region has been given high priority.
