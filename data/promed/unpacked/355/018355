There has been an increase in the number of typhoid cases last month
in Daru, Western province. A total of 59 cases were reported, more
than double the usual number.

Dr John Konga, the CEO of Daru General Hospital said normally, the
number of cases reported would be between 20 and 25. He said the lack
of clean water supply and poor sanitation led to the increase.

Villagers of a province in the Northern Division have been urged to
improve their toilet and sanitary facilities before looking at other
projects outside the home boundary. Sub-divisional medical officer
Bua, Doctor Vasiti Cati told the Bua Provincial Council meeting at
Nawaido, in Bua, yesterday [30 Nov 2007] it was important for
villagers to take pride in improving sanitary facilities in their
attempts to stop the spread of typhoid.

Dr Cati said since August [2007], 38 typhoid cases had been reported
in the province. She said this was not a good sign as the disease
could be fatal. Dr Cati reminded delegates the disease claimed the
life of a schoolteacher at Tunuloa in April 2007.

[3] Cameroon: Central African Republic refugees
Date: Mon 3 Dec 2007

Most of the 45 000 Central African Republic (CAR) refugees living in
eastern Cameroon are diseased, malnourished, and generally in bad
health, non-governmental organisation (NGO) and UN workers say.

The refugees arrive "very weakened, after long days of walking and a
lot of stress and they live in very difficult conditions," Eric
Grimaldi of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) told IRIN.

Once settled in some 60 villages in eastern Cameroon, their health
does not improve significantly. For every 10 000 people, there are
between 3 and 7 deaths per day among the refugees. According to MSF,
the situation is particularly bad in the village of Ngaoui in
Adamaoua Province, home to 5 000 refugees and receiving 100 new
refugees a month.

"[The refugees] suffer from malnutrition, typhoid and amoebic
diseases," said a nurse in a missionary hospital in the small eastern
town of Letta. "The health of the refugees is really very bad... And
they always arrive in a critical state to begin with."
