Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) biologists are seeing an outbreak of adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) in a local deer herd in The Dalles and ask that residents do not feed the animals and bury or take to the landfill any carcasses they find on their property.

District Wildlife Biologist Jeremy Thompson said The Dalles office received several reports of deer dying in the Cherry Heights area during the past month. The cause of their deaths was determined as AHD when specimens were sent to the state lab.

"If these deer died from AHD, then feeding them will potentially spread this disease to other deer rapidly. It's very important people don't provide water sources or feed for deer for this reason. [This is an awkward statement. One does not feed dead dear. I think what this means is that by providing food and water to deer, the virus may transmited into the feed/water and then spread to other deer. - Mod.TG]

Their bodies are built for browse and grass, not grain," says Thompson.

AHD is a virus transmitted by direct contact between deer, making it easier to spread in areas of high deer concentrations. This is particularly a concern where people feed and water deer since it unnaturally concentrates them in a small area. Deer with AHD can have clinical signs common to other diseases that include: rapid or open mouth breathing, foaming or drooling at the mouth, diarrhea (possibly bloody), weakness and emaciation.

Death can occur within 3-5 days from the time the deer are exposed to the virus.

ODFW is also asking the public to report sightings of deer with these symptoms to ODFW's office in The Dalles at 541-296-4628.

Thompson said the current AHD cases are not the 1st in The Dalles, and outbreaks have occurred in other parts of Oregon.

He said the virus does not pose a risk to people, domestic pets, livestock, or other wildlife, nor are there any known cases of humans getting sick from AHD or getting the disease from consuming the meat of an infected deer.

[AHD is caused by an adenovirus. EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease) is caused by an orbivirus. They are different.

This particular adenovirus, capable of infecting both wild and captive cervids, was 1st recognized in California deer in around 1994. The virus is closely related to bovine adenovirus-3, but the biologic properties of the 2 viruses are clearly distinct, and it does not cause disease in other animals than deer.

Clinical signs of this disease in deer may be confused with some signs of pneumonia or even with bluetongue. Acutely, these signs may present themselves as diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and open mouth breathing, and even drooling, which could lead to disease spread at feeding stations. These may progress to weakness, and the body cavity may fill with fluids. If this happens, death may occur within 3-5 days of initial exposure. If not, the animals may develop a chronic condition and present with abscesses and ulcers throughout the mouth and throat.

This disease killed several thousand animals in California and has killed more than 400 cervids in Oregon so far.

This virus seems to spread easily by direct animal-to-animal contact or contact with body fluids. The disease may be airborne, especially in dense or crowded populations, such as around feeders or water stations put out by people who enjoy watching the deer.

Hence, the public is being encouraged to cease feeding and watering wild deer to avoid tight groupings and crowding that may spread the disease. Likewise, proper disposal of deceased deer may be important. Please call the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife for specific recommendations regarding disposal of dead animals in your area. - Mod.TG
