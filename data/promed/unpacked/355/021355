Pitia Flores Ledur, Karina Karmirian, Carolina da Silva Gouveia Pedrosa, Leticia Rocha Quintino Souza, Gabriela Assis-de-Lemos, Thiago Martino Martins, et al. Zika virus infection leads to mitochondrial failure, oxidative stress and DNA damage in human iPSC-derived astrocytes.
Abstract

Zika virus (ZIKV) has been extensively studied since it was linked to congenital malformations, and recent research has revealed that astrocytes are targets of ZIKV. However, the consequences of ZIKV infection, especially to this cell type, remain largely unknown, particularly considering integrative studies aiming to understand the crosstalk among key cellular mechanisms and fates involved in the neurotoxicity of the virus. Here, the consequences of ZIKV infection in iPSC-derived astrocytes are presented. Our results show ROS imbalance, mitochondrial defects and DNA breakage, which have been previously linked to neurological disorders. We have also detected glial reactivity, also present in mice and in post-mortem brains from infected neonates from the Northeast of Brazil. Given the role of glia in the developing brain, these findings may help to explain the observed effects in congenital Zika syndrome related to neuronal loss and motor deficit.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Here we detail how ZIKV infection produces extensive neuropathology in the developing mouse brain and spinal cord of both sexes. Surprisingly, neuropathology differs depending on viral strain with a French Polynesian isolate producing primarily excitotoxicity and a Brazilian isolate being almost exclusively apoptotic but occurring over a prolonged period that is more likely to produce severe hypoplasia. We also show exposure can produce a characteristic pattern of infection that mirrors neuropathology and ultimately results in gross morphological deformities strikingly similar to CZS. This research provides a valuable mouse model mirroring the clinical course of disease that can be used to test potential therapies to improve treatment and gain a better understanding of the disabilities associated with CZS.

Significance statement
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed congenital Zika syndrome. Despite its devastating effects, very little is known about how ZIKV infection produces fetal neuropathology. Here we detail the temporal progression of ZIKV infection in the mouse brain and spinal cord resulting in massive neurodegeneration of infected regions. We also report a ZIKV strain from a region of Brazil with high levels of microcephaly (abnormally small head circumference) produces particularly devastating neuropathology.

Smoots AN, Olson SM, Cragan J, et al. Population-Based Surveillance for Birth Defects Potentially Related to Zika Virus Infection -- 22 States and Territories, January 2016-June 2017.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In states and territories with documented local Zika virus transmission, the prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy increased 21% during the 2nd half of 2016 compared with that in the 1st half.

What is added by this report?
In U.S. territories with widespread local Zika virus transmission, the prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection increased 4-fold during January-March 2017 compared with January-March 2016.

What are the implications for public health practice?
During the Zika virus outbreak, birth defects surveillance programs adapted to rapidly identify Zika-related birth defects regardless of laboratory evidence. These data provide more complete information on all infants affected and allow planning for care.

Jurisdictions included in this report submitted data to CDC for the entire period (January 2016-June 2017). Jurisdictions were aggregated by level of local transmission of Zika virus: 1) widespread local transmission of Zika virus (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands); 2) limited local transmission of Zika virus (southern Florida counties and Texas Public Health Region 11); and 3) without local transmission of Zika virus.

Discussion
The peak occurrence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection in areas with widespread local transmission occurred in February 2017, 6 months after the reported peak of the Zika virus outbreak in these areas in August 2016 (6). This is consistent with other findings regarding the time between the peak of a Zika virus outbreak and recognition of an increase in potentially Zika-related birth defects (7). Approximately one half (47.6%) of cases with laboratory test results available in areas with widespread local transmission had confirmed or possible laboratory evidence of infection. In areas with limited local transmission, the prevalence increased 20% during October-December 2016, although not significantly; no increase was observed in areas without local transmission.

Compared with the previous report (4), this analysis added 7 more jurisdictions (including one with widespread local transmission) and reported 18 months of data from monitoring births potentially affected by the outbreak. The previous report grouped widespread and limited local transmission areas together, reporting a 21% increase in prevalence for these areas combined (4). Stratification by local transmission levels provides support that the significant increase in prevalence is exclusive to widespread local Zika virus transmission areas. Further, the baseline prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection during the reference period in the 22 jurisdictions is consistent with the baseline prevalence for 3 jurisdictions before Zika virus was introduced in the Region of the Americas (5).

[This study provides additional information about the 4-fold increase in the prevalence of birth defects attributable to Zika virus infection. Even though reported Zika virus transmission in the Americas has declined considerably over the past 12 months in the Americas, the virus is still present, and monitoring of fetal development in areas where Zika virus infections have occurred in the recent past is prudent. - Mod.TY]

HVF Sousa Pereira, SP dos Santos, AP Rodrigues Lazzari Amancio, P Soares de Oliveira-Szejnfeld, E Oliveira Flor, J de Sales Tavares, et al. Neurological outcomes of congenital Zika virus syndrome in toddlers and preschoolers: a case series.

Summary
---------
Background
Congenital Zika syndrome causes a spectrum of neurological symptoms with varying effects on function that require different therapeutic strategies. To date, this spectrum of effects and its clinical implications have not been completely described. We describe the neurological examination findings in toddlers and preschoolers, including predominant symptom complexes and comorbidities.

Methods
This study is a case-series neurological evaluation of 75 children with congenital Zika syndrome in Campina Grande, Brazil. The study is part of a cohort of children with congenital Zika syndrome that started in 2015 and is still ongoing. Children with Zika virus infection detected during pregnancy (mothers exhibited rash and were followed and diagnosed by fetal ultrasound abnormalities or RT-PCR) or through microcephaly screening after birth, using Intergrowth 21 guidelines, were selected by laboratory and radiological criteria. Children were examined during a 10-day period in September 2018, and underwent neurological interview, examination, and assessment of functional outcomes and comorbidities. Children were divided in groups of predominant corticospinal or neuromuscular clinical signs and the associations between these groups and clinical comorbidities were assessed.

Findings
All of the children recruited to the study from 29 Nov 2015 to 30 Nov 2017 had imaging correlates of congenital Zika syndrome. Children were assigned to groups depending on the signs exhibited, either corticospinal or neuromuscular, with or without dyskinetic signs. 75 children completed the evaluation, 38 (51%) girls and 37 (49%) boys. Median age was 33 months (range 26-40 months; IQR 29-34). Microcephaly was present at birth in 56 (75%) children, and 19 (25%) children were born with normal head circumference, 15 of whom later developed microcephaly. Neurological examination grouped 4 children as having isolated dyskinetic signs, 48 children were assigned to the corticospinal group and 23 into the neuromuscular group. Dyskinetic findings were present in 30 (40%) children, either alone (4 [5%]) or combined with corticospinal (19 [40%] of 48) or neuromuscular (7 [30%] of 23) findings. Comorbidities were highly prevalent, and the neuromuscular group had worse functional outcomes, evaluated by gross motor function (p=0·026), manual abilities (p=0·0013), and communication function (p under 0·0005) classification scales, than the corticospinal group, whereas pneumonia (p under 0·0005) and urinary tract infections (p under 0·0005) were more frequent in the corticospinal group. Cortical hyperexcitability was supported by several clinical correlates, such as early onset epilepsy, persistence of primitive reflexes, and dystonia.

Interpretation
We describe distinct neurological profiles in the congenital Zika syndrome spectrum, with functional outcomes tending to correlate with these groups. The clinical division of children based on the disease signs proposed here is supported by the literature on central and peripheral nervous system pathology in congenital Zika syndrome. The high prevalence of dyskinetic symptoms merits special attention.

Tilly Gurman, Anne Ballard Sara, Florentina Villanueva Lorenzo, Desiree Luis, Gabrielle Hunter, Sean Maloney, et al. The role of gender in Zika prevention behaviors in the Dominican Republic: Findings and programmatic implications from a qualitative study.

Abstract
----
Background
Zika remains an epidemiological threat in Latin America, including the Dominican Republic. Although transmitted by the same mosquito as dengue and chikungunya [viruses], Zika is unique in the potentially harmful consequences for babies born to women infected during pregnancy. Experts highlight the feminization of Zika, in terms of burden of disease and women's caregiving responsibilities. Understanding gender's role in Zika prevention, therefore, is key to strengthening current and future programs.

Methodology/Principal findings:
This qualitative study, comprised of 12 focus group discussions and 8 in-depth interviews, explored gender's role in Zika among pregnant and non-pregnant women as well as male partners of pregnant women in the Dominican Republic. Topics included perceptions about Zika and perceived feasibility and effectiveness of prevention behaviors (e.g. cleaning water storage containers, using condoms during pregnancy). Researchers applied grounded theory through a process of deductive coding -- classifying data around predetermined categories -- followed by inductive coding, identifying themes that emerged from coded data. Study findings uncovered 3 ways in which gender may influence Zika prevention. 1st, women are largely responsible for household chores -- including cleaning water storage containers -- with men as assistants. 2nd, men described their role in the family as the protector. Finally, men and women believed that partners would perceive suggesting condom use or abstinence during pregnancy as a sign of infidelity.

Conclusions
Current/future Zika programs should address knowledge gaps, especially around water storage cleaning techniques and sexual transmission. Programs should also integrate gender into programming in culturally relevant ways that avoid reinforcing stereotypes. Furthermore, programs should tailor activities for men, women, as well as the couple. In the end, integrating gender in a way that is mindful of the local context while not exploiting existing gender roles is critical for preventing Zika and similar mosquito-borne diseases, both in the Dominican Republic and throughout the region.

[This report illustrates the importance of understanding how cultural traditions can influence compliance with measures that can reduce the risk of Zika virus infection of pregnant women. Preventive measures must be designed and delivered in a way that is culturally acceptable.

Reported Zika virus infections are relatively few so far this year (2020) compared to the previous 4 years. Perhaps the outbreaks in these previous years have left a significant proportion of the population in those areas immune. - Mod.TY]
