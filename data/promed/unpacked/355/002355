KARNAL BUNT: USDA AMENDS REGULATED AREAS
========================================
Date: April 25, 1997
From: H. Nolan Lemon, Jr. <nlemon@aphis.usda.gov>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is amending the criteria for
classifying areas regulated for Karnal bunt.
"Bunted kernels must be found in or associated with an area for
USDA to consider regulating it," said Alfred S. Elder, acting
deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine with the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part USDA's
marketing and regulatory programs mission area.
Given the similarity of _Tilletia indica_ spores to the spores of
a yet-unnamed rye grass smut, USDA has concluded that the
detection of spores alone does not conclusively confirm the
presence of Karnal bunt in an area. The new criteria will allow
USDA to remove some parts of Arizona and California from the list
of regulated areas.
USDA is also modifying the classification of restricted areas by
establishing separate restricted areas for seed and regulated
articles other than seed.
USDA's action will relieve restrictions on the movement of grain
and other regulated articles from additional areas in Arizona,
California, New Mexico, and Texas. However, USDA will regulate
an area if it includes at least one field that has been
associated with bunted kernels. USDA will consider a field to be
associated with bunted kernels if:
-- bunted kernels were found in the field during surveys;
-- seed contaminated with bunted kernels was planted in the
field;
or
-- the field was tested, spores were found, and the grain
from this field was traced to a handling facility in which grain
containing bunted kernels was stored.
USDA has revised the list of Karnal bunt-regulated areas to
reflect the new classification criteria.
USDA has designated La Paz, Maricopa, Pinal, and Yuma
Counties as restricted areas for seed in Arizona. In California,
USDA has restricted the Bard/Winterhaven area of Imperial County
and the Palo Verde Valley area of Imperial and Riverside Counties
for seed.
USDA has taken every precaution to ensure international markets
for U.S. wheat remain open and believes the amended criteria will
protect the health of U.S. wheat and prevent the spread of Karnal
bunt to disease-free areas. In fact, USDA recently negotiated
the reopening of Canada's St. Lawrence Seaway facilities for the
transshipment of durum wheat from the U.S. Northern Plains.
Canada placed an embargo on U.S. durum wheat last year following
detections of Karnal bunt in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and
Texas.
During the negotiations, Canadian government officials expressed
confidence that USDA's National Karnal Bunt Survey demonstrated
the absence of Karnal bunt in wheat-producing areas of the U.S.
Northern Plains.
"We're obviously pleased with Canada's lifting restrictions on
durum wheat," said Elder. "But, APHIS will continue to urge
Canada to lift other restrictions, including those on non-host
seed and grain elevators."
Elder said USDA will continue to conduct the National Karnal Bunt
Survey because it demonstrates APHIS' commitment to safeguarding
U.S. trading partners from the spread of the disease.
In addition to using these new standards for determining the
presence of Karnal bunt on domestic wheat, USDA will also apply
them to imported wheat.
Mexico has established phytosanitary measures to protect the
Mexicali Valley from the disease's spread and has requested that
USDA recognize the Mexicali Valley as a pest-free area for Karnal
bunt. USDA recognizes Mexico's commitment to contain the
disease. Having evaluated the Mexicali Valley under the new
standards, USDA will propose lifting restrictions on wheat from
this area and formally recognizing it as disease-free.
Karnal bunt, a fungal disease of wheat, is caused by the smut
fungus _Tilletia indica_ and is most commonly spread by infected
seed. Karnal bunt was first detected in the United States in
Arizona in March 1996.
While the fungus does not threaten human health, flour made from
heavily infected wheat has an unpleasant odor and taste.
This interim rule is effective upon APHIS' administrator's
signature April 25 and is scheduled for publication in the
Federal Register. For further information, contact Mike Stefan,
operations officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, PPQ, USDA,
APHIS, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, Md. 20737-1236, or telephone

Consideration will be given to comments. Please send an
original and three copies of your comments to Docket No.
