Bird flu hits more provinces in Vietnam
---------------------------------------
Quang Nam in the central region became the 16th Vietnamese province
to succumb to bird flu, the media reported Thursday [31 May 2007]. In
Vinh Nam hamlet in Duy Xuyen district, 370 out of a flock of 400
ducklings raised by a household had been infected 30 May, the
province's veterinary bureau said. Specimens had tested positive for
the H5N1 strain of the virus, it added.
The central Animal Health Department reported a day earlier that 115
ducks had died on a farm in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho of H5N1.
The infected flocks in Quang Nam and Can Tho were not vaccinated
against bird flu and animal health workers slaughtered the remaining
685 birds. The number of birds killed by the virus or slaughtered
nationwide has risen to more than 50 000 this month.
Local veterinary agencies reported they had culled all fowls in
affected flocks, disinfected affected areas, and established
quarantine checkpoints around infected areas.
The 16 Vietnamese cities and provinces [out of a country-wide total
of 61. - Mod.AS] affected by bird flu since the beginning of last
month are Quang Ninh, Son La, Nam Dinh, Hai Phong, Bac Giang, Ninh
Binh, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, and Vinh Phuc in the
northern region; Nghe An, Quang Ngai, and Quang Nam in the central
region; and Can Tho and Dong Thap in the south.

The head of the National Steering Committee for Avian Influenza
Prevention and Control on Thursday [31 May 2007] instructed all local
agencies to keep an eye on rural farms and backyard poultry to head
off possible bird flu outbreaks. To deal with the worsening
situation, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has called on the health
ministry and the Standing Committee of the National Steering
Committee for Avian Influenza Prevention and Control to adopt drastic
measures to control the disease.
Local governments, medical, agricultural, rural development, border
quarantine and preventive medical units have been asked to prepare
and supply bird flu kits to local agencies to prevent transmission to
humans. The health sector has been warned to remain vigilant when
treating patients suspected to be infected with H5N1 by placing them
in isolation wards.
On Wednesday [30 May 2007] Minister of Agriculture Cao Duc Phat said
the country was on the brink of another bird flu epidemic among
poultry after the H5N1 virus had spread rapidly in the past month.
Last week Vietnam reported its 1st human case in a year-and-a-half, a
30-year-old man in Vinh Phuc province near Hanoi. Doctors treating
the man in Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital said his condition was improving
and that he was now able to breathe without a respirator.
Between 2003 and November 2005, Vietnam was one of countries
worst-hit by the disease, with 42 deaths. It, however, won
international praise for its transparency and effectiveness in
curbing the epidemic. Globally the virus infected 309 people in 12
countries, 187 of whom died, according to the World Health Organization.

Hong Kong bird confirmed with H5N1 virus
-----------------------------------------------------
A starling has tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in
Hong Kong, agricultural officials said Friday [01 Jun 2007].
Authorities said the bird, found dead last week in a densely
populated central area, was confirmed with the killer strain by
laboratory tests. They warned of personal contact with wild birds and
live poultry.
It was the 16th wild bird that has been found dead in Hong Kong this
year with H5N1, which has killed almost 200 people and ravaged
poultry flocks worldwide since 2003.
Biologists believe local species of wild birds found dead with the
virus could have picked it up from contact with infected flocks in
mainland China. Hong Kong was the scene of the world's first reported
major bird flu outbreak among humans in 1997, when 6 people died.
