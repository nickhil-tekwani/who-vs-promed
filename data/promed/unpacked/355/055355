The cow identified last week as Belgium's first case of "mad cow" disease
was used in a 1,200-ton batch of animal feed, some of which has been
exported to Poland and the Netherlands, the agriculture ministry
acknowledged Thursday. The embarrassing and potentially dangerous error
occurred because the animal had initially been thought to be suffering from
rabies, a ministry spokesman said. By the time laboratory tests had
revealed the animal was not rabid but had been suffering from bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the carcass had already been used for
feed. Agriculture Minister Karel Pinxten last week assured the public that
the animal had been slaughtered and burned in accordance with European
Union rules designed to keep BSE-contaminated meat out of the food chain.
A ministry spokesman insisted, however, that there was no danger to human
health because the animal concerned had been boiled at a sufficiently high
temperature to eliminate the BSE agent. The use of the boiled-down
carcasses of BSE-infected cattle for the manufacture of cheap feed is
thought to have been the main factor in spreading the disease among British
cattle in the 1980s. The use of meat and bonemeal for feed for ruminants
(cattle, goats and sheep) has since been banned by the EU. The European
Commission on Thursday expressed concerned about the Belgian incident and
said it had written to Pinxten demanding a detailed explanation of what
went wrong.

[Rabies is a differential diagnosis for BSE. One widely accepted
hypothesis for the origination of the BSE agent in the UK is that the
rendering industry changed the extraction process so that temperatures were
lowered while ether concentrations increased to cut overall costs. I am
assuming that this low temperature extraction procedure was not used when
the "rabid" cow, now identified as the first Belgium BSE case, was
rendered. Otherwise, the exported MBM can be the focus of a common source
epidemic for Polish or Dutch dairy farms as occurred many times in the UK.

Included is a short update on the BSE situation in Belgium. There are no
other new cases to date. The cow was diagnosed with rabies and the carcass
entered the rendering chain on the 17th of September, although this is a
controversial. The date of BSE suspicion was approximately mid-October and
date of BSE confirmation 31st of October. The MBM batches were sold to
Netherlands and Poland.
