Fever fever [sic] in Muzaffarpur has started to wreak havoc again. After a peace of one or 2 months, a glowing fever, also known as AES (acute encephalitis syndrome), has killed an 8-year-old girl. More than half a dozen children have died in Muzaffarpur this year [2020] so far from this deadly disease.

[Apparently, there has been a lull in Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome cases in Bihar state, but new cases are appearing. As of 16 May 2020, there were 48 cases of AES and 5 deaths due to the disease reported this year [2020] in the state. A 16 May 2020 report indicated that an 8-year-old girl died of AES, bringing the total deaths in Bihar state to 6 at that time. (https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/may/16/bihars-aes-death-toll-reaches-six-after-death-of-minor-girl-in-muzaffarpur-district-2144107.html). One wonders if the 8-year-old girl in the above report is the same one as reported earlier. According to the above report, there are a total of 8 deaths. However, an earlier report on 17 Jun 2020 indicated there had been a total of 11 deaths in Bihar as of thaat date this year (2020).

As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES and JE cases occur has begun, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 3-4 months. - Mods.TY/MPP
