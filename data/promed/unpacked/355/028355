The number of cholera cases has tripled in the cholera treatment centers of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Port-au-Prince and Leogane in less than a month. According to the MSF report, 134 people in the town of Martissant at the end of April [2012] and nearly 400 in total [were cared for] in the different cholera treatment centers of MSF in Port-au-Prince and Leogane.

The arrival of the rainy season facilitates the spread of the disease. To cope with this influx of patients, MSF had to reopen a cholera treatment centers in Carrefour, south of the capital for institutions in Martissant, Delmas, and Drouillard, closer to the center and north, from being overwhelmed.

"The sewers in my neighborhood are overflowing and we live in unhealthy conditions, without clean water or soap," one woman said. "I had diarrhea and was vomiting a lot, then I fainted," she recounted.

Since the epidemic began in October 2010, cholera has killed more than 7000 people (out of approximately 500 000 cases recorded, a number that represents approximately 5 percent of the population).

[As expected, with the onset of the rainy season the number of cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection is rising in Haiti. The sanitary infrastructure of the country is still at a point that flooding can easily increase spread of the infection. It may well become the case that the disease will, like in Africa and Asia, become endemic with flares with flooding as well as droughts. - Mod.LL
