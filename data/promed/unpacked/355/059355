The top official in Estill County, Kentucky, says a sick restaurant employee caused a salmonellosis outbreak that sickened 83, but state officials say the root cause remains unknown. Wallace Taylor, executive judge for Estill County, said Tuesday, 8 Mar 2016, he "is being told it was narrowed down to an employee" at the Eagles Roost restaurant and bar in Irvine, Kentucky. "Maybe the state just doesn't want to say yet," Taylor said.

Officials with the Estill County health department have not responded to requests for comment on whether a restaurant worker is the outbreak vector. The department does not have any information about the outbreak on its website and has not posted an outbreak update on its Facebook page since 17 Feb 2016. However, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services said while state investigators do not believe there is an ongoing risk to the public, "no source for the Salmonella has been identified."

The state health agency reports 83 cases of salmonellosis infections have been confirmed by laboratory cultures or met the case definition for the outbreak in Estill County. The most recent illness began 10 Feb 2016. 13 of the victims required hospitalization.

A county elected official said he believes his son was among those sickened in the outbreak. He said his family and many others in the area frequently dine at the implicated restaurant, which opened in recent months. "I ate there (the Eagles Roost) with my family on a Friday evening and Monday morning my son went to the hospital," he said. "They never tested him, though."

He believes many of the sick people weren't tested for salmonellosis, which complicated the outbreak investigation. "It took a long time to find a common denominator," Wallace said. "There were a wide variety of foods with different ingredients. It was pretty much everything on the menu.
