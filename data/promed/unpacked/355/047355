Far North Queenslanders have been urged to vaccinate their children following a spike in mumps cases in Cairns. There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since [24 Jul 2017], compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.

Tropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.

"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households," he said.

He said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.

"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune," he said. "The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.

"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people."

Northern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.

"This year's [2017] increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.

"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated." ...

The disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

This is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.

Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households.

University of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin [Otago, South Island].

Three young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.

Nationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of "an increased risk of further outbreaks".

Auckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month -- most aged 10 to 19 -- while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year [2017].

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month [July 2017] it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.

The MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.

Most people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.

Men hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.

The outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.

Pro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was "determining our ongoing response as the situation develops."

The outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].

All students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.

Marlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is "highly contagious". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.

Personal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.

Dr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. "The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage," Sherwood said.

There have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.

With 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.

Up to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus. In 2017, as of 18 Aug, there have been 230 cases reported from 19 localities, most of them in schools, which suggests low vaccination coverage in children and adolescents. The 1st outbreak was reported in April 2017 and the occurrence of cases is continuing until the month of August, according to the municipal health secretary. ...
