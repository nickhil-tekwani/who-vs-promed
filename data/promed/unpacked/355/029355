A mysterious respiratory disease is sweeping greyhound tracks across the
country, killing dozens of dogs and forcing owners to halt racing as
researchers hunt for a vaccine to control the outbreak.
Dr Lisa Zerbel, a veterinarian in Massachusetts who is treating some of the
sick dogs, said she thinks the illnesses are caused by a new strain of the
influenza virus that is more virulent than the common one known as "kennel
cough". But other experts say it is too soon to pinpoint the cause.
Wonderland Greyhound Park, in this blue-collar city north of Boston, has
been the hardest hit. Since May 4, 16 of its dogs have died from the
influenza-like illness, and the track has suspended racing indefinitely and
quarantined its 1200 greyhounds.
Racetracks in Colorado, Iowa, and Rhode Island have also reported greyhound
deaths over the past month, while other states are seeing a rash of
nonfatal cases, according to Massachusetts officials. "The reason this is
happening is because greyhounds travel from track to track, and they may be
incubating the illness without someone knowing," Zerbel said. Necropsies on
2 of the greyhounds at Wonderland found the dogs died of pneumonia, a
complication that can be caused by infection by either bacteria or a virus.
"The most frustrating thing about it so far is it tends to be very silent
early on," Zerbel said. "It's not until the late stages that they start to
show signs indicating that they need treatment." By then, she said, a sick
greyhound may be racing at a track in another state.
Gary Guccione, secretary and treasurer of the National Greyhound
Association in Abilene, Kansas, said similar outbreaks have plagued
racetracks for the past 3 years. "A major outbreak like this used to happen
once every 6 or 7 years," he said. "Now it seems to be coming on with more
frequency and with greater strength. We're in desperate need of a good
vaccine." There is already a vaccine for kennel cough, but the
Massachusetts State Racing Commission does not require it, and it is
unlikely it would be effective in this case, said Dr Alexandra Lightbown,
the commission's chief veterinarian. In the meantime, all greyhounds at
Wonderland are being treated with antibiotics as a preventive measure.
Virginia Tech's Dr Brad Fenwick, a specialist in greyhound medicine, is
leading the search for a new vaccine. He hopes to conduct experiments on a
vaccine this summer. Track owners around the country are funding his research.
He said he doubts the deaths at Wonderland and other tracks are from a new
strain of influenza. But he said it is not clear yet whether the infections
are caused by bacteria or by a virus. Bacterial pneumonia can result from a
variety of illnesses, and in greyhounds it can progress from mild to
life-threatening in a matter of hours.
At Dairyland Greyhound Park in Kenosha, Wisconsin, roughly 1/4 of the
track's greyhounds have become ill in recent weeks, though none has died,
said Scott Larrivee, a spokesman for state regulators. Dairyland suspended
racing this week.
Several greyhounds have died at Bluffs Run racetrack in Council Bluffs,
Iowa, according to Sally Prickett, a state veterinarian. She is awaiting
lab results.
She said kennel cough usually hits younger dogs because their immune
systems are weaker. But this disease is striking older dogs, and appears
more serious, she said.

Ailing dogs cancel races; Tucson Greyhound anticipates resuming business on
Tuesday.
--------------------------------------------------
Tucson Greyhound Park expects racing to return to normal next week after a
disruption caused by a mysterious respiratory disease that has swept across
the country. David Romo, director of racing, said the track is in the 2nd
week of cancellations and said the disease has afflicted about 380 dogs --
about 80 per cent of its total. He said the track plans to resume racing on
Tuesday but he couldn't say whether it would be able to stage a complete card.
"The dogs have been getting better; it just has to run its course," Romo
told The Arizona Republic. "It's been horrible." The ailing dogs have also
slowed business at Tucson Greyhound Park. "It hurts everyone involved,"
said general manager Marshall Kueker. The food and beverage people are not
working. The mutual people are not working and kennel operators are not
generating any revenue."
The disease has caused cancellations throughout the country and killed
dozens of dogs as researchers hunt for a vaccine to control the outbreak.
No Tucson greyhounds have died.
Dennis Young, assistant general manager at Phoenix Greyhound Park, said 4
days of racing had to be canceled in April. When racing resumed, only 12
races were run during mid-week programs, as opposed to the usual 15,
because of the number of sick dogs.
On 18 Jan 2005, Tucson Greyhound Park quarantined all of its dogs because
of an outbreak of kennel cough. But racing was not disrupted.

Race flu may kill your pet: CDC probes possible link to humans
--------------------------------------------------------------
The devastating and shadowy malady that is claiming the lives of greyhounds
at Revere's Wonderland racetrack may have even deadlier ambitions: lovable
Fido and perhaps even his master. The federal government's top scientists
are exploring whether a deadly dog flu that has ripped through greyhound
tracks across the country -- and is suspected in Massachusetts -- could
leap to humans. The strain of canine influenza has already popped up in
other dogs in animal shelters around the country. "Obviously, there is
nothing to stop it from going from greyhounds to terriers or shepherds,"
said Ruben Donis, chief of the molecular genetics section of the influenza
branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. "Humans, we
can't say anything at this point," Donis said.
There is little the typical dog-owning family can do to protect its pet,
experts said. Instead, the onus is on greyhound handlers to follow strict
hygiene protocols so the virus that has devastated racers doesn't jump to
the general dog population.
Revere's Wonderland dog track has been struck by the deadly contagion. 2
more greyhounds died there Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 18 in
roughly a week. In Rhode Island, 13 dogs have died at Lincoln Park.
Meanwhile, veterinarians treating sick and dying greyhounds at Wonderland's
gated, barracks-like kennel compound yesterday enforced a strict quarantine
-- one aimed at not only dogs, but humans as well.
Dr Lisa Zerbel, a veterinarian at North Shore Animal Hospital who is
treating Wonderland's 1200 greyhounds, rejected a request from a Herald
reporter to enter the compound, located in an industrial section of Lynn.
Zerbel said even casual human contact with the infected dogs could spread
the killer illness beyond the hot zone. "Just down the street, we have a
pet store, many animal hospitals," Zerbel said. "We want to assume it could
be easily spread."
As vets battle the epidemic, state officials are now scrambling to nail
down exactly what is killing the dogs -- and to prove whether it is linked
to the flu-like killer that has affected an estimated 10 000 dogs
nationwide. These include a few hundred domestic dogs as well.
And the federal CDC may help in that research, with plans to request a
tissue sample from some of the dead Massachusetts dogs, Donis said. This
summer, the CDC also plans to begin testing the blood of track workers in
other states -- the 1st step in determining whether the canine flu may have
already leaped to humans.
A sliver of good news: The mystery dog flu appears not to be the kind of
killer that some scientists have seen in the so-called "avian influenza" --
a canine malady that has infected and killed people in Asia. Donis said the
illness sweeping through greyhound populations appears to be milder. That
said, flu, right after it jumps to a new species, can prove unpredictably
virulent. The 1918 influenza epidemic eventually lost its killer status,
but not before millions died in the few years after its outbreak, Donis said.
