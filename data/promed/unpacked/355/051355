Central African Republic: Diarrhea epidemic in north confirmed
-------------------------------
The Pasteur Institute in the Central African Republic capital, Bangui, has
confirmed an epidemic of diarrhea in the northwest of the country, where at
least 40 people died in late September 2003, an official said on Wed, 15
Oct 2003.
"Of the 24 tests we carried out, 15 revealed the presence of _Shigella
dysenteriae_" Dr Antoine Talarmin, the director of the Pasteur Institute,
told IRIN [Integrated Regional Information Networks, an initiative of the
United Nations].
The institute's laboratory technicians and officials of Medicos sin
Fronteras (MSF-Spain) and Cooperazione Internazionale (COOPI), inspected
the villages of Gouze, Lemouna, and Pende from 3 to 8 Oct 2003 and
identified the disease. The villages are near Bozoum, a town 384 km
northwest of Bangui.
"Undoubtedly, there is an epidemic as all those who tested positive had
the same pathogen," Talarmin said.
Public consumption of unclean water was, he said, the cause of the
epidemic. The institute is still testing well waters to determine which
need to be purified.
Talarmin said the disease had proven resistant to cheap antibiotic drugs
such as bactrim and ampicillin, thus necessitating the use of the stronger
but more expensive drug ciprofloxacin.
The MSF representative, Ignasi Soler, told IRIN on Wednesday that the NGO
had already supplied local health centers with ciprofloxacin and that
treatment had started. He said a MSF team was due to inspect the affected
villages on Thu, 16 Oct 2003 and deliver more drugs.
The north has been receiving drugs from the EC Humanitarian Office through
COOPI since June. The COOPI representative in the CAR, Massimiliano
Pedretti, said that during the 2nd half of September 2003, his agency's
supported health centers in the affected villages had registered 300 of
patients complaining of diarrhea.
Several cases of water-borne diseases have been reported nationwide since
the state water utility, the Societe de Distribution des Eaux en
Centrafrique, suspended supplies in October 2002. However, clean water
supplies have been restored in Bozoum and its surrounding areas since Oct
2003, which could help halt the spread of diarrhea.

[ProMED does not receive many reports from CAR. Clearly an inadequate
supply of potable water remains a major issue in outbreaks of shigellosis,
either in peacetime or wartime, flood or famine, or under normal
conditions. - Mod.LL]
