Vietnam: Surge in Dengue Fever Cases in Southern Mekong Delta
--------------------------------------------------------------
Southern Vietnam recorded twice the number of dengue fever cases in the
first 2 months of the year, as during the same period in 2002. An official
from the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City says, of the 2611 reported
cases, 7 people died from the fever.
The institute is setting up a hotline between hospitals in the region to
improve co-operation in diagnosing and treating cases. The worst affected
provinces were in the southern Mekong Delta region, where moist and humid
conditions provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Health experts say major outbreaks of the disease, which first appeared in
Vietnam in 1969, tend to occur every 4 or 5 years.

Australia; Third Case of Dengue Fever in Townsville, North Queensland
--------------------------------------------------
Townsville district's third dengue fever case in a week was confirmed
yesterday as council checks raised concerns on the number of mosquito
breeding sites at city homes. Townsville City Council environmental
services committee chairwoman Ann Bunnell said checks around Aitkenvale and
Gulliver were uncovering breeding _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes (potential
dengue fever carriers), other breeding mosquitoes and receptacles holding
water. The council believed residents were still complacent about dengue fever.
While Townsville district's third case of dengue was confirmed yesterday
afternoon, Cairns remains in the grip of an outbreak with 235 confirmed
cases. A Tropical Public Health Unit spokeswoman said the third North
Queensland case, only known to be "outside Townsville", was not locally
acquired. It was said to have been acquired in affected Cairns suburb
Parramatta Park. 2 other cases, from Aitkenvale and Gulliver, were
confirmed early last week. They too were acquired from Cairns, in the
suburb of Cairns North.
Townsville City Council and Queensland Health environmental health officers
have been working to eradicate Townsville breeding sites for the
dengue-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the suburbs where the patients
resided. 2 houses, one each in Aitkenvale and Gulliver, have been found to
be harbouring dengue mosquitoes. Cr Bunnell said about 9 homes still needed
to be inspected in Gulliver. "Staff are still finding a lot of water lying
around and other dishes and containers lying around that have the potential
to allow dengue fever mosquitoes to breed," Cr Bunnell said. "We are very
concerned because it's in serious proportions in Far North Queensland.
Dengue is totally preventable."
