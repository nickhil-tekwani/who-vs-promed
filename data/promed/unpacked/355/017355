--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Children have to date borne a minimal medical burden in the global COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiological data from many countries show that children are a small minority of those who test positive. Children younger than 18 years have made up only 1.7% of national cases in the USA, /1 1% of cases in the Netherlands, /2 and 2.0% of a large observational cohort in the UK. /3 Whether these proportions reflect lower susceptibility among children versus adults, /4 or similar infection rates, but much higher proportions with asymptomatic disease, is unclear. /5 Studies from several countries have confirmed that severe illness and death due to COVID-19 among children are rare, /1, /6 with accurate estimates unavailable because of an absence of true population denominators. Attention has now shifted to the vulnerability of children for 2 reasons. First, the degree to which children transmit COVID-19 is key to how countries reopen communities after lockdown. Second, new concerns about a novel severe Kawasaki-like disease in children related to COVID-19, including Lucio Verdoni and colleagues' /7 description of an outbreak in Italy in The Lancet, change our understanding of this disease in children.

"Kawasaki disease is a rare acute paediatric vasculitis, with coronary artery aneurysms as its main complication. The diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent fever, exanthema, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection, and changes to the mucosae and extremities. /8, /9 Verdoni and colleagues describe 10 cases (7 boys, 3 girls; aged 7.5 years [SD 3.5]) of a Kawasaki-like disease occurring in Bergamo, Italy, at the peak of the pandemic in the country ([18 Feb 2020] to [20 Apr 2020]), a monthly incidence some 30-fold higher than observed for Kawasaki disease across the previous 5 years. Bergamo was the city with the highest rate of infections and deaths in Italy at that time. Within the cluster were 5 children who had features similar to Kawasaki disease (that is, non-purulent conjunctivitis, polymorphic rash, mucosal changes, and swollen extremities); however, another 5 children presented with fewer than 3 of the diagnostic clinical signs and were older than patients with classic Kawasaki disease. There was also a high proportion of shock, with 5 of 10 children presenting with hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation, and 2 of 10 children needing inotropic support. 2 of 10 children had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR swab and 8 of 10 had a SARS-CoV-2-positive serology test; however, these tests were not done contemporaneously with the episode, so the clinical relevance is unclear. The majority of patients with Kawasaki disease respond well to intravenous immunoglobulin; however, 10-20% require additional anti-inflammatory treatment. /9 In this cohort, 8 of 10 children received high-dose corticosteroids in addition to intravenous immunoglobulin. These differences raise the question as to whether this cluster is Kawasaki disease with SARS-CoV-2 as the triggering agent, or represents an emerging Kawasaki-like disease characterised by multisystem inflammation. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based on clinical and laboratory criteria and is hindered by the lack of a diagnostic test. Understanding the pathophysiology of this emerging phenomenon might provide welcome insights into our understanding of Kawasaki disease.

"Anecdotally, clinicians across Europe have identified clusters of similar cases. In the UK, paediatricians have identified a small group of children presenting with shock and a multisystem inflammation to critical care units, some of whom have coronary artery aneurysms, and a further group of less severely ill children with a Kawasaki-like disease, who respond to a variety of immunomodulatory treatments, including intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and biologics such as infliximab and anakinra (Whittaker E, unpublished). Long-term echocardiogram data on coronary artery aneurysms are pending. In response to this cluster in London, UK, we notified the National Health Service of the emergence of an unusual disorder, and an alert was issued on [25 Apr 2020]. On the basis of the review of clinical and laboratory features, a case definition of the syndrome we have provisionally called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) was formulated by experts in the UK and published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. /10 Correspondence /11 in The Lancet on [7 May 2020], describing 9 children with PIMS-TS requiring critical care in south London highlights the severe end of the spectrum of this disease.

"The recognition of this disease late in the 1st pandemic wave might relate to its rarity and the difficulty of recognising uncommon syndromes in fragmented health-care systems rapidly reorganising to deal with a pandemic. Alternatively, it might reflect a mechanism for PIMS-TS. Alternatively, it suggests that the mechanism for the Kawasaki-like disease described here and PIMS-TS might represent post-infectious inflammatory syndrome, which might be antibody or immune-complex mediated, particularly because in this Italian cohort there was little evidence of viral replication. For prospective studies, measuring antibody at the time of presentation, as well as consenting patients for appropriate research samples, will be essential to elucidate the mechanism of this syndrome.

"Although the article suggests a possible emerging inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, it is crucial to reiterate -- for parents and health-care workers alike -- that children remain minimally affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection overall. Understanding this inflammatory phenomenon in children might provide vital information about immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and possible correlates of immune protection that might have relevance both for adults and children. In particular, if this is an antibody-mediated phenomenon, there might be implications for vaccine studies, and this might also explain why some children become very ill with COVID-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic.

"In the UK, a British Paediatric Surveillance Unit study has been rapidly opened to explore the extent of PIMS-TS nationally. 2 COVID-19 priority studies in the UK (DIAMONDS [Central Portfolio Management System 45537] and ISARIC [UK Clinical Research Network 14152]) are collaborating to ensure that every child with this emerging syndrome has the opportunity to consent to take part in a study exploring mechanisms. International discussions are underway to facilitate standardised approaches to the investigation and management of these children, including treatment strategies to prevent long-term adverse outcomes such as coronary artery aneurysms.

Lancet. 2020 May 13. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31103-X; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31103-X/fulltext

"Summary
--------
"Background
"The Bergamo province [Italy], which is extensively affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, is a natural observatory of virus manifestations in the general population. In the past month, we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

"Methods
"All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki-like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively.

"Findings
"Group 1 comprised 19 patients (7 boys, 12 girls; aged 3.0 years [SD 2.5]) diagnosed between [1 Jan 2015 and 17 Feb 2020]. Group 2 included 10 patients (7 boys, 3 girls; aged 7.5 years [SD 3.5]) diagnosed between [18 Feb and 20 Apr 2020]; 8 of 10 were positive for IgG or IgM, or both. The 2 groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 vs group 2, 0.3 vs 10 per month), mean age (3.0 vs 7.5 years), cardiac involvement (2 of 19 vs 6 of 10), KDSS (0 of 19 vs 5 of 10), MAS (0 of 19 vs 5 of 10), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (3 of 19 vs 8 of 10; all p less than 0.01).

"Interpretation
"In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic."

[This article adds to the growing body of reports associating COVID-19 with a pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (see the next article below). The accompanying comment is on target with respect to querying the delayed recognition of this syndrome. It will be interesting to see the results of retrospective looks for this syndrome going back to March and April 2020 in countries as the cumulative case counts rose. - Mod.MPP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Background
"Acute clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.

"Methods
"We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between [27 Apr 2020] and [7 May 2020], in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since [1 Jan 2018], based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression.

"Results
"A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p less than 0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. 11 patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 14 patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation.

"Conclusions
"The ongoing outbreak of KD in Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS, and African ancestry."

[This descriptive study joins other studies and reports documenting a real increase in a Kawasaki-like disease coincident with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The identification of a 13-fold increase in incidence of the Kawasaki-like disease during the 2 week period in the middle of high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in France, when compared with the incidence of the disease during the period 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019, is impressive.

One of the conclusions of the authors re: a higher prevalence of disease in children of sub-Saharan or Caribbean ancestry leaves room for further clarification. For one thing, the study hospital is a large public hospital and there may well be an increase of Kawasaki-like disease in other private hospitals that cater to the more affluent population. The study does not address the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may be increased among this population due to family inability to observe social distancing or work in jobs that do not require their presence. Hence, there may be confounding variables behind the apparent ethnic disparity.

While it will be interesting to see the final post-peer review article, this preliminary article adds to the literature base of circumstantial evidence supporting the association of this disease with COVID-19 in the pediatric population. - Mod.MPP

Rapid risk assessment: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome and SARS -CoV-2 infection in children
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several countries affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic recently reported cases of children that were hospitalised in intensive care due to a rare paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). The presenting signs and symptoms are a mix of the ones for Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and are characterised, among others, by fever, abdominal pain, and cardiac involvement. A possible temporal association with SARS-COV-2 infection has been hypothesised because some of the children that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection were either positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology.

Executive summary
-----------------
In total, about 230 suspected cases of this new paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) have been reported in EU/EEA countries and the UK in 2020, including 2 fatalities, one in the UK and one in France. These cases are being further investigated. So far, epidemiological studies have shown that children appear to be less affected by COVID-19. Only 2.1% of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) were in the age group between 0 and 14 years of age.

To date, an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this new clinical entity of multisystem inflammation has not yet been established, although an association appears plausible. At current, the risk is assessed as follows:

- The overall risk of COVID-19 in children in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered low, based on a low probability of COVID-19 in children and a moderate impact of such disease.

- The overall risk of PIMS-TS in children in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered low, based on a very low probability of PIMS-TS in children and a high impact of such disease.

While the clinical management of these children has absolute priority, data collection from EU/EEA Member States and the UK would strengthen the body of knowledge for this rare condition and allow for a better analysis of these cases. An analysis of surveillance data could clarify the incidence of KD/PIMS and identify the most affected age groups and risk factors for both conditions.

ECDC has agreed with the EU/EAA Member States and the UK to include PIMS as a possible complication to be reported for EU-level COVID-19 surveillance. Research efforts should aim at a) determining the role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of PIMS-TS and b) answering other significant remaining questions.

Risk communication is needed to raise awareness in the medical community about PIMS-TS and inform parents and caregivers about signs and symptoms. The importance of timely contact with a healthcare worker should be stressed. Risk communication should emphasise that PIMS-TS is a rare condition and that its potential link with COVID-19 is neither established nor well understood.

"Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"PIMS-TS symptoms
"PIMS-TS cases presented with signs and symptoms similar to atypical KD and TSS. All children had prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal symptoms (50-60%) as well as conjunctivitis, rash, irritability, and in some cases, shock, usually of myocardial origin. However, some respiratory symptoms could be present, and dyspnoea was usually correlated with concurrent shock.

"Some children were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, while others were positive for IgG antibodies. COVID-19 history or COVID-19-compatible symptoms could be either elicited in the history of the child or a household member. Markers of inflammation were elevated: neutrophilia with lymphopenia, significantly increased C-reactive protein, D-dimer, IL-6 and ferritin levels, and hypoalbuminaemia.

"Coinfection with other pathogens has been investigated, and in a few cases, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) or other pathogens have been detected (personal communication from the WHO COVID-19 Clinical Network Knowledge Exchange, see also Table 1) [6,53]."

"Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PIMS
--------------------------------------------------
Table 3. Available evidence on causality of association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PIMS, according to Bradford Hill [67]."

The table is worth looking at: it looks at 9 criteria (strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, analogy) and concludes: "After assessing the evidence and rating it (limited to substantial), only 5 out of 9 criteria would support a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of PIMS-TS. Future clinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies may elucidate the biological determinants of this syndrome and further explore the evidence supporting these causality criteria."

"Risk assessment
----------------
"Risk of PIMS-TS in children in the EU/EEA and the UK
A causal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PIMS-TS has not been proven, and several unknowns limit our ability to accurately assess this risk. However, it is hypothesised that PIMS-TS, seen as a dysregulation of the immune response to a pathogen, may occur as a late reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The simultaneous occurrence of reported PIMS-TS cases and children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 would support this hypothesis. It has to be noted, however, that only a relatively small number of children has been reported with PIMS-TS compared with the large overall number of children with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"The cases of PIMS-TS detected so far have been rather severe. It is possible that this relatively small number of cases represents the more severe end of the spectrum of a post-infectious syndrome that has not been fully recognised. As the onset of symptoms of PIMS-TS is estimated to be 2-4 weeks post COVID-19 infection [9, 53], and as primary care services are gradually operating in a more regular mode, more cases of PIMS-TS may be detected to provide us with a more complete picture of this phenomenon.

"As of 11 May 2020, 5 fatalities in PIMS-TS cases have been reported (one in France, one in the UK, 3 in the US) [6,53]. Long-term outcome and possible sequelae are overall unknown, but since a number of children present with myocardial involvement (either myocarditis or coronary artery abnormalities), long-term follow up is warranted.

"In summary, the probability of PIMS-TS in children in the EU/EEA is currently assessed as very low, and the impact of PIMS-TS is assessed as high, therefore the overall risk of COVID-19-associated PIMS-TS in children is assessed as low risk."

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -- CDCHAN-00432
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing 1) background information on several cases of a recently reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and 2) a case definition for this syndrome. CDC recommends healthcare providers report any patient who meets the case definition to local, state, and territorial health departments to enhance knowledge of risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of this syndrome.

Background
----------
On [26 Apr 2020], clinicians in the United Kingdom (UK) recognized increased reports of previously healthy children presenting with a severe inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki disease-like features. /1 The cases occurred in children testing positive for current or recent infection by SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serologic assay, or who had an epidemiologic link to a COVID-19 case. Patients presented with persistent fever and a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan (such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, and neurologic) involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. /2 Respiratory symptoms were not present in all cases.

A total of 8 cases, including one death, from the UK, were described in a recent publication. /3 In the limited sample of 8 children, it was reported that 75% of the patients were of Afro-Caribbean descent and 62.5% were male. The report also indicated that all 8 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through antibody testing, including the patient that died. /3

During March and April [2020], cases of COVID-19 rapidly increased in New York City and New York State. In early May 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received reports of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. From [16 Apr through 4 May 2020], 15 patients aged 2-15 years were hospitalized, many requiring admission to the intensive care unit. As of [12 May 2020], the New York State Department of Health identified 102 patients (including patients from New York City) with similar presentations, many of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serologic assay. New York State and New York City continue to receive additional reports of suspected cases.

Additional reports of children presenting with severe inflammatory syndrome with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 or an epidemiological link to a COVID-19 case have been reported by authorities in other countries. /4

It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.

There is limited information currently available about risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment for MIS-C. CDC is requesting healthcare providers report suspected cases to public health authorities to better characterize this newly recognized condition in the pediatric population.

Recommendations
---------------
Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department.

For additional information, please contact CDC's 24-hour Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100...

Case definition for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An individual aged less than 21 years presenting with fever*, laboratory evidence of inflammation**, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem (2 or more) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, or neurological); AND
- No alternative plausible diagnoses; AND
- Positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test; or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms

*Fever greater than 38.0 deg C [100.4 deg F] for 24 hours or longer, or report of subjective fever lasting 24 hours or longer
** including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), or interleukin 6 (IL-6), elevated neutrophils, reduced lymphocytes, and low albumin

Additional comments
-------------------
Some individuals may fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease but should be reported if they meet the case definition for MIS-C
Consider MIS-C in any pediatric death with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Overview & stats
----------------
Children have been significantly less affected by COVID-19, as only 1 percent of New Yorkers who have been hospitalized were under 20 years old.

However, the State Department of Health is investigating 130 reported cases and 3 deaths in New York of children -- predominantly school-aged -- experiencing symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome, possibly due to COVID-19.

Of the children displaying these symptoms, 90 percent tested positive for COVID-19 either by diagnostic, antibody testing or both.

Age of Cases (updated 17 May 2020)

Age / Percent of cases
less than 1 year / 6%
1-4 years / 20%
5-9 years / 27%
10-14 years / 27%
15-19 years / 14%
20-21 years / 5%

Race and ethnicity of cases (updated 14 May 2020)
Race / Percent of cases
White / 23%
Black / 29%
Other / 18%
Asian / 2%
Unknown / 28%

Ethnicity / Percent of cases
Not Hispanic / 42%
Hispanic/Latino / 35%
Unknown / 23%

Symptoms
--------
Though most children who get COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms, this inflammatory syndrome has features which overlap with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome and may occur days to weeks after acute COVID-19 illness.

New Yorkers should seek immediate care if a child has:
- Prolonged fever (more than 5 days)
- Difficulty feeding (infants) or is too sick to drink fluids
- Severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting
- Change in skin color -- becoming pale, patchy, and/or blue
- Trouble breathing or is breathing very quickly
- Racing heart or chest pain
- Decreased amount of frequency in urine
- Lethargy, irritability, or confusion

Early recognition by pediatricians and referral to a specialist including to critical care is essential.

Information for healthcare providers
------------------------------------
Advisory
At the Governor's direction, the State Department of Health issued an advisory about this serious inflammatory disease, called "pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19," to inform healthcare providers of the condition, as well as to provide guidance for testing and reporting.

Healthcare providers, including hospitals, are required to report to the Department of Health all cases of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with COVID-19 in those under 21 years of age.

Updated Advisory 5/13
The Department of Health issued an updated health advisory establishing an interim case definition for the pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome. Case definitions are important because they provide a new name to a syndrome and a definition of what symptoms healthcare providers should look for. Case definitions help standardize tracking and reporting and can help ensure a better health outcome.

Webinar
On [14 May 2020], the State Department of Health hosted a statewide webinar for all healthcare providers to discuss the symptoms, testing, and care of reported inflammatory disease in children related to COVID-19. The recording is available at https://totalwebcasting.com/view/?func=VOFF&id=nysdoh&date=2020-05-14&seq=1.

Response efforts
----------------
New York State is leading the national effort to find out more about this illness related to COVID-19 in children:

Clearly we are in a "seek and ye shall find" mode looking for more cases of this pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PMIS-TS) in Europe, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the USA. Presumably WHO will offer a name for this syndrome that can be agreed upon internationally.

As pediatricians are looking in multiple countries and multiple states in the USA, more cases are being identified. Remembering that more severe cases/presentations are often the 1st signal of a newly identified disease or syndrome, it is quite possible that as hospital records are being reviewed and pediatricians are checking their case records, a wider spectrum of syndrome presentation will be identified with milder presentations as well as the more severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome presentation currently being identified. - Mod.MPP]
