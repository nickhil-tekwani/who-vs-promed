For the 1st time, African swine fever [ASF] has also hopped onto a large domestic pig farm in Western Poland, affecting over 23 700 pigs. It is the largest affected pig farm since Poland started reporting ASF outbreaks in 2014.

The outbreak was discovered on 18 Mar 2020, and the confirmation was given on Sat 21 Mar 2020, according to the German agricultural title Top Agrar [https://www.topagrar.com/schwein/news/erster-asp-fall-bei-hausschweinen-in-polen-12005773.html]. The report has already been filed in the European Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) and has also been confirmed by the Polish Central Veterinary Inspectorate.

The breeding farm is located near the village of Niedoradz, Lubusz province, 66 km as the crow flies from the border with Germany. The farm had 23 746 animals on-site, of which 6904 were sows, 16 037 pre-weaning piglets, 776 weaner pigs, and 29 boars. Roughly 135 pigs died of the virus, according to Top Agrar. Obviously, the authorities moved to cull the entire farm's pig population, and protection zones have been created around the farm.

It is not a surprise that the 1st affected pig farm is around Niedoradz. In recent weeks more than once, dead wild boar were found in the vicinity of the village's pig farm houses.

The virus has been circulating in 5 provinces in Eastern Poland since 2014. In those areas, new outbreaks continue to be found as well. So far, in Eastern Poland, 237 (backyard) farms are known to have been infected. The largest affected farm in Eastern Poland had 9400 animals on-site.

In Western Poland -- an entirely different area of Poland, as can be seen on the map [at the source URL] -- the virus has been in the wild boar population since November 2019. Since then, the virus has been confirmed in wild boar carcasses in 502 locations. The outbreak zone stretches out into 3 provinces, being Lubusz (413 outbreak locations), Greater Poland (84) and Lower Silesia (5). The carcass found closest to Germany was found in mid-January 2020, at a distance of 13 km from the German border.

In total, in March 2020, ASF-infected [wild boar] carcasses have now been found in 143 locations in Western Poland, exactly as many as in the whole month of February 2020.

It is difficult to gauge at this time how many wild boar have died because of ASF in Western Poland, because one finding place can relate to one affected carcass as well as 10 simultaneously. This type of information will only be shared later by the authorities.
