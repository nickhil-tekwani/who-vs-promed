A Colorado baby is recovering from a rare disease. The 5-month-old has infant botulism, which can be life threatening. The good news is that the infant is getting better every day, although she is still on a breathing machine.

The baby's uncle contacted CBS4 last week. He said that back on 1 Jan 2013, she wasn't eating as normal, and she seemed very tired. Her mother took the infant to the pediatrician. He sent them to the emergency room. There, the infant stopped breathing, was incubated and then airlifted to the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children.

A pediatric neurologist was the 1st to suspect infant botulism, a rare but very serious disease. The treatment, botulism immune globulin, had to be flown in from California. The infant has been improving since she started the medication on 4 Jan 2013. She is still on a breathing machine but is expected to make a full recovery.

The CDC reported 85 cases in 2010 and 84 in 2009.

The family wants people to know that the infant could have gotten sick from indirect contact with honey or possibly exposure to dirt and dust at a home under renovation. Both may contain [spores of] the bacteria. They want parents to be aware of the danger and to never feed honey or corn syrup to infants under one year old.

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the USA. In many cases, the source of the spores is not found, although honey has been a common vehicle. Babies being breastfed as the only source of food may also develop the illness.

A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial note with references removed from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified." http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5202a1.htm. - Mod.LL
