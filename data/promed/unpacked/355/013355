More than 100 people are believed dead from a malaria outbreak in the
Poroma area of Papua New Guineas (PNG) Southern Highlands, reports
Post Courier.

According to sources, the epidemic, which started last December
[2008], killed many people and resulted in an all out war on the
mosquitoes by the division of health in the province.

[Multi-drug resistant malaria is well known in Papua New Guinea (PNG)
(Karyana et al. Malaria morbidity in Papua Indonesia, an area with
multidrug resistant _Plasmodium vivax_ and _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Malar J. 2008; 7: 148). A complex picture of multidrug resistance in
both _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ has recently been demonstrated in
a study of 482 children with _P. falciparum_ and 195 with _P. vivax_
in PNG, where the highest cure rate of 95.2 percent in _P.
falciparum_ infections were obtained by artemether-lumefantrine, and
the highest cure rate of 88 percent in _P. vivax_ infections were
obtained by dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Karunajeewa et al. A
trial of combination antimalarial therapies in children from Papua
New Guinea. NEJM 2008;359:2545-57, with comments in NEJM
2008;359:2601-3 and NEJM 2009;360:1254, with authors reply 1255).

The 1st chloroquine resistant isolates of _P. vivax_ were reported
from Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea in 1989 (Rieckmann et al.
_Plasmodium vivax_ resistance to chloroquine. Lancet 1989;2:1183-4;
Baird et al. Resistance to chloroquine by _Plasmodium vivax_ in Irian
Jaya, Indonesia. Am J Trop Med Hyg 1991;44:547-52). A clinical trial
in southern PNG in 2004, found a risk of failure within 28 days of 65
percent after chloroquine monotherapy for _P. vivax_ and 48 percent
after chloroquine plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for _P. falciparum_
(Ratcliff et al. Therapeutic response of multidrug-resistant
_Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ to chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in southern Papua, Indonesia. Trans R Soc
Trop Med Hyg 2007;101:351-9). A recent study has highlighted that
multidrug-resistant _P. vivax_ in PNG is associated with severe
malaria and even death (Tjitra et al. Multidrug-resistant _Plasmodium
vivax_ associated with severe and fatal malaria: A prospective study
in Papua, Indonesia. PLoS Med 2008;5:e128).
