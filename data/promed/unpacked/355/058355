Young boy tests positive for bird flu
-------------------------------------
A 4-year-old Egyptian boy has tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu
virus, becoming the 37th human case in the Arab country, the official
Middle East News Agency [MENA] reported on Saturday [23 Jun 2007]. It
quoted a health ministry statement identifying the boy as an
inhabitant of the Upper Egyptian province of Qena.
He was admitted to hospital in Qena on Thursday [21 Jun 2007]
suffering high fever after being exposed to birds suspected of having
bird flu, MENA quoted the ministry as saying. He was taken to a
hospital in the capital Cairo and is in a stable condition. A total
of 15 of Egypt's bird flu cases have proven fatal.
This patient is the 3rd human bird flu case from Qena over the past
month after a lull of nearly 2 months. Egyptian officials had said
they expected the virus to lie low during the hot summer, following
the pattern it set last year after the initial outbreak in February 2006.
Bird flu did extensive damage to the country's poultry industry and
the economy as a whole after its arrival in Egypt, which has more
confirmed bird flu cases among humans than any other country outside
of Asia. Most of those who have fallen ill in Egypt were reported to
have had contact with sick or dead household birds, primarily in
northern Egypt where the weather is cooler than in the south.
Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated. The government still finds it
hard to enforce restrictions on the movement and sale of live poultry.

Sumatran girl tests positive for bird flu in Indonesia
------------------------------------------------------
A hospitalized Indonesian girl has tested positive for the virulent
H5N1 bird flu virus after coming into contact with sick chickens, a
health official said on Sat 23 Jun 2007. The 3-year-old girl is being
treated at a hospital in Pekanbaru, the provincial capital of Riau on
Sumatra island, said Nyoman Kandun, a senior Health Ministry official.
The girl, who had contact with dead chickens, is the 101st confirmed
human case of bird flu in Indonesia, Kandun said. Of those, 80 have died.
Since 2003, bird flu has killed at least 191 people worldwide, more
than 40 percent of them in Indonesia, according to the World Health
Organization.
