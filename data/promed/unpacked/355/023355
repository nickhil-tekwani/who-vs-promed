Recombinant Noroviruses Responsible for Recent Outbreaks in New South Wales
--------------------------------------------------
New mutant viruses responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks in New
South Wales in recent times have been identified by research
published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US
Centers for Disease Control [see below and: Norovirus Recombination
in ORF1/ORF2 Overlap, R.A. Bull et al.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1273.htm> or

Known as recombinant noroviruses, they are thought to be one of the
reasons for a 5-fold increase in infectious gastroenteritis cases in
the period 2000 - 2003 (see Table 1, p2, in NSW Public Health
Bulletin, 2004: 15(9-10) 157-167
<http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/public-health/phb/HTML2004/septoct04html/table1p160.htm>
.

Noroviruses cause up to 90 per cent of infectious gastroenteritis
cases globally each year.

Last year -- 2004 -- there were well over 10 000 NSW cases of
infectious gastroenteritis. Outbreaks in recent years were reported
at a Sydney children's hospital (February 2002), a Sydney aged care
facility (September, 2002), a Picton aged care facility (July 2003)
and in Wagga Wagga (October 2003).

Viral gastroenteritis is a common infection of the stomach and
intestines that results in vomiting and diarrhoea. Other symptoms can
include nausea, fever, abdominal pain, headache and muscle aches.
Non-viral causes of gastroenteritis include bacteria, toxins,
parasites and some non-infectious diseases.

Spread by air, water and personal contact, noroviruses are highly
contagious and can survive in food, water and the environment for
long periods, according to University of New South Wales virologist,
Dr Peter White, one of the research authors.

"An inoculum of as few as 10 viral particles is enough to infect an
individual," says Dr White. "The virus can be spread by
person-to-person contact, for example shaking hands with someone who
has been sick and has the virus on their hands. It can also be picked
up from contaminated surfaces, food or drink, and it's possible that
infection can spread through aerosol particles when people vomit," he
says.

The research team made 4 new findings:
- they "genetically fingerprinted" 10 main types of mutant (or
recombinant) norovirus from among hundreds of known varieties of
noroviruses from around the world.
- they isolated 4 of these main types in the greater Sydney region.
- 2 of the main types found in Sydney are new forms of the virus
never identified before.
- they located the "break-point" within the viruses' genetic code
where the viruses mutated by swapping part of their genome.

"Viral recombination refers to a virus's ability to swap parts of it
genetic material with another related virus," says the study's lead
author and UNSW PhD candidate, Ms Rowena Bull. "This can happen when
a person is infected with 2 forms of the norovirus at once. It's how
viruses create diversity in their genome and gives them a better
chance of spreading and surviving in different host environments," Ms
Bull says.

The genetic diversity of noroviruses is now known to be much greater
than was thought when the 1st strain was discovered some 30 years
ago. According to the US Canters for Disease Control and Prevention,
the known host range of noroviruses is also greater than previously
thought with novel strains recently identified in mice, cows, pigs
and humans.

Public health experts have been puzzled by the periodic emergence of
new strains of the norovirus, which causes rapid-fire outbreaks of
gastroenteritis across the globe before suddenly vanishing again.
Outbreak of viral gastroenteritis increase in winter and are common
in families and group settings including nursing homes, hospitals,
childcare centres and schools, according to the NSW Health Department.

Recent evidence suggests that susceptibility to infection might be
genetically determined, with people of O blood group being at
greatest risk for severe infection. Noroviruses are named after the
original strain "Norwalk virus," which caused an outbreak of
gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968.

[The reference for the paper cited above and the abstract are the
following: Norovirus Recombination in ORF1/ORF2 Overlap. By Rowena A.
Bull and 5 others at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, New
South Wales, Australia, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan and the
Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.

Abstract:
"Norovirus (NoV) genogroups I and II (GI and GII) are now recognized
as the predominant worldwide cause of outbreaks of acute
gastroenteritis in humans. 3 recombinant NoV GII isolates were
identified and characterized, 2 of which are unrelated to any
previously published recombinant NoV. Using data from the current
study, published sequences, database searches, and molecular
techniques, we identified 23 recombinant NoV GII and 1 recombinant
NoV GI isolates. Analysis of the genetic relationships among the
recombinant NoV GII isolates identified 9 independent recombinant
sequences; the other 14 strains were close relatives. 2 of the 9
independent recombinant NoV were closely related to other
recombinants only in the polymerase region, and in a similar fashion
one recombinant NoV was closely related to another only in the capsid
region. Breakpoint analysis of recombinant NoV showed that
recombination occurred in the open reading frame (ORF)1/ORF2 overlap.
We provide evidence to !
support the theory of the role of subgenomic RNA promoters as
recombination hotspots and describe a simple mechanism of how
recombination might occur in NoV."
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/pdfs/04-1273.pdf>.

The aims of this study were to characterize and compare 3 recombinant
NoV sequences isolated in Sydney with other published recombinant NoV
and those identified through database searches and phylogenetic
analysis. The genetic relationship among all identified recombinants
was explored and the recombination breakpoint accurately determined.
A model of NoV recombination is proposed.

The authors also concluded that decline in the prevalence of
previously dominant strains, such as US-95/96 in the United States
and Australia, suggests immunity in the community might be an
important factor in reducing further spread of NoV. Recombination
offers NoV an attractive mechanism for immune evasion. Subgenomic RNA
promoters have been proposed to be recombination hotspots. - Mod.CP]

Hungary: New Variant and Recombinant Noroviruses in the etiology of
gastroenteritis
--------------------------------------------------
The following in the Abstract of a paper authored by Reuter G,
Krisztalovics K, Vennema H, Koopmans M, and Szucs G, of the Regional
Laboratory of Virology, ANTSZ Baranya County Institute of State
Public Health Service, Pecs, Hungary, which records the predominant
role of new norovirus variants and recombinant noroviruses in the
etiology of gastroenteritis in Hungary.

"Between Jan 2001 and Dec 2003, stool specimens from 262 (45 percent)
of 581 reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis were investigated for
noroviruses in Hungary. Specimens collected from outbreaks of
non-bacterial gastroenteritis were examined by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction and enzyme immunoassay. In 253 (97 percent)
of 262 outbreaks, norovirus was detected and confirmed by sequencing
in 211 (81 percent). Hospitals (35 percent), day care centers (30
percent), and elderly homes (27 percent) were the most common
settings. Diversity and frequency of the genotypes changed over time
but with predominance (95 percent) of genogroup (GG) II strains.
Strains grouped into 11 genotypes including an epidemic spread of
new-variant GGII4 (Lordsdale virus) and a recently emerged group of
natural recombinant strains (GGIIb/Hilversum polymerase) with 4
capsid types (Hawaii, Mexico, Snow Mountain, and Lordsdale). Clusters
of epidemics including food-borne outbreaks were detected.

[The noroviruses (and to a lesser degree the sapporoviruses) are now
recognized to be the predominant cause of self-limited epidemic
gastroenteritis in humans. The noroviruses and the sapporoviruses are
small single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses constituting the
genera _Norovirus_ and _Sapporovirus_, respectively, of the family
_Caliciviridae_. These 2 reports record the presence of genetic
recombinants among noroviruses isolated from clinical material.
Genetic recombination, first described for poliovirus and
foot-and-mouth disease virus, is probably an attribute of all small
positive-sense RNA viruses maintaining genetic diversity. The
detection of recombinants in the unrelated outbreaks described above
suggests that genetic recombination may play a role in the etiology
of epidemic gastroenteritis, possibly contributing to evasion of the
immune response. - Mod.CP]
