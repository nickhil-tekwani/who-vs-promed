"HPAI H5N6 viruses 1st emerged in China in 2013 and have been reported by several Asian countries. The Asian lineage H5N6 causes severe clinical signs in poultry and associated mortality. The outbreaks in these countries have led to significant destruction of poultry for control measures by the veterinary authorities. This group of H5N6 viruses has also been associated with human infection, including a number of deaths. A total of 19 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A (H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014.

"In 2017-2018, a new variant strain of HPAI H5N6 emerged, and these outbreaks are ongoing in Asia and Europe. These viruses are different from the H5N6 viruses associated with the human infections in China. Detection of this new strain of H5N6 virus in migratory bird species poses a potential threat for the dissemination of this virus by wild birds within and outside Asia and Europe." - Mod.CRD
