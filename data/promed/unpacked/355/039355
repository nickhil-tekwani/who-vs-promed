Quarantine of foot and mouth and anthrax disease in 16 villages in Kastamonu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease was detected in Aşağışehirören and Yukarışehirören villages of Taşköprü district of Kastamonu. With the occurrence of foot and mouth disease, Kastamonu Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry teams banned entrance and exit to villages where the disease was detected. In addition, a quarantine radius of about 2 kilometers was imposed in Taşköprü's Aşağışehirören and Yukarışehirören villages. After the quarantine of the 2 villages, the Taşköprü Livestock Market was closed until further notice as a precaution.

Anthrax disease has also been detected in 14 villages in the Kuzyaka region of Kastamonu. With the appearance of the disease, Kastamonu Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry and Kastamonu Veterinarian Chamber Presidency teams quarantined 14 villages in the Kuzyaka region and banned entry and exit.

Since anthrax is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, especially affecting the lungs and skin, Kastamonu Provincial Health Directorate teams also carried out filiation studies [contact studies]. Filiation teams traveling from house to house followed the citizens who were in contact or showed signs of illness and ensured their treatment.

After the measures were taken in the Kuzyaka region, the quarantine was lifted with the disease's effect gone.

[This province is in the centre of the country's northern border and the Black Sea. Kastamonu is the capital district of the Kastamonu Province, Turkey. According to the 2000 census, the population of the district is 102 059 of which 64 606 live in the urban center of Kastamonu. (Population of the urban center in 2010 is 91 012) The district covers an area of 1834 km2 (708 sq mi), and the town lies at an elevation of 904 m (2966 ft). It is located to the south of the province. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastamonu)

Anthrax is sporadic in this region of Turkey. We have no prior reports of anthrax in this province. And by definition, no anthrax cases can or will occur in the fauna of the Black Sea. If the _B. anthracis_ recovered can be genotyped, it should give a useful lead on the original source of the anthrax outbreaks in the 14 villages' livestock. No vaccination of the livestock in these 14 villages is mentioned in these reports. Obviously, it is overdue and needs to be done as soon as possible if not sooner. And repeated for the next 3-4 years if they are not to suffer repeated outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ

Turkey, where FMD is endemic, is one of the 39 members of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EUFMD). FMD is endemic in Turkey; control is mainly performed by mass vaccinations. According to the commission's quarterly reports for 2022, 15 outbreaks of FMD have been recorded in the Anatolia region from January-March and 14 from April-June 2022. These were typed as O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2QOM-15. The country is included in FAO's "FMD pool 3" (West Eurasia and Middle East), characterised by the circulation of FMD serotypes O, A (most recent case, 2017) and Asia-1 (most recent case, 2015).

Since 2018, only serotype O has been reported from Turkey. To create herd immunity, vaccination of at least 80% of the total number of cattle in a province is carried out with vaccination campaigns held twice a year before and after pasture season. Cattle are included in the campaign throughout the country, while small ruminants are vaccinated only once a year in Thrace. Calves are vaccinated from 2 weeks or 2 months of age, depending on the vaccination status of their dams. A booster dose is administered one month later. During an epidemic, all ruminants in the outbreak area are given emergency vaccinations without waiting for the campaign period. Sap Institute, the national FMD reference laboratory and largest vaccine producer, updates the vaccine content by producing monovalent or multivalent vaccines according to the local strains in circulation. It will be interesting to note if the infected holdings in Kastamonu had been vaccinated and if their causative pathogen identified. - Mod.AS
