[Newcastle disease virus is categorized into 3 groups. The velogenic
strains are highly pathogenic and easily transmitted.
Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical state, and for a
varying but limited period during convalescence. It is present in exhaled
air, respiratory discharges, feces, eggs laid during clinical disease, and
all parts of the carcass during acute infection and at death.
Newcastle Disease virus can produce a transitory conjunctivitis in man, but
the condition has been limited primarily to laboratory workers and
vaccination teams exposed to large quantities of virus and, before
vaccination was widely practiced in crews eviscerating poultry in
processing plants. The disease has not been reported in people who raise
poultry or consume poultry products. - Mod.TG
