A total of 5 tribals of Kankadaamba village under Semiliguda block of the district [Koraput, Odisha] suffering from anthrax were admitted to different hospitals on [Sat 28 Mar 2015]. It is suspected that the tribals might have contracted the disease after feasting on cattle meat. Sources said about 20 families of the village had taken half-boiled cattle meat about a fortnight back.

On being informed, a medical team rushed to the village and found 5 persons suffering from the disease. The team shifted 3 persons to Kunduli PHC [Primary Health Centre] and 2 to District Headquarters Hospital.

Additional District Medical Officer (ADMO) AK Padhi said other villagers are also being examined and preventive drugs distributed among them.

A few days back, 3 tribals of neighbouring Nandapur block [see archive 20150316.3234549] were affected by anthrax and admitted to Koraput Government hospital.

[For a map of India showing Orissa/Odisha on the NE coast, go to http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. Koraput district is in the central hilly spine of the state; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Koraput.html, as is Semiliguda http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Similigurha.html and Nandapur; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Nandapur.html.

Nandapur is 21.5 km (13.4 mi) to the south west of Semiliguda, with a number of intervening villages. As there would appear to be a livestock anthrax problem in the area, it would seem wise to consider a proactive vaccination of all those village herds, and any others within 5-10 km (3-6 mi) to head off any further human cases. And the sooner the better. As the majority are connected by a highway, it should not present overwhelming problems. - Mod.MHJ]
