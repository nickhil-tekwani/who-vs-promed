For the first time since February 2001, there was a
laboratory-confirmed case of domestic dog/coyote (DDC) rabies in
Texas. This case, like the case in 2001, was confirmed in a dog in
Webb County, which lies along the US-Mexico border. The recent case,
which occurred on 10 Mar 2004, was located within Laredo
approximately 0.2 mile north of the Rio Grande.
The DDC variant tends to travel rapidly through a dog population.
Therefore, the City of Laredo has taken proactive steps to control
the potential spread of the virus in the incident area, including
picking up free-roaming dogs that may have had contact with the rabid
dog, determining the vaccination status of domestic animals, trying
to locate any exposed persons and animals, and scheduling a rabies
vaccination clinic.
The geographic location of this case is well within the limits of the
area covered by the Texas Oral Rabies Vaccination Program (ORVP).
From a historical aspect, in 1988 a rabies epizootic began in deep
South Texas involving the DDC rabies virus variant. The primary
animals affected in the epizootic were domestic dogs and coyotes.
There was a record yearly total of 142 cases in 1995; by 1996, 21
counties in South Texas had reported cases of DDC rabies. The Texas
Department of Health enacted the ORVP for coyotes in South Texas in
1995.
The program entails the aerial distribution of edible baits
containing oral rabies vaccine with the goal of producing a zone of
vaccinated coyotes to control the spread of the epizootic.
Program implementation has continued on a yearly basis. Since its
initial implementation, the number of DDC cases has declined,
including no reported cases in 2002 and 2003, and the northward
progression of the epizootic has been halted.

[Currently neither the City of Laredo nor the surrounding areas have
reported any human rabies exposure. Of course, client education
regarding vaccination of pets is appropriate, as is the rounding up
of stray animals.
It is interesting to note that, although the ORVP continues in the
area, there has been a case within the zone. It emphasizes that the
plan is instrumental is stopping the northward spread of rabies, but
must be used in conjunction with vaccination of pets. - Mod.TG]
