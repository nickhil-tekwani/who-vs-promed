Egypt confirms 54th human case of bird flu
------------------------------------------
On Wed 4 Feb 2009 the Egyptian Health Ministry confirmed that a
2-year-old baby has been infected with bird flu virus, which brings
the number of human cases of bird flu to 54 in the populous country.

The baby from the Suez governorate, some 120 km (75 mi) east of
Cairo, was admitted to hospital with a high temperature, the state
MENA news agency quoted Health Ministry spokesman, [Abdul Rahman
Shaheen], as saying. The baby contracted the deadly virus after being
in contact with infected birds, said [Shaheen].

This is the 3rd case of human bird flu in Egypt in 2009. On 25 Jan
2009, a 2-year-old baby from the Delta governorate of [Al-Minufiyah],
some 65 km (40 mi) north of Cairo, was hit by the deadly disease. On
12 Jan 2009, a 21-month-old baby girl from Kerdasa, 6th of October
governorate, was infected with the virus.

Egypt reported its 1st H5N1 virus in dead poultry in February 2006
and the 1st human case in March of the same year.

Two-year-old struck with bird flu
--------------------------------
Health authorities [in Cairo] announced Wednesday [4 Feb 2009] that a
new case of bird flu has been discovered in the province of Suez
involving a male child, thus bringing the number of people struck by
this disease in the country to 54 since its appearance in Egypt in
February 2006.

The afflicted child is 2 years old, said Dr [Abdul Rahman Shaheen],
spokesman for the ministry of Health, adding that the flu symptoms
began to appear on the child last Monday [2 Feb 2009], following
which he was admitted to the hospital for observation. He had come in
contact with dead birds while playing which resulted in his running
up high fever and severe coughing and other symptoms normally
associated with the bird flu. This took place last Friday [30 Jan 2009].

The disease had struck dead 22 people in Egypt since its appearance,
and the authorities [in Cairo] fear its resurgence mainly because
poultry shops, chicken-coop keepers at home, and bird collectors
mishandle dead birds, which exposes these people to the deadly flu.
