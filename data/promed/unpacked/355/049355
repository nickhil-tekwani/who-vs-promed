The Ecuadorian government declared a health emergency in 15 provinces
threatened by epidemic outbreaks of such diseases as dengue fever and
malaria. Jorge Zambrano, a Health Ministry specialist in epidemics, said
Monday that the government's declaration would allow authorities to ease
the process of acquiring medicine to treat the sick. This year alone,
15,000 cases of malaria have been reported, Zambrano said in a press
conference.
Heavy rains throughout the country have provided fertile ground for
mosquitoes - the primary disease carriers - to reproduce and spread
illnesses. As a result, the number of cases reported could rise, he added.
The coastal provinces of El Oro, Los Rios, Esmeraldas and Guayas have been
the hardest hit by the outbreaks, although numerous cases of dengue fever
and malaria have also been reported in provinces in Amazonia and the mountains.
