Health director Rama Rao and district Collector Neelam Sahni over phone to
take steps on a war-footing to arrest the spread of encephalitis. Talking
to newsmen, he said had officials taken preventive measures keeping in view
last year's experience, the lives of six children could have been saved in
Miryalaguda division of Nalgonda district. He said 20 children were
battling for their lives in various government and private hospitals and
urged the officials to send medical teams to vaccinate the children.

in the government hospital to treat the affected children. Talking to

said five children's specialists from Niloufer hospital, Hyderabad, two
homoeopathy doctors had been asked to treat those admitted to the special

in eight mandals [? of the division last year and added that anti-larvae
measures, such as spraying of [insecticide, were conducted in 78 villages
to prevent the spread of the disease. The disease had spread to other
villages due to the non-implementation of preventive measures, she said.
Besides taking several measures to prevent the spread of the disease, pig
rearers had been directed to take their pigs away from residential areas.
