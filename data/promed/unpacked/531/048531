A 50-year-old man succumbed to Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in Aralagodu gram panchayat limits near Kargal [district Shimoga, Karnataka] on [Wed 1 May 2019].

The deceased has been identified as [K, aged 50]. He was treated for fever at Aralagodu hospital, and his blood sample was sent to laboratory to screen for KFD. He tested positive, and health workers suggested admitting himself at the Manipal hospital for treatment. However, K refused to go to Manipal, as villagers dissuaded him from doing so. His family sources said that K passed away on [Wed 1 May 2019] morning.

With this, the KFD death toll in Aralagodu and Kargal limits has risen to 22.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.

The case fatality rate of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is 2-10 percent, and mortality is higher in the elderly [the latest case was 50 years old] and in individuals with comorbid conditions. There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf.

An indigenously manufactured formalin inactivated tissue-culture KFD vaccine has been used for immunization in Karnataka since 1990. The vaccination campaigns are conducted during the months of August-November in the areas that report KFD activity (defined as laboratory evidence of confirmed case/s in monkeys/humans or infected ticks) in the previous transmission seasons and surrounding villages within a radius of 5 mm [Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Govt of Karnataka. Manual on Kyasanur Forest Disease. 2005].

Two doses of the vaccine are administered to individuals aged 7-65 years at an interval of one month. As the immunity conferred by the vaccination is short-lived, booster doses are recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination and repeated for 5 consecutive years after the last confirmed case in the area. If cases of KFD are reported in the area in spite of vaccination during the pre-transmission season, additional vaccination campaigns are conducted. As part of the KFD vaccination programme, information about the number of individuals eligible for vaccination as well as coverage of vaccine is routinely compiled.

In the previous field evaluations of the vaccine during 1990-92 in Shimoga, Uttar Kannada and Chikamagalur districts, vaccine efficacy of 79.3 percent with one dose and 93.5 percent with 2 doses was reported [Dandawate CN, Desai GB, Achar TR, Banerjee KIndian J Med Res. 1994 Apr; 99:152-8.], while no impact was reported in a review in 2011-12 [Kasabi GS, Murhekar MV, Yadav PD, Raghunandan R, Kiran SK, et al. (2013) Kyasanur Forest Disease outbreak, Shimoga district, Karnataka, India, December 2011-March 2012. Emerg Infect Dis]. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation study by Kasabu et al published in 2013 reported lower efficacy particularly after single dose administration [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554520/].

Ensuring vaccine efficacy against the prevalent strains and adequate coverage in susceptible populations remains a continuing challenge.

Despite the above findings, vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to preventing KFD. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full sleeved clothes and long pants to reduce exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites. - Mod.UBA
