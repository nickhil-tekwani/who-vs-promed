Three outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 have been confirmed in backyard poultry flocks in Albania (2 in the central part and one in the north of the country). Up to now, about 320 birds have died and the disease mortality in affected farms has ranged from 48% up to 100%, with 100% in chicken and turkeys with lower rates in ducks and geese. The Veterinary Services have set up protection and surveillance zones around outbreak locations and have commenced culling operations.

Notification of the Ministry of Agriculture:

"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MARD] is closely following the monitoring of the epidemiological situation in the bird population in our country. Following the announcement given by the World Organization for Animal Health, about the presence of the Avian Influenza virus in some countries of the region and beyond, by order of Minister Milva Ekonomi, a plan of protection measures was drafted.

"First, the entry of birds into the territory of our country from countries that have confirmed the presence of the disease was banned. A National Crisis Center has been set up at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to direct and coordinate the action plan. After analyzing samples from suspicious cases in backyard birds, at the Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary (ISUV), the presence of Avian Influenza (Avian Influenza) type H5N8 was confirmed. The disease is present only in 3 outbreaks, located respectively in the Administrative Unit Fushe-Kruje, in the Administrative Unit Dajt and in the Administrative Unit Bujan.

"The Veterinary Service carried out the elimination of affected and suspicious birds and took measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Subsequently, the Ministerial Order prohibits at the national level the trade of live birds in open spaces and in live animal markets. The movement of birds to slaughterhouses is allowed, provided accompanied by a veterinary health certificate.

"Regarding intensive, commercial holdings (complexes), so far there are no suspected cases. The level of Biosafety in these complexes is according to European standards and is being rigorously monitored by the Veterinary Service. It is important to note that products and by-products originating from these birds do not pose a risk to consumer health. MARD brings to the attention of the public the observance of hygiene and high temperature cooking of all products of animal origin.

"The National Authority of Veterinary and Plant Protection (AKVMB) continues to monitor the situation for early detection of new cases and their isolation."
