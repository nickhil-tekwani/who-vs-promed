After broad consultations with experts from FAO, OIE and WHO, a consensus has been reached on the naming of the influenza A(H7N9) virus recently detected in China. The below approach is adopted and will be used in the 3 organizations' communications.

- The core term is "avian influenza A(H7N9) virus," which will be used for scientific / technical or other reports.

- The core term will be used but can be further modified according to specific circumstances. For example:

* "human infection (or disease) caused by the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus"
* "chicken infection (or disease) caused by the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus"
* "swine infection (or disease) caused by the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus" if detected in swine.

- For media communications, especially recognizing that social media such as Twitter will gravitate towards the use of the shortest possible terms, it is suggested that terms such as "H7N9" and "H7N9 virus" be used as surrogates as needed.

The above joint standardization efforts from FAO, OIE and WHO are expected to streamline the communication at all levels globally. The 3 organizations are committed to joint utmost efforts to respond to challenges including terminology under complicated circumstances and will review and develop a systematic naming approach to address similar and unpredicted events in the future.

http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_04_17/en/index.html


As of 17 Apr 2013 (18:00CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Of the latest laboratory confirmed cases, there are 9 from Zhejiang Province, 7 from Shanghai Municipality and 3 from Jiangsu Province.

Additionally, 3 patients earlier reported have died.

To date, a total of 82 patients have been laboratory-confirmed with human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including 17 deaths. More than 1000 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored.

Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

As of 18 Apr 2013 (18:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from Jiangsu (1), Zhejiang (2), Henan (1) Provinces, and Shanghai Municipality (1). No additional death has been reported.

To date, there are a total of 87 laboratory confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 17 fatalities in China reported from 4 Provinces: Anhui 3 (1), Henan 3 (0), Jiangsu 21 (3), and Zhejiang 27 (2) and 2 Municipalities, Beijing 1 (0) and Shanghai 32 (11).

Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[About this Disease Outbreak News:

1. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources.

2. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported.

3. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.]

Four new cases of H7N9 bird flu were confirmed on Thursday [18 Apr 2013] in Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, according to local authorities.

A 26-year-old woman from Jiangsu's capital of Nanjing was confirmed to be infected on Thursday [18 Apr 2013]. Five people who were in close contact with her have not shown flu symptoms.

Two other cases were confirmed in neighboring Zhejiang, according to the provincial health department. A 54-year-old woman and a 69-year-old man tested positive for the new strain of avian influenza. Both are in serious condition.

A Shanghai woman also tested positive for the virus on Thursday [18 Apr 2013], according to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission. Of the 7 people who had been in close contact with her, none have exhibited any abnormal symptoms.

Meanwhile, an H7N9 patient was discharged from a hospital at 2 p.m. Thursday [18 Apr 2013] after being successfully treated, according to the commission.

The 66-year-old Shanghai man showed flu symptoms on 31 Mar 2013 and was confirmed to be infected on 6 Apr 2013. Doctors said he now carries antibodies against the virus and will not be infected again.

China has reported a total of 87 cases of H7N9, of which 17 have died.

[6] Cluster unproven

http://qz.com/75738/chinese-authorities-cant-rule-out-human-to-human-bird-flu-transmission/


The family-clustered H7N9 cases reported in Shanghai were unable to prove human-to-human transmission, an expert said Wednesday [17 Apr 2013] in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.

According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, a man and one of his sons in Shanghai died from the bird flu, and his 2nd son was also infected but has since recovered. It has not been confirmed whether the 3 people contracted the virus from infected fowl or the contaminated environment or through human-to-human transmission, said Feng Zijian, an official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Active screenings of human infections across the nation have not been required by the commission, and China will continue its current measures to prevent and control the spread of the H7N9, said Li Xingwang, an infectious disease expert of Beijing Ditan Hospital of the Capital Medical University.

[7] Cases without bird contact
Date: Thu 18 Apr 2013

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday [17 Apr 2013] that a number of people who have tested positive for a new strain of bird flu in China appear to have had no contact with poultry, adding to the mystery about a virus that has killed 17 people to date. Chinese authorities have slaughtered thousands of birds and closed some live poultry markets to try to slow the rate of human infection, but many questions remain unsolved, including whether the H7N9 strain is being transmitted between people.

WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl confirmed that "there are people who have no history of contact with poultry," after a top Chinese scientist was quoted as saying this applied to about 40 percent of those infected. "This is one of the puzzles still (to) be solved and therefore argues for a wide investigation net," Hartl said in emailed comments. Hartl [said that] an international team of experts going to China soon would include in their investigation the possibility that the virus can be spread between people, although there was "no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. It might be because of dust at the wet markets; it could be another animal source beside poultry; it could also be human-to-human transmission," he said by telephone.

Wendy Barclay, an influenza expert at Imperial College London, said it could be hard to reveal or rule out exposure to poultry or to wild birds, which could also be a possible source of infection: "The incubation time might be quite long, so visiting a market even 14 days before might have resulted in infection."

Hartl said 2 new suspected cases of possible human-to-human transmission were being investigated. The 1st is a couple in Shanghai who tested positive, Hartl said, adding that the wife had died and husband was still sick. A 7-year-old girl in Beijing was the 1st case in the capital at the weekend, and the boy next door has also tested positive but is not showing symptoms, he said. The WHO had previously reported 2 suspected family "clusters," but the 1st turned out to be a false alarm, and the 2nd was inconclusive.

China has warned that the number of infections, 82 [now 83] so far, could rise. Most of the cases and 11 of the deaths have been in the commercial capital Shanghai. China reported 3 new outbreaks to the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) this week, bringing the total number of locations to 11, the OIE said. Poultry markets remain the focus of investigation by China and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. But Zeng Guang, chief scientist in charge of epidemiology at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre (CDPCC), said about 40 percent of human victims had no clear history of poultry exposure, the Beijing News reported. The centre declined to comment on state media reports saying only 10 of the 77 cases known by Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] had had contact with poultry.

A study published last week showed the H7N9 strain was a so-called "triple reassortant" virus with a mixture of genes from 3 other flu strains found in birds in Asia. One of those 3 strains is thought to have come from a brambling, a type of small wild bird. "We can't rule out that this ... has passed through poultry but then been reintroduced to a wild bird population from which some spread to humans might be occurring," Barclay said.

China's poultry sector has recorded losses of more than USD 1.6 billion since reports of the strain emerged 2 weeks ago.
