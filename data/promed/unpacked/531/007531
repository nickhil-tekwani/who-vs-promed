East Africa: outbreak of cattle disease puts Rwanda on alert
------------------------------------------------------------
Movement of cattle from Uganda to Rwanda has been banned following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Uganda's western districts of Ntungamo and Isingiro.

The disease is spread by infected animals through aerosols, contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing, or feed. Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) has dispatched a team of veterinary officers at the borders to enforce the ban.

"We have temporarily stopped the entry of animals from Uganda and we have put the foot-bath containing a disinfectant at all entry points to prevent the disease," Dr Christine Kanyandekwe Deputy Director General for animal resources extension in RAB told The New Times. She said the disease is 20 km [12.5 mi] away from Kagitumba border and most emphasis is put on porous borders where infected animals like cows, goats, sheep, and others could be sneaked into the country.

Nyagatare District Mayor, Fred Atuhe, said they have increased vigilance in the district to check the spread of the disease. He said there was fear the disease could have already broken out in the [district] Sectors of Matimba, Rwempasha, Mushikiri, and Tabagwe.
"We are taking no-nonsense decisions to control the spread of the deadly disease. There is no more movement of cows. We are taking no chances because of the porous border," he said.

The virus causes a high fever for 2 or 3 days, followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness and death. The disease is spread by infected animals through aerosols, contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing, or feed, and by domestic and wild predators.

Though it doesn't kill the animal immediately, it debilitates milk and meat production, causing severe economic losses to farmers.

Justine Zimurinda, in charge of Animal Quarantine in the Eastern Province, said if the disease crosses over, the country could lose Rwf 4 billion [USD 6.56 million] within 3 months. "We earn a lot of money from milk and beef. The disease has not yet broken out here, but the fact that it is present in neighbouring Uganda is a threat enough," Zimurinda said.

Another trans-boundary disease that is a threat to the region, especially Tanzania, is peste des petits ruminants (PPR), considered the most destructive viral disease affecting small ruminant flocks. The disease may cause death rates of up to 100 percent in [naive] sheep and goats if not prevented immediately.

Rwanda last had an infectious animal disease [FMD?] outbreak in 2008 and from then on, the government put strict control at its borders to avoid illegal import of animals from neighbouring countries and implemented quarantine measures.

[Rwanda's most recent annual report to the OIE refers to 2010. According to the report, FMD was present, "limited to one or more zones," reportedly caused by serotypes A, O, and SAT2. The (7) outbreaks were reported from the districts Nyagatare, Gatsibo, and Kayonza. Routine mass vaccinations involved 651 786 cattle. The total cattle population (2010 OIE data) of Rwanda is 1 334 820, sheep 789 836, and goats 2 970 780.

According to the Rwanda page of the WRLFMD, FMDV-O was reported in Rwanda in 1960, 1998, and 2004; FMDV-SAT2 was recorded in 1992, 1996-1997, 2000-2001, and 2004. According to the site, FMDV-A has never been reported in Rwanda (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/rwa.htm).

Uganda reported to the OIE the circulation of FMDV-O during 2011 in 17 of its districts, including Isingiro; Ntungamo was not included in the list.

An official confirmation of the reported outbreak in Rwanda, details on the FMD virus serotype involved and on the vaccine strains applied, are anticipated.

Regarding PPR: according to Rwanda's 2010 report to the OIE, PPR was "suspected (not confirmed)" in Rwanda in 2010. According to Uganda's 2011 report, PPR was present ("clinical disease"). - Mod.AS]
