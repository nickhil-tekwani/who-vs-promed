A bat may have exposed 4 people in Latta to rabies, DHEC announced in a press release [Mon 26 Mar 2018].

The bat, found in a bedroom, tested positive for rabies on [21 Mar 2018]. A pet dog may have also been exposed, DHEC said.

"Rabid bats have been known to transmit the rabies virus to humans and pets," said David Vaughan of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "People - especially children - sometimes don't realize they've been bitten and it is very easy to overlook a bat bite because bat teeth are so tiny."

The 4 people were referred to health care providers for post-exposure treatment. The dog was current on its rabies vaccination.

The bat is the 1st animal in Dillon County to test positive for rabies in 2018. There have been 11 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year [2018]. In 2017, none of the 63 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Dillon County.

Several Kilgore College students must undergo rabies vaccine injections after a bat they handled tested positive for the virus.

The bat was found on campus near the Fine Arts Building on [22 Mar 2018], but the students handled the bat before animal control picked it up. Testing results released [Mon 26 Mar 2018] afternoon confirmed the bat had rabies.

It is unusual for nocturnal animals, such as bats, to move about during the day. If you encounter one, do not touch it. Contact local law enforcement immediately.

[For information on wildlife reservoirs of rabies in the USA, go to http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, being infections that are almost always fatal, unless treated. - Mod.PMB
