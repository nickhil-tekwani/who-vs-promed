----------------------
Root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.) are common pathogens that
parasitize vegetables and other crops and cause significant yield
reductions worldwide. In the early spring of 2006, severe plant stunting,
chlorosis, and extensive root galling were observed on cucumber plants
grown in a greenhouse on Zeta plain, Zetska ravnica, Montenegro. In the
summer and autumn of 2006, infected roots of different crops were collected
from greenhouses and vegetable production fields of Zeta plain, which
represents the largest area of Montenegro's vegetable production. Several
vegetable crops were found to be infected with root-knot nematodes,
including tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.), squash (_Cucurbita
pepo_ L.), cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L.), pepper (_Capsicum annuum_ L.),
and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_ L.). Symptoms on these crops included
root-galling, leaf chlorosis, and stunting. Heavily infected tomato plants
growing in 2 greenhouses also displayed early flower and fruit drop.
Nematode species were determined based on characterization of (i) female
perineal patterns, (ii) male and 2nd-stage juvenile morphology, and (iii)
esterase and malate dehydrogenase phenotypes from young egg-laying females.
The most prevalent species was _M. incognita_, which was isolated from the
roots of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and lettuce from 9 locations. _M.
arenaria_ was detected at 3 locations from the roots of tomatoes grown in a
greenhouse and the weeds _Convolvulus arvensis_ L. and _Solanum nigrum_ L.,
which were growing in open fields in separate locations. _M. javanica_ was
found on tomato and squash in the same field where _M. arenaria_ was also
found on _S. nigrum_. _M. javanica_ was isolated from tomato and squash.
In this study, we found high incidence of _Meloidogyne_ spp. in intensive
vegetable production areas of Montenegro. The implementation of an
effective integrated pest management program is essential for future use of
infested areas. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _M. arenaria_,
_M. incognita_, and _M. javanica_ from Montenegro.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.) attack a wide range of plants,
including many common vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamentals. The genus
contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and
sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
On infected plants, large galls form throughout the root system affecting
plant vigour. Above ground, symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf
chlorosis, which may be confused with nutritional problems. Severe
infections may kill the host plants and often result in significant
economic losses to growers. Losses are due to yield reduction as well as to
lack of consumer acceptance, for example for carrots which have developed
severe forking with galls on lateral roots. Damage usually depends on
population density, nematode species or race, and host species or cultivar.
Many commonly grown cultivars of tomato and the other crops mentioned in
this report can be severely affected by root-knot nematodes, and intensive
vegetable cultivation under plastic tunnels often increases nematode
numbers in the soil.
The pathogens are spread by plant material, in infested soil, and by
mechanical means, for example tools or contaminated equipment. Eggs can
persist in the soil for years. Disease management of nematodes is difficult
and generally requires an integrated approach of phytosanitary measures and
exclusion, including use of clean planting material and soil, nematicides,
resistant host varieties, and crop rotation with non-host species. In some
instances, susceptible cultivars can be grown successfully when grafted
onto rootstocks resistant to root-knot nematodes, a method used
increasingly, for example, for eggplant in Italy.
