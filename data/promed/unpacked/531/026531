Omitted in error from the ProMED-mail post of 9 March 2001 was the location
of the likely outbreak of soybean rust in South Africa. According to Clive
Levy, severe rust infection has been seen near Vryheit in northern
KwaZulu-Natal (extent ca. 1 square km) and Karkloof in the central part of
the province (extent unknown).
