The stone-crushing workers in Patgram upazila are left to suffer, as most are too poor to afford treatment for an irreversible lung disease, silicosis, which is their occupational hazard. Silicosis is a disease caused by silicon poisoning, a common side effect of working in stone-crushing yards. The workers breathe in the silica dust while working in the yards, and the silicon settles in their lungs, slowly solidifying their respiratory systems. Patgram is dotted with hundreds of stone-crushing yards, where large mountain boulders imported from Bhutan or India are broken down into small chips and fine powder to make products for mosaic, plaster, and building construction.

At least 67 stone-crushing workers died of silicosis in the last 6-7 years, said Burimari Union Parishad chairman Abu Sayed Newaz Nishat, adding he has a list of 100 stone-crushing workers with the disease in the union. However, the number could be higher, as more than 20 000 workers are employed in the stone-crushing industry there, he stated. There is no official figure for the total number of deaths resulting from silicosis.

When the stone-crushing yards 1st started operations, impoverished villagers of the border area flocked to sell their labour but soon realised the job came with fatal side effects. Stone-crushing workers affected by this disease have become physically weak and lost their ability to work. With poverty and hunger hanging over the workers' heads, they are left with nothing to do but wait for death.

[TH], 55, from Kamarerhat village in Burimari, has been suffering from silicosis for 7 years. He was forced to sell his lone asset -- 8 decimals [0.08 acre] of land -- to meet his treatment costs. After selling his land, he sought shelter on other's land. "I have been dying of this disease for the past 6 years," said [TH]. "We used to work as a group of 15 people; all of us have been affected by silicosis. Only 8 of us are alive now," he said.

Worker [MA] had explained to a correspondent of this newspaper last year [2019] the silicosis-affected workers' need to take Pulfibro, a life-saving medication for these workers, 4 times a day. Each pill costs BDT 60 (USD 0.71) [or BDT 240 / USD 2.83 per day - Mod.TG]. Today, the workers earn BDT 360-400 [USD 4.24-4.71] a day for their labour. [So 60-66% of their daily wages is for medication to keep them alive. - Mod.TG]

Pulfibro, the brand name for the drug Pirfenidone, reduces the fibrous tissue formations that fill up the air pockets inside the lungs of the silicosis-affected workers. As long as the silicon [crystalline silica] resides in the lungs of the workers, the lungs will continue to envelop the pollutant with scar tissue, and the workers will have to continue taking this expensive pill to undo the damage.

[MA] passed away on 15 Feb this year [2020] at Rangpur Medical College Hospital, as his respiratory system collapsed. He was the coordinator of an unofficial Burimari-based group called the "Silicosis Patient Association", which fought for the rights of the workers.

The workers have been seeking financial assistance for their treatment from the local administration, public representatives, and wealthy locals. But their pleas remain unheard. Many have ended up foregoing treatment due to a lack of money; many others have died with no treatment.

"When I receive treatment, I feel a little better. Whenever I stop treatment, I fall sick. But I cannot afford all the medical expenses," said [RK], 45, a stone-crushing labourer of Ufarmara village suffering from silicosis. "By selling off my only asset, one bigha arable land, I sought treatment at the National Institute of Diseases of the Chest and Hospital in Dhaka, as well as hospitals in Rangpur and Lalmonirhat. There is nothing to sell anymore, so I cannot afford the medical treatment," he said. "I have been suffering from this disease for the last 5 years. Four of my co-workers have gone," he said. With no ability to work, he has to sit at home.

[SI], a 42 year old worker from Dangirpar village, said he did not know about silicosis when he started work in the stone-crushing yards 14 years ago. Without any precautionary measures in place, all the workers were affected. "I have been suffering from this disease for 8 years. Some of my friends have died of it. My condition is not good either. I'm dying while trapped in my house," he said. "If I could get treatment, I would probably survive a few more days," he added.

Stone-crushing labourers [RH], 38, of Dolapara village; [R], 46, of Natarbari village; [AH], 48, of Islampur village; [NI], 48, of Bamandal village; [AU] of Kamerhat village; and others have also given up due to their financial condition and lack of help. "Many of us now work while covering our nose and mouth with clothes, but most people still don't know to do this," said [NI], a 42 year old labourer in the Burimari land port area. "We have no alternative work, so we crush stones. I know how dangerous and incurable silicosis is, but there is no way out," said another labourer, [SR].

Dr Bipul Chandra Roy, a tuberculosis and chest disease specialist at RDRS Bangladesh in Lalmonirhat, said he is providing treatment to many patients suffering from silicosis. While some receive regular treatment, most are irregular patients as they cannot afford the medicine.

Lalmonirhat deputy commissioner Md Abu Jafar told The Daily Star a team from the Ministry of Labour and Employment met with the labourers a month ago. The ministry is preparing to provide financial assistance, he said, but when the help will arrive is a question he does not have an answer to. "I am contacting the ministry to speed up the steps. And if anyone with the disease appeals to me, I will help," added the deputy commissioner.

Contacted, Patgram Upazila health and family planning officer (UHFPO) Dr Arup Paul said silicosis-affected patients are more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection. They all must stay at home during the ongoing crisis period. Health officials are collecting information about the silicosis-affected people, he added.

[Silicosis is a serious lung disease. In September 2019, ProMED-mail posted on stone masons in the US and India being affected by silicosis [Silicosis - USA: workers health 20191007.6712659 and Silicosis - India: (GJ) fatalities, injured workers 20191110.6771540]. While it would not be a perfect solution in the Bangladesh situation, even some masks would be helpful.

Pulfibro, or pirfenidone, is an oral antifibrotic agent with a broad spectrum of antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Pirfenidone has beneficial effects for the treatment of certain fibrotic diseases and is under clinical trials in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis http://www.apexbt.com/pirfenidone.html.

Sadly, this lung condition may make the workers more susceptible to the COVID-19 currently circulating in most of the world. Silicosis may also make it difficult for physicians to distinguish between early COVID-19 and early silicosis disease. Surely the stone industry would not have a heart of stone. Hopefully the industry in these affected regions will step up with some protection, masks, or respirators for their workers.

According to CDC, in an article probably inspired by a paper in MMWR [Rose C, Heinzerling A, Patel K, et al. Severe silicosis in engineered stone fabrication workers: California, Colorado, Texas, and Washington, 2017-2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019; 68: 813-818. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6838a1.] "Respirable crystalline silica exposure causes silicosis, a disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Clusters of cases have been reported internationally among stone countertop fabrication workers, but only one US case in this industry has been reported previously."

The problem has also been examined in Australia [Ryan Hoy. Artificial stone associated silicosis with rapid lung function decline. Eur Resp J. 2017; 50: OA484; DOI: 10.1183/1393003.congress-2017.OA484 https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/50/suppl_61/OA484].

While we are not told whether the workers in Bangladesh are stone or engineered stone workers, we can present some information with regard to silicosis.

"Silicosis is a lung disease caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica, a mineral part of sand, rock, and mineral ores such as quartz. It mostly affects workers exposed to silica dust in occupations such mining, glass manufacturing, stone cutting, and foundry work. Over time, exposure to silica particles causes scarring in the lungs, which can harm one's ability to breathe.

"Symptoms of silicosis can appear from a few weeks to many years after exposure to silica dust. Symptoms typically worsen over time as scarring in the lungs occurs.

- Acute silicosis causes cough, weight loss, and fatigue within a few weeks or years of exposure to inhaled silica.
- Chronic silicosis appears 10-30 years after exposure and can affect upper lungs and sometimes causes extensive scarring.
- Accelerated silicosis occurs within 10 years of high-level exposure.

"Silicosis can develop within a few weeks to even decades after exposure. When people breathe silica dust, they inhale tiny particles of the mineral silica. This silica dust can cause fluid buildup and scar tissue in the lungs that cuts down your ability to breathe. This can lead to lung scarring and cough, weight loss, and fatigue.

"Silicosis affects the lungs by damaging the lining of the lung air sacs. Once this begins, it leads to scarring and, in some situations, to a condition called progressive massive fibrosis. This condition happens when there is severe scarring and stiffening of the lung, which makes it difficult to breathe.

"People with acute silicosis experience cough, weight loss, tiredness, and may have fever or a sharp chest pain. You may also have shortness of breath over time, especially with chronic silicosis. Your healthcare provider might hear crackles or wheezing when they listen to your lungs. Having silicosis increases the risk of other problems, such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, and chronic bronchitis.

"Each type of silicosis affects the body somewhat differently:
- In acute silicosis, the lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, which causes severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.
- In chronic silicosis, the silica dust causes areas of swelling in the lungs and chest lymph nodes, which makes breathing more difficult.
- In accelerated silicosis, swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in chronic silicosis.

"Over time, lung capacity decreases, and people with silicosis may need support with oxygen and other devices to help them breathe.

"Symptoms of silicosis can appear from a few weeks to many years after exposure to silica dust. Symptoms typically worsen over time as scarring in the lungs occurs. Cough is an early symptom and develops over time with exposure to silica that is inhaled. In acute silicosis, you may experience fever and sharp chest pain along with breathing difficulty. These symptoms can come on suddenly.

"In chronic silicosis, you may only have an abnormal chest x-ray in the beginning and then slowly develop a cough and breathing difficulty. More than 1/3 of people with silicosis have phlegm production and cough. Chronic bronchitis-like symptoms may occur, and the lungs have additional sounds called wheezes and crackles. As extensive scarring progresses over time, you may see signs of chronic lung disease such as leg swelling, increased breathing rate, and bluish discoloration of the lips.

"There is no cure for silicosis. Prevention is still the best way to avoid the disease. Once silicosis has developed, your doctor will assess the degree of lung damage with tests. Some people may need urgent treatment with oxygen and support for breathing. Others may need medicines to decrease sputum production, such as inhaled steroids. Some may need inhaled bronchodilators, which relax the air tubes.

"Once the disease advances, the management is similar to many other chronic lung diseases and needs a multidisciplinary or team approach. To keep the disease from getting worse, it is important to stay away from any additional sources of silica and other lung irritants, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and smoke. You may consider counseling to discuss changing occupations.

"Acute silicosis may need to be treated with steroids, and a lung transplant may need to be considered."
