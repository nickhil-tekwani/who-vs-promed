A Madera County man in his 90s died in August [2020] from the Saint Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV], the county health department reported Thursday [3 Sep 2020]. The county said it is the 1st confirmed case of SLEV in California this year [2020] and the 1st in Madera County since 1976.

The health department, through preliminary testing, thought it was the West Nile virus before the test confirmed it was SLEV. Madera County Public Health Officer Simon Paul said through a news release "the risk for St. Louis encephalitis remains low in Madera County."

He offered advice, saying "you can decrease your risk by using EPA-registered repellent to keep mosquitoes from biting you, mosquito-proofing your home through the use of properly fitting doors and screens, and not allowing standing water to collect in your home or yard."

[St. Louis encephalitis virus is found nearly every year in California, sometimes in mosquitoes, sometimes causing cases in humans, as with the case reported above. The USA CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults, as is the case in the above report. Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
