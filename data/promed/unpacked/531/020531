Necropsy and testing of a number of the bats found trauma consisting
of fractured appendages, wounds, and contusions. Of 15 bats
necropsied (4 at the National Wildlife Health Center and 11 by
Arizona Game and Fish Department Wildlife Health personnel),
4-millimeter "bb" pellets were recovered from 4 animals, and 4 had
wound tracts that passed through the body. Several bats were screened
for rabies by the Arizona Department of Health and were found to be
negative. Samples from the bats were also tested by PCR for _G.
destructans_, and no fungus was detected.

Sadly, this event appears to have been caused by one or more persons
deliberately shooting at the bats with CO2-charged pellet or bb guns
(gas cylinders were found under the bridge). The Arizona Game and
Fish Department is investigating and has offered a reward for
information leading to the identification (and hopefully prosecution)
of the perpetrators.

[_G. destructans_ is the causative agent for White Nose Syndrome
(WNS) in bats. It is good to know that WNS has not reached there.

I appreciate Dr. Justice-Allen providing us with an official report
of the situation with the bats. - Mod.TG]
