Hemorrhagic disease, which may be caused by either of 2 possible viruses, has been killing dozens of white-tailed deer in Wyoming and Montana over the past month. The most common and likely of those viruses is epizootic hemorrhagic disease [virus] or EHD. The other possible virus, but not likely the cause of the deaths, is blue tongue virus (BTV) disease, which more often affects cattle. The 2 viruses are closely related but not the same.

The deer are dying of internal bleeding, and tests at the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab in Laramie will determine whether epizootic hemorrhagic disease or bluetongue is responsible. Both viruses are endemic, or native, to the region and cause outbreaks in wildlife from time to time.

White-tailed deer are the usual victims, but EHD also can infect pronghorn antelope, elk and mule deer. Both diseases can infect livestock, but neither poses a risk to humans.

People in recent weeks have come across dozens of dead and dying deer in the Big Horn Basin in north-central Wyoming and in Montana, from the Great Falls area to north of Chester.

"A lot of the landowners are finding them in the irrigation ditches," Tom Easterly, a Wyoming Game and Fish Department wildlife biologist in Greybull, said Wednesday [14 Aug 2013].

The actual number of deaths is difficult for biologists to determine with much accuracy. An especially large outbreak could cause the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to restrict deer hunting limits in the area this fall [2013], Easterly said, but he expressed doubt that would happen.

Biting gnats spread EHD, and outbreaks tend to occur as dry weather causes deer and gnats to congregate near water.

Signs can include bleeding or swelling of the head, neck, tongue, or eyes, and victims suffer from loss of appetite and extreme weakness. Cases tend to taper off after the 1st hard freeze.

Last year [2012], drought conditions led to hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in eastern Wyoming and a high rate of deer mortality in South Dakota and Nebraska, according to the department.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease was 1st identified in Wyoming when significant numbers of deer died in the Black Hills north of Newcastle in 1957.

[In the cases mentioned above, laboratory confirmation will be needed to determine which virus it is. As livestock have not been reported as being involved, it is most likely EHD.

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate and fever (affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature), and finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa. Then, 8 to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.

EHD and bluetongue are not the same disease. Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although molecularly they are not the same disease.

There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently improbable, as some areas with winter feeding are viewed as one mechanism of spreading tuberculosis. Additionally, vaccine companies have not been forthcoming with a willingness to develop a vaccine that could be used for mass vaccination. With more people adopting alternative livestock, such as various species of cervids, the opportunity for vaccine companies is increasing. It may be that lobbyists with the alternative livestock will need to be active in Congress to secure minor use, minor species (MUMS) dollars to be an incentive for the vaccine companies.
