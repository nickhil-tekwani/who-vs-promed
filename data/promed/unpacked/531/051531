This is a follow-up of the situation posted on ProMED on 1 Apr 2022 (Plague - Congo DR: (IT) fatal 20220401.8702341).

As of 8 Apr 2022, the Rethy Health Zone, located in Djugu Territory, Ituri Province, DR Congo continues to report plague cases with a total of 33 suspected cases of bubonic plague, including 2 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 6.0%). Two health areas out of a total of 22 areas are affected, mainly Lokpa with 31 cases and one death and Rassia with 2 cases and one death. All 10 villages within the Lokpa health area reported suspected plague cases.

The most affected age group is >5 years (28 cases) with no difference between female and male. Most patients (93.9%) presented with fever and lymphadenopathy either inguinal (36.3%), sub-maxillary (45%) or axillary (18.7%). Out of 16 samples taken from patients who gave their consent, 2 were positive to the rapid diagnostic test for plague; other tests were negative. There is thus a crucial need for confirmatory diagnostics.

The coordination of the field response is ensured by the health zone management team with the technical support of the plague surveillance and control center of Bunia and, as of 8 Apr 2022, additional material support of Malteser International [NGO] (sampling kits, rapid diagnostic tests), deltamethrin (an insecticide), and doxycycline (an antimicrobial).

[ProMED thanks Drs Adroba and Laudisoit for this post. As can be seen in the See Also section below, Ituri province is endemic for _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium causing human plague.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. It is the pneumonic form of infection that can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
