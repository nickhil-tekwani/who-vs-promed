Potato wart confirmed in a second field in Prince Edward Island
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced that potato wart [PW]
disease, caused by the [soil-inhabiting] fungus (_Synchytrium
endobioticum_), was found in a second field on Prince Edward Island (PEI).
The infected field is considered a "contact" field due to its relation with
the initial finding of PW in PEI in October 2000, and is located about 10
km from the original site.
The CFIA confirmed the presence of PW in the second field on 3 Sep [2002],
and took measures to mitigate the risk of spreading the disease immediately
after it was first suspected on 30 Aug 2002. All affected land, machinery,
and equipment were placed under an order prohibiting movement, and
arrangements were made to have machinery and equipment cleaned and
disinfected under CFIA supervision.
Following the initial discovery of PW disease in a field of potatoes in New
Annan, PEI, on 24 Oct 2000, the CFIA and the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) developed a 3 year work plan that includes movement restrictions on
fields within a buffer area and, associated with the affected contact
field, a series of surveillance activities and a certification process for
potatoes from fields determined to be PW-free.
Under the terms of this work plan, fields planted with potatoes last year
were inspected, and were found to be PW-free. Within another 2 years, if
the weather conditions are conducive to expression of PW disease, the vast
majority of PEI fields should be declared PW-free. No impact on trade due
to the new find is expected, given the existence of the 3 year work plan.
The discovery of PW disease occurred during regular harvest inspection
activities, in cooperation with local industry, under the established
monitoring program of the 3 year work plan. Later this year, for the second
consecutive year, more than 200 CFIA potato inspectors will be monitoring
potato fields in PEI and conducting surveillance activities for PW. The
potatoes from the affected field were intended for processing only and all
harvested potatoes have been processed.
The CFIA is proceeding with the implementation of a buffer area surrounding
the affected field and restricting potato and soil movement from the
affected, buffer zone and contact fields associated with this new finding.
These restrictions are necessary to contain PW disease and prevent any
further spread domestically or to other trading partners. No potatoes at
risk have [been] moved off of the island. PW is a quarantine pest, but it
does not affect the safety of potatoes for consumption.

[The second finding of PW in PEI is a blow. Many PEI potato producers
affected by the first finding of PW in 2000 were driven to bankruptcy. The
term "contact field" means that it was identified as a field that supplied
potatoes to the producer (Cavendish Farms) prior to the discovery of PW in
2000. - Mod.DH]
