The cancer ward of an Ottawa hospital has been closed due to a focus of
infection and colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
Officials who confirmed the outbreak in the hematology/oncology unit say
that "they are taking precautions to keep the killer organism at bay."
So far, 10 people on the 40 bed ward have been identified as carriers and
one person is infected. As a result, the hospital is not admitting any new
patients on the ward.
However, some patients have been able to go home and visitors are still
allowed.
