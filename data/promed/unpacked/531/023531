From January to October [2019], Gandhi Hospital [Hyderabad, Telangana], the nodal centre for swine flu [influenza A] and H1N1 infection in the state, recorded over 94 positive cases of swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] with 22 confirmed deaths. While the numbers do not seem to be as high as last year [2018], doctors have advised the utmost precautionary measures to the public while administering their staff and themselves with vaccines against the flu.

According to Dr. Krishnamurthy, Head of the Department of Pulmonology at Gandhi Hospital in the city, "There is no threat of an epidemic currently. Only one death has been recorded in the past month [September 2019]. We have a fully functioning RICU [respiratory intermediate care unit] and 14-bed ICCU [intensive coronary care unit] to tackle both isolated and mass cases of swine flu. Private hospitals and other government hospitals that record swine flu cases send [them] to Gandhi Hospital, as we are the nodal centre for the state."

North America: Influenza activity continued at inter-seasonal levels in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B.

Caribbean: Influenza and SARI activity were low and continue at inter-seasonal levels.

Central America: Influenza activity continued to increase in El Salvador with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B co-circulating; SARI activity remained at a low level. In Nicaragua, influenza A(H3N2) activity increased with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses co-circulating; SARI cases among all hospitalizations were within levels observed in previous seasons.

Andean: Overall, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low in the sub-region. In Bolivia, influenza percent positivity increased with the circulation of influenza B/Victoria (I"162/163) lineage virus predominance and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus co-circulating; SARI cases decreased to levels observed in previous seasons.

Brazil and Southern Cone: Influenza activity decreased throughout the sub-region except for Chile. In Chile, influenza activity decreased with influenza B predominance (co-circulation of influenza B Yamagata and Victoria lineages). ILI activity continued below a moderate level, and SARI activity remained at a low level.

CDC is already reporting flu cases in the volunteer state. Allergies and the flu are quite different, although some can get them confused. Allergies do not cause fever or muscle aches.

If you happen to catch the flu, expect those symptoms to last at least 3-5 days.

A new treatment for influenza, Zofluza, has become a challenge, because resistant viruses are likely to occur, and the Japanese Society for Infectious Diseases has discussed how to use it.

According to a new recommendation made by the academic society, children under 12 years of age tend to have more resistant viruses than adults. "The data is scarce, and we can't decide whether to recommend it at the moment."

Zofluza, developed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., was used often when it was launched last year [2018], as it is effective with a single dose. Approximately 6 million [doses] were shipped in just half a year.

Zofluza has an effect different from the widely used Tamiflu, and it can be used for patients who cannot be given Tamiflu.

A new recommendation will be posted on the academic society's website soon. Officials of the academic society wrote: "We want you to think about how to use Zofluza in an emergency."

[Baloxavir marboxil is an antiviral medication used to treat the flu (influenza) if symptoms started less than 48 hours ago. It helps make the symptoms (such as stuffy nose, cough, sore throat, fever/chills, aches, tiredness) less severe and may shorten recovery time by 1-2 days. Baloxavir marboxil works by stopping the flu virus from growing. It will not treat other kinds of infections besides the flu virus. Baloxavir marboxil is not a substitute for the flu vaccine (https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-176369/baloxavir-marboxil-oral/details). It was developed by Shionogi Co., a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and Roche AG.

The US FDA approved Zofluza last year [2019]; a single oral dose of Zofluza (baloxavir marboxil) is for the treatment of uncomplicated flu in patients aged 12 and older who have had symptoms for no more than 48 hours. When used within 48 hours of getting sick with the flu, antiviral drugs can reduce symptoms and duration of the illness, according to the FDA.

As of 2019, in the only published phase 3 RCT of otherwise healthy outpatients, baloxavir reduced the duration of symptoms by about one day compared to placebo, which was the same as oseltamivir. On the 1st day after treatment with baloxavir was started, viral load decreased more than with either placebo or oseltamivir. However, after 5 days of oseltamivir, the effect of a single dose of baloxavir was indistinguishable (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1716197). - Mod.UBA]
