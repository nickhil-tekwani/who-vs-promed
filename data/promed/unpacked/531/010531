An outbreak of rabies was registered in Donetsk oblast [region] recently. 5
people have been exposed to rabies and one of them died because of late
medical help. The cases were associated with both wild and domestic
animals. In one case a female wolf attacked 3 people in a village. Later on
the veterinarian scratched his hands while doing an autopsy on this wolf's
carcass. Another person had applied for medical help on 2 Sep 2010 after
sustaining bites from his own dog. This person came to the hospital too
late to be rescued and he died soon after.

[The Ukraine has been experiencing a serious nationwide rabies problem for
over a year. As recently as June 2010, an epidemic of rabies in wild foxes
was reported under way in Zhytomyr Oblast in the north central area of the
country, distant from the Donetsk oblast in the report above (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100609.1919). A 2 Sep 2009 ProMED-mail post
(archive no. 20090905.3121) reported a rabid wolf attack in Kiev Oblast,
also in north central Ukraine. A 4 Sep 2010 ProMED-mail report (archive no.
20090912.3216) indicated that Ukrainian veterinarians said that an alarming
situation was developing with regard to outbreaks of rabies among animals
in the Crimea and in the Ukraine in general.
