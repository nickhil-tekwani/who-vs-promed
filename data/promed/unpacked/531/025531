Influenza update no 234 [Mon 6 Apr 2015; based on data up to 22 Mar 2015]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity decreased further but remained above the seasonal threshold in the northern hemisphere. While influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated this season [2014-2015], the proportions of influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections increased in the last few weeks.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease but remained slightly above the threshold while the proportion influenza B detections increased.
- In Europe, influenza activity continued to decline in most countries. Influenza A(H3N2)virus continued to predominate this season, but there was an increase in the proportion of influenza B detections in many countries.
- In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity decreased in most of the region. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained predominant in the region.
- In western Asia, influenza activity decreased in most countries in the region. But influenza detections have increased in Turkey with influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 co-circulating.
- In the temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the region, but increased in the Republic of Korea.
- In north China, influenza B activity increased, while the peak of influenza activity occurred in the beginning of the year.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity was reported to increase slightly in most countries. Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico reported increased influenza-like illness (ILI), with detections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity remained high and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated in India and Bhutan. Influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) and B continued to decrease from its peak in southern China and China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of [2 Apr 2015] 14:15 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 88 countries, areas or territories reported data for the time period from [8 Mar 2015] to [21 Mar 2015]. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 87 715 specimens. 17 828 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 9119 (51.1 percent) were typed as influenza A and 8707 (48.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 2558 (49.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2579 (50.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 427 (97.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 10 (2.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------
North America
In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease but overall influenza detections remained slightly above the seasonal threshold. While influenza A(H3N2) virus has predominated this season, Influenza B continued to increase and was the dominating virus in the last few weeks.

In Canada, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity decreased and was within expected levels. Influenza A detections continued to decrease while influenza B detections continued to steadily increase. The majority of the influenza activity occurred in the Central and Atlantic provinces and affected the senior population.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decline but remained above the seasonal threshold while influenza B continued to increase. The influenza detection rate declined to 10.6 percent from the previous report (11.4 percent). The pneumonia and influenza mortality rate reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System was at 7.4 percent, slightly above the epidemic threshold (7.2 percent) for the week. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI (2.2 percent) continued to decline as well, but remained above the 2.0 percent national baseline.

In Mexico, influenza detections overall decreased to 24.3 percent positivity from the peak of around 50 percent positivity at the end of the year 2014. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity continued to decrease to 509 ARI cases per 100 000 habitants, from around 700 ARI cases per 100 000 at the peak at the end of January [2015]. Pneumonia activity also decreased but remained high and above the expected levels.

Europe
In Europe, influenza activity continued to decline in most countries but the proportion of positive samples remained high at 41 percent in the countries that reported. The hospitalized influenza cases were reported mainly among individuals 65 years old and older (53 percent). Influenza A(H3N2) continued to dominate. However, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses continued to circulate in the region, with a continued steady increase in type B virus detections. There was excess all-cause mortality among people aged greater than or equal to 65 years old observed in Belgium, England, France, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales, according to the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EUROMOMO). The excess all-cause mortality coincides with circulating influenza (H3N2) viruses and cold weather.

In Eastern Europe, influenza activity overall remained low. The Russian Federation and Greece reported ongoing influenza activity with influenza B predominating.

Northern Africa and Middle East
In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity was decreasing throughout most of the region.

Western Asia
In western Asia, influenza activity decreased in most countries in the region. However, influenza detections have increased in Turkey with influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating.

Central Asia
In central Asia, influenza activity was mainly low with some detections of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B.

Eastern Asia
In eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the region. While influenza A(H3N2) detections decreased in north China and the Republic of Korea, influenza B detections increased in both countries. In north China the ILI rate was with 2.7 percent compared to the season's peak of around 4 percent. In the Republic of Korea, the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI decreased to 35.6 percent (from 45.5 percent in the last update), and remained above the baseline of 12.2 percent. In Mongolia influenza activity and ILI activity decreased.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and the tropical countries of South America continued to be low. Colombia reported an increase in ARI activity in outpatient consultations and hospitalizations, with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). Ecuador reported an increase in SARI activity with a high detection rate of RSV but low number of influenza detections.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, some influenza activity was reported. In western Africa and eastern Africa influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B were co-circulating.

Tropical Asia
In tropical Asia, influenza activity remained high but seemed to decrease in India and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Influenza activity in Bhutan remained high in the last few weeks, with a predominance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. ILI cases were most commonly observed in the age group of 15-29 years and SARI cases were most common in the 0-1 year-old group. Influenza activity continued to decrease in south China and China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region but remained elevated above the baseline in China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). south China continued to report a mixture of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B detections. Viet Nam reported increased activity with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported high but decreased influenza activity with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

India continued to report high but decreasing activity with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in the southern hemisphere countries.

[In the northern hemisphere, seasonal influenza is lingering longer than in previous years, but no drastically different antigenic strains have appeared, nor has there been any increase in the number of isolates with enhanced resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors currently in use. However, the vaccine being produced now to combat the expected seasonal viruses in the northern hemisphere has been amended slightly to take account of minor changes in the current A/H3N2 virus component. - Mod.CP]
