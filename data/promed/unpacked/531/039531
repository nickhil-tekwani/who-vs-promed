Another 10 people have been hospitalized with food poisoning in the
Stavropol Territory over the past day, [bringing the] number of
hospitalized people to 78, including 15 children. Doctors estimate the
condition of the sick people as moderate to severe. [Symptoms have included
fever, nausea, and headache.]
A source in the main emergencies department in the Stavropol Territory told
Itar-Tass that the 1st cases of poisoning cases had been registered on Sat
26 May 2007. It was found out that all hospitalized people had [become ill]
after eating cakes bought at several food stores and small marketplaces.
The producer of the implicated products -- a private confectioner's shop --
was found.
Laboratory tests showed that salmonellae, which cause an acute infectious
intestinal disease, were found in the cakes.

[It is interesting that diarrhea is not specifically mentioned as a
symptom. The source for the contamination of the cakes with salmonellae is
not stated. Contaminated eggs, inadequately cooked, have often been the
source of infection in such settings.
Stavropol, in the Southern Federal District of Russia, can be located on
the map at <http://www.russiasregions.com/southern_federal_district.html>.
