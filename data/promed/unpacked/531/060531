We note in the subject post the comment, "The biotype may be of interest. One reproduces by conventional sexual means, whereas the most common one through the Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand reproduces primarily via parthenogenesis."

We sought information on the topic from the entomologists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories and provide it here as it may be of interest to your readers:

Although North American medical entomologists/acarologists don't normally think of the reproductive modes of the acarine objects of their attention in terms of "biotype[s]," we do recognize the overwhelming importance of parthenogenetic capabilities in invasive species. From the very 1st encounter with specimens of _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ last year [2017] in New Jersey, the presence/absence of males was one of the 1st questions we sought to answer, after we conclusively identified the tick. All told, to date, we have looked at thousands of _H. longicornis_ specimens from the presently known US infestations, most of them immature stages, but among the adults examined, only one male has appeared. For that reason, information on the tick circulated to the public by various means has consistently alluded to the evident parthenogenetic nature of this invasive population, including in the 1st formal scientific report of the incursion just published in the May 2018 issue of the Journal of Medical Entomology 55(3): 757 - 759 [see reference below].

Dr Levings answered the question about the reproductive status of _H. longicornis_ in the USA. Finding just one male points to parthenogenesis. The abundance of immature stages in their collections suggests that this tick has become established in the USA. This is of concern because of its capacity to serve as a vector for several pathogens.
