Orange County bird die-off raising concerns among experts
---------------------------------------------------------
Shelmarie Main and Chloe Mallone were heartbroken when they saw a blue-beaked American wigeon collapsed on a pond drainage grate. His head hung down, barely keeping his beak out of the water, and his wings were splayed to the side.

The mother-daughter duo take walks along Village Pond Park most days to admire wildlife. On that day, 2 kids poking at something on the ground caught their attention. As they got closer, they realized it was a dying wigeon. His head was twisted and he barely moved. His instinct to flee seemed gone. When they touched him, he shuddered with his last breath. Just a foot away, a female mallard was struggling. Slightly more alert, the bird tried to flee but could not.

Main and Mallone moved the dying animals to safety. As they did, they discovered 2 more dead ducks. They called the county's animal control for help.

"It was horrible, there were so many," said Mallone, 20, who said she's been a bird geek since age 9. "To see one once in a while is normal but all of these at once, it was heartbreaking. At first I thought someone had been poisoning them."

In the last 2 weeks nearly 3 dozen dead and dying water fowl have been found in several areas across Orange County, including Lake Forest and Santa Ana. More than a dozen were found at the Village Pond in Lake Forest. At least 16 dead and dying ducks have been found at Carl Thornton Park near South Coast Plaza in Santa Ana. Most have been migratory birds such as the American wigeon, American coots, and some mallards.

Wildlife experts worry what a rapidly spreading disease could mean for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds that use the Pacific flyway as a migration course between northern breeding grounds and southern winter spots. In September [2012], more than 2000 birds died in Oregon following a botulism outbreak.

In the case of the dying fowl in Orange County, experts are conducting tests trying to figure out what happened. Possible culprits include botulism or other toxin or an avian virus. The condition is especially troublesome to bird experts because it could devastate tens of thousands of migratory bird communities and even impact resident fowl at local lakes.

Debbie McGuire, director of the Wetlands & Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach, has begun conducting necropsies on some of the dead birds. She and veterinarians there have also taken blood serum samples. McGuire said while it's not the time of year botulism is usually seen, a recent warm spell could have helped the neurotoxin spread and ducks could have eaten affected plants. What she's more concerned about is a virus or toxin that the migrating birds may have picked up along their route.

"Certain viruses could spread quickly," she said. "With the different species coming in, we've got some that are federally and state protected. Loosing a few individuals in their population could affect their survival as a species."

The Huntington Beach center has taken in cadavers and is treating an American wigeon and American coot, both of which are barely clinging to life. The birds show extreme weakness, an inability to stand and to hold up their heads. They are vomiting and have diarrhea and are dehydrated. Recent necropsies on a wigeon showed that whatever killed the bird came on suddenly, McGuire said.

"It was not a chronic condition that killed him," she said. "The bird died quickly with an acute onset -- which is likely a toxin."

McGuire said the 2 live birds were too weak for blood to be taken from them. If they also die, the blood will be taken then for testing, hundreds of thousands of migratory birds fly through southern California, visiting parks in Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, and Santa Ana. They stop at wetlands, marshes, and riverbeds scattered throughout the region such as Upper Newport Bay, Bolsa Chica wetlands, San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary, San Diego Creek, Santa Ana River, Prado Dam, and little lakes along the 91 freeway.

Trude Herd, project director at Sea & Sage Audubon in Irvine said that 3/4 of North America's shore and song birds and ducks migrate to or through Southern California.

Herd said if the culprit is botulism, the birds could have picked it up in soil hundreds of miles away and then dropped dead in Southern California locations.

"When most birds migrate, they migrate in flocks," she said. "It puts them at risk if the virus spreads between them. One of the challenges of migration is that there are so few wetlands left along the Pacific flyway. That puts them at risk and any kind of disease can spread through quickly. The majority you may not find dead. They may go to the ocean or a secluded place. You don't know the magnitude of death. This could be very damaging to the migratory population."

County officials, including Dr David Kieltyka, OC Animal Care's veterinarian, are investigating, said Ryan Drabek, director at OC animal Care. Several duck carcasses were not fresh enough to test, Kieltyka said. He is working closely with the Wetlands center to determine the cause. The idea of an unknown number of carcasses lying around or birds in distress is troubling to the agency.

In September 2011, a confirmed botulism outbreak, which involved a large die-off of more than 100 birds at Lake Forest lakes, the Laguna Niguel Regional Park, and decorative ponds at the Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna Niguel, had county agencies busy with necropsies. In the end, 3 duck cadavers tested positive for botulism.

Drabek cautions the public not to touch the birds and to keep a distance. Meanwhile all reports of dead or dying birds should be directed to the animal care agency or others who oversee specific jurisdictions.

"If a bird can be rehabilitated, we'll take them to the wetlands center," Drabek said. "If a carcass is found and is fresh, it can be tested and we need to be notified as quickly as possible. Our job with wildlife is to pick it up and remove it. If it becomes a broader issue, we'll get (California Department of Fish & Game) involved."

Kieltyka's hunch is that the birds are not picking up a virus but that botulism is the culprit. "What we don't want is flies and maggots coming off dead carcasses," he said. "We'll take it one step at a time."

On Thursday [15 Nov 2012], Kristi Jolliffe, a volunteer who cares for sick and injured water fowl with OC Parks, was at the Santa Ana park looking for more sick or dead ducks. She found 2 sick American coots and an Egyptian goose that had difficulty standing.

"I'm finding carcasses in trash cans that have not been properly disposed," the Laguna Niguel woman said. "Vector Control picked up a dead coot to test for West Nile virus. I'm worried that whatever this is may begin to affect the resident birds."

[The description of the birds' conditions sounds very much like botulism.

Botulism is sometimes called limberneck in ducks and other waterfowl. Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (such as chironomid (nonbiting midges) fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible, avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
