Indonesia's polio outbreak infects over 200 children in Indonesia
-----------------------------------------------
The number of children affected by the crippling polio virus in an
outbreak in Indonesia has risen to 205. The highest number of cases
is in West Java province, with 54; only one case can be confirmed in
the capital, Jakarta.
Health officials say a 2nd round of a nationwide anti-polio
vaccination campaign had fewer takers because of parents' fears of
possible harmful side effects. 2 more rounds are scheduled for 30 Aug
[2005] and 27 Sep [2005], targeting 24.3 million children.
The disease is believed to have returned to Indonesia via Saudi
Arabia, either through migrant workers or Muslim pilgrims returning
from Mecca.

16 new polio cases were confirmed today [7 Aug 2005] in Banten,
Lampung and DKI Jakarta provinces, bringing the total number of cases
to 205. 15 cases are from infected districts: Tanggamus (Lampung
province), Serang and Lebak (Banten province), and one case is from a
newly infected district: Central Jakarta (DKI Jakarta province).
These new cases are within the areas included during the 2 emergency
vaccination campaigns held on 31 May [2005] and 28 Jun [2005]. Plans
are underway for National Immunization Days -- targeting 24.4 million
children less than 5 years old throughout the country -- on 30 Aug
[2005] and 27 Sep [2005].

[The above report represents an increase of 50 cases since the last
ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak (155 cases on 29 Jul 2005). The
occurrence of cases in new areas as well as in areas already covered
by emergency vaccination campaigns is a bit disconcerting, suggesting
that the vaccination campaigns have not been reaching the susceptible
population. We await results of the planned national immunization
days later on this month (August 2005) and in September 2005.
