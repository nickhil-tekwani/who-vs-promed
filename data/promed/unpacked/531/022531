An outbreak of FMD in Tungurahua
--------------------------------
The cases were reported in Pilahuin. The SESA [Ecuadorian Animal
Health Service] closed the cattle show yesterday [22 Sep 2008], but
the order was not respected and the farmers negotiated [sold] their animals.

Yesterday [22 Sep 2008], Mario Guzman and Trajan Torres, officials
from the Center for Livestock Marketing of Ambato made an unexpected
announcement.

"People should cooperate. They have to vaccinate their cattle. The
fair is closed because of a case of FMD [foot-and-mouth disease]. The
message was broadcast with the help of loudspeakers and surprised
hundreds of cattle farmers who came to the livestock fair in Cashapamba.

Other controls
--------------
SESA has information that in addition to the 4 cattle [?those with
FMD], another 34 also were traded from the parish of Simiatug. In
this locality, according to the technicians, the farmers do not
vaccinate their animals, because they believe that the vaccine
affects their fertility.

According to the Center for Livestock Marketing of this city, the
livestock fair held in Ambato is the 2nd largest in the country. The
largest takes place in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.

The Center for Marketing is a joint venture formed by the local
municipality and the Agricultural Center. Officials from this Center
perform cattle inspections.

The size of the fairgrounds in Cashapamba is 13 200 sq m [about 142
000 sq ft]. In this sector, located north of Ambato, approximately 2
500 livestock farmers from Bolivar, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo [provinces],
and several communities from [the region of] Amazonia arrive on
Mondays to market different breeds of cattle. According to data from
the Center for Marketing and the SESA, approximately 1800 cattle are
sold weekly at this market.

The technicians began to spread the news of the disease recurrence
08:00 in the morning [23 Sep 2008]. Veterinarians from SESA were also
at the livestock fair.

They told the farmers that this past [19 Sep 2008] in the community
of Rio Blanco, in Pilahuin parish, a half hour from Ambato, 4 cattle
were identified with high fever, lassitude, and weight loss -- the
main symptoms of FMD. In addition, the technicians indicated that the
cattle were obtained from a breeder in Simiatug parish, province of
Bolivar. "But at the moment, the cattle remain isolated," said Luis
Escobar, a veterinarian from SESA.

He also said that according to investigations, the new outbreak
originated in Bolivar. "Months ago Tungurahua developed a campaign to
eradicate FMD. But the disease appears when you bring cattle from
other provinces, which have not been vaccinated," he said.

In this respect, the managing director of the Center for Marketing of
Ambato, Mario Guzman, reported that the situation is worrisome. "This
happens due to the irresponsibility of certain farmers who do not
bother to vaccinate their livestock. Each dose costs just USD 0.30."

However, few farmers complied with the provision of the Agricultural
Center and SESA. In the area around the fairgrounds, the farmers
began the marketing of livestock.

One of them, a farmer from Chibuleo parish, stated, "We do not know
anything about this new outbreak. Therefore we got to the fair early.
Our livestock are healthy and vaccinated." He paid USD 10 to
transport his cow on a truck. "I have to sell my stock anyway, in
order to pay debts. I took out a loan to enroll my child in school,"
he worried.

[Another farmer from] Santa Rosa parish, located a half an hour from
Ambato, did the same. "This decision is unfair. If the cattle are
vaccinated there is no problem, "she said while trying to sell a cow
at USD 900.

[Yet another farmer, this one from] Mocha canton, requested that the
authorities announce in advance when they decide to close the show.
"The vendors who arrive here pay high prices for freight. We have no
alternative but to sell the cattle."

Officials of the Center for Marketing and SESA did not prevent the
cattle sales, despite the warning.

Guzman reported seeking assistance from the Tungurahua Provincial
Council. The Council has been promoting a program to provide free
veterinary care in the communities since last year [2007]. The goal
is that the Prefecture assigns a group of veterinarians who travel
through the rural parishes and determine if there are other sick animals.

SESA will also continue to monitor the cattle that are isolated in Rio Blanco.

In recent days, officials conducted inspections in the communities of
Bolivar, especially in Simiatug parish. The purpose [of these
inspections] is to determine if there are other cattle with symptoms of FMD.

They have not confirmed if the livestock fair will take place next
Monday [29 Sep 2008]. Nor did they identify, as of press time, if the
authorities would declare quarantine in Tungurahua and Bolivar
provinces, as prevention.

Also, SESA announced that it would conduct a disinfection of the
Cashapamba fairgrounds. Another action will be to begin training
programs in rural communities and implement controls in other livestock fairs.

[Certain strains of FMD are extremely contagious and can spread
easily between animals. The authorities are suspicious of the
evidence of disease and are trying to limit the spread.
