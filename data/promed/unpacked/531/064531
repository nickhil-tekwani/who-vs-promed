Crimean-Congo hem. fever; the current situation in Kosovo
----------------------------------------------------------
The following figures, provided by the Institute of Public Health in
Pristina, summarize the current situation regarding Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever in Kosovo. Contrary to the impression given by the
previous report, cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever are not
particularly unexpected in this region. For this reason the single
confirmed case recorded in Malisevo this year has not yet been notified
through the usual channels.
The figures for the last five years are as follows:
1995 - 119 cases, 16 fatal in Peja 68/9 ;
1996 - 23 cases, 5 fatal in Peja 9/2;
1997 - 8 cases, none fatal;
1998 - one case;
1999 - 7 cases, two fatal;
2000 - 4 cases. So far only one of the latter (in Malisevo) has been
confirmed serologically. Two are still undergoing serological test, and the
remaining one has been scored negative.

[The figures provided by Dr. Brian Gushulak change the perception of the
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) situation in Southern Europe. It is
clear that CCHF virus is present in this region and that there is potential
for spread beyond this region. Health professionals should be aware that
travellers in and out of this region may be exposed to and have contracted
infection where there is evidence of contact with ticks. - Mod.CP
