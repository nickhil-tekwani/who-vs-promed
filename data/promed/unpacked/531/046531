Export of live chickens resumes from mainland to HK
----------------------------------------------------
The first batch of 6000 live chickens passed the quarantine checkpoint in
the city of Shenzhen Tuesday morning, marking the resumption of live
chicken export to Hong Kong after a 2.5-month suspension due to a bird flu
outbreak.
The 1st batch of live chickens came from chicken farms in Huadu district of
Guangzhou city and Shenzhen city.
The interior area's poultry exports to Hong Kong and Macao were suspended
after cases of avian influenza were spotted in January 2004. Live chicken
exports to Macao were restored on 5 Mar 2004.
After being checked by the Hong Kong side, these chickens will go on the
market in Hong Kong Wednesday.
In the Jiangfeng Chicken Farm in Huadu, where 2000 of the chickens came
from, the Guangdong administration of quality supervision, inspection and
quarantine quarantined the chickens 5 days ago. They also took samples to
test for bird flu H5 antibodies. On Tuesday morning, just before leaving
for Hong Kong, the chickens also received another quarantine check.
In the next 3 days, Jiangfeng Chicken Farm will also export 2000 live
chickens to Hong Kong every day, according to Cao Yun, manager of the farm.

[This consignment is the 1st stage in the implementation of the pilot plan
described in update 62 (see reference). We asked whether the sampling and
laboratory tests reportedly planned at destination -- namely Hong Kong --
were also required from the exporting farms in mainland China. The current
posting provides an affirmative reply. Data on the testing techniques
applied at both ends will be useful. - Mod.AS]
