The United States is seeing unseasonably high levels of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases among children, causing overflowing admissions at pediatric hospitals in several parts of the country.

According to National Public Radio, children's hospitals in the Washington, DC, area, including Children's National Hospital, Inova Fairfax, and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, are at or near capacity. And doctors at a Fort Worth, Texas, hospital say they are seeing more than 300 cases per day.

Most doctors believe that after 2 years of distance learning, shuttered daycares, and mask wearing in public, many children have not been exposed to common childhood respiratory illnesses and have an "immune debt" that is leaving them at a disadvantage this cold and flu season, according to US News & World Report. Pre-pandemic, almost all US children typically contracted RSV before age 2.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), RSV annually causes 2.1 million outpatient hospital visits and 58 000 hospitalizations for US children 5 and under.

"Prior to 2020, seasonal patterns for RSV in the United States were very consistent. However, the patterns of circulation for RSV and other common respiratory viruses have been disrupted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic early in 2020," the CDC said. "Beginning in the southern region of the United States, RSV circulation began to rise in the spring months of 2021. It is too soon to predict when the previous seasonal patterns will return."

["Pediatricians are mainly concerned about children younger than one because their airways are so tiny, Dr. Sarah Ash Combs, [an emergency medicine physician at Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC], said.

"However, RSV also tends to be harsh on children who were born prematurely, Combs said.

"'Even if you are a little older, maybe you're a one-year-old, but you were born at 24 weeks of age, you are at higher risk,' Combs said.

"Children with a history of lung illness or congenital heart problems also are at higher risk for a severe RSV infection, Combs said.

"This is an odd year for RSV, however, because even kids who should weather the virus well are coming down with bad cases, Combs added.

"'What's a little different this year is so far we have also been seeing atypically some otherwise healthy children -- so not these very young infants, not these children with longstanding health conditions -- getting sicker than we would expect from RSV,' Combs said."
