Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health and the World Health
Organization (WHO) say a cholera outbreak in the northern province of
Ghazni has been brought under control, according to a WHO press release.

The outbreak, which sickened at least 130 people in the Nowa
district, began 9 Aug 2010, when a health NGO (non-governmental
organization) confirmed the 60 initial cases through laboratory
testing. The Ministry of Public Health and the WHO immediately
deployed staff with emergency medical supplies to treat the outbreak.
Since then, the outbreak has slowed to just 3 new cases daily, the
WHO reported in its release.

Diarrheal diseases are common in Afghanistan, where just 23 percent
of residents have access to safe drinking water. To limit the expanse
of outbreaks, Afghanistan has created the Disease Early Warning
System, which is now operational in 284 districts in all 34
provinces, with more than 300 surveillance officers tracking disease outbreaks

[3] Cholera - India (Tamil Nadu)

Cholera cases have been increasingly reported for the past 3 weeks,
especially among the residents of North Chennai, with many patients
being treated in hospitals for the bacterial disease. Doctors
attribute the trigger to consumption of contaminated water amid rains
and water-logging.

Dr Mohana Kumar of Ezhil hospital in Tondiarpet confirmed, on Tue 31
Sep 2010, a spurt in cholera patients, adding that some of the cases
had been severe owing to a mix-up of drinking water and sewage water.
"Of the many diarrheal cases, there are at least 3 confirmed cases of
cholera every week. The affected age group ranges from from 5 to 55
years," he pointed out.

Most of the cases are from Vysarpadi, Tiruvotriyur, Tondiarpet and
other areas in North Chennai. A hospital authority at the
Communicable Diseases Hospital in Tondiarpet informed that the last
week saw more than 20 persons getting admitted with serious diarrheal
disorder, and that a few of them did test positive for cholera.

A senior official at the Department of Public Health and Preventive
Medicine said in 2010 has so far reported 707 cases of cholera and a
death prior to August 2010. August 2010 alone has had reported 166
cases of cholera. The main reason is unhygienic water supply system,
he said, asking for a better water supply system.

There has been a outbreak of gastroenteritis in Ludhiana and around
34 people have been admitted to local hospitals. Most of the cases
have been registered from the Niwasi Bihari Colony, Sherpur Colony
and Gaspura area of the district, where, according to the
authorities, the disease has broken out mainly due to waterlogging.
Many people have died due to the disease.

Ramesh Tiwari, a resident of the Niwasi Bihari Colony, also said that
the waterborne disease broke out due to continuous waterlogging in the area.

"There is always waterlogging here in this area due to jammed sewage
system. This has caused the outbreak of gastroenteritis in the area.
All the clinics and hospitals in area are full of gastroenteritis
patients," said Tiwari.

Local administration has also confirmed the outbreak, and has said
that the numbers of the cases are increasing every day. "Almost 5 to
6 cases are coming every day. Most of them are coming from a
particular area. Symptoms of the disease are that one suffers from
vomiting, dysentery, and this can lead to dehydration," said Kuldeep
Singh, Assistant Commissioner, Ludhiana.

Within 5 days, gastroenteritis has already taken 19 lives.

Nearly 60 students and teachers at a technical school in northwest
China, including some from a town ravaged by mudslides, have been
hospitalized with dysentery, state media said Tue 31 Aug 2010.

It was not immediately clear how many of those affected in the city
of Lanzhou had come from the town of Zhouqu, where 1700 people were
left dead or missing in a huge mudslide.

Hundreds of students and teachers from Zhouqu were sent to Lanzhou,
the capital of Gansu, on Saturday, 28 Aug 2010, for the start of the
school year while damaged classrooms are rebuilt in the remote town,
Xinhua news agency said.

"Some students began feeling uncomfortable Saturday night [28 Aug
2010] and the number increased Sunday and Monday. Most of my
classmates have been taken to hospital," Yin Teng, a student at the
school, told Xinhua. Gansu vice-governor Hao Yuan said only a few of
those in hospital were still suffering fevers and diarrhea, 2 of the
symptoms of dysentery. If left untreated, the infection can be fatal.
