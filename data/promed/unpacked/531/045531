Results of disease tests received Friday [23 Sep 2011] for a cattle
herd in Montana's Park County have confirmed that some of the animals
were infected with brucellosis.

The tests were done on milk samples collected from 6 cows in the
150-head herd, Montana livestock officials said. Those animals were
slaughtered Thursday [22 Sep 2011] after previous blood tests
indicated the animals might be infected. Brucellosis can cause
pregnant animals to prematurely abort their young. It has been largely
eradicated nationwide but persists in wildlife in parts of Montana,
Idaho, and Wyoming around Yellowstone National Park.

The remainder of the unidentified Park County herd has been
quarantined. The infection marks the region's 15th found in cattle or
domestic bison since 2004.

Until recently, infections brought harsh sanctions on states where the
outbreaks occurred. But stricter testing and disease requirements over
the past several years prompted federal agriculture officials to adopt
a more lenient response to occasional infections. The government also
no longer requires that entire herds be slaughtered when infections
are found in just a few animals.

Because of the changes, Montana can retain its brucellosis-free
designation from the US Department of Agriculture despite the latest
infections, said agency spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole. "As long as the
state quarantines the affected herd and a herd plan is developed for
the affected herd, it won't affect their state status," she said. A
herd plan would include testing remaining animals from the ranch where
brucellosis was found and removing those that test positive.

The infected cattle from Park County had all been vaccinated. Because
5 were still pregnant, veterinarians believe the vaccine was working,
said Steve Merritt with the Montana Department of Livestock. "Normally
with unvaccinated cows that had been exposed, they would have lost
those calves," he said. But he added that they still could have
potentially spread the disease to other cows, necessitating their
removal from the herd.

Merritt said cattle on surrounding ranches also would be tested for
brucellosis to ensure they were not exposed.

Although the source of the infection has not yet been determined,
state officials suspect it may have come from elk.

Despite efforts to contain the disease, so far it has proven
impossible to eliminate it from wildlife.

Thousands of Yellowstone bison have been captured and sent to
slaughter over the past decade to prevent transmissions to cattle when
the bison attempt to migrate to lower elevations in Montana. That has
not stopped periodic transmissions to cattle from the tens of
thousands of elk that roam freely across the Yellowstone region.

[This article has some interesting wording. Testing was conducted in
milk because the blood test indicated the animals MIGHT be infected.
This strikes me as strange since there are some good tests for use in
cattle. Generally more than one type of test is used before calling an
animal positive for this disease.

The disease is serious not only for reproduction, but can be passed in
the milk. It also represents a health risk/threat to those people
closely associated or exposed to birthing fluids or milk.
