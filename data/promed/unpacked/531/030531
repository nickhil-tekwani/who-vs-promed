At least 38 people have died of Japanese encephalitis in Assam in the past 3 weeks, while 251 were infected, prompting the Health Department to undertake various measures to deal with the disease, officials said on Friday [22 Jul 2022]. A fresh death was reported from Biswanath district on Friday [22 Jul 2022].

According to the National Health Mission (NHM), since [1 Jul 2022], at least 38 people have died after being infected by the vectorborne disease in more than 20 of the state's 35 districts. On the direction of the NHM authorities, district rapid response teams were constituted to keep a close watch on the situation and to take preventive measures.

Japanese encephalitis and malaria kill many people in Assam every year, specifically during the monsoon season that usually starts in May and stretches to October. Principal secretary, health, Avinash Joshi and NHM director M S Lakshmi Priya are in close touch with the district authorities and have asked them to remain pro-active to deal with the situation. The NHM has also issued a standard operating procedure and guidelines to tackle the situation arising with the outbreak and health workers have been conducting a massive awareness campaign against the disease.

Last year [2021], at least 40 deaths were reported due to Japanese encephalitis, officials said. Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by infected mosquitoes mainly during the monsoon.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 38, with one more on 22 Jul 2022. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on Tuesday (19 Jul 2022) to 251 cases on 22 Jul 2022. Interestingly, these 251 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome. There is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state. The JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
