[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of Rutacea), it affects hosts in only a few other families. It appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Symptoms may include mottling, yellowing, and necrosis of leaves; distortion and spots on fruits; under-bark pitting and gumming on twigs; and branch and crown dieback followed eventually by death of the tree. Disease severity depends on viral strains, citrus variety, and the scion-rootstock combination. CTV strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting, and a mild type. Strains may occur singly or in combination.

The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner. Infectious insects may be carried on the wind for long distances. CTV can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. Disease management for CTV may include clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum, and vector control. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas.

The source publication above specifies that CTV in Laos was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by ELISA. Three different strains are reported. Further research is suggested to assess the impact of the virus on citrus crops in the country.
