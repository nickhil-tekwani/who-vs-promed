Northern leaf blight threatens Georgia corn
-------------------------------------------
Georgia Extension Plant Pathologist Bob Kemerait warns corn growers to
get ready to fight damaging diseases in their 2010 crops.

"Southern rust can devastate non-resistant hybrids," says Kemerait.
"It has been the no. 1 disease on Georgia corn until last year [2009].
The spores don't over-winter here, but they are carried in the winds
from Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America." A new race showed up
in 2008 that successfully attacked [previously] resistant hybrids.

Last year [2009], northern corn leaf blight overtook southern rust as
the primary corn disease threat in Georgia. Kemerait saw yield in one
field reduced from 200 to 70 bushels per acre as a result of this
disease. "I can almost guarantee that northern corn leaf blight will
be a problem in 2010," says Kemerait. "The spores are out there now
over-wintering. You are more likely to have this problem where you
plant corn behind corn."

Kemerait also says root-knot and stubby-root nematodes are main
concerns for corn growers. Nematicide testing in recent years showed
that fumigation prior to planting helped corn growth and led to good
yield increases where nematode populations caused significant crop
damage. New seed treatments may also help corn growers for fields with
low to moderate nematode infestations.

[2] Fusarium, maize, wheat, barley, new strain - Pacific Northwest

New blight strain appears
--------------------------
Idaho farmers are taking precautions against a strain of fusarium head
blight new to the Pacific Northwest. Juliet Windes, University of
Idaho, said the new strain has been found in the Magic Valley, Idaho.

"This particular disease really likes corn, and we keep growing more
and more corn," Windes said. "When you have small grains following
corn, the risk of this disease increases tremendously." Spores can be
locally airborne, but it typically moves with the corn seed, occurring
where there's a lot of crop residue.

The new strain will cause more head blight, or scabs, on wheat and
barley than the strains already found in the region, Windes said. It
has been more prevalent in the Midwest and has appeared in Montana,
but is new to Idaho. Other locations in the Pacific Northwest could be
impacted, she said.

Windes recommends crop rotation without planting grain after corn,
destruction of residue through plowing under and fungicides. Resistant
varieties and awareness of the conditions at flowering will be key to
controlling the disease, she said.

Some toxins produced by the strain can be dangerous to humans and some
farm animals. With malt barley, it can cause gushing in beer
production, Windes said.

[3] Stripe rust, wheat - Louisiana, Texas

Wheat: stripe rust in Louisiana
-------------------------------
In Louisiana, stripe rust is "statewide, right now," says Steve
Harrison of the LSU [Louisiana State University]. "Whether it becomes
a big issue or not, it's a little early to say." Generally, though,
"conditions have been good for stripe rust development. I expect it to
continue moving for another a couple of weeks, at least." He wasn't
surprised by stripe rust arrival.

A mid-March [2010] rust alert was issued to Arkansas producers
"because Louisiana and Texas have reported widespread stripe rust,"
says Gene Milus, University of Arkansas. "Most of ArkansasÂ’ stripe
rust inoculum probably comes from those states." In past years, "we
did a good job of eliminating the very susceptible varieties, but
someone may have planted a very susceptible variety thinking they can
get away with it."

If conditions are favorable for stripe rust, says Milus, "one
well-timed fungicide application on a 'susceptible' variety will
protect the crop from most losses. But you'll need 2 fungicide
applications to protect a 'very susceptible' variety. That's a big
difference."

[Northern leaf blight of maize is caused by the fungus _Setosphaeria
turcica_. Symptoms include leaf spots which may form large necrotic
areas and kill entire leaves affecting plant vigour and yield. The
disease is favoured by humidity and temperatures of 20-25 deg C (68-77
deg F). Disease management mainly uses resistant varieties or hybrids
and cultural methods (ploughing under of crop residues, crop rotation).

Southern rust of maize caused by _Puccinia polysora_ may lead to
significant losses of over 50 percent. It is favoured by warm, humid
conditions making it an important disease in tropical areas. Genetic
resistance and fungicides are mainly used in disease management.

Several species each of root-knot and stubby-root nematodes are known
to affect maize. Disease management of nematodes is difficult and
usually requires an integrated approach which may include pathogen
exclusion, resistant crop varieties and long term crop rotation.
Elimination of nematodes from infected fields is usually not possible.

Several species of fungi originally classified in the genus _Fusarium_
cause a number of head blight, stalk rot, seedling root rot, and ear
and stalk rot diseases in grain crops such as maize, wheat, barley,
rye, and oats. Pathogens affecting these hosts may be different
phylogenetic species or strains, which are often limited to particular
regions of the world. These diseases can cause yield losses of up to
45 percent in small grain crops, reduce the grade of harvested grain,
and may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins which can
seriously affect livestock. For any given host species, only certain
fungal strains produce toxins. Disease management generally includes
timely fungicide applications and crop varieties with reduced
susceptibility.

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per
cent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and
a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles
during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living host
plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease management
includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and
control of volunteer crops.
