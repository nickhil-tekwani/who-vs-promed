_Aedes albopictus_ Not in UK
--------------------------
On 6 Aug 2003 ProMED carried a report entitled Asian Mosquito
Poses Deadly Health Threat [see ref. below]. This was based on a
press report in the British newspaper, The Telegraph, of 6 Aug
2003. This and other items in the British press and on the BBC
variously reported that _Aedes albopictus_ had been found on
ships in UK ports, actually found breeding on the UK mainland, and
statements purported to have come from the UK government
Health Protection Agency (HPA) that _Aedes albopictus_ was
strongly suspected of already being in Britain.
I have in been in contact with the HPA and they say all these
statements are untrue and are the result of misreporting by the
Press.
From my own knowledge of British mosquitoes, I can say with
confidence that _Aedes albopictus_ has NOT been recorded from
the UK.
