Cereal growers are being warned that an aphid-carried viral disease could hit their crops. Last winter's [2015-16] abnormally mild weather saw aphids flying until after Christmas, resulting in the most widespread level of barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease seen for more than 50 years.

Experts advise using a seed treatment in high-risk BYD situations and recommend the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, or together with fungicides, which gives protection for about 6 weeks.

Problems can occur with early-sown crops that may need a top-up insecticide spray in the autumn. The 2 main BYD vectors [are] the bird cherry-oat and grain aphids. The only spray treatments available are pyrethroids. Bird cherry-oat aphids are still susceptible to pyrethroids, but 50 per cent of the grain aphid population are now resistant to these products.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and is the most destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3rd. It affects a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize and rye. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family _Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) mentioned above are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors. Neonicotinoid insecticides, as recommended above, are regulated by many countries due to a risk of pest insects developing resistance and possible environmental effects.
