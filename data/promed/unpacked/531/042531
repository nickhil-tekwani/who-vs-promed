The mayor of Magdalena municipality, Jaime Alverez, on Friday [15 Mar 2013] expressed his concern about the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever cases in this populace of Beni [department] and requested that health authorities take the necessary precautions to prevent this disease. He said that last week he had alerted the Departmental Health Services (SEDES) in order to avoid complications of an epidemic such as happened with dengue.

"We want results where they tell us, 'we have a hemorrhagic fever program' where the people feel secure about living in our towns and our communities," he stated. The mayor stated that one person had died on Wednesday [13 Mar 2013] from hemorrhagic fever.

In his judgment, a departmental hemorrhagic fever program must be decentralized to the endemic area which occur in Mamore and Itenez provinces. [In Bolivia, provinces are subdivisions within departments (state equivalent units). - Mod.TY]

The Governor of Beni [department], Carmelo Lens, stated on Friday [15 Mar 2013] that a health commission will go to Magdalena municipality on Saturday [16 Mar 2013] to assess risks of an increase in cases of hemorrhagic fever. "We are going to Magdalena to have a relevant on-site report and take pertinent actions," he said.

Lens stated that the mayor of Magdalena has the responsibility to combat this disease and others such as dengue. According to the epidemiologist of the Departmental Health Services, Wilfredo Camargo, 2 people have died of hemorrhagic fever in the 1st months of this year [2013].

[Last year (2012), ProMED-mail reported that 13 people had been infected with Machupo virus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever and 7 had died as a consequence of the disease. In Beni department, 5 municipalities, including Magdalena, were reported to have had large populations of _Calomys callosus_ mice, the reservoir host of Machupo virus, an arenavirus that can cause persistent infections in the mice. Apparently, this situation still exists.
