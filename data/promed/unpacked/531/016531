New bird flu outbreak hits Indonesia
------------------------------------
Hundreds of chickens at a farm in Indonesia have died of a strain of bird
flu that is potentially deadly to humans. An official said lab tests showed
that 350 chickens at the farm at Kranggan Harjo on the central island of
Java have died of the H5N1 virus, a lethal strain, which has killed at
least 30 people in South East Asia this year.
"The bird flu virus was of the H5N1 strain," the local head of the animal
husbandry office, Gembong Murdowo, was quoted by the Jakarta Post daily.
There was no immediate confirmation from officials. Murdowo said the
carcasses of the dead chickens had been burned to prevent the virus from
spreading.
At least 30 people have died of bird flu in Vietnam and Thailand since the
start of a major outbreak in late 2003. No Indonesians are known to have
been infected by the virus.
Indonesia in July launched a major vaccination program to eradicate bird
flu, which was lingering in some districts. Officials said the virus had
resurfaced because some farmers had neglected procedures by using illegal
vaccines and restocking their poultry too early.

Breeders get free bird flu vaccine
----------------------------------
Poultry breeders in Grobogan regency, Central Java, have received 300 000
doses of bird flu vaccine for free after the highly pathogenic virus killed
more than 350 chickens at a poultry farm in Kranggan Harjo village last week.
"The vaccine has been distributed to the breeders. We have asked for one
million doses, but that amount will be provided in stages," said head of
the Grobogan husbandry and fisheries office, Gembong Murdowo, on Monday.
"We don't want to repeat the same mistake in which 400 000 chickens were
killed here in 2003. The moment we were certain that the virus attacked a
farm in Toroh district, we immediately requested vaccine assistance from
the central government," he added.
Gembong said the distribution of the free vaccine was focused on 5
districts considered to be prone to the spread of bird flu -- Toroh,
Grobogan, Penawangan, Karangrayung, and Tegowanu. There are 19 districts in
Grobogan. Speaking to reporters in Grobogan, he said that only layers were
being infected at the moment. "The incubation period for the virus is 14
days to 20 days. There is a possibility that chickens bred for their meat
had been infected as well, but may had already been sold before showing
symptoms. The H5NI bird flu virus is not harmful to humans as long as the
meat is well-cooked," Gembon said.
Data from the Ministry of Agriculture shows that during the August
2003-July 2004 period, at least 8 178 493 poultry died of bird flu in
Central Java. The data indicated that the total number of poultry deaths
from the epidemic reached 16 237 635 in 16 provinces throughout the country.
Central Java was the province worst-hit by the bird flu. The total number
of poultry throughout the country stands at 242 923 094 as of last month
[September 2004].
Gembong said the bird flu had actually hit Penawangan district in April
this year, in which 750 layers were culled. "However, the case was not
noticed by reporters," he added.
Many poultry farmers in Grobogan were forced to quit their business due to
the bird flu epidemic in 2003. Among the victims was a breeder in Grobogan
who had 15 000 chickens. A similar situation also happened to a breeder who
had 750 chickens, and to another who had 3000 chickens. The 2 farmers were
traumatized by the bird flu epidemic and decided to quit the business.
