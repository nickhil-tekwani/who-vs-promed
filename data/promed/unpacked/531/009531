A deadly bacterial variant known as NDM-4, which is also called the "super bug", has been found by the medical researchers at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College of Aligarh Muslim University [AMU; in Uttar Pradesh state] from the hospital's sewage.

The finding of studies conducted by a team of scientists during the 1st 3 months of this year [2014] have been published in the latest issue of the Journal of Medical Microbiology UK (Khan AU, Parvez S. Detection of blaNDM-4 in _Escherichia coli_ from hospital sewage in India. J Med Microbiol. 2014; pii: jmm.0.076026-0. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.076026-0.; published ahead of print July 28, 2014). This is the 1st recorded presence of this particular strain of deadly antibiotic resistant "super bug" in India and the fallout of these findings is likely to be a cause of serious concern to medical authorities in the country.

"Sewage water samples from 3 sites within 10 metres [33 ft] from the washrooms of the general ward at the hospital were randomly picked and investigated," said Dr Asad Ullah Khan, chief coordinator of the Interdisciplinary Biotechnology Lab at AMU. Khan, who headed this research team along with Dr Shahdab Parvez said that so far this bug had only been detected in Cameroon, Denmark, France, and the Czech Republic. "There is no need for any sort of panic but because of poor hygiene standards in the country the detection of these bacteria certainly means that we have to spread more awareness nationwide regarding the urgent need of taking due precautions with regards to safe drinking water and uncontaminated food," Khan said.

The high risk group for these bacteria are people with very low resistance, such as cancer and HIV patients, and people with good health are relatively safe provided they follow rules of basic personal hygiene, he added. He pointed out that of 52 samples only one confirmed case [one sewage water sample?] of NDM-4 was isolated but in view of the fact that this bug multiplies at a very rapid pace even a very, very small presence cannot be taken lightly.

NDM-4 detected at Aligarh is a more deadly variant of the New Delhi metallo[-beta-] lactamase NDM-1 first isolated from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in [2008]. The detection of this bug had led to a controversy in international medical circles regarding the "origins" of this bug.

Khan said that new variants of the original bug have been isolated in recent years and NDM-4 is the latest of these variants. The multi drug resistant bug is the result of gross overuse of antibiotics. It may be mentioned that the original bacterium NDM-1 has already been reported widely from different parts of the world, particularly north east India.

[NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) was first identified in a strain of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolated in Sweden in 2008 from an Indian patient (1). NDM-1 is a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) that confers broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance, hydrolyzing penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems but sparing aztreonam, a monobactam. NDM-1 subsequently spread rapidly worldwide.

A clinical _Escherichia coli_ isolate from a urinary culture of a patient hospitalized in India in January 2010 was found to be resistant to all beta-lactams, including carbapenems, and expressed a novel MBL, NDM-4, differing from NDM-1 by a single amino acid substitution (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318389/). NDM-4 possessed increased hydrolytic activity toward carbapenems and several cephalosporins compared to that of NDM-1.

The finding of NDM-4 in sewage draining from washrooms of a general ward at a hospital suggests that this organism was being excreted by one or more patients housed on that ward, unbeknownst to the medical teams caring for them and not subject to infection control interventions.

Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of carbapenemase-producing isolates include in some circumstances conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing among high-risk patients and placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions (2).

However, the presence of NDM-4 could be more commonplace. For example, NDM-1 has been similarly found in sewage, but was also found in the drinking water in New Delhi (3).
