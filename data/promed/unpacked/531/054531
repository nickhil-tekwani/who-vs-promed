A mystery disease has killed dozens of Warao Indians in recent months
in a remote area of northeastern Venezuela, according to indigenous
leaders and researchers from the University of California at
Berkeley, who informed health officials here of the outbreak on
Wednesday [6 Aug 2008].

At least 38 people have died, including 16 since the start of June
[2008], said Charles Briggs, an anthropologist at Berkeley, and Dr
Clara Mantini-Briggs, a medical researcher there. They are a
husband-and-wife team known for their research on a cholera outbreak
that killed 500 people in Venezuela in the early 1990s.

Preliminary studies of the latest outbreak indicate that it may be a
type of infectious rabies transmitted by bites from bats, the
researchers said. The symptoms, which last 3 to 6 weeks, include
partial paralysis, convulsions, and an extreme fear of water, they
said, and those who die become rigid just before death. The disease
is believed to be fatal in most cases.

"The authorities must investigate this outbreak with extreme
urgency," said Dr Mantini-Briggs, a Venezuelan public health expert
who has advised President Hugo Chavez's government on policies to
combat dengue fever. "Fear about the disease has intensified among
the Warao while a preventative response is needed now."

[The signs given here are compatible with rabies. It is possible that
rabies virus is being transmitted there by vampire bats, most likely
_Desmodus rotundus_. Attacks by these bats on humans are uncommon,
but does occur (for an example of human rabies from bites by rabies
virus infected vampire bats in eastern, lowland Peru recently, see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20050120.0193). If these are rabies cases of
vampire bat origin, it is curious that no rabies cases in horses or
cattle are mentioned, since vampire bats prefer to feed on them if
they are present, nor are bat bites on the patients mentioned, which
would be obvious.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information
concerning this outbreak as it becomes available.
