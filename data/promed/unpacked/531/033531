An outbreak of sudden cat deaths has been blamed on irresponsible car
owners and anti-freeze, researchers have revealed.

The sweet-tasting but deadly substance used to keep cars running in
winter has been found in a spate of poison deaths in 5 areas around
the country. The chemical -- ethylene glycol, a major component of
anti-freeze in car radiators -- has been identified by scientists
testing cats with no known cause of death.

Professor Sean Callanan, from the School of Veterinary Medicine,
University College Dublin (UCD), said reports began to come in from
vets before his team began proper testing. "Over the past few weeks we
have seen an increase in the number of cats referred to the UCD
Veterinary Hospital by local veterinary practitioners," he said.
"Many have died suddenly or after a short illness, and our post-mortem
examinations have confirmed that these animals experienced rapid
kidney failure following the ingestion of ethylene glycol, a major
component of anti-freeze."

The alarm was raised after cats in Cavan, parts of Dublin, Wexford,
the Midlands, and Athlone were found to be dying in groups. The
professor of veterinary pathology warned that dogs are also at risk
from poisoning. Most of the deaths were family pets and it is
believed cats are more susceptible as they lick the substance in small
puddles while dogs look for larger water sources. A few millilitres
will kill a cat. Cats are also more at risk as they spend time
outside fending for themselves and have a habit of lying under warm
cars.

There is no way to be certain how or where the cats ingest the
chemical although suspicion has fallen on leaky car radiators and
irresponsible disposal of anti-freeze products, the professor said.
"We cannot identify the precise sources of the ethylene glycol that is
poisoning an increasing number of cats, but we are asking people to be
vigilant with the storage, use, and disposal of their anti-freeze
products. Ethylene glycol has a sweet taste, so any small puddles
created from leaky car radiators, or improperly discarded or stored
anti-freeze will pose a poisonous threat to small animals."

It only takes a small quantity of ethylene glycol to poison small
animals and induce relatively rapid kidney failure. The professor
said that after ingesting the chemical, small animals may initially
present with relatively vague, non-specific signs such as being dull
and listless. Other damaging side-effects include uncoordinated
movement before they move rapidly on to kidney failure and death.

[Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting chemical
found in many household products, including antifreeze, de-icing
products, detergents, paints, and cosmetics. It is poisonous if
swallowed.

Engine coolant is another name for antifreeze. Regardless of the name
it is a cryoprotectant used by the internal combustion engine and
other heat transfer mechanisms. It protects against freezing as well
as overheating of the engine. The most common coolant is ethylene
glycol.

Ethylene glycol as an engine coolant is often a yellow-green syrup
appearing fluid. It seems to have a sweet taste and is part of the
reason animals may consume it.

Ethylene glycol can and does cause kidney failure. Ethylene glycol is
metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to form glycolaldehyde, which is
eventually metabolized to glycolic acid. This causes acidosis.
Glycolate is transformed to into glyoxylic acid, which may become
oxalate crystals. These crystals accumulate in the kidney. The
precipitation of calcium oxalate in the renal cortex results in
decreased glomerular filtration and renal insufficiency. Consequently,
the kidneys often fail. While this is a much simplified explanation of
the actual toxic pathway, it nevertheless allows for a brief glance at
the pathway from ingestion to renal failure.

Animals may initially display nervousness, described as "walking on
egg shells". This is subtle and owners may not notice it. The animal
may seem ataxic, may vomit and then appear to be relatively normal for
about a day, before becoming listless, and very ill. This is a
simplified explanation of a series of events, but it helps explain why
animal owners may miss the early signs, especially if the cats are
feral.

The 1st signs of ethylene glycol ingestion are similar to the signs
caused by drinking alcohol (ethanol). Within a few hours, more toxic
effects become apparent. Other clinical signs may include nausea,
vomiting, convulsions, stupor, or even coma.

An overdose of ethylene glycol can damage the brain, lungs, liver,
kidneys and lungs. The poisoning causes disturbances in the body's
chemistry, including metabolic acidosis. The disturbances may be
severe enough to cause profound shock, organ failure and death. As
little as 120 milliliters (approximately 4 fluid ounces) of ethylene
glycol may be enough to kill an average-sized man. The goal of
treatment is to support the body's vital functions and remove the
poison from the body.

While people with old vehicles, or those in poor repair may be
suspected, it may also be a case of malicious poisoning by someone who
may not appreciate loose cats in the area.
