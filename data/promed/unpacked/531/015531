Grey heron found H5 positive in HK
-----------------------------------
A grey heron found in Hong Kong earlier has been confirmed as an H5 avian
flu suspect, and further tests are under way for the nature of the virus,
the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said Saturday [11
Dec 2004].
The department collected the bird in Lok Ma Chau on 3 Dec 2004. Appearing
to be sick at the time, it was sent to the New Territories North Animal
Management Center for isolation and observation. It died the following day.
A postmortem examination later at the department's Tai Lung Veterinary
Laboratory showed the bird to be an H5 suspect. Subsequent tests on the
bird all yielded an H5 positive result.
As a precautionary measure, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection has
traced all 6 staff who had contact with the bird and has found that they
are in good health. Their medical condition will be monitored over the next
few days.
As a safety measure, all poultry farms within 5 km of the location where
the bird was found have been inspected. There have been no abnormal deaths,
and the chickens show no symptoms of bird flu.
Grey herons are a frequent winter visitor but rarely visit Hong Kong in the
summer. They are not a resident species in Hong Kong.
