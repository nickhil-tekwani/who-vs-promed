The valley district of Swat in northern Pakistan is experiencing a huge outbreak of hepatitis A in which hundreds have been infected, according to an Express Tribune report on Tue 19 Feb 2013. The wards are full at hospitals in the region, and even dozens of policemen have been sickened by the viral infection.

The source of the problem is poor hygiene in the area, contaminated water more specifically. According to the report: "The garbage and sanitation lines fall into streams. The municipality also throws all the city garbage in the streams, which has not only created air pollution but also water pollution," Zahir Khan, a doctor in Mingora, told The Express Tribune newspaper. He further said that a majority of the people drink water from the streams where the water is contaminated, as these people have no alternative sources for drinking water. "Hundreds of patients suffering with hepatitis A have already been admitted in various hospitals. It seems that contaminated water has gotten mixed into the potable water system, which has caused the epidemic," Dr Abdul Wasay said.

Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes, may occur a few days after [other] symptoms appear. Anyone with these symptoms should contact a health care provider. The incubation period, or time between exposure and symptoms, is typically 28 days. It is possible for hepatitis A to be active but not show symptoms for up to 7 days. Symptoms usually last one to 2 weeks but can last longer. Young children with hepatitis A often have no symptoms.

Hepatitis A is spread person-to-person and through a fecal-oral transmission route and typically occurs when a person eats food or drinks a beverage contaminated by someone with the virus. The virus is not spread by coughing, sneezing, or by casual contact. Severe complications from hepatitis A are rare and occur more often in people who have liver disease or a weakened immune system.

Thorough hand washing after visits to the toilet, before touching food or drink, and after changing a diaper are the best way to control the spread of hepatitis A.

[Hepatitis A virus infection is a vaccine-preventable disease, but vaccination is not a feasible option in an impoverished and flood-devastated country. The provision of an adequate supply of potable water is the immediate priority, followed by improvements in sanitation. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Improved sanitation, food safety, and immunisation are the most effective ways to combat hepatitis A.

The Swat Valley is an administrative district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. It is the upper valley of the Swat River, which rises in the Hindu Kush range. The capital of Swat is Saidu Sharif, but the main town in the Swat valley is Mingora.
