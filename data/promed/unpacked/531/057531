Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 33
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed another
human case of H5N1 avian influenza. The patient, a 21 year
old man from Lampung, Sumatra, developed symptoms on 20 Sep
2005 and was hospitalized on 24 Sep. He remains hospitalized
in a stable condition (subsequently died, see below).
Confirmatory testing was conducted at a WHO reference
laboratory in Hong Kong.
Initial investigation has revealed that the man had direct
exposure to diseased and dying chickens in his household
shortly before the onset of illness. Contact tracing and
field investigations are under way and samples have been
taken to determine whether family members and other close
contacts may have been infected.
The man is the fifth laboratory-confirmed case of H5N1
infection in Indonesia. Three out of the 5 cases were fatal.

Indonesia: another person infected with avian influenza
virus
----------------------
--------------------------------------
Another man has been confirmed by the World Health
Organization's (WHO) laboratory test in Hong Kong as
infected with bird flu, while his nephew, a 4 year old boy
has also tested positive [according to tests carried out in
a] local laboratory, an official said here on Monday [10 Oct
2005].
Director general of disease control and environmental health
of the Indonesian Health Ministry I Nyoman Kandun told
Xinhua that the case brought the total number of people
confirmed by the organization of having the H5N1 virus to 5
in Indonesia. The first 4 have died in tandem [?]. [The WHO
statement issued on 10 Oct 2005 (above) identifies 5 cases;
3 fatal and two non-fatal. - Mod.CP]
The man, aged 21 years old from Lampung Province, had been
treated in Abdoel Moeluk Hospital in the province. Later,
the health officials sent his blood sample to the WHO
laboratory in Hong Kong, said Kandun. "H was confirmed as
positive by the Hong Kong laboratory," he said. "Now, we are
waiting for the result of the boy's blood sample from Hong
Kong. Normally, if a local test was positive, the Hong Kong
laboratory will report the same. If it is positive, it will
add to the list of persons confirmed by the WHO," the
director said.
Kandun said that so far over 98 [suspected avian influenza]
cases with bird flu symptoms had been found across the
country. Indonesia's health minister has said the country
could face a bird flu epidemic if the number of suspected
cases of the virus continued to mount.

[The final statement is misleading. It is the number of
confirmed cases which indicate the extent of transmission of
the virus to humans, not the number of suspected cases --
few of which have been confirmed and some of which may have
been misdiagnosed. - Mod.CP]
