A legionnaires' disease outbreak in California's wine country has caused one death and nearly a dozen hospitalizations since mid-July [2022], and public health officials have found one possible source of the bacterium that causes the illness, authorities said on Wednesday [3 Aug 2022].

High levels of legionella bacteria were found in a water sample taken from a cooling tower at Embassy Suites Napa Valley, although none of those who were sickened had visited or stayed at the hotel, according to a Napa County statement. "The cooling tower has since been taken offline, which mitigates any ongoing risk to public health," the statement said.

County and state public health investigators have been working with hotel staff to "remediate the source of exposure" but "we must continue to investigate other cooling towers and water sources in the outbreak area, as it is common to find more than one source," Dr Karen Relucio, the county's health officer, said in the statement.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that grow in warm water. It was named for the outbreak where it was first identified, at a 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia [_Legionella_ species].

People can get legionnaires' disease when they breathe in water vapor containing the bacteria. "Outbreaks are commonly associated with buildings or structures that have complex water systems, like hotels and resorts, long-term care facilities, hospitals, and cruise ships," according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "The most likely sources of infection include water used for showering, hot tubs, decorative fountains, and cooling towers." The disease isn't contagious and can be treated with antibiotics, but can be dangerous for some people, such as those with pre-existing conditions. Symptoms include muscle aches, fever and chills.

A dozen Napa County residents have been hospitalized with the disease since 11 Jul 2022. Three remain hospitalized and one person has died, the county said. That person was over the age of 50 and had "risk factors for severe disease," the county said.

There are about 10 000 reported cases of legionnaires' disease in the United States each year, but the disease is probably underdiagnosed and the real annual figure may be much higher, according to CDC. The disease usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and can range from a mild cough to a "rapidly fatal" case of pneumonia, according to the World Health Organization. Complications from the disease can include respiratory failure, shock and acute kidney failure.

"Although legionnaires' disease is a rare infection, this is a reminder that the bacteria that cause it are common in nature and can be found in man-made water systems," Relucio said. "This means it's very important for owners and managers of water systems that can create aerosols to take steps to prevent legionella from growing and spreading in water systems."

[Napa County (population 138 019 residents in 2020) is north of San Pablo Bay, the northern extension of San Francisco Bay; its county seat is the city of Napa (pop 77 480 residents in 2021), about 50 miles [38 km] north of the city of San Francisco. Napa County is known for its regional wine industry and is a major tourist destination in California. Calistoga (pop 5228 residents in 2020) is a city about 30 miles [19 km] north of the city of Napa, along Route 29 which is lined by wineries, wine tasting rooms, restaurants, and hotels. A map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Calistoga,+California+94515/Napa,+California. Legionella was found in a water sample taken from a cooling tower at Embassy Suites hotel in the city of Napa, just off Route 29. A map showing the location of this hotel can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/1075+California+Blvd,+Napa,+CA+94559.

The news article above reports that a cluster of 12 cases of legionnaires' disease, with one death, was reported between 11 and 27 Jul 2022 in residents of the cities of Napa and Calistoga. We are not told of any epidemiologic factors linking these cases, other than their residence in Napa County. No cases were reported in tourists.

We will await the results of genotyping clinical isolates. Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates, if available, and environmental isolates of legionella, for example, the legionella isolated from cooling tower at the Embassy Suites hotel in Napa, will identify the environmental source responsible for the individual cases.

More information from knowledgeable sources on this cluster of legionnaires' disease cases in Napa County, California would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
