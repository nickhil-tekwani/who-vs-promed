A Comorian child of 12 years is hospitalized in Mayotte in critical
condition, having contracted Rift Valley fever (RVF). RFV is a viral
disease currently wreaking havoc in East Africa, especially in Sudan.
Health authorities fear an epidemic in the Comoros. Pending
confirmation of the presence of the disease in the livestock
population of the Comoros, surveillance is being reinforced
throughout the islands.

Last August [2007], a boy, 12 years old, living in Moroni (Grande
Comore Island) was transferred to a hospital in Mayotte. He had
developed symptoms 3 months previously, and it was confirmed in
September 2007 by the National Reference Center (NRC) in Lyon that
the boy was a case of RVF.

At present, the boy is hospitalized in Mayotte in critical condition.
"He has [severe] neurological symptoms," says Pierre Vincent,
Coordinator of the Epidemiology Centre (Wax) in Mayotte. The boy, a
resident of Moroni, has apparently contracted infection from a sick
indigenous animal. Since neither the child nor a relative had visited
East Africa, an outbreak of RVF among livestock in Grande Comore is
suspected.

The Health Authorities are anxious to assess the risk of a spread of
infection in livestock. Two weeks ago, the veterinary services of
Mayotte dispatched 100 test samples to the Ministry of Health of the
Comoros so that the extent of any infection of the animal population
could be estimated. These samples have been sent to the Centre for
International Cooperation in Agronomic Research (CIRAD) in
Montpellier. The results are not yet known, but, already, Dr. Pierre
Vincent "feared an outbreak in the Comoros."

"However, the situation has not alarmed our authorities. We cannot
consider that the risk is significant," stated Dr Vincent. According
to Dr Nicolas Krieger, deputy director of the Directorate of
Veterinary Services (DSV), no ruminants or their products have been
exported to Europe from countries where this disease is endemic. All
livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) and animal products imported into
the Comoros have originated from France and other countries of the
European Union. Furthermore, even if the virus can be transmitted via
the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, the disease could not be transmitted
[to humans and from human to human by mosquitoes] without the
existence of infected livestock to amplify the virus. The WAX
Coordinator stated that: "Man does not participate in the development
cycle of the disease, because the virus does not multiply
sufficiently in the blood. Mosquitoes, therefore, can only acquire an
infectious dose by feeding on domestic livestock.

The Health Authorities nonetheless remain on their guard. "We also
know that RVF is endemic in Madagascar," said Dr. Vincent.
"Consequently, we have continued the surveillance measures which were
put in place following the outbreak of cholera in the Comoros. There
is always strict control of goods and materials imported into the
Comoros."

[The Comoro Islands are an archipelago lying between Madagascar and
the African continent. The main islands are Grande Comore, Anjouan,
Moheli and Mayotte. The islands are volcanic in origin. Politically,
the islands are divided into 2 entities: Comoros, a sovereign state,
and Mayotte, an overseas collectivity of France. A map of the Comoros
Islands can be accessed at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoro_Islands>.

RVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with
RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated
with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the
illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or
hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead
to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases
affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever,
generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss
at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within 2
days to one week after onset of illness. The most common complication
associated with RVF is inflammation of the retina (a structure
connecting the nerves of the eye to the brain). As a result,
approximately 1-10 percent of affected patients may have some
permanent vision loss. Approximately one percent of humans that
become infected with RVF die of the disease. Case-fatality
proportions are significantly higher for infected animals. The most
severe impact is observed in pregnant livestock infected with RVF,
which results in abortion of virtually 100 percent of fetuses.

This rather confused report indicates that a single human case of RVF
has been confirmed in the Comoros, although this requires independent
confirmation, as the symptoms and severity of the disease are
unusual. The patient has no known link with RVF endemic regions in
East Africa, therefore it has been inferred, but not yet established,
that the infection occurred by transmission from an infected animal
on the Comoros. Further information is awaited that would confirm
this extension of RVF beyond its presently known range. - Mod.CP]

[Identification of RVF in the Comoros should not come as a surprise;
it is in the Indian Ocean between the RVF-endemic territories of
Tanzania/Mozambique and northern Madagascar (map at
<http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/d/d9/Comoros_in_relation_to_Afrika_map.jpg>).
Tanzania suffered an RVF outbreak earlier in 2007; Madagascar is also
known to be endemically infected. In 1982, the Zinga virus,
prevailing in Madagascar, was identified by the WHO Reference
laboratory for Arboviruses in Yale as RVF virus.

According to unofficial assessments, the livestock population of the
Federal Islamic Republic of Comores is as follows: cattle - 51 000;
goats - 115 000 - 170 000; sheep - 20 000. Imports of cattle from
Tanzania have been reported during recent years.
