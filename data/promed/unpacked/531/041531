[The newly confirmed case on 29 Nov2014 is the 1st case of MERS-CoV reported from Rafha, a town located in Northern Saudi Arabia near the border with Iraq (see map at the source URL above).

The newly reported fatality, is most likely the 79 year old Saudi female from Alkharj, reported as a newly confirmed case on 26 Nov 2014, who at the time was listed in critical condition. She had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities and of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment.

With the report of this case and fatality, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia reported since June 2012 is 814 including 350 deaths (case fatality rate of 43.0 percent).

According to the most recent ECDC Communicable Disease Threats report (23-29 Nov 2014), as of 27 Nov 2014 there have been a total of 947 cases of MERS-CoV reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 382 deaths (case fatality rate 40.3 percent). This tally does not include the 3 cases and 4 deaths reported since 27 Nov 2014.

It will be interesting to learn if virus is identified in the animals (presumably camels) this newly confirmed case had contact with. - Mod.MPP
