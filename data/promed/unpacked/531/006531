Retrospective diagnosis of human case of bat rabies
---------------------------------------------------
Last autumn [2009], for the 1st time ever, a bat was discovered in
Finland that carried a rabies virus [see ProMED-mail post: Rabies
(EBLV-2), Daubenton's bat - Finland: (LS) 20090819.2935]. This was
the northernmost observation of its kind in Europe. The prevalence of
the [virus] has been under scrutiny this past summer [2010] and the
results will be published later in the autumn [2010].

The summer's research also helped to solve a 25-year-old mystery. A
Swiss bat researcher who lived in Finland died of bat rabies in 1985.
Where had he contracted the illness? The crucial clue came in August
of last year [2009}, when researchers heard that on the Kakskerta
island close to Turku there was a sick bat. It was examined
thoroughly and was discovered to be carrying [a] bat rabies [virus].

There are 2 types of bat rabies virus [in Europe] -- European bat
lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2). The bat
found in Kakskerta was infected with EBLV-2, which was also the same
type that caused the bat researcher to lose his life. The Kakskerta
find stirred into action the authorities responsible for fighting the
spreading of rabies. What is the prevalence in Finland of the disease
that is capable of killing a man?

Researchers have been looking for the answer to this thorny question
throughout the summer [200] in the Helsinki and Turku regions. The
aim is to collect 600 samples, and 400 of them have already been
secured. "The samples are being collected from places where there are
known to be communities of bats," explains Finnish Food Safety
Authority section head, senior researcher Miia Jakava-Viljanen. "We
are looking for rabies antibodies [in] bat saliva."

The Kakskerta discovery also prompted interest in neighbouring
Sweden. No bat rabies has been observed there, but when researchers
set out to look for it, the rabies antibodies were duly discovered.
"They indicate that the [virus] exists also in Sweden," says Jakava-Viljanen.

Bat rabies was known to exist in Switzerland in the 1980s, but it was
unknown in Finland. "The suspicion at the time was that the
researcher who died had contracted the illness somewhere else than in
Finland, for he studied bats also elsewhere," Jakava-Viljanen notes.
An additional proof was the fact that Kakskerta's sick bat individual
belonged to the Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_) species. The
Swiss researcher had been studying in Daubenton's bats. EBLV-2 is
very rare in Central Europe, whereas EBLV-1 is much more common there.

From the point of view of humans and health dangers, the discovery
attests to the old rule to deal with bats with respect. "Never touch
a bat with bare hands," Jakava-Viljanen instructs. "Rabies can only
be passed on via a bite." Bats are protected animals. They must not
be caught or killed without permission from the authorities. Efforts
have been put in place to protect bats' hibernation and breeding
places and daytime hiding places on the strength of EUROBATS, the
Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats
[<http://www.eurobats.org/>].

Rabies has not been detected in Finland since 1991. Efforts -- for
instance the use of [animal] vaccines -- have been made to prevent
its spread into the country across the long eastern border, carried
by small predators. In addition, domestic dogs and cats are being
vaccinated against the disease. The situation is being monitored by
taking samples from animals. Suspicious behaviour, such as
uncharacteristic aggressiveness, may be a symptom of a rabies
infection. The so-called bat rabies, which is carried by airborne and
mixed-habitat animals such as bats, is found even in countries where
the ground animal variety has been completely eradicated. Ground
animal rabies was last detected in Finland towards the end of the 1980s.

[This report concludes retrospectively on circumstantial evidence
that EBLV-2 infection had been contracted by the deceased Swiss
researcher in Finland and not in Switzerland as previously supposed.
EBLV-2 infection has also been responsible for human deaths in other
areas (namely the UK) where classical carnivore-transmitted rabies is
absent -- see ProMED-mail references below.
