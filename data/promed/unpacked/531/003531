Outbreak of Hepatitis A in primary school in Totonicapa, Mexico
---------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Pedro Luis Noble, State Secretary of Health confirmed the
occurrence of an outbreak of hepatitis A in students attending the
Jose Lopez-Portillo elementary school in Totonicapa community in San
Felipe Orizatlan municipality, Hidalgo State, Mexico. Because of this
occurrence, health care worker teams have been sent to the
aforementioned community in order to take care of the situation and
control the outbreak.

"As of today [17 Nov 2011], 6 cases of hepatitis (A) have been
confirmed, who are already receiving therapy, and there are 27
additional children presenting symptoms suggesting this infection,"
Dr. Noble said. For this reason, teams of health care workers from
Huejutla Health Authority are visiting the households of affected
children, in order to instruct their relatives with respect to how to
enforce sanitary control measures, he explained. Dr. Noble also added
that all actions regarding this outbreak have been carried out,
including basic personal and household sanitation measures, as well as
procedures for adding lime to septic boxes, water well cleaning and
water chlorination, amongst other measures.

It is worth mentioning that until now, Jose Lopez-Portillo school is
still normally functioning, and no additional cases (of hepatitis A)
have been identified. Considering the current situation, surveillance
measures have been implemented in order to prevent the occurrence of
additional cases; and, should any symptomatic child be identified,
he/she may be transferred to a public health care facility.

"Health care personnel are constantly performing epidemiological
surveillance activities, as well as in other communities in this area,
both in health care facilities as in ambulatory facilities," said Dr.
Noble.

Hepatitis A is an acute infection caused by a virus that enters the
body through the ingestion of water or food contaminated with faeces
of infected persons, or through direct contact with contaminated
hands. Dr. Noble recommended that persons must comply with measures
for preventing the transmission of viral diseases, such as strict
handwashing before and after eating, before preparing food, after
going to the toilet, and after changing babies' diapers. He also
recommended the following measures: persons must drink only
disinfected water (purified, boiled, chlorinated, with colloid silver,
or iodinated); they must only eat well cooked foods; they must also
carefully wash and disinfect fresh fruits and vegetables; they must
not practice self-medication; and, last but not least, they must go to
the nearest health care facility in case any symptoms may occur.
