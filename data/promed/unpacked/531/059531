Lassa Fever in Nigeria
----------------------
The Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health has reported an increased number of cases of Lassa [haemorrhagic fever]. Nineteen of the country's 36 states have reported cases since the beginning of 2012. As of April 13, 2012, there were reports of 818 suspected cases, including 84 deaths. At this time, 131 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing. Seven deaths have also been reported among health care workers. Cases have occurred in the states of Edo, Bauchi, Plateau, and Taraba. The number of reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria is greater this year than in previous years. However, cases in previous years could have been underestimated due to the lack of laboratory and disease investigation systems. The Nigerian government is responding to the outbreak by improving the disease investigation, treatment of patients, and conducting awareness campaigns among affected populations. Security and availability of resources are proving to be a major challenge. WHO does not advise or recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with Nigeria.

Lassa fever is a viral illness that is spread by rats [classically the "multimammate mouse" _Mastomys natalensis_, also dubbed "rat"]. People get the disease through direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine. Lassa fever may also spread though person-to-person contact. This happens when a person comes into contact with an infected personâ€™s blood, tissue, or body fluids. The symptoms include fever, pain behind the chest, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the mouth or nose. People with Lassa fever may also experience hearing loss, tremors, swelling of the face and eyelids, and swelling of the brain. Pregnant women with Lassa fever often have bleeding from the genitals and miscarriage and may die from the illness.

Lassa fever is seen in West Africa. Cases have been documented in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. However, the rats that spread Lassa fever also live in other countries in Africa. The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. These numbers are estimates because cases are not investigated everywhere. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 10 per cent to 16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region. Lassa fever can occur all year long, but most cases occur from January to May.

How can travelers protect themselves? Avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces. Put food away in rodent-proof containers. Keep the home clean and rodent proof. Trap rats in and around homes. Do not eat rats. Wash hands well and often with soap, and teach children to wash their hands, too. Do not share eating or drinking utensils. Clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as toys, doorknobs, tables, and counters) regularly with soap and water or with cleaning wipes. Avoid close contact with sick people.

If you have traveled to the area and develop symptoms of fever, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, see a doctor or health care provider right away. Be sure to tell your doctor or health care provider that you have recently traveled to Nigeria.

[Curiously this travel alert identifies only 4 of the 19 states affected by the outbreak of Lassa fever -- Edo, Bauchi, Plateau, and Taraba, whereas the Nigerian Ministry of Health had reported previously that Lassa fever was affecting 12 states -- Edo, Nasarawa, Plu, Ebonyi, Taraba, Yobe, Ondo, Rivers, Gombe, Anambra, Delta, and Lagos [see ProMED-mail report "Lassa fever - Nigeria (04) 20120223.1050129"].

About 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic with the remainder experiencing severe multi-system disease with the virus affecting several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease and the animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat". _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta. In the absence of an effective vaccine, rodent control would seem the best option for control of the current outbreak. Images of multimammate rats be viewed at http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mastomys&hl=en&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=TRScT7zkLdCo8QPc0sGyBA&sqi=2&ved=0CEsQsAQ&biw=1008&bih=404.

Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to excreta of infected _Mastomys_ rodents, and the infection may spread further between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is little epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported. (For further information see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html).
