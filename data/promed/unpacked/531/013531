Set Back For Polio Eradication Campaign In Bangladesh
-----------------------------------------------------
DHAKA: [A second child suffering from wild poliovirus [infection,
manifested as an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) attack, was found yesterday
at the Dhaka Shishu Hospital. An 18-month old child has been clinically
confirmed to be suffering from wild poliovirus infection. The child, who
hails from Nayagram of Nabinagar thana in Brahmanbaria district, was
admitted to the hospital on Sun 5 Nov 2000. He is now under observation:
His twisted left leg has no sensation and is also dehydrating.
Dhaka City Corporation sent stool samples for laboratory confirmation to
Institute of Public Health (IPH) yesterday and another set of samples will
be sent to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in US today.
According to the child's parents, the young boy's left leg became paralyzed
after about 30 days of [continuous dysentery. He had no polio vaccination.
There are 39 more such victims suffering from irreversible paralysis
including 3 earlier detected cases in the city. All the 39 cases were
detected during a WHO-assisted programme in Bangladesh initiated in 1998
and subsequently confirmed by laboratory tests in 1999. No wild polio case
was detected this year in the country until this case and [another child.
The latest detection deals a serious blow to Bangladesh's polio
immunization program. Bangladesh can only attain the WHO-confirmed status
of a polio-free country if no AFP cases are found for 3 consequent years.
For this, a strong surveillance system has been developed with WHO
technical support to detect such cases. There were a number of suspected
cases but after tests it was found that they had non-polio paralysis.
A child gets infected with poliovirus usually before the age of 15, and the
virus enters the body through mouth and reproduces in the intestine. The
virus incubates between 4 and 30 days before it attacks the host. Only one
per cent of those infected becomes paralyzed while the rest would not even
realize that they have had the infection. The virus mostly gets out of body
through stool.
Laboratory tests can only confirm AFP if the stool is collected within 14
days from the paralysis attack. Case detection of AFP within 14 days of the
onset of paralysis is still well below target at 68 per cent. The AFP case
detection target is 80 per cent. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was
[expected to declare Bangladesh polio-free on 16 Dec 2000, Victory Day,
but sources at the Health Ministry said that the announcement might [will
now have to be postponed.

[In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis by
the end of 2000. To achieve this goal, the 10 member countries of the World
Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region (SEAR) began implementing
polio eradication strategies in 1994. Approximately 25% of the world's
population live in SEAR countries, most in India, the largest country where
polio is endemic. Progress in this region is critical for the success of
global polio eradication. In 1999, most polio cases worldwide were reported
in SEAR (i.e., 48% of reported polio cases and 62% of cases with wild
poliovirus isolation). Although large numbers of polioviruses 1 and 3
circulated in 1999, transmission occurred mainly in 4 states in northern
India, with focal transmission of poliovirus 2 limited to 2 of these
states. Transmission of virus in southern India decreased substantially
from 1998 to 1999. Virologically confirmed wild poliovirus cases found in
border districts in Myanmar and Nepal highlighted the importance of border
regions in the transmission of wild poliovirus and the need for cooperation
of neighboring countries in surveillance and planning of immunisation. The
Myanmar cases represented virus importation from Bangladesh because the
cases were found close to the border, and the isolated virus showed more
genetic similarity with virus isolated in Bangladesh than with indigenous
Myanmar virus.
AFP surveillance is conducted to identify the remaining infected areas, to
target supplemental vaccination, and to monitor progress toward eradication
through a network of reporting units dispersed throughout a country. AFP in
Bangladesh has detected residual cases of wild poliovirus infection and
prevented premature relaxation of immunisation programmes. It is not
entirely clear from this report whether the diagnosis is supported by
laboratory confirmation - Mod.CP
