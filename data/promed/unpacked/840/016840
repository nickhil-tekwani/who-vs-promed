1st case of _Brucella canis_ in Sweden
--------------------------------------
The dog disease _Brucella canis_ has been found for the 1st time in
Sweden. The bacterium causes abortions and infertility in dogs and
may, in exceptional cases, infect humans. The infected bitch was
killed. At present, steps have been undertaken to carry out tests and
to try trace contact cases in order to stop the spread.

The affected animal was an American Staffordshire terrier-bitch
imported from Poland, where it has was mated. When she aborted her
litter in June 2011, samples were taken to find the cause. The samples
showed positive results for _B. canis_ in the National Veterinary
Institute (SVA) and, in July 2011 at the EU reference laboratory. The
Swedish Board of Agriculture decided that the bitch should be killed
immediately to prevent further spread of infection. The male suspected
of having infected the bitch was born in Serbia and found to present
reduced fertility, a symptom of the disease. The male is now in
Sweden.

It is important to test dogs from other countries
-------------------------------------------------
One should not breed animals that are infected with _B. canis_. It is
always a greater risk to mate in a foreign country or import dogs,
says Pia Ehrenpris, veterinarian at the Board of Agriculture. We
recommend all owners to be careful when identifying the animals used
for breeding or imported. Many diseases such as leptospirosis can
often be excluded by means of preventive testing prior to breeding or
importation.

Sexually transmitted disease
----------------------------
The bacteria are spread primarily through mating, but they also occur
through the transfer, for example, of aborted materials, milk, and
urine. In exceptional cases, the bacteria can also infect humans. Sick
animals may particularly suffer impaired fertility but may also have
problems with back, eyes, and skin. Asymptomatic infections are
occurring. Although one might try treating an infected dog, it is
impossible to guarantee that the dog ever becomes free of the
bacteria.

[Initial publication of the suspected case was released by the Swedish
Board of Agriculture on 1 Jul 2011; see '_Brucella canis_ in Sweden'

(in Swedish).

Canine brucellosis, caused by _B. canis_, is an important cause of
reproductive failure in dogs, particularly in kennels and can end the
reproductive career of a breeding animal. _B. canis_ is zoonotic,
although disease appears to be rare in humans. Other _Brucella_
species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B.
abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Genetic and immunologic
evidence suggests that all members of the genus _Brucella_ are closely
related.

Dogs are the only species known to be affected by _B. canis_; however,
antibodies to this organism have been found in other carnivores.

_B. canis_ has been reported from the United States (particularly the
southern states), Canada, Central and South America (including
Mexico), some European countries, Tunisia, Nigeria, Madagascar,
Malaysia, India, Korea, Japan, and China. _B. canis_ is probably found
throughout most of the world; however, New Zealand and Australia
appear to be free of this organism.

In dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus
and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal
transmission. This organism can be found in vaginal discharges for 4
to 6 weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal
secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High
concentrations of _B. canis_ are found in semen for up to 2 months
after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can
occur for years. _B. canis_ is also found in urine, and low
concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular
secretions, and feces.

Canine brucellosis is usually introduced into a kennel in an infected
dog or semen. This disease is controlled by sanitation and the removal
of infected dogs. Housing in individual cages reduces the spread of
the organism. Repeated testing and the removal of seropositive or
culture-positive animals, combined with quarantine and testing of
newly added dogs, have been used to eradicate brucellosis from some
kennels. There is no vaccine for _B. canis_.

Long-term antibiotic therapy has been used successfully to treat some
dogs, but some animals relapse. Neutering can be used as an additional
control measure.

Humans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting
organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded
skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with
infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. The virulence of
this organism for humans may be low. Approximately 30 cases have been
reported worldwide since the 1960s. However, _B. canis_ infections can
be difficult to diagnose in humans and may be underreported. In
symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical
signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease
begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs
such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized
aches.

_B. canis_ is not included in the list of OIE notifiable
diseases/infections.
