An outbreak of bird flu was detected in a farm with thousands of turkeys in Avarela, Obidos. The General Directorate of Food and Veterinary Medicine (DGAV) has already activated a contingency plan, establishing, among others, the slaughter of affected animals and a sanitary restriction around the affected area, within a radius of up to 10 kilometers [6.2 mi]. At issue is a "highly pathogenic avian flu", with very high mortality rates, and which can infect other animals and also humans, when there is very close contact.

However, DGAV stresses that "there is no epidemiological evidence of avian influenza transmission to humans through food consumption, namely poultry meat and eggs".

To prevent the spread of the disease, a protection zone and a surveillance zone were defined, covering respectively 3 and 10 kilometer radii around the poultry farm. The DGAV banned the circulation of live birds in the restriction area, but also that of fresh meat, including offal and poultry meat products. The same applies to the circulation of eggs for hatching and for human consumption, as well as animal by-products obtained from birds originating from production in the affected area.

The contingency plan provides for the elimination of infected birds, with compensation being made for the sanitary slaughter of the animals. The measures apply until 27 Jan 2022, and poultry farms in this zone will be subject to inspection.

[The previous HPAI H5N1 outbreak of the current season, in Portugal, started on 30 Nov 2021 and was reported to the OIE on 6 Dec 2021 (item 3 in ProMED post 20211209.8700162). It affected a backyard hobby flock of chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese located in the province of Setubal (map at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=43980). The current event is located in the district of Leiria. Both areas are situated in western Portugal, respectively south and north of the Lisbon district (map at https://www.mappr.co/counties/portugal/).

The current epizootic of HPAI H5N1 has spread, since its start (September 2021), throughout most parts of Europe, in several countries in Asia and, to a lesser extent, Africa. Most likely, by means of migrating birds.

So far, no human cases have been reported. - Mod.AS
