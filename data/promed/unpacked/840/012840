Equine coronavirus, or ECoV, has been on many veterinarians' radar
lately. While they've long known the virus is commonly found in foals,
it's recently been implicated in several outbreaks among adult horses.
So to better understand the disease it causes and how to best diagnose
and manage outbreaks, researchers recently completed a study on ECoV
in mature horses.

At the 2013 American Association of Equine Practitioners' Convention,
held 7-11 Dec 2013 in Nashville, Tennessee [USA], Nicola Pusterla,
DVM, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM, a professor at the University of California,
Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, presented the results of the
study.

Background
----------
"We consider this an emerging pathogen," Pusterla said, noting that
disease outbreaks associated with ECoV and adult horses have rarely
been described in the scientific literature prior to recent years.

Pusterla said common signs of ECoV infection in adult horses include
anorexia, lethargy, and fever; less common signs of disease include
diarrhea, colic, and neurologic deficits. Complications include
septicemia (bloodstream infection), endotoxemia (endotoxin in the
bloodstream), and encephalopathy (a brain condition caused by
abnormally high ammonia levels in the blood), all of which are
associated with gastrointestinal tract barrier breakdown, he said.
Coronavirus has high morbidity rates, but low mortality rates (meaning
many horses will develop illness, but few will die as a result), he
said, and it's often self-limiting.

Coronavirus is spread feco-orally, Pusterla said, "and likely passed
from horse to horse via fecal contamination of the environment from
clinically but also asymptomatic shedders (i.e., they show no signs of
having a disease, yet they are shedding virus or bacteria)."

At least 2 recent outbreaks, he added, were associated with a single
competition.

Study results
-------------
In their ECoV study, Pusterla and colleagues evaluated the clinical
and laboratory results from horses involved in 8 recent outbreaks in
California, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, and Wisconsin.
They evaluated horses' clinical signs, disease duration, diagnostic
methods, and a variety of other parameters.

Of the 268 horses involved in the 8 outbreaks:
- the majority of affected horses were adults;
- 80 horses developed clinical signs -- most commonly anorexia,
lethargy, and fever;
- clinical signs generally resolved without treatment in 1 to 4 days,
and outbreaks lasted about 3 weeks;
- 9 horses died or were euthanized due to complications, 4 horses
developed septicemia, 4 had encephalopathy, and 1 came down with
endotoxemia;
- horses remained infectious for up to 14 days after clinical signs
appeared; and
- blood work from 13 affected horses showed leukopenia (a reduced
white blood cell count).

The team also determined that fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
testing appears to be an effective method by which to diagnose ECoV
infection. Pusterla said that, using this method, 89 percent of sick
horses tested positive and 91 percent of healthy horses tested
negative, resulting in a 90 percent agreement between clinical status
and disease detection. He noted that PCR can detect ECoV for 3 to 9
days in sick horses.

Pusterla also noted that ECoV research is continuing: "We are in the
process of establishing a serological assay, which would allow us to
determine the overall exposure rate to ECoV in various horse
populations across the USA."

Take-home message
-----------------
In summary, Pusterla said this generally self-limiting disease has
high morbidity and low mortality rates. Horses can remain infectious
for up to 2 weeks; however, the virus can only be detected in feces
for up to 9 days. Fecal PCR appears to be an effective and accurate
diagnostic test.

To protect their horses from contracting the virus, Pusterla
recommended owners "apply daily preventive measures by respecting and
applying basic biosecurity protocols."

[Coronaviruses comprise a large group of RNA viruses that can cause
both respiratory and enteric signs of disease in various species. They
are further grouped based on genetic and serologic differences into
alpha, beta, and gamma coronaviruses.

The equine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus, has been recently isolated
from a number of outbreaks across the USA. This is an enteric disease
of the equine. At this time there has been no association with a
respiratory component although in cattle enteric and respiratory
disease is common.

Common clinical signs/blood test changes may include anorexia,
lethargy, fever (usually 104 deg F/40 deg C or lower), changes in
fecal character; diarrhea not routinely seen, mild colic-like signs
(laying down; looking at sides), neurologic abnormalities (ataxia,
depression, recumbency) secondary to hyperammonemia (elevated levels
of ammonia in the blood), leukopenia (neutropenia, lymphopenia) (low
white cell count), and hypoalbuminemia (or hypoalbuminaemia, levels of
albumin in blood serum are abnormally low).

A veterinarian should be involved to assess the seriousness of the
illness as well as provide necessary treatment.
