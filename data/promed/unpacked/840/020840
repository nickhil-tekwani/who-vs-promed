Budgie virus is still active in Scotland
----------------------------------------
Vets have confirmed that the new budgie virus had reached Scotland as early
as February 2003 and is still active north of the Border. The latest
suspected outbreak occurred just 3 weeks ago. The stud affected had already
suffered losses from the virus -- thought to be avian paramyxovirus 5
(APMV-5) -- earlier this year.

The Scottish Agricultural College's (SAC) Veterinary Science Division --
which monitors disease in both the domestic and wild animal populations in
Scotland -- noted 2 outbreaks of a fatal disease in budgie studs in January
2003. Following 2 more outbreaks in February 2003, efforts were stepped up
to identify the cause.

"From past experience, we knew the top 5 causes of budgie deaths that we
were used to seeing," SAC senior veterinary investigation officer Tom
Pennycott told Cage & Aviary Birds. "Then that changed and it became clear
that there was something going on."

Tests were started on samples from the February 2003 deaths, and it was
those that provided the link to APMV in mid-June. Further tests, which are
expected to confirm the virus is APMV-5, are expected to be completed this
week.

Mr Pennycott said that post mortem results from the original outbreaks were
being used to identify new cases of the virus: "If breeders are reporting
50 percent mortality in their mature birds, along with post mortem findings
including enlarged liver and spleen (accompanied with pale spotting), we
are probably looking at the same virus."

However, he added that it is not unusual to see other more common
infections in affected birds as well: "Megabacteria is just one of several
secondary infections that we have seen come along on top of the virus."

Compared to the 1993 UK outbreak of APMV-5 -- which is also known as
Kunitachi disease after a major outbreak in Japan in 1978 -- Mr Pennycott
said the current cases appeared more severe. Papers he had read on the 1993
outbreak suggested that it was limited to just 2 budgie studs and that
mortality was only about 20 percent.

While it appears clear that the outbreak 10 years ago was controlled and
had no lasting effect on the budgie population, it is too early to predict
the outcome this time. "We know that species infected with other types of
APMV only carry the virus for 6-8 weeks and do not pose a risk of infecting
others if they survive," Mr Pennycott said, "unfortunately, little is known
about APMV-5 and its transmission."
