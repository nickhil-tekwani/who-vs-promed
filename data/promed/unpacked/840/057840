Twelve people had died from rabies during the last 6 months, the Health Ministry said yesterday [14 Jul 2022]. Director-Public Health Veterinary Service Dr. L.D. Kithsiri said, "95% of the infections happen due to dog bites. Puppies carry the highest risk of infection. In the last 6 months, we have vaccinated 500 000 dogs free of charge. We will also sterilise 30 000 street dogs to control their population," he said.

There are between 20 and 30 million dogs in the country and only around 1.1 million dogs are vaccinated annually, he said. Dr. Kithsiri added that if they could vaccinate 70% of the canine population, the spread of rabies could be stopped. The Ministry recommends the annual rabies vaccination of all dogs above 6 weeks, Dr. Kithsiri said. He added that 20 to 30 deaths occurred annually due to rabies and mainly due to exposure to infected dogs.

"The main reasons for deaths in Sri Lanka are non-vaccination of dogs against rabies and not getting post-exposure treatments. If treated properly immediately after an infected animal bite [rabies] is 100% preventable, and post-exposure vaccine and serum [are] freely available at government hospitals." He added that Sri Lanka had adopted rabies control measures since 1975 and the number of human rabies deaths had declined from 377 in 1973 to 19 in 2014.

"Sri Lanka seeks to be rabies-free by the end of 2025. Towards the elimination of the disease, the country needs more effective, evidence-based strategies and efforts," he said, adding that there was a lack of awareness about the disease, especially among those who did not own pets.

[Sri Lanka set the target of zero rabies in the nation by 2020; however, its goal was extended to 2025 due to the stagnation of the decline of human rabies deaths in the last several years.

The following 2 figures, presenting Sri Lanka's evolution of human/animal rabies incidence, control measures in dogs and post-exposure treatments in humans since 2007, are derived from a 2021 review (see reference citation below):

The authors concluded that mass dog vaccination and dog population control had been "well implemented," but people's awareness on rabies control and prevention and its related responsible dog ownership "need more attention."
