[1] Sheath blight - USA (Louisiana): new strain suspected

Louisiana's rice crop may be threatened by sheath blight. Clayton Hollier, LSU [Louisiana State University], is surveying rice fields of southwestern Louisiana after sheath blight was reported in Acadia Parish when growers noticed fungicides they used were less effective.

The blight currently found in Louisiana is fungicide-resistant, which Hollier said makes this disease serious. While there is a product that farmers can use to kill the fungicide-resistant disease, Hollier said it is important to figure out what prompted the resistance.

His research will attempt to identify how widespread the blight is and how sensitive different samples of the blight are to fungicide. It will also be important to look for any genetic changes in the fungus that have caused it to become resistant, he said.

[2] Neck blast - USA: Arkansas

Some Northeast Arkansas rice farmers are battling a plant disease in their fields known as neck blast.

The disease that can prevent rice grains from filling out has been confirmed in a field in western Greene County, prompting a warning to scout late rice fields.

The warning is for "late-planted fields with blast-susceptible varieties in blast-prone areas," says Yeshi Wamishe, extension plant pathologist.

"If you have rice fields at booting to early heading, the crop could still benefit from a fungicide application," she says. "Timing is important -- once the head is completely out of the boot, a fungicide application has no benefit for prevention of neck or panicle blast."

[3] Brown spot - India: Jammu and Kashmir

In view of reports of blast and brown spot disease that has attacked paddy crop in certain areas of Baramulla, Kupwara, Budgam and Anantnag [districts], the Agriculture Department has initiated measures to curb the diseases.

Farmers are provided fungicides free of cost to control the diseases. Sprays of fungicides have been carried out by the department in the affected areas. The Director of Agriculture Kashmir has advised farmers to contact the Extension Officers of their respective areas in case they find any symptoms on the paddy crop.

[Sheath blight
-------------
Sheath blight of rice is caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_. Symptoms include expanding lesions on sheaths of leaves near the water line and infection spreads rapidly in the field. Yield losses of up to 50 percent are reported due to poorly filled grain heads and reduced plant vigour. Fungal sclerotia survive for long periods in the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields causing infection in the next crop. Some weed hosts can serve as pathogen reservoirs. No reliable source of genetic host resistance has been identified so far. Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides. The possible emergence of a strain with new fungicide resistances reported in item 1 is cause for concern.

Blast
-----
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_, synonym _Pyricularia oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide (see link below) with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die, and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Brown spot
----------
Brown spot disease of rice is caused by the fungus _Cochliobolus miyabeanus_ (previously _Helminthosporium oryzae_, _Bipolaris oryzae_). Symptoms include brownish spots on leaves and glumes, as well as blight on seedlings grown from infected seeds with a mortality rate of up to 60 percent. The disease also affects quality, weight and number of grains per panicle with a yield reduction of up to 45 percent. Leaf spots are thought to be due to a toxin produced by the fungus, and the disease is favoured by a poor nutritional state of the host. Spores are carried on seed and other plant parts. Brown spot is managed by fungicide sprays, seed treatments (hot water, fungicides), but mainly by use of resistant crop varieties.
