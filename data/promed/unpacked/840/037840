A friend of mine who is a physician at the Eisenhower Medical Center in
Rancho Mirage [Coachella Valley, California told me there have been 3
deaths, one a 23 year old woman, with symptoms of a hemorrhagic viral
disease recently. [An arenavirus was identified in 1 or all of them (not
sure of details here). Local rodents were surveyed and one was positive
for [an arenavirus in the urine. The CDC is supposed to have done the tests.
You might contact the CDC for more information on this situation.

[We have been attempting to obtain further information but have been
unsuccessful. CDC apparently is not involved in these studies at this
time. Others, who are, are awaiting confirmatory tests before the
information is made public. Because of the transmission mechanisms of
arenaviruses to humans, there is little chance that this is the beginning
of an outbreak, so there is no real rush to publicize these events until
absolute confirmation has been obtained. Nonetheless, although lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus infections are known to have occurred in the U.S.,
some few laboratory infections with arenaviruses have occurred (one fatal),
and antibody to indigenous arenaviruses has been found in humans in the
U.S., no hemorrhagic diseases in humans have been attributed to
arenaviruses in North America to now, as far as I know. We await further
details. - Mod.CHC .......................................chc/es
