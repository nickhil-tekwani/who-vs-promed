At least 10 people were hospitalized while 9 cattle died from anthrax in Chipinge District [Manicaland Province], Department of Veterinary Services director in the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Josphat Nyika said yesterday [6 Jan 2015]. The 10 were hospitalized after they ate contaminated meat and were receiving treatment at a local hospital.

The department has since vaccinated 28 037 cattle in response to the outbreak.

Nyika confirmed the anthrax outbreak in Chipinge yesterday. He urged farmers to report on cases of death of animals to the nearest veterinary offices.

[Chipinge District, Manicaland Province, is on the eastern border with Mozambique; see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipinge. Maps of Zimbabwe can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/zimbabwe.pdf and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3079887,6613. The location of Chipinge can be seen at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/00/Chipinge.html.

This would appear to be a repeat of the outbreaks this time last year, 2014. Let us hope that this vaccination response becomes proactive in 9 months time, ahead of the not unexpected outbreaks in January 2016. This would prevent both livestock deaths and human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
