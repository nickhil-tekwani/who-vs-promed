A mystery illness has struck a small village in Makira [an island in Makira Ulawa Province, Solomon Islands], with 4 reported dead and the township in Kirakira advised to stay indoors while doctors await test results. It is understood a team of medical staff from Kirakira are now on the ground and monitoring the situation.

Charles Koroni, in updating concerned family members on Facebook, says that there was an "an influx of patients today. The hospital is full and some sick patients had to return to their village earlier this evening."

Unconfirmed reports state that doctors suspect that the illness is due to meningococcal septicemia. Meningococcal septicemia, which is characterized by rapid circulatory collapse and a hemorrhagic rash, is a more severe, but less common, form of meningococcal disease.

Doctors say it could start off just as a faint pink rash, as a red or purple spot or blotch, or as pinpricks on the skin. Often people mistake the early signs of the rash for a common ailment -- such as a blister, a scratch, a bite mark, a bruise, or even an ingrown hair. In the final, critical stage, it spreads rapidly into purple bruises, or haemorrhages, which cover the body. The person can go into shock, their blood pressure falls and circulation fails in the body extremities -- the fingers, toes and limbs. Amputations or death may be a result.

Meningococcal disease is caused by bacteria (not by a virus), and transmitted via saliva. The bacteria are spread by activities such as sneezing, coughing, and sharing food or drinks. Environments where people are in close contact, such as market places, schools, parties and nightclubs, make it easier for the bacteria to spread. Health authorities say an appropriate response will be made once test results become available. "Until then, our advice is for relatives of those affected to get tested immediately and for those patients suspected of carrying the bacteria to be isolated and treated," stated one senior health official spoken to.

It is understood tests results will be known this week [week ending 13 Jul 2014], with health authorities on high alert.

[The news report above says an outbreak has filled a local hospital on the island of Makira, the largest island of Makira Ulawa Province in the Solomon Islands; 4 patients have died. But the report does not give the total number of affected individuals, nor any of their demographic characteristics (age, sex, occupation, etc.), exposure to animals or arthropods, the time course of the outbreak, or a description of the clinical manifestations of the disease.

We are told that physicians suspect the patients are suffering from "meningococcal septicemia" and we are given a textbook description of that disease with a rapidly progressive hemorrhagic rash, circulatory collapse, multiorgan failure and death. Meningococcal septicemia is due to bloodstream invasion by _Neisseria meningitidis_. It may occur with or without meningococcal meningitis. However, in a community outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease, most patients would be expected to present with meningitis; only a few would have meningococcal septicemia. The news report makes no mention of any patient having meningitis.

Other infectious diseases can present with a similar clinical picture, e.g., viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). VHF is caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHF are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Except for dengue, none of the VHF occurs on the Solomon Islands. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague. We must await more information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

Solomon Islands is divided into 9 provinces. The capital and largest city of Makira Ulawa Province is Kirakira on Makira Island, which has a population of about 10 000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makira). Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II of the UK as its head of state; it consists of a large number of islands in Melanesia lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of 28 400 sq km (11 000 sq mi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands). The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.
