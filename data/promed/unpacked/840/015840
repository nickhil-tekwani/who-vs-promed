Papua New Guinea: More than 100 Dead in Measles Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak in the Western Highlands in Papua New Guinea has
killed at least 102 children in the past 4 months, according to
medical staff at the Mount Hagen General Hospital. Over 1200
pediatric measles patients were admitted to the hospital between Jan
2002 and Apr 2002, with 426 in April alone. Limited supplies of drugs
to treat the disease were received on Mon 29 Apr 2002 from the
Australian Agency for International Development, but one medical
officer said that would not be sufficient to curb the disease. To
prevent further spread of the disease, parents are being called on to
get their children vaccinated against measles.

[ProMED-mail does not usually comment on outbreaks of
vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles when they occur in known
endemic areas, but the severity of this outbreak is unusual and
suggests either a low vaccination coverage in the affected area or
perhaps a breakdown in the cold chain for the vaccine distribution.
(Many of the vaccines currently used in the childhood vaccination
programs have temperature maintenance constraints to preserve
potency. If these vaccines are transported and stored at
temperatures above the designated maximum temperatures, the result is
a loss of potency of the vaccine leading to the use of non-potent
vaccines with subsequent failure of the recipient to develop
antibodies against the disease.) Although wild measles isolates
exhibit varying degrees of geographically restricted genetic
variability, there has been no suggestion of failure of current
vaccines to provide adequate protection, although complications are
more common and severe in poorly nourished and chronically ill
children. The medications referred to in this article would be used
for treatment of complications and symptoms of measles, but would not
interrupt transmission of the virus. The only intervention that
would interrupt transmission of the virus would be vaccination of the
high-risk population with potent measles vaccine. - Mods.CP/MPP
