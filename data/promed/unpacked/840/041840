Angola: Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak 2005; IFRC final report (abridged)
---------------------------------------------------
[This Final Report of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC) covers the period 4 Apr to 3 Jul 2005]
Background and summary
----------------------
The outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) in Angola was a slow-onset
disaster, which became prominent in early 2005 after some epidemiological
tests identified the MHF virus. The first cases of the disease had been
reported in Uige province in October 2004. As of 14 Apr 2005, only 44 cases
had been confirmed on the basis of laboratory analysis of blood specimens.
As of 23 Aug 2005, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) reported a total of 374
cases, including 329 deaths (case fatality rate of 88 per cent). Of these,
368 cases -- including 323 deaths -- were reported in Uige Province and 158
of the cases were laboratory-confirmed.
A number of 'contacts' were monitored in Uige province and clinical
specimens from 'alerts' shipped to the Special Pathogens Programme,
National Microbiology Laboratory, and Public Health Agency of Canada for
diagnostic testing. The last confirmed case died on 21 Jul 2005, in Songo
Municipality (Uige Province) and there has been no laboratory-confirmed
case since then.
Individuals that were in contact with suspected or confirmed cases were
defined as "contacts" (they must have been in physical contact with a case,
with clothing and bed clothing or have slept in the same house for a
month). They do not necessarily become infected but require monitoring. The
identification and follow up of all contacts stopped the spread of the virus.
Surveillance mobile teams from MINSA, World Health Organization (WHO) and
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) were actively involved in searching
'contacts' to complete the epidemiological tree, a picture of the virus spread.
The US government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO,
and MSF conducted a joint assessment and one of the recommendations argued
against the temporary closure of Uige provincial hospital. The assessment
came up with recommendations aimed at preventing transmission of the virus
at the hospital. Some of them were implemented and the hospital remained
functional; for example, cleaning and disinfecting should be thoroughly
performed and personal protection equipment should be supplied in adequate
quantities. WHO supported the management of the hospital with a new team of
specialist who travelled to Angola in April 2005.
Red Cross action
----------------
On 4 Apr 2005, the Federation supported Angola Red Cross with an allocation
of CHF (Swiss Francs) 65 000 [USD 51 000] from its Disaster Relief
Emergency Fund (DREF) to initiate activities to control and prevent the
spread of the MHF and to sensitize communities on MHF.
Later on 22 Apr 2005, the Federation allocated some further CHF 187 000
[USD 147 000] to enable the national society to scale up activities in the
field. The German government, through the German Red Cross, contributed EUR
59 000 [USD 74 000] to cater for administrative and programme support costs
and EUR 3850 [USD 4826] towards the purchase of the non-food items. The
British Red Cross also contributed GBP 5000 [USD 9282] toward the
operation. The Angola Red Cross implemented a number of control, prevention
and sensitization activities in Uige province and the surrounding villages.
These included:
- distributing information, education and communication (IEC) material
donated by Social Mobilization Commission of Luanda;
- sticking cartoons stickers at public places, with theme "safe injection
only at the hospital"; - Conducting prevention campaigns among the affected
communities;
- training of the local communities' volunteers on social mobilization,
hygiene and health promotion;
- participating at the provincial traditional healers and midwives meetings
organized by UNICEF, with the aim of contributing to issues directed at
preventing and controlling the spread of MHF;
- conducting support visits to affected families to provide moral and
psychological support to affected families;
- meeting with traditional chiefs (Sobas) and parish administrators;
- distributing midwifery protective and hygiene material provided by the
government;
- attending meetings of the social mobilization sub-commission;
- addressing the public on MHF control and prevention during campaigns in
Uige town and the surrounding villages;
- developing a first aid programme for assistance during the operation;
- distributing non-food items (mattress, buckets, jerry-cans, bed sheets,
blankets, mosquito nets and soap).
The plan of action developed to be implemented during the 3 month operation
was revised and activities were expanded to include additional
municipalities in Uige (Mucaba, Bembe and Bungo). The revised plan of
action specifically focused on social mobilization, psycho-social support
as well as the distribution of basic non-food items and IEC material
through community volunteers.
The Angola Red Cross established an emergency commission at its
headquarters to coordinate all the daily activities in cases of Marburg
Hemorrhagic Fever outbreak. The emergency commission also maintained
permanent radio communication with Uige branches. The Uige Red Cross branch
reported that three Red Cross volunteers and another one from Help Health
Committee -- a local non-governmental organization (NGO) in Uige -- died on
14 April 2005. The volunteers were working on social mobilization
activities in the Cametery neighbourhood (in the city of Uige) when
lightning struck a tree under which they were hiding from heavy rains,
killing them instantly. The Federation received the news with shock. The
head of southern Africa regional delegation conveyed condolence messages to
the national society and the volunteer's families.
The regional disaster management (DM) support team sent alert messages to
the national societies in the region, especially those neighbouring and
doing business with Angola. Feedback was received from Namibia Red Cross
and the South African Red Cross Society in relation to their contingency
plans and their strategic branches at the borders were on alert. The
regional DM technical manager visited Angola to provide technical support
and was on the ground on 16 Apr 2005. The main objectives of the support
visit were:
- to ensure volunteer mobilization and training in social mobilization and
health education;
- to support the branch with some basic on-the-job DM training pending the
deployment of the Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT);
- to provide branch, local authorities and beneficiaries with coping
mechanisms through social mobilization and protection awareness.
The Federation regional delegation in Harare, with support from the
Secretariat, engaged a medical technician as of 16 Apr 2005. The medical
technician provided assistance in;
- assessing the general situation in collaboration with the health delegate
attached to Angola Red Cross and the regional DM technical manager;
- supporting the health delegate in liaising with the government and other
stakeholders and positioning of the Angola Red Cross and the Federation in
the field as required;
- providing technical advice on MHF to Red Cross staff, Red Cross
volunteers and those from the local authorities.
Coordination
------------
A Federation delegate from Guinea-Bissau was deployed to Uige Province to
support the logistics, distribution, and relief activities. The delegate
worked closely with the Angola Red Cross Society provincial secretary in
coordinating the operations and was communicating regularly with the
provincial local authority, provincial Marburg control committee and the
international team from the CDC, MSF, WHO, United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA). The Air Passenger Service of the World Food Programme (WFP)
operated twice-weekly flight to Uige, transporting the much needed
equipment and materials. Within the UN system, WHO closely monitored the
situation to identify any changes.
MINSA was responsible for coordinating the national response to the Marburg
epidemic operating under a cooperation agreement with Angola Red Cross
signed in 1996. This agreement stipulates that the 2 parties should
coordinate the assistance and protection of the population during an
epidemic caused by natural disaster. Angola Red Cross is also a member of
the National Civil Protection Commission, which played an important role in
controlling the spread of MHF. The national technical commission
strengthened coordination mechanisms in the areas of logistics,
epidemiology, and social mobilization, and to direct isolation and
treatment interventions in Uige, Luanda and other locations with confirmed
or suspected cases. The medical personnel in the affected areas also played
a significant role in influencing community behaviour and attitudes towards
the epidemic, especially fighting stigma and discrimination. At the
national level, the Angola Red Cross is a member of the social mobilization
sub-commissions; 2 national society staff were permanent members and
participated in all meetings. The Provincial Marburg Control Committee,
supervised by the provincial governor, ensured good coordination of
activities, thereby avoiding duplication of efforts among the stakeholders.
Through this committee, stakeholders stayed abreast of events and
activities in the field through daily meetings.
