CDC is collaborating with public health, veterinary, and agriculture officials in many states and the US Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Cotham infections linked to contact with pet bearded dragons purchased from multiple stores in different states. Bearded dragons are popular pet lizards, native to Australia, that come in a variety of colors. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, obtains DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE.

On 22 Jan 2014, CDC was notified by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services of a cluster of _S._ Cotham infections with a high proportion of ill persons reporting exposure to pet reptiles. Since 2012, there have been 12 ill persons infected with _S._ Cotham in Wisconsin, and 10 (83 percent) of 12 persons reported contact with pet bearded dragons. Wisconsin receives funding under the CDC FoodCORE (Foodborne Diseases Centers for Outbreak Response Enhancement) program. These centers work together to develop new and better methods to detect, investigate, respond to, and control multistate outbreaks of foodborne diseases.

_Salmonella_ Cotham is a rare serotype. Searching historical Salmonella databases, CDC determined that serotype Cotham represents only 0.01 percent of all human isolates in the USA since 1963. Before this outbreak, typically less than 25 serotype Cotham infections were reported to PulseNet annually. Given the rarity of the Cotham serotype and the information gathered by Wisconsin, CDC conducted a search of PulseNet for all _S._ Cotham infections reported since 2012.

As of 21 Apr 2014, a total of 132 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Cotham have been reported from 31 states since 21 Feb 2012. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows (listed in alphabetical order): Arizona (4), California (21), Colorado (2), Florida (3), Georgia (1), Idaho (3), Illinois (6), Kansas (6), Kentucky (4), Maryland (3), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (5), Minnesota (3), Missouri (7), Nebraska (1), Nevada (3), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (3), New York (10), North Carolina (2), Ohio (1), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (5), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (5), Texas (6), Utah (3), Virginia (3), Washington (4), and Wisconsin (12).

Among 132 persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 20 Feb 2012 to 1 Apr 2014. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 79 years, with a median age of 2 years. 58 percent of ill persons are children 5 years of age or younger. 51 percent of ill persons are female. Among 67 ill persons with available information, 28 (42 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
----------------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health agencies indicate that contact with pet bearded dragons is the likely source of this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Cotham infections.

On 25 Mar 2014, CDC sent a questionnaire to the states involved in the investigation to obtain more detailed information from ill persons about recent contact with reptiles. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. To date, CDC has received a total of 31 completed questionnaires. 27 (87 percent) of 31 persons interviewed reported contact with reptiles or their environments before becoming ill. When asked about the type of reptile, 25 (81 percent) of 31 persons reported contact with lizards; of these 25 persons, 21 (84 percent) specifically reported contact with bearded dragons, a type of lizard. The percentage of ill persons in this outbreak reporting contact with a reptile is substantially higher than the percentage of USA households that reported owning a pet reptile in a survey conducted in 2013-2014 by the American Pet Products Association (5.6 percent). State and local health departments are continuing to interview ill persons.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
The Oregon State Public Health Laboratory has isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Cotham from samples from a pet bearded dragon and its terrarium (habitat) collected from an ill person's home in Oregon.

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a US public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is an interagency partnership among CDC, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state and local health departments.

The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ and several other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens and submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory tested _Salmonella_ Cotham isolates collected from three ill persons infected with the outbreak strain. 1 (33 percent) of the 3 isolates tested was multidrug resistant (defined as resistance to at least 1 antibiotic in 3 or more antibiotic classes), and the other 2 (67 percent) isolates tested were pansusceptible (susceptible to all antibiotics tested). The multidrug resistant isolate has shown resistance to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, and gentamicin. One of these antibiotics, ceftriaxone, is commonly used to treat serious Salmonella infections, including those in children. The CDC NARMS laboratory is continuing to conduct antibiotic resistance testing on _Salmonella_ Cotham isolates collected from ill persons. Additional results will be reported when they become available.

Traceback investigation
-----------------------
The pet industry is working closely with CDC to determine the source of the bearded dragons linked to this outbreak in order to prevent additional illnesses. Through this collaboration, multiple potential bearded dragon breeders have been identified that supply lizards to pet stores in the United States where ill persons reported purchasing their animals. This investigation is ongoing and CDC will update the public when more information is available.

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk.

Pogona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
