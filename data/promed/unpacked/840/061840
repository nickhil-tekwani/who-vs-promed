Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) is advising waterfowlers and others not to move sick or dead geese, ducks or other birds in the North Sound due to a suspected avian influenza outbreak that has killed over 1150 birds in this important wintering grounds this fall [2022].

The most recent hotspot is Skagit Bay and nearby areas of the Skagit Delta, Camano Island and Port Susan, where some 700 dead birds, mostly young snow geese, have been collected. It's a "developing situation that has escalated significantly in the past 2 weeks," according to spokesman Chase Gunnell in Mill Creek.

"Our hope is that as sheetwater ice and snow melt around the North Sound, the waterfowl congregated on Skagit Bay will be able to spread out and this hotspot around the bay will dissipate," he says, adding though that infections are expected to continue through winter to varying degrees.

Ahead of the 10 Dec 2022 goose hunting reopener in Goose Management Area 1, WDFW is advising hunters that geese as well as ducks that appear healthy and are flying around "likely present minimal risk but should be cooked thoroughly before consumption."

But in the name of reducing the risk of disease transmission, hunters are also being asked to clean their kills with disposable gloves at home instead of the field -- where raptors might scavenge on them -- and then to double-bag the carcasses and place them in their garbage can. Hands, knives, cleaning surfaces and hunting gear should also be cleaned and disinfected, according to WDFW.

Waterfowlers' retrievers can also get sick from what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza -- this strain is HPAI 5 -- and so should be kept away from sick or dead birds the dogs may encounter in the marshes.

"DO NOT attempt to move sick birds to a veterinarian or rehabilitation center, or to your home, as this can spread the disease," an agency statement out late this morning [8 Dec 2022] stressed. "If a dead bird must be moved, it is best to wear disposable gloves while handling it and to double bag and dispose of the carcass in the garbage where pets and scavengers can't reach it."

According to WDFW officials, "infected birds may appear lethargic, unable to fly, and exhibit wheezing, vomiting, or have diarrhea or secretions from their mouth or nostrils."

A November [2022] outbreak centered on Whatcom County's Wiser Lake killed more than 450 geese and ducks. Die-offs are occurring elsewhere in the Northwest as well, including at least 350 snow geese and ducks in Idaho south of Boise after unusually large numbers of snows dropped in late November. And it's also affecting backyard birds in Oregon as well.

[2] Louisiana: goose, pelican, birds of prey, vulture

The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries says avian influenza or bird flu has spread into more parishes in Louisiana. Dr. Jim LaCour, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries wildlife veterinarian, said the virus travels with infected birds. "Now with the migration of the birds south it has finally reached Louisiana after the better part of a year."

He says his staff is sampling birds to keep track of the virus and have found it spreading in the state. He says birds from Avoyelles, Calcasieu, Morehouse, Ouachita, and Richland parishes have tested positive. He says geese, pelicans, eagles, hawks, and vultures have tested positive -- and domestic poultry is highly vulnerable.

LaCour says the CDC considers the virus to be low risk to humans, but hunters who are exposed to areas, such as flooded fields, where they could come into contact with it ought to be especially careful. "If they have chickens or turkeys at their homes, they can bring this virus back to their poultry and the virus can kill the poultry," LaCour said.

LaCour says hunters keep their hunting clothes away from their other clothes until they get a chance to wash them in extremely hot water because the virus thrives in cold water. He says he expects it to keep spreading until it reaches a peak in the spring and then subsides. "This is a cyclic event. It's not the first time it's happened and it probably won't be the last time," LaCour said.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 along the Atlantic coast of North America spread rapidly across the continent, having recently reached South America with reports as far south as Chile. After the number of cases declined since June 2022, they bounced back in the past few months, probably enhanced by migratory movements.

Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the maintenance and propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic.

The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. - Mod.PMB
