Since 2013, a condition now named rapid apple decline (RAD) for its sudden onset has caused apple trees to quickly deteriorate and die across North America. Researchers at Cornell AgriTech teamed up to explore potential causes of RAD, such as pathogens, insects, cold weather injury, and root system interactions. While their findings revealed no direct above-ground causes, they noticed that a weaker root system could potentially contribute to the decline.

"So very little is known about the below-ground root system of apple rootstocks right now," [they] said. "By performing a comprehensive analysis of these systems, we are hopeful that this project will uncover the answers." [They] will hone in on the complex dynamics of apple root systems and explore the behavior of viruses in commercial apple orchards. [They] will work with commercial growers to compare samples of both declining and healthy trees from different orchards and soil systems [and] will also obtain trees from nurseries for analysis.

[They] will explore a possible connection between high-density orchard systems and RAD [and] establish whether the presence of viruses in nursery trees may weaken the root system. [They] also will examine a wide variety of commonly used commercial apple rootstocks to determine whether there is a connection between RAD and specific rootstocks. "We want to help growers make good decisions about using cultivars that do not have viruses present on the right rootstock and in the right site."

[This undiagnosed disease or disorder in apple orchards was previously reported from Michigan and New York (ProMED-mail post 20100608.1911). It now appears to be either much more widely distributed, or it is being more readily recognised ever since it has been defined as a distinct problem. However, so far not much progress seems to have been made in finding a cause (see ProMED-mail post 20171228.5526316).

Association with specific rootstocks and apple varieties may imply graft transmissible agents such as viruses, viroids, or phytoplasmas. Molecular methods are needed for their detection in a systematic search for pathogens. RAD may also represent a syndrome including a number of different pathogens and/or external factors, which would make the task of identifying any causes much more complex.

Generally, to identify a biotic or abiotic cause for a disease or disorder of unknown aetiology, a defined process must be followed: description of specific symptoms in individual plants; patterns of their distribution in space and time; evidence for or against transmission of symptoms and spread of the condition; Koch's rules (that is, to re-isolate an infectious pathogen after culture and transmission, or equivalent processes for non-culturable pathogens) to test for causation by a biotic agent; and molecular studies to identify a known or characterise a novel potential infectious agent. Especially in slow growing hosts, such as trees, this process may take many years and it would be complicated considerably if a previously unknown pathogen were to be involved.
