Further outbreaks of bluetongue have been reported around Europe in the past week. [In France, serotype 8; elsewhere, serotype 4.]

The disease was only detected in cattle; one of the outbreaks occurred on a mixed goat and cattle farm [see further -- Romania].

Five new outbreaks were reported in France, located in the Puy-de-Dome region, all caused by BTV-8 [bluetongue virus serotype 8]. Out of 808 susceptible animals, there were 6 recorded cases.

In Slovenia, 2 cattle reacted positively [non-clinically] to a qRT-PCR test during a monitoring programme, in a herd of over 40 cattle in Kuzma, in the northern region of Murska Sobota.

Three outbreaks were detected in Austria, close to the border with Hungary, and 2 were located close to the Slovenian region where an outbreak in 4 cattle tested antigen-positive, although there were no clinical signs.

In Romania, 2 backyard holdings were affected in the Botosani and Vaslui regions. Out of the susceptible 23 cattle and 104 goats, 3 cattle were confirmed positive.

The outbreaks in Austria, Romania and Hungary were serotyped 4 but the serotype of the Slovenian outbreak has yet to be identified.

[The (subclinical) infection of 2 cattle in Slovenia has not been serotyped yet; most likely, this infection is caused by the same virus which has already affected Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Austria and Turkey, namely BTV-4.

Turkey has reported on 20 Nov 2015 a single BTV-4 outbreak in a sheep flock counting 833 susceptible animals, of which 7 sheep have, reportedly, undergone a "subclinical infection." Their vaccination history was not provided. In case unvaccinated, the subclinical picture is rather unusual and deserves clarification. Sheep are known, in general, as a species which suffers clear clinical disease following infection with pathogenic strains; serotype 4 is known to have caused serious outbreaks in the past. According to the Turkish report, the outbreak had started on 6 Oct 2015.

France has been undergoing a large outbreak this year (2015) with BTV-8 which is regarded to be similar to the one which had caused a major outbreak in north-western and central Europe in 2006-2008, was briefly recorded in France in 2010 and may have remained circulating under the radar since. On 26 Nov 2015, BTV-8 was reported for the 1st time in an additional prefecture of France, namely Lozere, subsequently added to the restricted zone (http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2015/11/26/97001-20151126FILWWW00167-fievre-catarrhale-ovine-premier-cas-en-lozere.php).
