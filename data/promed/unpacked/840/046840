USDA searches for pest in potatoes from Canada
-----------------------------------------------
[The US Department of] Agriculture (USDA) is tracing seed-potato
shipments to Washington, Oregon, Idaho and 5 other states from Canada
that it fears might have been carrying a microscopic, wormlike pest
that attacks potato plants. The department has banned additional
shipments into the United States and plans to search for the golden
potato cyst nematode in fields in Washington, Idaho, Oregon,
California, North Dakota, Colorado, Maine and Nebraska, said Larry
Hawkins, a spokesman for the USDA in Sacramento, CA.
U.S. officials are concerned that discovery of the golden nematode in
any of the 8 states could lead to some countries banning U.S.
potatoes, which happened in 2006 with the discovery of the similar
pale potato cyst nematode in Idaho, Hawkins said Tuesday [18 Dec
2007]. The department closed the U.S. border to seed potatoes from
the Canadian province of Alberta on 1 Nov 2007 after officials with
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] on 23 Oct 2007 announced
the discovery of the golden nematode at 2 farms about 60 miles [96 km] apart.
"At this point the concern we have is whether or not Canada has been
able to determine what the extent of the infestation is in Canada,"
Hawkins said. Earlier this month [December 2007], Mexico also cut off
shipments of Alberta seed potatoes. Canadian seed growers have since
mounted a campaign to reopen the U.S. border.
"From our perspective we don't think [the ban] is justified," said
Alain Boucher, national manager of the potato cyst nematode emergency
section of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. "Some farms have no
association at all with the 2 fields, but by default they are all
treated the same."
He said it is unclear how the nematode got into Alberta. Seed Potato
Growers of Alberta [PGA] recently sent a letter to U.S. clients
asking them to contact agriculture officials to request the
restrictions be lifted. "They're lobbying very hard to get the U.S.
potato growers to accept seed potatoes, and we feel that's very
risky," Hawkins said. The nematodes feed at the roots of potato
plants and can reduce crop production by 80 percent. Officials say
the pest is not harmful to humans and doesn't have any effect on the
potatoes themselves. Seed potatoes are an inch [2.5 cm] or 2 in
diameter and are often grown in colder areas at higher elevations.
When planted, they grow into potato plants that produce more potatoes.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_) and pale (_G. pallida_) cyst
nematodes cause serious crop losses in potato. They can also infect
other solanaceous crops and weeds. Symptoms on potato are stunting,
yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system,
which is abnormally branched and brownish in colour. Damage to the
crop varies from small patches of poor growing plants to complete
crop failure. Diseased plants 1st occur in isolated patches and these
become larger with each new crop if potatoes are continually grown on
the infested site. In light infestations, potato plants may show no
above ground symptoms, but yield can be reduced. Light infestations
can reduce tuber size, whereas heavy infestations reduce both number
and size of tubers.
The nematodes are not greatly influenced by soil type and temperature
and thrive wherever potatoes are grown. The pathogens survive in soil
in the absence of a host as cysts containing viable eggs. These can
survive in soil, which has not been planted to potatoes, for up to 20
years. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant
material. It takes about 6-7 years from introduction into a potato
paddock before numbers of the nematodes reach a detectable level.
Disease management includes exclusion, quarantine, and crop rotation
with non-host species.
_G. rostochiensis_ is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and Asia,
and occurs in parts of the Americas. It has been included on the
alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Its
1st report in Canada was in 1965 in British Columbia. Strict
sanitation measures are being applied to try to prevent further
spread in Canada.
