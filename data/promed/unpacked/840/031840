One more child succumbed to encephalitis at a hospital here, taking
the death toll due to the deadly disease in eastern UP to 128 this
year [2011]. 13 new cases have been reported to the state-run BRD
Medical College Hospital since yesterday [5 Aug 2011], Senior
Paediatrician K.P Kushwaha said. 124 patients suffering from the
disease are undergoing treatment in the hospital.

As many as 731 encephalitis cases were reported in hospitals in the
region this year [2011]. Gorakhpur and Kushinagar are the worst
affected districts.

The fever is caused by a virus found in pigs and is transferred to
humans by mosquito bite.

[The 3 Aug 2011 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20110804.2356) indicated
that there have been 107 deaths from Japanese encephalitis virus
infections. The above report indicates that there are now 128 cases.
Although the above report does not indicate the specific etiology of
the encephalitis cases, the mention that the virus is found in pigs
and transmitted by mosquitoes is a clear implication that JE virus is
involved. It would be of interest to know whether all of these cases
were laboratory confirmed as JE virus infections.
