----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following your request please find below a summary of the limited microbiological investigations conducted at the Animal Health Trust [AHT] on samples that were submitted to our diagnostic microbiology laboratories by veterinary surgeons attending racehorses in Newmarket [Suffolk] during a period of August 2016. We understand that attending veterinary surgeons would also have submitted samples to their own veterinary practice laboratories whilst dealing with this same incident. However, although we are not aware of what those tests specifically revealed, we understand that they were similarly inconclusive in terms of identifying a specific microbiological causative agent.

Between 10 and 25 Aug 2016, the Animal Health Trust's diagnostic laboratories received 11 respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal washes) submitted from Newmarket racehorses by their attending veterinary surgeons for viral and bacterial pathogen detection using sensitive PCR methods -- unfortunately these did not demonstrate consistent positive results to indicate a single causal agent likely to be responsible for these cases. Indeed there was only one sample that was positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and 2 others that were positive for the bacterium _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ -- this latter result is though not unexpected as this organism is commonly carried in the upper respiratory tract by outwardly healthy animals, but has been consistently associated with lower respiratory tract disease (inflammatory airway disease or IAD) in young racehorses that can involve large numbers of the bacteria recovered from the trachea, which show evidence of mucus and inflammatory response. The AHT serology laboratory only received paired blood samples (samples taken during acute and convalescent phases of disease to evaluate changes in antibody levels in response to recent infection) from one animal and this did not show evidence of rising antibodies against any of the viral agents (EHV-1, EHV-4, flu, rhinitis viruses, and adenovirus) or the bacterium _Streptococcus equi_, the cause of strangles -- obviously this is only one animal but again, doesn't suggest anything specific and for which there is a test available, was involved. Taken together these limited results do mean that the significant recognised equine infectious diseases of equine influenza and strangles can, with a certain amount of confidence, be excluded.

[ProMED-mail is most grateful for the prompt and detailed response to our RFI, as received from Dr Newton of the Animal Health Trust. We would also like to acknowledge and thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project assistance that was provided.

According to the results of tests performed in samples obtained from 11 of the affected horses, the involvement of equine influenza and strangles (infection with _Streptococcus equi_) could be excluded "with a certain amount of confidence." Notably, convalescent serum was received (and tested) from one animal only.

It will be interesting to note if serum samples were obtained also from the other (10) sampled horses during the acute phase of their infection. In such case, convalescent sera could still be derived from these horses, submitted to the laboratory and tested in tandem with the earlier (acute-phase) obtained sera for the changes in antibody levels in relation to the potential candidate viral agents of respiratory equine diseases. - Mod.AS
