The number of cholera deaths continues to rise in Guinea in 2006 as
state radio reported a new flood of cases in the Forest Region of the
southwest. State radio on Wed, 21 Jun 2006, reported the deaths of 16
persons in the Kissidougou prefecture, 500 km southwest of the
capital Conakry, and local clinics have registered a further 173
cases of the water borne disease.
According to UN figures released in May 2006, 111 people had died
following outbreaks of the disease in the prefectures of Gueckedou,
Kissidougou, N'zerekore and Lola -- all in the Forest Region close to
the Liberian border. Guinea's Forest Region shelters tens of
thousands of refugees, most from Liberia but some from Sierra Leone
and Cote d'Ivoire. According to the UN, Lola prefecture where one of
the largest camps for Liberian refugees is based, has had continuous
cases of cholera since 2005.

A cholera outbreak has hit Goma, the capital city of North Kivu
province in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo with 14 cases
having been reported in the government forces garrisoned in the
region, the UN mission to the country said on Wed, 21 Jun 2006.
The 14 cases were reported in the 5th and 7th brigades of the
government forces, said a press officer of the UN mission, adding
that the officers and soldiers of the 2 brigades, as well as their
families were living in appalling health conditions and running out
of drinking water and medicine. The press officer said another
cholera outbreak had occurred in the region of Rutshuru, some 50 km
north of Goma, leading to 7 deaths in the ninth brigade of the
government forces.
Most of the 800 000 residents in Goma have been drinking the unclean
water of lake Kivu since Jan 2002 when a volcano eruption destroyed
the water-supply system in the city. Last Aug 2005, more than 800
cholera cases were reported in the 4th brigade of the DRC government
forces in Goma and 30 people died.

incidence are Luanda where the outbreak started and Namibe, one of
the last (so far) to be affected.
