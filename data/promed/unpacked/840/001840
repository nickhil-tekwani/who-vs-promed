New sugarcane disease found in Nghe An
--------------------------------------
Around 4873 hectares [12 041 acres] of sugarcane in the central
province of Nghe An have been hit by sugarcane grassy shoot, an
unusual disease that stunts growth, the Plant Protection Department said.

Reported in Viet Nam for the 1st time, the disease, however, has the
ability to spread very widely. It is caused by a phytoplasma and
leaves sugarcane with its leaves and neck twisted. Sugarcane
varieties most susceptible to grassy shoot are MY 5514, ROC 10, F 156
and, especially, Vien Lam, a variety imported from China, which is
100 percent diseased.

The department has ordered local authorities to destroy farms on
which 20 percent of the cane has the disease.

[Sugarcane grassy shoot (SCGS) is an as yet unclassified phytoplasma.
It is reported from several countries in South East Asia where it can
cause considerable crop losses. SCGS phytoplasma is also found in
millets (_Sorghum_ and _Pennisetum_ species). Symptoms in sugarcane
include stunting, excessive tillering and side shoots giving a
grass-like appearance. Leaves may be soft and reduced in size with
white coalescing stripes which may result in total leaf chlorosis.
Symptoms are usually more severe on ratoon crops than on 1st planted
ones. SCGS is readily spread by infected setts, and it has been
suggested that the pathogen may also be transmitted by leafhoppers.
Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and
use of clean planting material. The phytoplasma may be eliminated
from contaminated setts by heat therapy. Sugarcane lines resistant to
SCGS are available.
