A 21-year-old man who had never been vaccinated is the 1st confirmed case of yellow fever in Parana. This case was identified on Sat 26 Jan 2019, when a task force of the State Secretariat of Health went to the Litoral in order to organize, together with the Antonina municipality, strategies to deal with the disease. The young man is hospitalized in the Litoral Regional Hospital and is doing well, with a mild form of the disease.

With the formation of the Center of Emergency Health Operations (COES) by the state Secretariat, a team went again to the Litoral this Tue 29 Jan 2019, and created a Paranagua First Regional Health COES in order to monitor the disease.

The COES also prepared a document with the so-called clinical management flow in order to orient the health professionals with the identification and treatment of yellow fever, since the last case of the disease occurred in 2015, when the disease was contracted outside the state.

Various measures and strategies to deal with the disease are now in progress by the State Secretariat for Health, especially directed at the 7 municipalities of the 1st region and municipalities of the 2nd region, due to their proximity to Sao Paulo state where several cases now have been confirmed [see the report below].

A reinforcement team sent by the State Secretariat is visiting each of the cities of these 2 regions in order to identify the difficulties and actively search in communities more isolated to urge the population to take the vaccination. From Thu 31 Jan 2019 until 5 Feb 2019, a person by person search will be carried out in the entire area where the virus is suspected to circulate.

The alert is also extended to strategic groups in the areas of risk, such as truck drivers who descend to the Port of Paranagua, public security officials, and workers of companies that circulate in the Atlantic Forest. Up to now, no more dead monkeys have been found.

Alert: The symptoms are fever with sudden onset in people who have never been vaccinated against yellow fever or with vaccination of less than 10 days and who have been in forested areas where circulation of the virus has been documented during the 15 previous days.

These conditions must be associated with another 2 or more signs such as headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pains, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, icterus, or hemorrhage.

The Health Secretariat orients [everyone] that all information about dead monkeys and the occurrence of suspected cases, be immediately notified to the Center for Strategic Information for Health Surveillance (CIEVS), that is on continuous duty. The telephone numbers are (41) 99117-3500 and (41) 99917-0444.

[Although the response to this single case may seems like an overreaction, it is not. Presumably, this case is due to spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle to the young man. The valid concerns are that a single case indicates that active yellow fever (YF) virus transmission is occurring in the area and that there is the risk that a sylvan case could spark an urban outbreak should a viremic individual be in a setting where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are abundant and the people not vaccinated. - Mod.TY]

[2] Sao Paulo state: US CDC travel alert

Level 2 travel alert issued by CDC for Brazil regarding the yellow fever virus [YFV]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2019, the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo has reported 12 new cases of yellow fever virus, including 6 deaths, said the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

Historically, yellow fever virus transmission is at its highest between December and May each year, the PAHO said on 25 Jan 2019.

This is important news since over 6 million people visited Brazil during 2018, says the World Tourism Organization.

And, protection from the yellow fever is important since about 15% of people who get this virus develop serious illness, that can sometimes be fatal, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of 2018, the preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever indicate that 13.3 million people in Sao Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro, and 1.85 million in the Bahia states were vaccinated.

"Human cases reported during the current 2018-2019 seasonal period in Sao Paulo State, as well as the confirmation of epizootics in the state of Parana, mark the beginning of what could be a 3rd cycle and a progression of the outbreak towards the Southeast and South regions of Brazil," the PAHO said.

The previous yellow fever waves of transmission were during the 2016-2017 seasonal period, with 778 human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017-2018 seasonal period, with 1376 human cases, including 483 deaths.

In the United States, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published a recommendation in 2015 that one dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection and is adequate for most travelers.

The CDC says the clinician's decision whether or not to vaccinate any traveler must take into account the traveler's risk of being infected with YFV, country entry requirements, and individual risk factors for serious adverse events after yellow fever vaccination.

Revaccination against yellow fever was previously required by certain countries at 10-year intervals to comply with the International Health Regulations.

As of July 2016, a completed International Certificate of Vaccination is valid for the lifetime of the vaccinee. Moreover, countries cannot require proof of revaccination against yellow fever as a condition of entry, even if the last vaccination was more than 10 years prior, says the CDC.

With the caveats described above, international travelers should refer to the online version of this CDC book [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-home] and the CDC Travelers' Health website [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel] for any reported updates to country entry requirements since the publication of this edition.

As of July 2018, the CDC published updated maps [https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/index.html] indicating which countries require yellow fever vaccination.

In response to Brazil's YFV outbreak, the CDC issued a Level 2 Travel Alert [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/yellow-fever-brazil] during May 2018 recommending visitors to Brazil protect themselves from yellow fever by getting the vaccination at least 10 days before arrival.

Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus that is spread through mosquito bites. To prevent getting sick from the yellow fever virus, the CDC says to use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and get vaccinated.

International travelers can find convenient locations to schedule a vaccination appointment by visiting Vax-Before-Travel [https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/vax-before-travel/appointment].

In the USA, the Stamaril vaccine is approved and has a clinical efficacy profile similar to the YF-VAX vaccine and is available at select locations.

The CDC Vaccine Price List provides private sector vaccine prices for general information. And, vaccine discounts can be found on this webpage.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the CDC [https://vaers.hhs.gov].

[Although no information is provided about the specific localities where YF was acquired in Sao Paulo state, their proximity to cases that occurred during the previous YF outbreak in the state, or the conditions under which the 12 new cases became infected, this news is of concern. The situation for Brazil is of concern, as the yellow fever (YF) transmission season for the current year (2019) is just beginning. The percent vaccination coverages for the affected municipalities in Sao Paulo state are not mentioned. Statewide, the 6.5 million individuals already vaccinated represent just 53.6% coverage of the population, far short of the 80% or more necessary to provide good YF coverage. One hopes that the Sao Paulo health authorities are responding aggressively to the occurrence of these cases and mounting intensified surveillance for infected people and monkeys, coupled with an aggressive vaccination campaign to provide coverage to people in the areas of risk who have not been vaccinated. - Mod.TY
