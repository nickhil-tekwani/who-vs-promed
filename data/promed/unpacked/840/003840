[The report above addresses cases in the entire affected localities. It presents only numbers of confirmed cases, and not suspected cases, so the actual numbers of chikungunya virus infections are doubtless higher than those presented above.

Public Health Directorate is extremely alert with the chikungunya virus having spread rapidly to 8 islands. For the 1st time, 3 questionable cases have been reported in Aruba. However, these have not been confirmed yet. Blood samples for testing have been taken and sent to laboratories in the Netherlands for analysis.

"We will receive the results next week, [week of 27 Jan 2014]" official of the Public Health Directorate, Eugene Maduro, said during the press conference organized this morning [24 Jan 2014] to inform everyone on the state of affairs regarding chikungunya and dengue. Both viruses are carried by the _Aedes aegypti _ mosquito. "Meanwhile one person infected with the chikungunya-virus has died", Maduro said. This person lived on St Maarten. "The 3 questionable cases on Aruba had been on holiday on St Maarten. The persons were begged to isolate themselves. "Sleep under a mosquito net and preferably keep off the streets as much as possible", Maduro said. "The yellow fever and Mosquito Control [unit] meanwhile rushed to the residences of these persons to remove all mosquitoes and [their] breeding grounds."

The largest concern of the Public Health Directorate is it becoming a local epidemic as is the case on St Maarten, where already 780 people reported possible infection. "If these 3 questionable cases on Aruba are indeed infected with chikungunya [virus], they are so-called imported cases. They were infected elsewhere. Any indication of a local epidemic and we will be even worse off [and] lose control. We must go all out to prevent this."

[This situation is another illustration of the risk that inter-island travel presents for dissemination of chikungunya virus in the region. If any or all 3 of these imported cases are confirmed as chikungunya virus infections, one hopes that the rapid response by the Aruba health authorities has prevented ongoing transmission of the virus.
