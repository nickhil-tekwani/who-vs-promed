Swine fever threatens pigs in farms in Tanzania's capital
-----------------------------------
DAR ES SALAAM -- A recent outbreak of the highly contagious African swine
fever (ASF) is posing a threat to thousands of pigs in farms in Tanzania's
capital Dar es Salaam. The pigs face slaughter on precautionary grounds as
the government has put farm animals under quarantine throughout the city.
The government has ordered the restriction of the movement of pigs and pig
products including pork, sausage, smoked bacon and ham with immediate effect.
"All pigs in farms having been affected by the outbreak should be
slaughtered under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon," a joint
statement of the chief municipal veterinary officers of districts said. It
is still not clear what caused the outbreak of the viral disease nor how
long it would take to halt the spread of the disease. A source [from the
pig industry warned if the outbreak of ASF is not traced quickly, the
number of animals to be slaughtered is incalculable.
ASF is a viral disease [that affects pigs and wild boars, [for which there
is no cure or vaccine. The only method to eradicate the disease is by
slaughter and safe disposal of carcasses, banning swill feeding,
restricting movement of pigs and pig products, and cleaning and
disinfecting affected farms. Although the disease has no effect on humans,
it could
hurt hundreds of farmers in the area, [according to experts.
