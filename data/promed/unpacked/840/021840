Thailand: More Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Five new patients in the bird flu red zones of Phitsanulok and
Phichit, Thailand are suspected of having caught the H5N1 virus. The
Thai Public Health Ministry stated the number of suspected cases has
been pushed to 44, all of which are awaiting laboratory test results,
the Bangkok Post has reported.
The 5 new patients all showed signs of influenza and all had direct
contact with chickens in areas where mass chicken deaths have been
reported, the newspaper said. A 42-year-old woman and a 4-year-old
girl both fell ill after they touched dead chicken carcasses at their
homes in Phichit, where mysterious mass chicken deaths have occurred.
Five other provinces are said to be vulnerable to bird flu, including
Sukhothai, Uttaradit, Suphan Buri and Nakhon Pathom. Officials in
those zones have been urged to follow procedures to prevent the
spread of the disease.

[ProMED-mail continues to receive reports of suspected human cases of
H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in Thailand, mostly but not
exclusively from the province of Phichit. According to this report,
as of 29 Jul 2006, the number of suspected but unconfirmed cases has
reached 44. So far, only a single case has been confirmed, a
17-year-old youth residing in the province of Phichit, one of the
"red zone provinces;" see: ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human
(103): Thailand, susp. 20060728.2093." This youth tested positive for
both dengue and H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. It is not clear
at this stage whether the youth's dengue virus infection status
affected his susceptibility and response to H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection.

[The Thai Ministry of Health maintains a section on avian influenza
on their website. In this section they list information on the
number of individuals under observation for possible avian influenza,
and the number of suspected and confirmed cases. According to the
most recent update (29 Jun 2006 available at
<http://thaigcd.ddc.moph.go.th/AI_case_report_060729.html>) there has
been one confirmed case, there are presently no suspected cases, but
there are presently 80 cases "under observation", with a cumulative
total of 1915 cases from 67 provinces that have been "under
observation" for avian influenza since Jan 2006. The newswires seem
to be jumping on local reports of cases under observation and
publishing them as though they were strongly suspected to be cases of
H5N1, only to be ruled out once the laboratory results are available.
While the Agricultural sector in Thailand has had significant
problems with reporting of suspected avian influenza, the human
health sector has apparently been more successful in most (albeit not
all) instances. - Mod.MPP]
