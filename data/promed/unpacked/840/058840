[During the 1st 3 months of 2005, Italy was the only EU country reporting
EIA to the ADNS (Animal Disease Notification System): 2 cases, 8 Mar 2005.
The disease was reported from Italy (Pavia) also, in July 2004. No other EU
country reported the presence of EIA during 2004.
According to OIE's data (last available annual report, 2003), 28 countries
have reported the presence of the disease. EIA seems to be present in most
countries of the American continent, in Australia and in south-east Europe,
especially the Balkan countries. See
