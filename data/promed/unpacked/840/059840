Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), an acute and highly contagious
viral disease of sheep and goats, is raging in a VDC [Village
Development Committee, see footnote*] of Nawalparasi district
[Mid-Western region] for the past one week. Until now, the disease
has already claimed more than 5000 in the district, including 160
goats at Arkhala VDC, causing massive loss to farmers. Sitaram
Marahatta, technician at District Livestock Office, said the disease
spread from a billy goat brought from Kawaswoti. Following the spread
of PPR, the livestock office vaccinated at least 5000 goats in
several villages as part of a vaccination campaign.

[*A village development committee (VDC) in Nepal is the lower
administrative part of its local development ministry. Each district
has several VDCs, similar to municipalities but with greater
public-government interaction and administration. There are 3913
village development committees in Nepal. A VDC is further divided
into wards, the number depending on the population of the district,
the average is 9 wards].

[PPR, also named stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome, is a highly
infectious viral disease in small ruminants, with high case fatality
rates, which may go as high as 70-80 percent in goats. A homologous
PPR vaccine, the PPRV vaccine Nigeria 75/1 strain, became available
during the 90's with excellent results. It is a live vaccine cultured
in Vero cells. The original strain of the virus, isolated in Nigeria
in 1975, has been attenuated by serial passages in Vero cell cultures
(see reference below). The seed is stored in freeze-dried form at -20
deg C (-4 deg F) and reportedly may be obtained from the 2 OIE
Reference Laboratories for PPR, namely CIRAD/EMVT, Montpellier,
France and the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, UK.
In 1998, the OIE International Committee endorsed the use of this
vaccine in countries that have decided to follow the 'OIE pathway'
for epidemiological surveillance for rinderpest in order to avoid
confusion when serological surveys are performed. The production of
the commercially available attenuated PPRV vaccine is described at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.07.11_PPR.pdf>.

The efficacy of the homologous PPR vaccine has been recently
demonstrated in Israel: since its introduction in March 2006, not a
single outbreak of PPR has been recorded there, while in previous
years, when the Plowright rinderpest vaccine was applied in small
ruminants, outbreaks of PPR were recorded almost every year. The
annual numbers of PPR outbreaks in Israel were, since 1997, as
follows: 1, 3, 2, 8, 12, 0, 4, 1, 9, 2 (=2006: new vaccine introduced
in March), 0, 0, 0.

PPR is regarded endemic in Nepal. The disease has been spreading with
accelerated pace during the last 2 decades, currently covering, on
top of most of Africa, also the Middle East, as well as vast parts of
Asia. OIE maps of PPR distribution can be generated in the
