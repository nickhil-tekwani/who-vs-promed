The number of cases in the Dumfries and Galloway measles outbreak has
reached 21 -- including one teacher and 2 pupils at a Dumfries primary school.
The region has an MMR vaccine uptake of over 93 per cent and this has risen
since this outbreak was confirmed. Recent research has shown 25 postcode
areas in Scotland where one in 5 nursery children is at risk of measles.
Health experts in the south west say that level of uptake could lead to
much more serious outbreaks of the disease.
Dumfries and Galloway public health consultant Dr David Breen said the
impact of measles would be much greater in areas with low vaccination
rates. "In many ways people who are not immunised are being protected by
those who are immunised," he said. "Once the figures go down you get into
problems. For most people, yes, it is only measles. It seems like we are
doing a lot of immunising for what was accepted years ago as just something
you got. What the public won't accept is people dying from it."
Dr Breen stressed that the number of people getting complications from
measles remained very low. He said that a policy of "informed consent" in
Dumfries and Galloway had led to the high uptake of the MMR vaccine. He
added that there had been increased demand since the outbreak was
confirmed. It appears that the spread of the disease in the region -- which
first emerged around Kirkcowan and New Galloway -- has started to slow
down. "At the moment we are just watching it day by day," said Dr Breen.
"We are keeping an open mind on it, it could spread to other areas."
The youngest child affected so far was 3 years old, with the oldest person
aged 39. The small number of pupils and staff who have not been immunised
at the affected Dumfries primary school have all been contacted to see if
they want the vaccine. "We are chasing our tails in many ways," admitted Dr
Breen. "We know this will eventually probably burn itself out."
