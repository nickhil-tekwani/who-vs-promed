The total toll from "mysterious" fever has continued to escalate with 13
more deaths reported from Ramabai Nagar district ([formerly] Kanpur Dehat)
on Sunday [10 Oct 2010]. More and more people infected with the
unidentified virus have flocked the district hospital in Akbarpur. So far,
256 people have already died during the past few days. A team of district
officials visited the affected villages on Sunday [10 Oct 2010] to
ascertain the facts and figures of human casualties. It has been learnt
during the visit that as many as 400 people, most of whom are minors, are
down with fever.

The disease started from Ahrauli Sheikh village in Amraudha block and
within a month spread to 48 villages, housing 3000 families. It was also
learnt that the infants who fell victim to the disease were suffering from
acute malnutrition. "The infants were suffering from malnutrition and that
made some of them vulnerable to the killer virus," said district nodal
officer (epidemic) Arvind Sachan.

[This report provides no additional information about the nature of the
disease (other than fever), nor its likely etiological agent (other than
"killer virus") beyond similar statements in the 1st report of 4 Oct 2010
(cited below). There has been a significant increase in the number of fatal
cases, from 180 in the 4 Oct 2010 report to 256 indicated above. In the
absence of additional information, it is impossible to speculate rationally
about what is going on in this outbreak. Sadly, the complete article goes
on at some length about complaints by local people charging inadequate
availability of medical facilities and attention in this area. If samples
have been collected and sent to a reference laboratory, ProMED-mail would
be interested in receiving information about the results as they become
available.
