China's agriculture ministry said on Monday [10 Dec 2018] it will ban pig farming in areas inhabited by wild boars to prevent the spread of highly contagious African swine fever [ASF].

China, the world's top pork producer, has reported more than 80 outbreaks of ASF across the country since early August [2018], leading to the culling of hundreds of thousands of pigs.

The ministry said that a strain of the virus found last month [November 2018] in a wild boar was different from the one circulating among domestic pigs, and it warned of the risks of an additional strain infecting its domestic herd.

[The ban on pig farming in areas inhabited by wild boars is in need of more detail, in particular the definition of "areas." According to FAO's assessment (March 2018): "The species is widely distributed throughout China, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and north of the country, including the Tibetan plateau, and the region bordering Mongolia. However, little precise information is available about the ecology, population structure and dynamics, as well as the actual distribution and density, of wild boar in China."

Identifying in China's wild boar population an ASF virus strain which is different from the strain circulating in domestic pigs may be very concerning news; a separate circulation, not originating in domestic pig farms but elsewhere, should be excluded.

The 1st wild boar event, published on 16 Nov 2018 (20181116.6149559), addressed a single animal found dead in Daqinggou Village, Hongtuya Township, Hunjiang District, Baishan, Jilin province, initially described in a press release of China's Ministry of Agriculture (http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yqfb/201811/t20181116_6163229.htm). The case was later reported to the OIE (Jilin's follow-up report, No. 3, submitted on 22 Nov 2018; at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=28665). As can be seen in the map included, the location is adjacent to the border with North Korea.

According to the press release, an investigating team was immediately dispatched to the site to carry out an epidemic situation assessment.

More than 2 weeks later, on 3 Dec 2018, an ASF outbreak was reported from farmed wild boar in another northeastern province, namely Heilongjiang. An investigation team was dispatched to this location as well. This event was similarly included in a ministry press release, dated 3 Dec 2018, (ProMED post 20181204.6179428; the press release, in Chinese, is available at http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yqfb/201812/t20181203_6164220.htm). On 7 Dec 2018, China reported the said wild boar event to the OIE in its follow-up report No. 4 of the province Heilongjiang. The report included the following information on the affected population: "Jinhe farm is affiliated to Bei an Bureau, General Administration Bureau of land reclamation in Heilongjiang province. These wild boars were raised on the farm;" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28844).

The current information on the strain of wild boar being "different from the strain circulating in domestic pigs" (which was earlier reported to be closely related to East European and Russian strains) might be the outcome of investigations carried out by one or both teams. It will be interesting to note whether the wild boar events in Jilin and Heilongjiang share the same ("different") strain. - Mod.AS
