Deadly fish disease arrives in Welwyn Hatfield
----------------------------------------------
Angling has been banned in the grounds of a stately home in Times
Territory after an outbreak of a deadly fish disease. The ban was
imposed by the Environment Agency, after a number of carp were found
dead in a section of the River Lea which winds through the Brocket
Hall estate in Lemsford.

Tests later established that they had died from Koi herpesvirus, a
highly contagious piscatorial disease for which there is no cure. The
section of river will now be closed to anglers until the fatalities cease.

Experts at The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science (Cefas) are investigating. They say the most likely cause was
the illegal release of an infected aquarium goldfish into the river.

Nicky Garner, for Brocket Hall, said both the Environment Agency and
Cefas were contacted as soon as the dead carp were discovered. She
said: "For the time being we are not allowed to fish the river. We
only have a few members and select guests that do this. However, we
believe some people come onto the estate by means of footpaths at
night and fish without our permission."

There is no risk to human health from the outbreak.
