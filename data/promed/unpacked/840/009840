[The location of the outbreak, in Karnataka state (southern India), is indicated in the interactive map, available at the source URL. The 11 previous HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India during 2012 (7 in poultry, 4 in wild birds) were, reportedly, identified in the north-east.

The species involved in the current outbreak is described in the OIE report as "birds." From the data in the location description ("turkey unit"), it may be assumed that the affected birds were turkeys (_Meleagris gallopavo_); confirmation or otherwise will be helpful. - Mod.AS
