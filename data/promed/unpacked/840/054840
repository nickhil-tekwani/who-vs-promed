Nigeria: 10 Deaths Attributed to Lassa Fever in Ekpoma (Edo state)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh tragedy struck yesterday in Ekpoma town of the Esan West Local
Government Council Area of Edo State, following an outbreak of Lassa fever,
resulting in the death of 10 persons, including 2 students at the Ambrose
Alli University (AAU).
The outbreak of Lassa fever, according to health sources close to the Irrua
Specialist Hospital (ISTH), was noticed by doctors at the hospital following
laboratory analysis conducted after repeated cases of unusual symptoms
initially diagnosed as mere fever.
Vanguard [this news source] gathered that the tests and the rising number of
deaths prompted the doctors attached to the hospital designated by the
Federal Government for the control of the disease in the state to conduct
[further] tests and confirm the outbreak, which they claimed was [being
brought] under control. A Lassa fever epidemic during 2004 claimed [the lives
of] more than 22 persons in the area.
A doctor who spoke with Vanguard regarding the incident in Ekpoma assured
that much is being done by the students and the community to educate the
residents on the causes of the deadly disease and methods of control. "We are
worried, but we are doing well in the area of control. We made [the
population] understand that Lassa fever has an incubation period of 6-21 days
and is transmitted from wild rodents through direct or indirect contact with
excreta of infected rodents."
Contacted regarding the death of the 2 students at AAU, the Director of
Information, Protocol and Public Affairs Dr. Don Akhailomen confirmed the
existence of an outbreak of Lassa fever, but said they have not received any
report on the death of any students.

[A similar report mentioning 13 deaths has been received from Joe Shea,
Editor-in-Chief of The American Reporter. Lassa fever is a zoonosis, with
infection being acquired from _Mastomys natalensis_, the multimammate rat.
The disease is endemic in west Africa. Lassa virus belongs to the old-world
group of arenaviruses. Like all arenaviruses, these viruses cause persistent
infections of rodents (_Mastomys_ sp. in the case of Lassa virus), usually
without obvious signs of disease.
Humans and other animals are infected through contact with rodent excreta,
particularly urine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to West Africa and have
been reported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and to a lesser extent from
Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic areas of rural West Africa,
subclinical infection is common, but occasional outbreaks with high mortality
rates have been recorded. - Mod.CP]
[Note that there have been some cases in Europe coming from Africa -- see
refs below -- but there were no secondary cases in other passengers on the
same flights or in hospital staff. - Mod,JW]
