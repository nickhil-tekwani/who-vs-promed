Georgia has been hit by the devastating pig disease African swine fever
(ASF) that could also threaten neighboring countries. ASF is a highly
contagious viral disease of pigs. It causes fever and results in very high
pig mortality. ASF does not affect humans.
"This is a dramatic development in the international distribution of
African swine fever, which has been almost entirely confined to sub-Saharan
Africa since 1990," said Jan Slingenbergh, senior animal health officer of
the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).
The disease has a catastrophic effect on commercial and smallholder pig
production and has serious socioeconomic consequences for rural
livelihoods. It is a transboundary animal disease with the potential for
wide international spread. There is no vaccine against the disease;
stamping out is the only remedy.
Georgia reported that outbreaks have started at the end of April 2007 in 10
regions spread across the country. A total of 20 000 pigs in village and
commercial farms have been slaughtered. Georgia has about half a million
pigs kept on commercial and many small holder farms. "The incursion of ASF
is of great concern for Georgia and its neighboring countries,"
Slingenbergh said. "Delayed detection of the virus has resulted in a long
danger period where the disease has been unrecognized, and the virus could
have moved to neighboring countries. Armenia, Azerbaidjan and the Russian
Federation should be on high alert," he added.
It is probable that the virus has entered Georgia through imported frozen
or processed pig meat. In the past, in some countries swill feeding, in
particular swill originating from aircraft and ships, has been incriminated
as a major source of infection.
The European Union, the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organisation for Animal Health) and FAO will send a joint team of experts
to Georgia in the next days to assess the situation and advise the
government on immediate control measures.
Pigs can acquire ASF by eating infected meat or tissues, by direct contact
with an infected pig, and by contact with contaminated material and
equipment, such as buckets, needles, clothing, and vehicles. ASF virus may
remain viable for long periods in infected pig tissues, meat and processed
pig products, which should not enter the food chain.
During an outbreak, recommended control measures are:
- infected and suspected infected farms must be placed in quarantine;
- no movement of pigs or any products of pig origin should be allowed;
- all infected and in-contact pigs must be slaughtered;
- carcasses must be burnt or buried deeply on site;
- vehicles should be disinfected on entering and leaving farms;
- personnel should ensure that shoes, clothes and equipment are disinfected
between farm visits.
The active participation of pig owners and keepers is crucial for a
successful control campaign and requires a major consultation and
communication campaign.

imports live pigs and pork and the data on their respective quantities. -
