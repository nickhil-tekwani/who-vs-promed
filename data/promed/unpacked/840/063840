A dog has tested positive for COVID officials have confirmed. They believe the pet, who is recovering at home, caught it from its owner. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says cases like this are extremely rare and there is no strong evidence to suggest that dogs, cats or other pets are passing on the virus to humans.

Owners and people who work with animals should wash their hands regularly though for good hygiene. Animal fur can act as a carrier for the COVID-19 virus for short periods of time, in the same way as other surfaces, such as door handles, says the advice. Do not share food, food bowls or utensils with your pet.

The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: "The infected dog was undergoing treatment for another unrelated condition and is now recovering. It is very rare for dogs to be infected, and they will usually only show mild clinical signs, and recover within a few days. There is no clear evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change."

If you're concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature, you should contact your vet who will decide if it needs a COVID test. And if you are self-isolating because of COVID, do not kiss or cuddle your pet or let them sleep in your bed.

But do think about arranging for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no-one to help but you need assistance, you should contact your vet.

COVID spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them.

[A previous case of a dog infected from its owner was reported by the UK authorities to the OIE on 24 Aug 2021; see posting 20210825.8621632.

COVID-19 infection in dogs is, in most cases, subclinical or presents mild, refractory respiratory signs. No dog-to-human infections have, so far, been reported. Infected cats may present clearer signs, but -- similarly -- no cat-to-human infection has been reported since the start of the pandemic.

According to evidence from experimental infection trials, SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, in difference with cats; cat-to-cat infection has been recorded. However, the situation may undergo changes with SARS-CoV-2 mutants (see 20211110.8699586). Dog owners and veterinarians must be vigilant for canine COVID-19 when dogs are presented with respiratory clinical signs.

More information about the SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals which have been duly reported by countries to the OIE (in the status of an "emerging disease"), including a table presenting the events, can be found in the OIE COVID-19 portal, section "Event in animals," available at https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/ (last updated 12 Oct 2021). - Mod.AS
