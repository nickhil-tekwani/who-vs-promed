Fear has gripped some Malawians following revelations that one of the most dangerous contagious diseases -- leprosy -- has resurfaced in the country. Authorities say they have, so far, registered 150 cases of leprosy over the past few months.

The National TB and Leprosy Programme coordinator, Dr James Mpunga, made the revelation during a TB and leprosy stakeholders' meeting, which took place at Mponela in Dowa on Monday [1 Nov 2021]. "Although Malawi reached an elimination level, cases in some districts have been identified and it is evidenced that they still exist," he said. Malawi achieved the elimination threshold for leprosy in 1994.

Following recommendations from the government, Mpunga said, the 2 programmes have now joined efforts to eliminate leprosy and TB by 2030. He further said: "Under one roof we will promote effectiveness and efficiency in terms of the use of resources."

Mchinji director of health and social services, Dr Juliana Kanyengambeta Mubanga, said the district has reported high numbers of cases over the past 3 years. "The disease is still there and we have identified a high number of them following a sensitization which was made around few areas," she said. Mchinji has so far registered 50 cases of leprosy.

Leprosy is a skin disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. The disease is preventable and treatable, but if not attended to, one can lose some parts like fingers.

Malawi's leprosy-free status does not mean the disease was totally eliminated. Malawi achieved what WHO refers to as "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in 1994 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3492035/), but leprosy has not been eradicated in Malawi completely. In fact, Malawi reported 310 cases of leprosy in 2010, 272 cases in 2016, 351 cases in 2017, 341 cases in 2018, and 288 cases in 2020; no data were reported in 2011-2015, or in 2019 (https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1639).

Of the 288 new leprosy cases reported in 2020 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-wer9636-421-444), about 85% had multibacillary leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 3 of the new cases in 2020 occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 24 of new the cases of leprosy had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding.

Many of the 150 new cases of leprosy in the past few months were likely registered through passive surveillance, whereby cases self-report to health facilities, rather than through active surveillance by health workers. The actual prevalence of leprosy at the community level therefore may likely be higher than what is being reported.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-wer8506/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Leprosy is not highly contagious. But because patients with the lepromatous (multibacillary) form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, a case of untreated lepromatous leprosy poses an increased risk for infection for close, long-term contacts, such as household members. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. As the organism is also present in skin lesions, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995 (see <https://www.who.int/activities/facilitating-the-provision-of-medicines-for-leprosy). Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

WHO emphasizes that sustained political commitment and adequate resources for leprosy services are required, especially for under-served population groups in remote rural areas, urban slums, and migrant labor camps, to reduce the burden of leprosy. Also strengthening the integration of leprosy services into the general health system through capacity building and skill development is required to ensure and sustain quality leprosy services, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention/care of disabilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm).

Malawi (estimated population, 19.5 million residents in 2021) is a landlocked country in south eastern Africa, bordered by Zambia to the west, Tanzania to the north and north east, and Mozambique to the east, south, and south west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi).
