The Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide consumer warning
Friday urging Americans not to eat any cold-smoked fish sold by a New York
company because it may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause
life-threatening infections. The warning marks the fourth FDA action since
November regarding Royal Baltic Ltd. of Brooklyn, N.Y., which has recalled
thousands of pounds of seafood potentially contaminated with the
food-poisoning bacterium [_Listeria monocytogenes_.
_Listeria_ can cause fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea and
diarrhea. Healthy people recover quickly, but _Listeria_ can cause serious,
sometimes fatal, infections in children, the elderly and people with weak
immune systems -- and is especially dangerous for pregnant women. It can
cause miscarriages and stillbirths even if the mother experiences no symptoms.
Separately, the FDA wrote Royal Baltic ordering it to cease manufacturing
all cold-smoked seafood, said Joe Baca, an FDA food safety director. Royal
Baltic, which has operated under a federal consent decree since 1994, has
until Tuesday to respond.
The FDA is investigating one illness possibly linked to the products, but
says it has repeatedly discovered _Listeria_-contaminated batches of
cold-smoked Royal Baltic products. Unlike manufacturing processes that
involve heat, cold-smoking fish cannot kill any listeria that makes its way
into the food, Baca explained. The FDA said consumers who have purchased
any Royal Baltic cold-smoked fish should return it to the place of purchase
for a refund. Products include: Captain (sea bass), Smoked Captain, Variety
Pack (salmon, trout and captain), Salmon, Sea Bass, Turbot, Royal Trout,
Lake Trout, Assorted Plate, Smoked Royal Trout, Smoked Turbot, Imperial
European-Style Smoked Salmon, Smoked Siomga, Assorted Pre-sliced Smoked
Fish (siomga, captain, trout), Smoked Trout and Smoked Lake Trout. The FDA
said consumers with questions may contact Royal Baltic at 718-385-8300.
