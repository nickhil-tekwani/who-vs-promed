The French Food Safety Agency has recommended a total ban on the use of cow
intestines in food production. The proposal follows fears of a spread of
BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Mad Cow Disease) in the country.
More than 50 cases have been diagnosed since the beginning of the year. The
Agency says the method of cleaning the intestines, which are primarily used
as sausage skins, does not guarantee full protection against the spread of
the disease which has been linked to a fatal human illness.

BSE-infected meat 'could still be in human food chain' - UK
------------------------------------------------------
Meat infected with BSE could still be finding its way into the human food
supply because of a legal loophole, the chairman of the Food Standards
Agency (FSA) warned yesterday.
Sir John Krebs promised a tightening of the regulations after warning
farmers could be allowing meat having not been inspected for the disease
to reach the open market. Beef from animals killed on a farm or in an
unlicensed abattoir for the owner or relatives to eat was exempt from
the rules introduced to keep BSE out of the human food chain.
Cattle aged over 30 months were also deemed unfit for human consumption but
the rule did not apply to meat from a private kill, he said. Sir John
called for stronger safeguards to ensure such meat was not being made
available for public consumption, particularly in rural areas. There was no
way of ensuring parts such as brains and spinal tissues - feared to be the
most dangerous part of an infected animal - had been properly removed, he
said. "That's precisely why we're concerned about both the extent to which
this goes on and the possibility meat or meat products from private kills
might get into the wider food chain.
"We want to make sure in the longer term work is done to tighten up this
loophole." The FSA said there was not enough information available to
assess the scale of the problem, and advised consumers in rural areas to
make sure any meat they bought was "from a reputable source".
Peter Scott, director of the British Meat Federation, which represents
abattoirs, called for the end of the exemptions for privately killed
animals. He said: "This is a problem for the FSA and it's a dilemma which
they, and before them the Ministry of Agriculture, have faced for a number
of years. But our view hasn't changed. We
believe, in this day and age, if there's any risk at all, then that
loophole must be closed."

US Has Low Risk of Mad Cow Disease
----------------------------------
An aggressive U.S. government program to monitor cattle health means the
risk of BSE occurring in this nation is "extremely low," a U.S. science
research group said in a new report.
The brain-wasting disease has been found in Great Britain and 9 other
European countries, but no cases have ever been found in the United States.
A report issued on Monday by the Council for Agricultural Science and
Technology summarized the latest information and disease statistics on BSE
and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of
neurological diseases that can be fatal for humans and other animals.
The council, based in Ames, Iowa, is composed of 38 scientific societies
interpreting scientific research and provide advice for lawmakers and
federal regulators. The report described the U.S. risk of BSE as
"extremely low."
Other TSE diseases have occurred in the US, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting
disease in deer and elk, and transmissible mink encephalopathy.
In July a flock of Vermont sheep originating in Belgium was suspected of
carrying TSE. Farmers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have
been battling over whether the sheep should be destroyed, or returned to
Belgium.
U.S. officials launched a surveillance program in 1990 to detect and
prevent the introduction of BSE. The program is run by several government
agencies and more than 250 federal and state regulatory veterinarians are
trained to diagnose the disease.
To fight scrapie, the U.S. government and industry have a surveillance
program tracing exposed animals back to the farm of origin. The USDA
recently proposed new rules for scrapie control by restricting interstate
movement of sheep and goats and establishing
pilot projects to evaluate flock cleanup plans based on testing.
The U.S. government also has a surveillance program for chronic wasting
disease, which is found in free-ranging deer and elk in 10 counties of
north-central Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. Transmissible mink
encephalopathy is a rare disease, with only 5 U.S. outbreaks recorded, the
last in 1985.
