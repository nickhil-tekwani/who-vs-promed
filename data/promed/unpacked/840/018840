The VRE (vanB) outbreak at Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia
has now involved 134 patients, of whom only 3 have been infected --
the rest are colonised and have been detected on screening. The
outbreak has peaked and only a small number of colonised patients are
being detected after an active infection control and antibiotic
restriction program.

[Vancomycin acts primarily by binding to the terminal dAla-dAla of
pepidoglycan subunits, thereby preventing cross-linking of cell wall
elements. VanB is one of several genes that code for ligase enzymes
which can substitute other functional moieties for the terminal dAla
(e.g. d-serine or d-lactate), thereby reducing the binding affinity of
vancomycin, and producing resistance to the antibiotic. VanB mutants
are typically identified by PCR. - Mod.ES
