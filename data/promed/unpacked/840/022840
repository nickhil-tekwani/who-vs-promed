_Brucella melitensis_ has been isolated from an aborted fetus submitted to the laboratory by the veterinary practitioner of a dairy farm in the Moshav (collective village) Gilat, west of Beer Sheva. Concurrently, another dairy farm in the same village was found infected when a cow, presenting a (160 days old) mummified fetus, reacted CF positive. Both farms have been put under quarantine. Subsequently, both herds were tested leading to the culling of 42 head out of 421 cattle in one farm, and 7 out of 270 in the other farm. Milk samples collected from all other farms in the village have been found negative by the ring test.

[Leakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The following statistics on the total annual number of human "Malta fever" cases have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 - 141; 2006 - 138; 2007 - 152; 2008 - 149; 2009 - 136; 2010 - 139; 2011 - 127; 2012 - 183; 2013 - 336; 2014 - 593, 2015 - 411, 2016 - 452. According to the Ministry's most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, dated [Sat 25 Nov 2017], the (preliminary) accumulated number of diagnosed new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2017 is 333, compared with 439 during the same period in 2016.

It will be interesting to learn whether human cases have followed animal infection in the 2 currently infected dairy cattle farms, if their personnel have undergone serological tests and, in case affirmative, what the results were.

It may be assumed that the infection originated in grazing sheep/goat flocks, but the route of introduction into the (zero-grazing) Moshav dairy farms has yet to be established.

For decades, brucellosis in livestock in Israel has been caused exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has long been eradicated (last case in 1984). _B. suis_ has never been diagnosed.

The affected dairy cattle farms have to undergo repeated tests, applying the "test-and-slaughter" policy until declared free of infection. In case of excessive infection rate, it may become necessary to cull the entire herds.

After the final eradication of bovine brucellosis (_B. abortus_) in 1984, vaccinations of all dairy female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain 19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine were continued compulsorily for years. This, in view of the continued circulation of _B. melitensis_ in the sheep and goat herds, and despite the fact that no clear evidence for its cross-protection was available.

Following a risk assessment, vaccination with "S19" vaccine was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see archive no. 20151103.3762268). Subsequently, the routine, periodic performance of the bulk milk testing was discontinued in 2015. Recently, this policy was revisited (see 20161103.460470).

In 2016, Israel's Ministry of Agriculture announced the inauguration of a _B.melitensis_ control/eradication plan in southern Israel, a highly infected region. Its implementation is said to have started, but on Wed 29 Nov 2017, the Ministry published a press release announcing the discontinuation of the said project. The reason for this act was given as "dispute with the Veterinary Union over the decision to recruit from the private market (outsource) professionals needed for the increased field and laboratory activities.
