Suspected Sara (crypasomaisis) and anthrax diseases have claimed at
least 35 head of cattle and goats in last 2 weeks in Kendrapara
district. The diseases were 1st detected during 1st week of January
2010. Only after the diseases spread to many villages, the
authorities woke up and announced a contingency plan.

"More than 1.5 lakh [150 000] head of cattle have already been
vaccinated in Rajnagar, Pattamundei, Aul and Rajkanika areas of
Kendrapara district," said chief district veterinary officer (CDVO)
Dr G.C. Sar.

The diseases have assumed alarming proportions in some villages under
Pattamundei and Rajnagar block. "We have sent blood samples of 30
affected cows and goats to the Animal Disease Research Institute
(ADRI) in Bhubaneswar," added the CDVO.

[Through 2004-2008 anthrax has been reported to OIE each year
affecting cattle: 2004, present but numbers not available; 2005, 6
outbreaks; 2006, 3 outbreaks but the disease is enzootic in 18/30
districts; 2007, 10 outbreaks; and 2008, 5 outbreaks -- and each year
with significant numbers of animals affected. Human cases have been
reported in 2001, 38 cases; 2003, 83 cases with 7 deaths; 2004, 11
cases with 3 deaths; 2005, 39 cases with 5 deaths; 2006, 18 cases
with 4 deaths; 2007, 64 cases with 11 deaths. It is long overdue for
this state to have a proactive effective veterinary control programme.
