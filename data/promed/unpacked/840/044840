[The affected backyard poultry flocks stretch from Damietta on the
Mediterranean to Cairo and Giza and as far south as Sohag, which is
near Luxor. See map at
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701576344/Great_Pyramid.html>.
Thus, while the number of infections is small, they cover 4
governorates (administrative divisions) over a wide geographic
area. The efforts to control have included an extensive backyard
vaccination program in 23 governorates. - Mod.PC]
