The Meningitis Research Foundation recently urged Hajj pilgrims embarking on a trip to Mecca from the UK to ensure their vaccinations are up-to-date to meet visa requirements.

Vaccination against meningitis is required for all travelers, who must carry a certificate showing they were vaccinated at least 10 days before leaving for Saudi Arabia, but no more than 3 years before arrival. Seasonal workers in Hajj areas are also required to be vaccinated.

The visa requirement was added more than 10 years ago after a number of large meningitis epidemics occurred when travelers visiting Mecca -- widely regarded as the holiest city in Islam -- returned to their home countries.

Newer vaccines like Menveo and Nimenrix, according to the foundation, are preferred. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has established a national network of vaccination clinics in England, Wales, or Scotland, though the network does not extend to Northern Ireland.

Meningitis is inflammation of the delicate protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The condition, which may be life-threatening, is caused primarily by viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms include headache, stiff neck, fever and confusion or altered consciousness.

[More than 2 million Muslims from over 183 countries make the Hajj pilgrimage each year. Because of intense crowding and high carrier rates of _Neisseria meningitidis_ among pilgrims, large epidemics of meningococcal disease have been linked to the Hajj pilgrimage, at first due to meningococcal serogroup A in 1987. After requiring vaccination with the bivalent A and C meningococcal vaccine for attending the Hajj, no further outbreaks due to serogroup A occurred, but then in 2000 and again in 2001, large epidemics due to meningococcal serogroup W135 occurred among pilgrims and their families.

A change in the Hajj pilgrimage requirements from bivalent to quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) meningococcal vaccine ended further meningococcal outbreaks. Pilgrims on Hajj or Umrah are required to present a certificate of vaccination with ACYW135, issued at least 10 days, but not more than 3 years before arrival. Hajj visas cannot be issued without proof of vaccination. Conjugated meningococcal vaccines are preferred over polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines because of lack of herd immunity and persistence of meningococcal carriage among vaccinated pilgrims with the polysaccharide vaccine. Menveo and Nimenrix are 2 conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W135 and Y); Nimenrix is conjugated to tetanus toxoid.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also outlined its recommendations for pilgrims during the Hajj (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-4-select-destinations/saudi-arabia-hajj-pilgrimage). These recommendations include restricting travel to only those in good health and being up to date on all routine vaccinations, which include vaccines for polio, influenza, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. The CDC also recommends vaccinations for meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and B, and typhoid. - Mod.ML
