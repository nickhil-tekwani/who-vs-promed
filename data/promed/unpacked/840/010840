CDC releases alert on seasonal flu, warns of severe cases
---------------------------------------------------------
The [US] CDC today [1 Feb 2016] issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory that warns of severe flu cases and recommends how to prevent unnecessary outbreaks.

Although the pneumonia and influenza mortality rate of week 3 (ending 23 Jan [2016], as the CDC noted on 30 Jan [2016]) was below the epidemic thresholds in both the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System and the NCHS [National Center for Health Statistics] Mortality Surveillance System, the rate of flu reports is increasing, particularly those caused by 2009 H1N1.

According to the CDC, 2009 H1N1, which is now a seasonal strain, has caused severe respiratory illness leading to hospitalization and some fatalities in patients.

The CDC recommends that anyone 6 months or older should still receive the flu vaccine as soon as possible for protection yet this season. All US flu vaccines protect against H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses.

In addition, antiviral drugs are strongly recommended for high-risk patients, such as those who are hospitalized, under the age of 2, over the age of 65, and have other factors that put them at risk, the agency said. Antiviral treatment should also be given to high-risk patients even if they are just suspected of having influenza, preferably within 48 hours of symptom onset, the CDC added.

The advisory also cautions clinicians that rapid influenza diagnostic tests may yield false-negatives, so antiviral therapy should not be withheld based on results from these tests.

This is the 1st time since December 2014 that the CDC has issued a HAN over flu. At that point a drifted H3N2 strain was circulating and was eventually associated with decreased vaccine effectiveness and a more severe flu season.

Flu Season Begins: Severe Influenza Illness Reported
CDC urges rapid antiviral treatment of very ill and high-risk suspect influenza patients without waiting for testing

There have been numerous reports in the media on the high incidence of A(H1N1) in other countries, especially Russia. They have noted that nearly 50 per cent of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have decreased up to 1/8 to 1/16 in titer in assays using antiserum to this virus, thus one wonders whether the virus circulating in Russia may have mutated [http://www.influenza.spb.ru/en/influenza_surveillance_system_in_russia/epidemic_situation/].
There is no mention of this problem in the United States in the CDC report. - Mod.LK
