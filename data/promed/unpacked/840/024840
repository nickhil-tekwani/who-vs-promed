Farmers fear millions in losses from pink mould
-----------------------------------------------
Farmers on the State's south coast could lose up to AUD 150 million
[USD 106 million] if barley infected with a mystery pink mould is
downgraded from malting quality to feedstock. WAFarmers president
Mike Norton said WA Government scientists had been unable to identify
the fungus responsible for the mould outbreak in flood-hit barley
crops. He said mould and excess rain had hit harvests along a stretch
of coast from Albany to Ravensthorpe.

Scientists ruled out the toxic fusarium head blight fungus as the
cause of the mould, co-operative grain handler CBH said. But no price
had been set for the grain and further toxicology results would not
be released until next month. CBH was taking delivery of barley
infected with pink mould at 3 locations, but storing it separately
pending a decision on its price.

Farmer Kim Sounness, of Wellstead, said there were a lot of concerned
farmers along the south coast waiting for full details of the
toxicology analysis. "We are still waiting to see what we can do with
this grain. There are mountains of it down here and no home for it,"
he said. Mr Sounness has begun feeding the pink grain to his sheep to
see whether it was safe for livestock.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB) of small-grain crops which is mentioned
above, can be caused by several related fungal pathogens. It results
in yield losses, reduces the grade of harvested grain and may also
cause toxin contamination which can affect stock. A pink
discolouration or mould may be seen on affected barley heads. For
more information on this disease please see previous ProMED-mail post
no. 20080708.2073 and links below.

However, according to the report above, FHB has been ruled out as the
problem in WA. The toxicological analysis may help with pathogen
identification since some of the compounds can be characteristic of
certain groups of fungi.
