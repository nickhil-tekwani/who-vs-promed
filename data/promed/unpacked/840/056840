The animal disease brucellosis is emerging in new "hot spots" around
Yellowstone National Park, according to new research that could
complicate efforts to control transmissions of the disease to cattle.

Feeding grounds where food is left for elk as well as herds of bison
inside the park have long been considered the main sources of
brucellosis, which causes pregnant animals to abort their young.

But Paul Cross with the U.S. Geological Survey said a 3rd source is
now emerging: Blood tests indicate large elk herds living far from
the feeding grounds have brucellosis exposure rates ranging from 10
percent to 30 percent.

That means containing the park's bison and getting rid of the feeding
grounds might not be enough to stop brucellosis transmissions to
cattle in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

The Yellowstone region has an estimated 100 000 elk and is the
nation's last reservoir for the disease. Over the last decade, cattle
infections have appeared in all 3 states bordering the park.

"It's no longer appropriate to say bison and the supplemental feed
grounds are the only sources of contamination," Cross said.

Cross was the lead author of a USGS study published online Friday [23
Apr 2010] by the Public Library of Science. Co-authored by
researchers from Wyoming Game and Fish, Montana State University and
USGS, the study was based on more than 6000 blood tests collected
from Wyoming elk between 1991 and 2009.

Since the testing began, Cross said disease rates increased
dramatically in 2 "hot spots," north of Dubois, Wyo. and northwest of
Cody, Wyo. Both of those areas are far from the state's 23 artificial
feeding grounds.

The study comes on the heels of another USGS report in March 2010
that found brucellosis rates on the rise across the region.
Prevalence rates increased from between 0 percent and 7 percent in
1991-1992, to between 8 percent and 20 percent in 2006-2007.

Wyoming's feeding grounds were established decades ago to keep elk
separate from cattle in the winter. By providing elk with a
guaranteed food source, it was hoped they would not eat hay left out
for cattle. But the feeding grounds also facilitated the spread of disease.

Montana does not allow feeding grounds. Yet state veterinarian Marty
Zaluski said the same problems result when large elk herds congregate
on private lands off-limits to hunters. Zaluski compared the trend
with colds and other viruses that spread quickly through facilities
such as day-care centers. "You put any animals in close
concentration, you're going to exacerbate these disease issues," he said.

Representatives of the cattle industry -- backed by members of the
Montana Legislature -- have pushed for the state Livestock Department
to take more control over elk management. They argue that would be
the only way to stem infections that can result in severe
restrictions against out-of-state cattle exports. Livestock officials
so far have declined the calls to intervene, saying elk fall under
the jurisdiction of Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks.

In Wyoming, wildlife managers have driven down brucellosis rates for
elk in some areas through a pilot program to capture, test and kill
disease-positive animals at 3 feeding grounds. Where those efforts
were successful, brucellosis exposure rates have dropped as low as 5
percent. That's versus 35 percent or more historically, said Brandon
Scurlock with Wyoming Game and Fish. Expanding the program across the
region would carry a steep price tag. The 5-year pilot effort cost
USD 1.3 million and removed 197 brucellosis-positive elk. That comes
out to about USD 6600 per animal.

[The current price of test and removal of elk may be more than
ranchers and the general public care to pay, as it would surely
influence taxes in an economy that is already suffering a load.
However, the price quoted in the article sounds about right for a
captive elk, except those being bred for genetics of the rack.

Perhaps it is not the elk that should be behind high fences but
rather the cattle that are at risk. - Mod.TG]
