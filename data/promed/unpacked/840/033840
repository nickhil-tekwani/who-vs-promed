Bluetongue Serotype 8 Epidemic Bulletin by EFSA Epidemiology Working
Group: Bulletin 11 of 21 Dec 2006. Outbreak Period until 20 Dec 2006
----------------------------------------------------
Main Observations:
1. The current bluetongue serotype 8 epidemic is now into its 17th
week, with the case total having risen to 2027 herds, compared to
2012 herds last week [and 1994 herds the week before. - Mod.AS]
2. Out of the 2025 reports which have correct georeferences through
20 Dec 2006, 695 cases were reported from Belgium, 6 from France, 867
from Germany, 452 from the Netherlands, and 5 from Luxembourg.
3. This week's new cases occurred again mainly in cattle, and most of
them in Germany. [4 new cases in cattle herds in Germany, one in a
cattle herd in Belgium, one in a mixed herd in the Netherlands,
totalling 6 new confirmed cases. No new cases this week in France or
Belgium. - Mod.AS]
4. The data confirm the continued decrease in the number of new
cases. Nevertheless, it is striking that 15 new cases were reported
this late in the year. One can speculate this might be due to the
continued high temperatures in the last several weeks.
5. This is the last report for 2006.

The origin of the BTV-8 responsible for this epizootic event, and the
reasons for its unusual pathogenicity to cattle, remain to be
investigated. Subscribers might be reminded of the interesting
entomological observations related to the possible role of
_Culicoides dewulfi_ in the dissemination of the virus in the
affected northwestern European countries.
OIE's Terrestrial Code Commission, in tandem with the Scientific
Commission, recently suggested modifications in the requirements of
the Code for a country or a zone to be considered free of Bluetongue.
Considering recent outbreaks in Europe and the understanding that
Bluetongue is increasing its geographical distribution in this
region, the Terrestrial Code Commission modified the northern
latitude boundary in Articles 2.2.13.1. and 2.2.13.2. The new text in
article 2.2.13.2. (Bluetongue), to be discussed by member countries,
includes -- among others -- the following:
BTV-free country or zone
1. A country or a zone may be considered free from BTV when
bluetongue is notifiable in the whole country and either:
a) the country or zone lies wholly north of 53 deg N or south of 34
deg S, and is not adjacent to a country or zone not having a free
status;
or
b) a surveillance programme in accordance with Appendix 3.8.X. has
demonstrated no evidence of BTV in the country or zone during the
past 2 years;
or
c) a surveillance programme has demonstrated no evidence of
_Culicoides_ likely to be competent BTV vectors in the country or
zone.
The Commission will further consider incorporating the concept of
compartmentalisation in the bluetongue chapter in light of future
comments from Member Countries. - Mod.AS]
