[The following information on Avian Influenza affecting poultry farms in the Netherlands in 2020 was published on 7 Dec 2020 by the Wageningen University and Research: "Bird flu (H5) has been diagnosed at laying hen farm in Den Bommel, the Netherlands, by Wageningen Bioveterinary Research. It probably concerns low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). There are no other poultry farms within the 1-km (0.63 mi) zone of this farm. To prevent the virus from spreading, the farm is culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). In total, this concerns approximately 25 000 animals.

Low pathogenic bird flu is less infectious than highly pathogenic bird flu. However, the serotypes H5 and H7 of low pathogenic avian influenza can mutate into a highly pathogenic virus. Therefore, strict measures must be taken.

In the 10-km (6.2 mi) zone around this farm the transport ban applies. This ban covers poultry, eggs, poultry manure and used bedding, as well as other animals and certain products from commercial poultry companies".
