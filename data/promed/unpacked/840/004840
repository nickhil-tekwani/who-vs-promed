The press report was not accurate about quinine resistance .I talked with
Dr Odhiambo, the Chairman of Kenya Medical Association, Coast Branch today
about the statement to the press. He said he was "misquoted". He actually
meant chloroquine resistance. I have not received any reports of quinine
resistance from Mombasa.
