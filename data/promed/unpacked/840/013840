Indonesia: Chikungunya Outbreaks in West Java
---------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease, locally known as chikungunya, has spread further in
West Java, with more than 70 people in Cirebon regency infected since last
week, local health officials said on Sat 15 Feb 2003. Jarnadi Kusmayadi, a
senior official with the city's health office, was quoted by Antara as
saying that the disease had attacked 66 people in the villages of Bojong
Lor and Wetan, Klangenan sub-district, and 7 others in Sedong Kidul and
Karangwuni villages, Sedong sub-district.
According to Jarnadi, [this is not the first appearance of the disease in
this area]; it infected at least 50 residents at Sumber village in Sumber
sub-district last year. However, he said the current outbreaks of
chikungunya were categorized as an "extraordinary" occurrence, although it
had yet to spread extensively in Cirebon. He said the local administration
had been taking measures to prevent the disease from spreading to other
villages in Cirebon and neighboring towns. The sub-district administrations
have provided medicine to chikungunya sufferers in their respective regions
to try and stop the disease from spreading, Jarnadi said. He acknowledged
that chikungunya had spread quickly to a number of other villages, but
could not say how many additional patients were infected, as his office was
still collecting data.
"A disease of this nature can spread quickly through mosquito bites, and it
is suspected to have been carried by urban people from Jakarta or others
from outside Cirebon," Jarnadi said. He said chikungunya was not a lethal
disease, but should the virus attack joints in the body, it could leave the
sufferer unable to walk and cause pain for months.
Chikungunya was first detected in December 2002 in the West Java capital of
Bandung and continued to spread in the regency this week. The disease has
affected more than 230 residents in the villages of Mandalamukti and
Ciptagumati in Bandung. According to data from the public health center in
Cikalongwetan, the number of people affected by the disease has increased
to 231, from 90 in December 2002. Local health officials gave vitamin B1
shots to unaffected villagers to try and stop the spread of the disease
[?]. According to local doctor Sudradjat, Chikungunya first emerged 3
months ago [circa November 2002] after several people were bitten by _Aedes
albopictus_ mosquitoes.
Several patients have said symptoms of the disease were at first similar to
dengue fever, but after several days they experienced debilitating pain in
their bones, leaving them unable to walk. However, after one week the
sufferers recovered without any medication.

[Chikungunya (meaning "doubled up") virus was isolated during an epidemic
in Tanzania in 1952 from both patients and mosquitoes. Subsequently it has
been isolated frequently from humans and mosquitoes in tropical Africa,
India, and Southeast Asia. Non-human reservoir species have not been
identified unequivocally, and migrants and travellers are blamed frequently
for spread of infection; e.g., for the comparatively recent introduction of
the disease into Malaysia. Recent laboratory studies suggest that in
southeast Asia, _Aedes albopictus_ is a more competent vector of
chikungunya virus than _Aedes aegypti_.
The largest epidemics of chikungunya in recent years have occurred in India
and Indonesia. As described above, the clinical picture resembles that of
dengue fever with which it is often confused. However, chikungunya virus
and dengue virus, though both arthropod-borne, are unrelated; the former
being an alphavirus and the later a flavivirus. After an incubation period
of 2 to 4 days, there is sudden onset of fever followed by crippling joint
pains which may temporarily incapacitate the patient. Arthralgia is the
most typical sign, occurring in around 70 percent of cases. The acute phase
of the disease lasts for 2 to 4 days with recovery in 5 to 7 days.
Treatment is palliative. - Mod.CP]
