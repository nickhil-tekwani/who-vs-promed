Due to the increasing number of areas having epidemics, in Boyolali
district, Central Java, an emergency has been declared due to a chikungunya
[virus] outbreak. This situation is believed to have occurred because of
the seasonal transition period has lasted an extremely long time, so that
the development of viral vectors that transmit this disease [virus] is favored.

During November [2008], 4 foci were discovered with the number of
chikungunya [virus infections] reaching 172 people and threatening the
other 1872 residents. Meanwhile, during 2008, 456 residents were recorded
to have had chikungunya virus infections. The usual seasonal transition
period is January until March, while the current transition period started
the month of September [2008].

"In no cases have the victims died because the disease does generally not
endanger lives. However, the economic impact is more striking than the
symptoms of dengue fever as chikungunya's effects remain afterward, with
pain in the joints and muscles that can last up to months, or even longer,"
said the head of field and disease prevention and environmental health, in
the District Health Office, Boyolali.

The chikungunya outbreak spread in Pangenrejo Village, Kecamatan Purworejo,
Purworejo regency. Between 3 Nov 2008 and this Friday [5 Dec 2008], the
sufferers continued to spring up until the [case] data collected reached 47
people. Of this number, 12 people were still ill and 35 other people are
currently gradually recovering.

The head of the Field and Disease Prevention of the Office of Environmental
Health Sanitation of Purworejo Regency, Dwitya Suprijono said these were
the 1st cases chikungunya that have happened in Pangenrejo Village.
"Therefore, this case was determined as an extraordinary incident in
Pangenrejo Village," he said, on Friday [5 Dec 2008].

During 2008 up until now, the chikungunya outbreak always happened in urban
areas in the Nelson Sub district and Purworejo. In general, affected
sufferers were sick for a week.

To the sufferers, Dwitya said, his organization has distributed medicine.
"Further, as efforts to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes, we will
also do fogging and distribute abate," he said. [Abate is a mosquito
larvicide. - Mod.TY] Dwitya said the most important action to prevent the
spread of the illness is by means of carrying out the eradication of
mosquitoes and to always maintain cleanliness of the environment.

As with dengue fever [virus], chikungunya [virus] is also spread by _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes. In the inspection that was carried out by the team
from the Health Service yesterday [4 Dec 2008], in 53 per cent of the 26
houses that were visited, mosquitoes were found [breeding].
