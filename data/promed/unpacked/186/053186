The death of 4 elephants within a month inside Nandankanan Zoological Park in Bhubaneswar has now emerged as a major concern for animal lovers as well as the State government. As there is no proven method of treating Elephant endotheliotrophic herpes virus, assistance from experts from Assam and Kerala is being sought to contain further outbreak, informed Forests and Environment Minister Bikram Arukh on [Sat 21 Sep 2019].

Arukh further informed that out of the total 8 elephants at Nandankanan zoo, 4 have died after they contracted the deadly herpes virus. "The other 4 elephants have been isolated and efforts are being made to prevent further outbreak," said Arukh.

Earlier on [Fri 20 Sep 2019] night, female elephant 'Gauri' succumbed to EEHV (Elephant endotheliotrophic herpes virus) attack while undergoing intensive treatment at Nandankanan Zoological Park. Gauri was brought to Nandankanan Zoo from Athagarh Forest range in 2012.

"At present there are 4 elephants including 3 adult ones at Nandankanan. When elephant Gauri was ill, her trunk wash samples along with other elephants were sent for tests to Assam. But we have not got any confirmation that other elephants had also contracted the herpes virus," said Jayant Das, deputy director of Nandankanan Zoo.

[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1A is a member of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and is a major cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in endangered juvenile Asian elephants worldwide.

This virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease and is commonly identified in animals kept at zoos. The virus only causes benign external herpetic lesions in African elephants, but in Asian elephant's infection results in endothelial disease, which in many cases can be fatal.
