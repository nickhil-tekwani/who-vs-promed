Michigan officials hustle to control plum pox
-----------------------------------------------
State agricultural officials said they are working to control
infections of plum pox, a viral plant disease that causes reduced
fruit production in trees. The disease affects certain stone fruits,
including peaches, nectarines, apricots and plums. Plum pox can also
affect cherry trees, but the strain identified in Michigan does not.
The virus poses no threat to people or animals.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture found the virus in samples
collected from a routine survey at a Michigan State University
research center near Benton Harbor.
The Michigan Department of Agriculture said Friday [11 Aug 2006] that
it is working with federal officials to establish an eradication
program. A public information session for growers in the area will be
held Wednesday in Benton Harbor. The strain found is the same one
that was discovered in Pennsylvania in 1999 and later in Canada and
New York, Michigan officials said.
The virus decimated fruit plants in Eastern Europe during the 1990s.
Symptoms of the virus -- which may take several years to develop --
include pale green spots, rings and lines on plant leaves. Infected
trees also tend to drop much of their fruit prematurely.

[The fruit crop plant plum, _Prunus domestica_, develops virus
symptoms in the fruit when infected by the plum pox virus (PPV,
family: _Potyviridae_, genus:_Potyvirus_).
PPV, also known as Sharka, has been devastating stone fruit crops in
Europe since the early 1900s. It was found in Chile in 1992. The
disease is spread by aphids, which can generally transmit infection
several hundred meters from the initial source plant. PPV affects
cultivated peach, nectarine, apricot, almond, and cherry, as well as
plum. It also can infect wild _Prunus_ (stone fruit) species and a
large number of wild and introduced weeds. PPV often causes markings
on stone fruits, which make the fruit unmarketable.
PPV was 1st detected in the USA in 1998, and since that time, an
effort at detection and eradication has managed to suppress the virus
well. This effort has been greatest in Pennsylvania, where the
earlier detections were found, including a positive find in peach on
4 Jul 2006 (20060705.1843). Despite the overall success at
suppression, this 1st report of PPV in plums in Michigan comes soon
after the 1st report in plums in New York State on 20 Jul 2006
(20060806.2181). This is the 2nd time the disease has been found at a
location in the United States outside of Pennsylvania. The strain of
virus that has been found in stone fruits in Pennsylvania, New York
and Michigan is the "D" strain, which is thought not to infect cherries.
Each of these detections in 2006 is a reminder that eradication in
the USA remains elusive for a virus with known active insect vectors.
Intensified efforts to collect and test samples in states where stone
fruits are grown are in place. These increased efforts are one reason
why more positive samples are being found. These current results will
no doubt result in even more intensive testing coupled with tree eradication.
