Further to the "emergence of DHF": In Australia it is considered that the
first description of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever came from
Queensland in 1897.

Medical Gazette 1898; 17: 98-107.

I could not resist an historical comment. Many textbooks say that DHF/DSS
emerged in Southeast Asia beginning in the early 1950s. Dr. Tesh correctly
points out documentation of the enormous epidemic of DHF and DSS in
Athens/Piraeus in 1927-1928.
In fact, there were a number of previous
outbreaks apparently featuring cases of DHF/DSS in the pre-virological era,
most notably an epidemic in India in 1872 and one in Australia in 1897, but
also cases in Indo-China (Vietnam) and elsewhere. Northern Egypt was hit
by a dengue epidemic in 1927 and, although there seem to have been a few
DSS-like cases, Egypt did not have the same degree of fatality as was seen
in Athens/Piraeus at the same time. Curiously, however, when dengue came
back to Egypt in 1937, there were many fatalities from DSS-like illness,
especially in the over 10 year old age group. Has anyone in Egypt studied
old banked serums to get a handle on what went on there?
It should be added that these historical observations are subjective in
that there were no modern virologic data, no concept of DHF or DSS, and no
standardized clinical case definition. Even so, the historical data are
intriguing. DHF and DSS may have been around for much longer than is
appreciated, but their determinants are little understood.
Actually, the longstanding controversy over the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS
has been polarized well beyond the scientific facts by those who love a good
scientific dispute but haven't bothered to read the data (see Clin Infect
Dis 1994;19:500-512) . For example, Leon Rosen published, early on, a
report of a DHF epidemic associated with secondary infections of the
DEN-3/DEN-2 sequence (Bull Soc Pathol Exotique 1973;66:381-385). Scott
Halstead published, also early on, that DHF/DSS sometimes occurs with
primary infection, and even published, later on, in vitro data on low
passage DEN isolates showing that viral growth properties and
"enhanceability" were independent virus properties (Am J Trop Med Hyg
1991;45:644-651).
As epidemiologists have been saying all along, diseases should be
viewed as the result of complex interactions between the agent, host, and
environment. It is ironic that for a disease of such tremendous worldwide
importance as dengue, so little is now being done to understand the
obviously complex pathogenesis so that better prevention and treatment
modalities can be developed.

[Duane Gubler mentioned that the first outbreak of DHF occurred in Charters
Towers, Australia (the Queensland 1897 reference above) and that cases were
also reported in Beirut in 1910, and Taiwan in 1916 and 1931.
Knowing when to quit while we are ahead, this string is cut before we have
to post "Dengue, DHF/DSS: etiology: Correction (02): Addendum (05): Supplement
