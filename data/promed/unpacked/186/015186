Anthrax alert halts Sumbawa cattle trading in 2 districts
---------------------------------------------------------
Sumbawa regency administration in West Nusa Tenggara (NB) has stopped the
movement of all cattle in and out of 2 districts, Labangka and Moyohulu,
after some livestock showed possible signs of anthrax contamination.

Cases of anthrax in cows were documented in those districts in 2008. It is
unclear whether the current suspects cases may be confirmed. "Recently we
found several signs of anthrax in cows in the districts. We decided to stop
cattle traffic as a preventive measure," Sumbawa Regent Jamaluddin Malik
said on Tuesday [13 Jan 2009]. Jamaluddin said the recent indications
cropped up during the rainy season; the 2008 cases occurred at the same
time last year [2007]. "We are going to halt the traffic for 2 to 3 months.
We'll be monitoring developments," he said.

Sumbawa is one of Indonesia's primary cattle production areas, delivering
at least 900 cows and 3000 calves to other regions in the country,
including Jakarta, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, and West Sumatra.
According to 2007 provincial data, there were 102 000 cows and 64 000
buffalo in NB.
