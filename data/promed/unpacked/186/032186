In a previous message regarding Nagana in Bostwana the moderator's comments
indicates Nagana is caused in cattle by _Trypanosoma brucei_.
In fact, Nagana in cattle is caused by different trypanosomes and
_Trypanosoma brucei_ is likely the less pathogenic, but the most studied in
laboratories because it grows well in mice. _Trypanosoma congolense_ and
_Trypanosoma vivax_ are much more pathogenic for cattle in Africa and
_Trypanosoma simiae_ is fatal for pigs. _Trypanosoma vivax_ and
_Trypanosoma evansi_ are also mechanically transmitted (other hematophagous
insects than tsetse flies and vampire bats) outside Africa (South America,
Asia). The group of trypanosomes named _Trypanosoma brucei sensu lato_
includes _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_ and _Trypanosoma brucei
rhodesiense_ which are the etiologic agents of sleeping sickness in man.
And we know cattle can be a reservoir of _T. rhodesiense_ in East Africa
and probably of _T. gambiense_ in West Africa.
Finally the results from different labs using molecular biology techniques
show _Trypanosoma congolense_ also is probably a complex of different
species with different pathogenicity. The world of trypanosomes is
fascinating! But we are worried by the present development of the disease
in man and cattle in Africa after so many efforts to control it.
