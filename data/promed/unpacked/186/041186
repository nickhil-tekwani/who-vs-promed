1st report of Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus and Cucumber
vein yellowing ipomovirus in Cyprus
-----------------------------------------------
In Cyprus, a survey was done in 2000/2002 to determine the identity and
prevalence of viruses of cucurbit crops. Cucurbits are major vegetable
crops in Cyprus and are produced mainly in the coastal regions of
Famagusta, Larnaca, Limmasol and Paphos districts. Cucurbits are mainly
cultivated in open fields, but cucumbers are usually grown under plastic
greenhouses. A total of 2993 samples of cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_),
courgette (_Cucurbita pepo_), melon (_C. melo_) and watermelon (_Citrullus
lanatus_) were collected from the major cucurbit-growing regions. Samples
were tested by serological or molecular methods for the following viruses:
Beet pseudo-yellows crinivirus (BPYV), Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV),
Cucumber vein yellowing ipomovirus (CVYV - EPPO Action List), Cucurbit
aphid-borne yellows polerovirus (CABYV), Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder
crinivirus (CYSDV - EPPO Action List), Papaya ringspot potyvirus type W
(PRSV-W), Squash mosaic comovirus (SqMV), Watermelon mosaic potyvirus
(WMV), Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV). ZYMV was the most prevalent
virus with an overall incidence of 45 percent. PRSV-W, CABYV and WMV were
detected in 20.8 percent, 20.8 percent and 7.8 percent of the samples
tested, respectively. CMV and SqMV were not detected during this survey.
CYSDV was detected in 88 percent of the tested cucumber samples which had
been collected from protected crops [greenhouse, screen house etc. -
Mod.JAD] all over the country. It is noted that CYSDV was also found in 12
samples of melon grown in the field. The presence of CYSDV was associated
with high populations of its vector _Bemisia tabaci_. CVYV was detected in
protected crops of cucumbers but with a low incidence (9.5 percent). The
EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of CYSDV and CVYV
in Cyprus. The situation of Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus in
Cyprus can be described as follows: Present, 1st found in 2000, widespread
in protected crops of cucumbers. The situation of Cucumber vein yellowing
ipomovirus in Cyprus can be described as follows: Present, 1st found in
2000 with a low incidence.

[Cucurbit vegetable crop plants such as cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_),
courgette or squash (_Cucurbita pepo_), melon (_C. melo_) and watermelon
(_Citrullus lanatus_) are susceptible to several different plant viruses,
as this survey in Cyprus demonstrates. Among the viruses detected, 2 are
noteworthy to the EPPO -- Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV)
(family: _Closteroviridae_, genus: _Crinivirus_) and Cucumber vein
yellowing virus (CVYV) (family: _Potyviridae_, genus _Ipomovirus_) --
because they are 1st reports for Cyprus.
Both viruses are transmitted by the whitefly _Bemesia tabaci_ and will
spread internally in any area where the virus is introduced on
vegetatively-propagated plants. Both are on the EPPO A2 action list. Note
that the samples for this report were collected in 2000 to 2002, making the
results contemporary with other earlier reports for Europe to be found in
the ProMED archive. At present, CYSDV has been detected and causes problems
in France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, the Arab Emirates and North America.
In Spain, the yellowing symptoms caused by CYSDV are frequently observed in
100 percent of the plants when they are found in an affected greenhouse or
screenhouse. CVYV is well established in Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Spain and
Portugal. Symptoms in both cucumber and melon have been described as vein
yellowing, vein clearing and stunting, with a corresponding yield
reduction. Sudden death, an uncommon outcome for plant virus disease, was
observed on melon in Spain. Avoiding infected propagation plants,
management of whiteflies and weed reservoirs are the main ways to manage
disease problems. Attempts to select or engineer useful tolerant or
resistant varieties are being made.
