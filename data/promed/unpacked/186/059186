Highlights:
- Usutu virus was isolated from _Culex pipiens_ pools in the Camargue, France.
- Phylogenetic analysis revealed USUV lineages Africa 2 and Africa 3.
- A simultaneous occurrence of different strains within the mosquito population was demonstrated.
- This is the 1st report on USUV in mosquitoes from France.

Abstract:
Usutu virus (USUV) was detected in 11 _Culex pipiens_ mosquito pools collected in 2015 in Camargue (France) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. Phylogenetic analysis of recovered virus sequences identified USUV lineages Africa 2 and Africa 3, demonstrating the simultaneous occurrence of different strains within the mosquito population. This is the 1st report on USUV in mosquitoes from France that concurrently accompanied the emergence of Usutu virus in blackbirds and a human case in France during 2015/2016.

[This report implicates _Culex pipiens_ as a Usutu virus (USUV) vector in Camargue, France, the same area where the 1st human case occurred during the same transmission season (see ProMED-mail Usutu virus - Europe: France 20180621.5868708). One hopes that follow up studies will be undertaken to determine the USUV vector efficiency of local strains of this mosquito for lineage 2 and 3 of the virus.

As noted previously, USUV has a fairly wide-spread distribution in Europe with rare cases in humans and sporadic cases in birds. A 2017 report in Eurosurveillance (see ProMED-mail archive Usutu virus - Europe (04): Austria 20171012.5376689) indicates that Usutu virus emergence in Europe dates back to at least 1996, when an episode of wild bird mortality was observed in the Tuscany region of Italy. USUV-associated bird mortality was subsequently found in several European countries. In 2001, it caused considerable die-off of birds in the Vienna area, mainly Eurasian blackbirds (_Turdus merula_). In 2016, widespread USUV activity was reported in wild birds in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands as well as in Austria (in the same area as 2001-2006) and in Hungary. - Mod.TY
