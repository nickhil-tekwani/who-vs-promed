Study Shows High Level of Avian to Human Transmission of Influenza A
(H7N7) Virus during Outbreak in the Netherlands 2003
--------------------------------------------------
A report on the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H7N7)
outbreak that occurred in the Netherlands in 2003 has been published
[see: Avian influenza H7N7, human - Netherlands 2003 20040221.0561].
Koopmans et al. describe the epidemiological and virological results
of case finding during the outbreak period, and the preventative
measures implemented (1).
The outbreak began at the end of February 2003, and the Dutch
Ministry of Agriculture announced a ban on the export of all poultry
and poultry-related products on 1 Mar 2003. During the outbreak the
infection spread to 225 farms, and led to the culling of
approximately 30 million chickens.
Active case finding was implemented among poultry workers, poultry
farmers, and their families following an increase in anecdotal
reports of health complaints from people involved in the control of
the animal epidemic. Health complaints were reported among 453
people, with conjunctivitis the most commonly reported symptom (349
cases). Influenza A (H7N7) was detected in 89 (19.6 percent) cases.
There was one human fatality during the outbreak, a 57-year-old
veterinarian who had visited several farms with HPAI-infected poultry
flocks (2). In addition, 3 contacts of confirmed influenza A (H7N7)
cases tested positive for influenza A/H7 infection.
Control measures were implemented early during the outbreak.
Following confirmation of influenza A (H7N7) as the cause of the
avian influenza outbreak on 3 Mar 2003, all workers in contact with
poultry were advised to wear protective glasses and face masks.
Shortly afterwards, and following the increase in cases of human
infection, influenza vaccination was offered to, and accepted by, all
poultry workers involved in handling, screening, or culling
potentially infected poultry. This policy was aimed at reducing
possible genetic mixing or reassortment of avian and human influenza
viruses in one infected person. The influenza vaccination
recommendation was subsequently extended to all poultry workers and
their families in a 3-km radius of infected poultry farms and those
suspected of having the infection. Treatment with oseltamivir was
recommended for all conjunctivitis cases, and a prophylactic regimen
of oseltamivir was given to all people handling potentially infected
poultry for 2 days after their last exposure.
Virological sequence data published elsewhere indicate that the virus
strains were of entirely avian origin, with no human genes (3). The
virus isolated from the fatal case had, however, accumulated
significant mutations, which may have been associated with enhanced
virulence in this case. Further cohort studies are also underway to
compare infection rates between different categories of poultry
workers, and examine the effects of various risk factors.
This study describes a large outbreak of avian influenza infection in
humans, with possible person-to-person spread among household
contacts. The authors highlight the difficulty of implementing
control measures early in the outbreak, when few data were available
on which to base their decisions. They note that by the time
prophylactic measures were reinforced one week after confirmation of
the first human infection, more than one thousand people within the
Netherlands and from abroad had already been exposed to this avian
influenza variant, thus demonstrating the need for pandemic
preparedness.
