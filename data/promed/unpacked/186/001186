Cases in various countries not mentioned above or with more recent case numbers.

Europe
---
Italy (Lazio region). 14 Sep 2017. (conf.) 17 cases. Locality affected: Rome 6 cases. Aggressive vector control underway.

[The count of confirmed cases is conflicting; 2 reports from 14 Sep 2017 indicated that there are 14 cases with others under investigation, versus the 17 cases reported above (http://www.who.int/csr/don/15-september-2017-chikungunya-italy/en/). A 13 Sep 2017 report indicated that because of the chikungunya outbreak, Anzio has suspended blood donations and Rome may have to as well (http://tinyurl.com/y6wr4h6j).

ProMED-mail rapporteur George Robertson sent a 19 Sep 2017 report that indicates that there are 2 related clusters of autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus, in the city of Anzio and in Rome, 2 areas located 60 km (37 mi) apart in the Lazio region (http://tinyurl.com/yb32lgdd). These areas, and especially Rome, are significant tourist destinations.

[2] Brazil: virus genotypes

ref: Cunha MS, Cruz NVG, Schnellrath LC, Medaglia MLG, Casotto ME, Albano RM, et al. Autochthonous Transmission of East/Central/South African Genotype Chikungunya Virus, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(10): 1737-39.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We isolated East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype chikungunya virus during the 2016 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Genome sequencing revealed unique mutations in the nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4-A481D) and envelope protein 1 (E1-K211T). Moreover, all Brazil East/Central/South isolates shared the exclusive mutations E1-M407L and E2-A103T.

[Results and Discussion]
------------------------
RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 mapped within the ECSA genotype with other isolates from northeastern Brazil (Figure --available at the source URL above]). We found no evidence of intergenotypic recombination despite co-circulation of ECSA and Asian strains in Brazil since 2014. The coding region of the consensus genome sequences revealed mutations in 98.3-100.0 percent of the mapped reads. We detected unique mutations in RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 that are absent in other CHIKV isolates: NSP4-A481D in the viral RNA polymerase and E1-K211T in an E1 polymorphic site. A K211E mutation in this same E1 site showed increased CHIKV adaptability to _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in a E1-226A background. Nonetheless, the effects of the E1-K211T substitution in Rio de Janeiro isolates are unknown. Furthermore, we detected unique substitutions in RJ-IB1 (E1-N335D) and RJ-IB5 (NSP2-L27I). Both Rio de Janeiro isolates and the ECSA isolate Bahia-08 share a NSP2-P352A substitution, which is not detected in other Brazil ECSA isolates. In contrast, the Brazil ECSA subgroup shares 2 exclusive mutations (E1-M407L and E2-A103T) that are absent in other ECSA strains. RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 genomes do not have the vector-adaptive E1-A226V or E2-L210Q substitutions but do have the E1-T98A substitution also present in other ECSA isolates. We also detected minority variants within the viral population, particularly in RJ-IB1, which showed higher genetic diversity than RJ-IB5). Further investigation of plasma-isolated viruses is necessary to confirm the diversity of minority variants.

[It will be interesting to learn from future studies if any of these mutations persist in Brazil and have a selective advantage that facilitate transmission by vector mosquitoes or producing higher titer or longer lasting viremias in humans. - Mod.TY]
