Marburg virus disease in Angola - update 4 31 Mar 2005
As of 30 March, 132 cases have been reported. These cases include 12 health
care workers. Of the 132 cases, 127 have been fatal. This is the largest
number of fatalities ever recorded during an outbreak of this rare, but
extremely severe disease.
Mobile surveillance teams have been established and are investigating
rumours of additional cases in Uige Province, which remains the epicentre
of the outbreak. A mobile field laboratory provided by the Canadian
National Microbiology Laboratory arrived yesterday, was set up in Uige
today, and will become operational tomorrow. A dedicated isolation
facility, operated by M�cins sans Fronti�s, is preparing to receive
further cases that may be identified by the mobile surveillance teams.
Additional staff from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and
WHO will be arriving over the weekend. Two logisticians will join teams in
Uige and Luanda. A data manager, media coordinator, and medical
anthropologist will also be arriving over the weekend.
WHO has despatched a further 500 kg of personal protective equipment and
other supplies to assist in the immediate improvement of infection control
in hospitals and the protection of front-line staff. To facilitate
real-time coordination of response operations, WHO has despatched mobile
communication field kits, which should greatly expedite the flow of
information.

Angola: Death Toll In Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak now 126
--------------------------------------------------
The death toll of the Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak has risen over the
last 24 hours from 117 to 126, out of the 132 cases recorded in Angola's
northern Uije province.
This was announced in Luanda on Wed 30 Mar 2005 by the Deputy Health
minister. Speaking to the press, the Deputy Minister explained that 5 of
the new corpses were found in residential areas by health staff working on
the detection of new cases of infection in the region. The bodies were
taken to the mortuary and buried subsequently, without giving the
next-of-kin the chance to handle them, the source said. According to him,
at this stage, the province has made some improvement in the isolation of
the sick, with aid of the Medicins sans Frontieres running the ward.
2 experts of the World Health Organisation (WHO) have left for the
country's northern region, carrying laboratory equipment capable of
detecting viruses. To fight the "Marburg" virus, the province is currently
counting on the aid of 4 experts, 2 with WHO and the others from Canada,
plus 17 with Medicins sans Frontieres.
As to Cabinda province, the 16 people who were in direct contact with the
case from Uije are under the control of the health authorities.

Angola: Death Toll May Have Reached 130
---------------------------------------
Angola's Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation have said 126
people had died between 13 Oct 2004 and 30 Mar 2005 from the deadly
Ebola-like Marburg virus, making it the world's worst [Marburg fever]
outbreak by official count.
"We have recorded a total of 132 cases between 13 Oct 2004 and 30 Mar 2005,
of whom 126 have died," a joint statement said. An earlier government toll
had put the number of cases at 124 and the fatalities at 117. But
unofficial estimates by health workers and officials earlier said the
number of deceased totalled 130, surpassing the previous record.
A severe form of haemorrhagic fever akin to Ebola, Marburg virus was first
identified in 1967. It spreads on contact with the fluids the body produces
in reaction to it, such as blood, urine, excrement, vomit and saliva. The
outbreak has claimed a record number of lives, overtaking the earlier peak
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola's neighbour.
But Quiala Godi, the number-2 health official in the northern province of
Uige -- the epicentre of the virus -- said the toll was higher in that area
alone. "I don't agree with the figures given by Luanda," he told AFP over
the telephone. "Until yesterday, we had a total of 132 cases, including 125
dead in the provincial hospital of Uige [alone] without counting 5 bodies
elsewhere."
Meanwhile, a communique by Angola's health ministry, the WHO, Medecins sans
Frontieres and the UN children's agency UNICEF said Canada had sent a
mobile laboratory to investigate cases of the virus. 4 African nations --
The Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Kenya and the western
island country of Sao Tome and Principe -- have gone on alert in the wake
of the outbreak in Angola.
Luanda's provincial health director Vita Mvemba on Monday appealed for
international assistance, saying the southern African country, which only
recently emerged from a brutal 27-year civil war, had only 1200 doctors
nationwide. 3/4 of the deaths in Angola have been children under the age of
5 years, according to the WHO, but the virus has also started to claim
adult victims since it erupted in October 2004.

[According to the WHO update (see [1] above) the reported case fatality
rate in this outbreak is 96 percent (127 deaths out of 132 cases). As
mentioned it is the highest case fatality rate reported in known outbreaks
of Marburg fever. It is still early in the course of the epidemiologic
investigation, and it is possible that with active case surveillance in the
region that milder cases that have not come to the attention of the health
sector will be identified. We await further information as it becomes
available. - Mod.MPP]
