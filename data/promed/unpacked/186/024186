A study report published in a recent edition of the Indian Journal of Medical Research says bats with nipah virus have been found in Assam's Dhubri and West Bengal's Cooch Behar districts.

During the study, conducted from March till December 2015, 107 _Pteropus giganteus_ bats were captured from Assam and Bengal - 60 from Dhubri, 39 from Cooch Behar and 8 from Jalpaiguri district in Bengal. Tissue specimens of the 107 bats were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which found 6 bats from Cooch Behar and 3 from Dhubri positive for nipah virus. _Pteropus_ bats are known to be a natural reservoir for this virus.

Nipah virus infection is a newly emerging zoonosis. In 2001, nipah virus-associated encephalitis outbreak was reported for the 1st time from Meherpur district, Bangladesh. Sporadic cases and outbreaks have been reported from various districts of Bangladesh since. Twelve persons died of nipah virus in Kerala in May this year [2018].

"The presence of nipah virus in the bat population in a previously unexplored region is a matter of serious concern. This warrants a survey to determine the presence of the virus among humans, suspected cases and reservoirs (swine and bat) in other states of Northeast," says the report.

A senior official of the Assam health department said so far Assam has not reported any nipah outbreak. "The detection of nipah in bats in Dhubri may be because of proximity of the district to Bangladesh. The bats may have migrated from there. People in Dhubri were screened under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme after nipah outbreak in Kerala. No one was found infected. So far, no nipah outbreak has been reported in the state," he said.

During the outbreak in Kerala, officials of the Assam health department had said there was no need to panic as the disease was restricted to 2 districts of Kerala.

[The finding is presented in the last issue of the Indian Medical Journal http://www.ijmr.org.in/article.asp?issn=0971-5916;year=2018;volume=147;issue=3;spage=318;epage=320;aulast=Yadav.

An extract from the article reads: "Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus and an important emerging zoonotic disease in South East Asia. NiV was 1st identified in Singapore and Malaysia during an outbreak of severe febrile illness with encephalitis in 1998-1999. In 2001, Nipah encephalitis outbreak was reported for the 1st time from Meherpur district, Bangladesh; since then, sporadic cases and outbreaks were reported from various districts of Bangladesh. India has witnessed 2 outbreaks of Nipah encephalitis in the eastern State of West Bengal during the year 2001 and 2007."

The natural reservoir hosts of NiV are flying foxes (_Pteropus_ spp.). They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia (including the Indian subcontinent), Australia, East Africa, and a number of remote oceanic islands in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. At least 60 extant species are in this genus. The species found in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian flying fox (_Pteropus giganteus_). It is one of the largest bats in the world.
