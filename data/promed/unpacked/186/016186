A confirmed case of anthrax was detected in a beef cattle herd in Sedgwick County after the producer had 7 acute deaths in the herd, according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA). The CSU [Colorado State University] Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the case last week. A 2nd positive case was confirmed positive in a nearby beef herd Tuesday [26 Jul 2022], the CDA said in a press release.

Both herds have been quarantined and are being monitored. The cattle are being treated with antibiotics and vaccinated against anthrax. The CDA and USDA are also working with county officials to ensure the infected carcasses are properly disposed of.

"Livestock producers in northeast Colorado should monitor their herds for unexplained deaths and work with their veterinarian to ensure appropriate samples are collected and submitted to a diagnostic lab for testing," said Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin. "Producers and veterinarians should refrain from performing field necropsies on suspected anthrax cases, due to the high risk of exposure to anthrax spores and possibility for human infection."

This is the 1st confirmed case of anthrax in Colorado cattle since 2012, when more than 75 head of cattle died in a multi-premises outbreak across northeast Colorado, according to the CDA.

Anthrax can occur naturally in Colorado's soil, the CDA said. The bacterial spores can lie dormant for decades then emerge in greater concentrations after rain storms, flooding or excavation.

According to the CDA, cattle producers can protect their herds through the following ways:
- Develop a vaccination plan for livestock in endemic areas by working with their veterinarian.
- Monitor their herd for unexplained deaths and report suspected cases to the State Veterinarian's office.
- Move livestock off affected pastures.
- Plan for proper disposal of affected carcasses without causing further contamination of the soil.

Colorado agriculture officials have confirmed anthrax in at least 2 beef cattle herds in Sedgwick County. These are the 1st confirmed cases of anthrax in cattle in Colorado since 2012, when more than 75 head of cattle died in a multi-premises outbreak in the northeast counties.

The Colorado State Veterinarian's office reports the 1st case was confirmed at the CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on 23 Jul 2022 after the producer had 7 acute deaths in the herd. A 2nd positive case in a nearby beef herd was confirmed positive on Tuesday [26 Jul 2022].

Both herds are currently being monitored under quarantine. The cattle are being treated with antibiotics and vaccinated against anthrax. CDA and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) are also working with Sedgwick County to develop a disposal plan to minimize continued contamination from infected carcasses. Because anthrax is listed as a select agent by the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the relevant state and federal agencies have been notified and appropriate precautions and investigations have been completed.

Anthrax is a bacterial pathogen in livestock and wild animals. Ruminants such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible, and horses can also be infected. Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected.

When conditions become favorable, the spores germinate into colonies of bacteria. An example would be a grazing cow ingests spores that in the cow germinate, grow, spread, and eventually kill the animal. Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. These spore-forming bacteria can survive in the environment for decades because of their ability to resist heat, cold, drying, etc. This is usually the infectious stage of anthrax.

There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of anthrax. [Anthrax is not contagious except through blood spill. - Mod.MHJ] People get anthrax by handling contaminated animal or animal products, consuming undercooked meat of infected animals and, more recently, intentional release of spores.

[Sedgwick County is in the northeast corner of Colorado, bordering neighboring states, and to the immediate east of Logan County, which was afflicted with anthrax in 2012. See map at https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/colorado_90.jpg.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture's advice to their ranchers is very sound. At this time of year, spread of livestock anthrax through female tabanid flies is very likely. Herds immediately neighboring the affected cattle are most at risk, but individual flies have been known to cause new cases up to 12-15 miles [19-24 km] away. The Sterne vaccine is very cheap and much, much less than the value of a dead cow.

The index outbreak could have been initiated by rain stimulating germination and multiplication of _B. anthracis_ spores on the soil surface and in the grazing roots. I would not be surprised if it turns out that the cause of these 2 outbreaks is genetically identical to that involved in the Logan 2012 outbreak. Spread from the latter to Sedgwick County would have been by flies and unobserved at the time. Random singular cattle deaths are seen but not always noted. Another aspect to keep in mind is that one can have anthrax latent infections, which are invisible except at necropsy, until the hot summer temperatures reduce the innate resistance and a minor germination is sufficient to initiate a real infection. There is still much to be learnt about anthrax outside the laboratory, and this is facilitated by getting mud on your boots. - Mod.MHJ
