The State may have ignored recommendations on anthrax outbreaks at Lake Nakuru National Park, exposing animals and humans to grave danger. The disease has killed 14 buffaloes with unconfirmed reports indicating one human infection in Elburgon, Nakuru County.

In August [2018], the Kenya Zoonotic Disease Unit of the ministries of agriculture and health had declared the park an anthrax hotspot and directed routine vaccination of all animals at all times. In a study to establish the cause of repeated anthrax outbreaks in the area, since 1973, the unit had blamed kneejerk reactions by government agencies for unnecessary loss of human and animal lives. "Typically, the government responds to these anthrax outbreaks by immediately deep-burying dead livestock and wildlife, ring vaccinating livestock, and treating affected humans," said the report. Anthrax vaccination programmes in the area, the report [says], have been irregular and mostly planned as a response to outbreaks; "there is no routine vaccination practised."

True to the report, on Tuesday [9 Apr 2019], Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) head of corporate communications Paul Gathitu said they had burned carcasses of the dead buffaloes, disinfected the sites and started vaccinating rhinos. "We will vaccinate 15 white rhinos and 67 black rhinos in a window of 10 days. So far, we have vaccinated 19 rhinos and 63 remaining while vegetation will be disinfected," said Susan Koech, the Principal Secretary for Wildlife, on Monday [8 Apr 2019]. The outbreak of anthrax was 1st identified on 29 Mar [2019] at the park, which has more than 4000 buffaloes.

On Sunday [7 Apr 2019], Nakuru County Minister for Agriculture Dr. Immaculate Njuthe said one case of suspected human anthrax had been reported in Elburgon. "If not managed well, the outbreak can spiral out of control and find its way into neighbouring communities," said Principal Secretary Koech.

The August [2018] study by local and international experts suggested inept handling of anthrax outbreaks in the past has not helped reduce recurrences. The experts had recommended the government develop an anthrax risk map for the country and maintain regular surveillance and vaccination of animals in and around the park. They had also recommended public education and awareness on the risk of anthrax outbreaks. The study traced 10 outbreaks around Lake Nakuru since 1973 including that of 2015, which killed 766 wild animals, including 745 buffaloes.

The Nakuru County government has intensified inspection of meat products following reports of an anthrax outbreak in the county. Public health officials have been dispatched to all sub-counties to inspect meat supplied to butcheries and hotels to ensure it is safe for consumption. The officers are working together with those from the veterinary department to inspect at least 1000 licensed butcheries in the county. "Locals should not fear buying meat in any licensed butchery because we have intensified inspection and the supply channel for safety," Samuel King'ori, chief officer in charge of the Public Health department, said.

Two weeks ago, at least 14 people suspected to have contracted anthrax were treated at Elburgon Hospital. Samples were taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) in Nairobi for testing, but the results are yet to be released.

"Nobody should consume meat that has not been inspected because evil-minded people can sell infected livestock meat that can lead to deaths," said King'ori. In 2016, at least 70 people at Lengenet village contracted anthrax after they consumed the carcass of a cow.

Besides inspecting meat, the health workers are also inspecting food joints, shops and supermarkets to ensure food safety.

Dr. Enos Amuyunzu, County Chief Officer for Livestock, said at least 15 000 cattle have been vaccinated in Nakuru Town East Sub-County. Other areas where vaccination is ongoing include parts of Njoro and Elburgon in Molo Sub-County. Amuyunzu has asked farmers to monitor livestock and report any signs of anthrax, including high temperature, shivering or twitching, harsh dry coat, blood in dung or in nostrils, decrease or complete loss of milk, and also dejection and loss of appetite.

[The 2018 expert advice was sound and experienced. It is hoped the present troubles will initiate the establishment of the necessary, and overdue, national programme of anthrax control and surveillance. Note that there has been another probable human case reported. - Mod.MHJ
