A horse in Virginia has tested positive for Equine Herpesvirus-1.

According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), on Friday, Feb. 21, the State Veterinarian's Office of the VDACS confirmed 1 horse tested positive for Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

The infected horse was at a boarding stable in Powhatan County. The boarding stable has been placed under quarantine.

They say no horse had left the property in at least 2 weeks.

In addition, the VDACS says exposed horses are being monitored twice daily for fever (temperature over 101.50 F) and other clinical signs and thus far no additional Virginia horses have been exposed.

There is no cause for alarm concerning the general horse population in Virginia.

EHV-1 is a virus present in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. Horses typically are exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects.

A large percent of horses carry the virus with no clinical signs for the remainder of their lives. Rarely, exposed horses develop the neurologic form of the disease.

Horse owners with concerns should contact their veterinarian.

The Equine Disease Communications Center Biosecurity has more information on best practices for diseas
e prevention in horses and VDACS has more information on EHV-1.

Horse owners also may contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services at 804.786.2483.

[Equine herpesvirus-1 is a virus of the family Herpesviridae that causes abortion, respiratory disease and occasionally neonatal mortality in horses. Initial spread of EHV-1 by a newly introduced horse through direct and indirect contact can lead to abortion and perinatal infection in up to 70 percent of a previously unexposed herd. This article does not tell us if this horse was vaccinated.

Biosecurity is extremely important with this disease, as it is highly contagious and spreads easily. There is no vaccine against the neurological form of the disease. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention. - Mod.TG
