A district in Hanoi reported it has 114 head of livestock infected by the
foot and mouth disease [FMD] epidemic sweeping through the region.
The Soc Son district epidemic prevention center said Thursday [31 Aug 2006]
it had found 4 infected sites with 75 heads of cattle and 39 pigs affected.
It had immediately culled all the pigs, was treating the cattle, and had
taken measures to contain the disease.
On Wed 30 Aug 2006 Thanh Tri, another district in Hanoi, announced its FMD
toll had risen to 155 animals.
The epidemic had hit 12 localities in Vietnam infecting over 3300 cattle
and 1100 pigs, the Animal Health Department said.

[Vietnam's last notifications to the OIE on FMD were sent on 20 and 24 May
2006, reporting the presence of FMDV serotype O in 32 provinces and of
serotype Asia-1 in one province (see 20060530.1510).
Hanoi was included among the provinces reportedly infected (in bovines and
buffaloes) with FMDV serotype O in April 2006. It is, however, not clear
which FMDV serotype is responsible for the current outbreaks, now affecting
pigs as well.
The decision to cull the affected pigs may indicate that porcines are not
included in the Vietnamese vaccination scheme. Pigs are prolific
disseminators of the FMD virus.
