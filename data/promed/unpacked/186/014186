Even before Mysuru is recovering from the menace of dengue and chikungunya the cases of which were reported from all parts of the city between July and September [2017], its populace is now facing a new kind of viral fever. This viral fever which lasts for around 15 - 20 days has no definite symptoms and is non detectable through various diagnostic tests too.

According to the District Vector-Borne Diseases Control Office, this new viral fever has the symptoms of both dengue and chikungunya and the patient continues to suffer for 15 - 20 days.

Speaking to the Times of India, Mysuru district vector-borne diseases control officer Dr S Chidambara said that this fever is yet to be given any specific name. "Those who suffer from this fever generally get fever for 1st 2 days and for next 15 - 20 days they face body ache, joint pain etc. After that it will get cured", he said. "This viral fever is neither dengue nor chikungunya or any other known types of viral fevers. The virus which is causing this fever is yet to be named" he added.

Dr A S Sarvesharaje Urs, a surgeon from Kuvempunagara of the city who is also the vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, Karnataka State branch, said that this fever has the symptoms of both dengue and chikungunya. "This new type of fever couldn't be detected even through blood tests. Blood test reports of patients are showing negative for dengue and chikungunya and other existing strains of viral fevers. Blood platelets counts also remain the same. Some time, the blood test report may show positive for few of the symptoms of both these fevers", he said. "Frequently the fever makes people mentally weak, which makes the patient weak physically also," he said.

Meanwhile, heath activists feel that there is the need of multi-pronged strategy to prevent the city from the grip of viral fevers. "Mosquito menace is common in old city areas. Open, clogged drainage network could be found in several parts of the city which are the fertile breeding ground for the mosquitoes. Only through awareness the problem can be solved," observe Dr. Ashok Kumar, a doctor and an activist.

According to Dr. M G Satish Kumar, physician at Colombia Asia hospital, during the last month, he has been receiving patients with this new kind of viral fever. "Patients complain of fever, rashes, muscle and joint pain. Many of them even find difficulty walking. But their blood samples are testing negative for both dengue and chikungunya," he explained. "Probably it is also mosquito-borne disease. Patients recover in a few days. We are giving them symptom-based treatment," he said.

[There is insufficient information to speculate which etiological agent is responsible for these febrile cases. Dengue and chikungunya viruses and other "strains of [unspecified] viral fevers" have been ruled out. It would be useful to know the basis for indicating that these are virus infections as well as the pathogens that have been included in laboratory tests. Additional information about the age and sex of the affected individuals would be of interest as well. Undiagnosed illnesses are reported occasionally in various states in India.

ProMED would appreciate receiving any additional information concerning the above cases. - Mod.TY
