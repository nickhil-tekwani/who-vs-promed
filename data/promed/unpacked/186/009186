'Shunned' Nobel-winner will head new [UK] research into BSE By David Brown,
Agriculture Editor.
Apparently Professor Stanley Prusiner has been called in by the UK
Government to plan new research into mad cow disease after years of
rejecting his offers to help. "They approached me a month ago," Professor
Prusiner said before leaving London yesterday after giving evidence at a
weekend session of the BSE inquiry.
He set up a special laboratory in California in 1974 to study scrapie - the
fatal sheep brain disease which is thought to have been the precursor of
BSE. But he told of difficulties that the agriculture ministry in London
put in his way when he tried to extend his work to cover BSE after the
disease was made public in 1987.
The following May, he requested cow brain samples from the ministry. He
received a holding letter in September but it was not until 1989 that he
was sent the samples he needed. He could not understand the delay since
"they had plenty of material to offer".
Then on June 5, 1991, he submitted a funding request to the ministry and
the Agricultural and Food Research Council to develop a way of screening
animals and people for the fatal brain diseases. Even now, he said,
scientists knew very little about them. They did not know how many cattle
were affected sub-clinically with the disease. They only knew those that
had succumbed to BSE.
His request was rejected. Then in September 1996, five months after the
beef crisis broke, when British scientists announced a probable link
between BSE and a new variant of CJD in people, he submitted another
request on the advice of John Wilesmith, the Government's senior animal
epidemiologist. This was also rejected. He estimated the project cost at Â£5
million.
Professor Prusiner "could not understand" pre-research findings used by
Professor Sir John Pattison, chairman of the Government's spongiform
encephalopathies advisory committee, and others to conclude that the new
variant CJD was linked to BSE. He said: "I am not convinced as a scientist
that the new variant CJD is caused by BSE in cattle." But while there was
"no conclusive proof", he conceded that this "seemed likely" on the basis
of available evidence.
It was true that the new variant CJD had been found - apart from one case
in France - in Britain, the country with the highest incidence of BSE. But
he questioned why there had only been 25 cases of the new variant CJD when
there had been so many cases in cattle. Professor Prusiner said: "We have
no clear reason why these people have developed this disease when 10
million other people with the same environmental history did not. There is
no unique behaviour trait. They didn't go out and eat cattle brains."
