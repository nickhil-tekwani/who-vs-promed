Multistate outbreak of monkeypox in persons exposed to pet prairie dogs
---------------------------------------------------------
An extensive multidisciplinary investigation in Wisconsin, Illinois, and
Indiana has identified cases of febrile rash illness in persons who had
direct or close contact with recently purchased ill prairie dogs. Scientists
at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, recovered viral
isolates from a patient and a prairie dog and demonstrated a virus
morphologically consistent with a poxvirus by electron microscopy (see
<http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/crc/prairiedog.asp>
for electron microscopy images).
Preliminary results of serologic testing, polymerase-chain-reaction
[PCR] analysis, and gene sequencing performed at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 6-7 Jun 2003 indicated that
the causative agent is monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus
group of viruses. Results of additional evaluation at CDC by electron
microscopy and immunohistochemical studies are consistent with the
finding of an orthopoxvirus. These findings represent the first evidence
of community-acquired monkeypox-like infection in the United States.
Further characterization of the virus is in progress.
Human monkeypox is a rare zoonotic viral disease that occurs primarily
in the rain forest countries of central and west Africa. In humans, the
illness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that of smallpox.
Limited person-to-person spread of infection has been reported in
disease-endemic areas in Africa; the incubation period is about 12 days.
Case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1% to 10% -- for
additional information about monkeypox, see

As of Sat 7Jun 2003, cases of suspected monkeypox had been reported
among residents of Wisconsin (17), northern Illinois (1), and
northwestern Indiana (1). Onset of illness among patients began in early
May [2003]. Patients typically experienced a prodrome consisting of
fever, headaches, myalgias, chills, and drenching sweats. Roughly one-
third of patients had nonproductive cough. This prodromal phase was
followed 1-10 days later by the development of a papular rash that
typically progressed through stages of vesiculation, pustulation,
umbilication, and crusting. In some patients, early lesions have become
ulcerated. Rash distribution and lesions have occurred on head, trunk, and
extremities; many of the patients had initial and satellite lesions on palms
and soles and extremities. Rashes were generalized in some patients.
After onset of the rash, patients have generally manifested rash lesions in
different stages.
All patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs, most of
which were sick. Illness in prairie dogs was frequently reported as
beginning with a blepharoconjunctivitis, progressing to presence of
nodular lesions in some cases. Some prairie dogs have died
from the illness, while others reportedly recovered.
In May [2003] the prairie dogs were sold by a Milwaukee animal
distributor to 2 pet shops in the Milwaukee area and during a pet "swap
meet" (pets for sale or exchange) in northern Wisconsin. The Milwaukee
animal distributor had obtained prairie dogs and a Gambian giant rat that
was ill at the time from a northern Illinois animal distributor. It is unclear
whether other retail outlets are involved. Investigations are under way to
trace back the source of the prairie dogs and the Gambian giant rat and
determine if distributors in other states might be involved. Animal
species susceptible to monkeypox virus may include non-human
primates, lagomorphs (rabbits), and some rodents.
On the basis of preliminary findings from this investigation, it appears
that the primary route of transmission may be from infected prairie dogs
to humans as a result of close contact. However, the possibility of human-
to-human transmission cannot be excluded at this time. As a precaution
until additional information is available, the measures below should be
followed.
General Prevention
------------------
Avoid contact with any prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats that appear to
be ill (e.g., are missing patches of fur, have a visible rash on the skin, or
have a discharge from eyes or nose). Wash hands thoroughly after any
contact with prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill animal.
Diagnosis
-----------
Physicians should consider monkeypox in persons with fever, cough,
headache, myalgias, rash, or lymph node enlargement within 3 weeks
after contact with prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. Inform the treating
physician or other clinician of the animal exposure.
Veterinarians
-------------
Veterinarians examining sick exotic animal species, especially prairie
dogs and Gambian giant rats, should consider monkeypox. Veterinarians
should also be alert to the development of illness in other animal species
that may have been housed with ill prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats.
Treatment
--------
No specific treatment recommendations are being made at this time.
Smallpox vaccine has been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox
among previously vaccinated persons in Africa. CDC is assessing the
potential role of postexposure use of smallpox vaccine as well as
therapeutic use of the antiviral drug cidofovir. [A newswire report states
that one of the victims had been vaccinated against smallpox back in
1972. - Mod.JW]
Reporting
---------
Health care providers, veterinarians, and public health personnel should
report cases of these illnesses in humans and animals to their state or
local health departments as soon as they are suspected.
Submission of Specimens from Patients with Suspected Monkeypox
--------------------------------------------------------------
Procedures recommended for collection of samples for diagnosis of
potential monkeypox disease are essentially the same as those for
diagnosis of the related orthopoxvirus diseases, vaccinia and smallpox.
For information regarding collection of serum specimens and lesions,
please refer to the smallpox laboratory testing guidelines at
. Consultation with the
state epidemiologist
and state health
laboratory
is necessary for submission instructions before sending specimens to
CDC.
Additional Information
----------------------
For more information contact your state or local health department.
Additional information and recommendations will be released as they
become available. Updated information will be posted on CDC's
monkeypox Web site

[At present there still seems to be some ambiguity regarding the identity
of the etiologic agent responsible for this outbreak. Monkeypox virus has
not been observed outside West/Central Africa and its name is something
of a misnomer. Monkeypox virus causes mild illness in primates but its
principal reservoir hosts may be squirrels and rodents. Monkeypox virus
is a member of the same poxvirus genus as smallpox virus (i.e. the genus
_Orthopoxvirus_) and smallpox virus vaccine (i.e. vaccinia virus)
provides protective immunity. However, in its natural range outbreaks of
monkeypox are infrequent and it has often been confused with outbreaks
of chickenpox (caused by an unrelated herpesvirus): see a previous
cautionary comment posted by Dr. D.A. Henderson in "Monkeypox -
Congo DR (Equateur) (06) 20020410.3926" - Mod.CP]

The Associated Press article on monkeypox quoted on ProMED-mail
states that: ["One of the cases] said she got 2 female prairie dogs from
SK Exotics on 5 May 2003. Neither looked sick at first, she said, but
one eventually began to look tired. [She] said she got sick in mid-May
with blisters, coughing and a 101-degree fever. Hospital staff gave her
aspirin, told her it was a viral infection and she went home, she said."
Monkeypox presents very much like smallpox. If the article is accurate
and the case did go to a hospital, why did the hospital not recognize the
similarities and become fretful?

[I would suggest that there is significant reason for concern about the
efficacy of the BT preparedness training that has gone on, if the patient
presented with a febrile "blister" illness to an Emergency Department.
Who were the targets of the training? Did they include all ED staff
including nursing (triage nurses are usually rotated among all ED nurses)
and all ED docs?
And if the patient was a young adult, giving ASA [aspirin] with a possible
varicella infection is still questionable because of the association with
Reye's syndrome. - Mod.MPP]
