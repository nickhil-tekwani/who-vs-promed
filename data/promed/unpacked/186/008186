[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) appeared 1st in northern Israel in January 1993 (notification in OIE's Bulletin of 29 January 1993, Vol. 6, No. 3). The route of introduction (most likely from Lebanon) has not been established. Remarkably, the 1st event took place in the village of Arbel, just 5 km (3.1 miles) from Sharona, where the current outbreak has occurred. Since 1993, the disease has become endemic and controlled mainly by mass vaccinations.

The apparent absence of cases in the goats, reportedly kept on the same premises, is unusual: Goats are considered even more susceptible to PPR than sheep. It would be interesting to note whether the affected flock in Sharona, or parts thereof (e.g., the goats), has been vaccinated and when.

On [1 Jul 2016], Israel's State Veterinary Services and Animal Health published the discontinuation of compulsory, state-organized PPR vaccinations, declaring further vaccinations as privatized and voluntary. - Mod.AS
