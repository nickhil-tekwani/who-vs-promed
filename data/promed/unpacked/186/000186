[3] Mpox vaccine safe and effective in real-world settings
Date: Mon 19 Dec 2022
Source: Infectious Disease Special Edition [edited]
https://www.idse.net/Viral-Infections/Article/12-22/Mpox-Vaccine-Safe-and-Effective-in-Real-World-Settings/69016


Real-world data have shown that the monkeypox (mpox) modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (Jynneos, Bavarian Nordic) is both safe and effective in reducing the risk for infection, according to a pair of newly released CDC reports.

The vaccine is a live, non-replicating viral vaccine licensed for the prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults who are at least 18 years of age, administered as a 0.5-mL 2-dose series given 28 days apart by subcutaneous injection. On 9 Aug 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the administration of 0.1-mL doses by intradermal injection for adults at least 18 years of age as a strategy to increase vaccine supply, and 0.5-mL doses subcutaneously for young people under the age of 18.

The 1st report focused on vaccine safety data reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine Safety Datalink, which included information on vaccine recipients of all ages, and through single-patient emergency Investigational New Drug procedures for young people under the age of 18 vaccinated before 9 Aug 2022.

"JYNNEOS vaccine was used on a large scale outside of clinical trials for the 1st time during the 2022 mpox outbreak," said Jonathan Duffy, MD, a public health physician with the CDC Mpox Emergency Response Team. "CDC routinely monitors vaccine safety as part of new vaccination programs, and sharing information about vaccine safety is important to maintaining confidence in vaccines."

From 22 May 2022 through 21 Oct 2022, a total of 987 294 mpox vaccine doses were administered in the United States.

Overall, reported adverse events (AEs) were rare and non-serious, with the majority being related to injection site reactions. No serious AEs were reported in patients under the age of 18.

While a small number of cases of myocarditis were reported, the VAERS myocarditis reporting rate was at least seven times lower than the background myocarditis rate, according to researchers.

"The JYNNEOS vaccine safety monitoring findings during the 2022 mpox outbreak have been consistent with what was known about the vaccine from the pre-licensure clinical trials," Dr Duffy said. "This provides reassurance about the safety of the vaccine when used to prevent mpox."

One major purpose of post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring is to detect rare AEs that cannot be recognized until larger numbers of people have received the vaccine, Dr. Duffy added. "No vaccine safety concerns were identified for JYNNEOS with nearly one million doses given. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor the safety of JYNNEOS as more people continue to be given the vaccine."

Aside from being safe, data from the second report showed that the vaccine is effective against mpox.

The analysis focused on data from 9544 reported mpox cases among men 18 to 49 years of age from 31 Jul 2022 through 1 Oct 2022, from 43 US jurisdictions. Researchers found that the rate of mpox was 10 times higher in unvaccinated men than in men who received both vaccine doses.

[The efficacy of the Jynneos vaccine given either SQ or intradermally has certainly been better than expected. What remains to be seen is if the duration of immunity if comparable across the various dose sparing strategies and administration routes. That will be key information for not only the next major outbreak, but to help stamp out local clusters in high risk populations where the virus is endemic or is likely to become so through the course of the current outbreak. - Mod.JH]

[4] France: viral loads in clinical samples of men with mpox virus infection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
Mpox is a zoonotic disease, discovered in monkeys in 1958. The 1st human case was confirmed in 1970, when the mpox virus (MPXV) was isolated from a child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. MPXV causes a disease in humans that is similar to smallpox, but with much lower mortality, ranging from 0% to 10% for cases reported after 2000. Symptoms are based on the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash, and complications such as encephalitis or profuse skin and mucous lesions are rarely described. Mpox is endemic in West Africa and Central Africa with sporadic cases or outbreaks in high-income countries, linked to the exotic pet trade or international travel. 2 distinct clades of MPXV have been characterised: Congo Basin and West African. The Congo Basin clade is associated with higher mortality than the West African clade and appears to be transmitted more frequently between humans. The last epidemic with indigenous transmission in a high-income country occurred in the USA in 2003, with 35 confirmed cases and 36 suspected cases following the importation of infected animals from Ghana.

Since early May 2022, more than 60 000 cases of mpox have been reported in countries with no historically reported cases, particularly in Europe and the USA, among individuals who have not travelled to endemic areas. This current epidemic appears to be concentrated among men who have sex with men, a substantial number of whom have been involved in mass gathering events (e.g., the Maspalomas Gay Pride).

MPXV is known to be spread through close contact with lesions, body fluids, and respiratory droplets of infected people or animals. However, sexual activity might drive MPXV transmission. 1st reports show an unexpected number of patients infected with MPXV with anal and genital lesions, which might also be associated with the sexual route of transmission. Understanding precisely how MPXV transmits from one individual to another -- in the context of sex with partners -- is crucial, in order to adapt communication about the disease and help control its spread.

To better understand the routes of transmission, investigation of the distribution of MPXV and viral loads according to anatomical locations in the 1st patients with a confirmed infection is essential. In this article, we report on a series of French individuals with locally acquired infections of mpox, with the aim of describing the distribution of MPXV in the human body, as well as the viral loads associated with different anatomical sites at time of diagnosis and after a 2-week follow-up.

Discussion
----------
Most patients infected with MPXV during the current outbreak in Europe and the USA are men who have sex with men, as was the case with all patients in our series, except one. In the 21 days before the onset of symptoms, which corresponds to the maximal incubation period of mpox, patients in our series reported multiple sex partners. All previous reports of the current outbreak have identified close sexual contact as the main risk factor of MPXV dissemination, emphasising the crucial role of understanding the route of transmission of the virus. Transmission of MPXV has been shown to occur through direct contact with skin lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets from infected animals or humans, or indirectly through contaminated fomites. By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, regardless of sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission. However, there has been little research into whether MPXV can be transmitted sexually until now (i.e., through sexual secretions containing the virus, and through oral, genital, or anal mucosa). Herein, we provide data on 356 clinical samples, collected at D0 and D14 from 50 individuals with confirmed [mpox] in Paris.

We detected MPXV in semen from most men (83% at diagnosis) with confirmed mpox, in line with other recent reports suggesting a possible risk of human-to-human transmission through male sexual secretions. This detection of the virus in semen is concordant with previous zoonotic viruses including the Zika virus and Ebola virus; however, sexual contact might not be the dominant transmission pathway. We also detected MPXV from the oropharynx and anus of almost all the patients reported here (87% in the oropharynx and 88% in the anus at diagnosis), which supports evidence of transmission through oral and anal sex. A recent Spanish study showed a high rate of MPXV detection in saliva (100%), the nasopharynx (83%), and the anus (92%), coming to similar conclusions as our study did, and supporting the transmission of MPXV through breathing and kissing.

The detection of MPXV was rarer in blood and urine than in other sampled sites. Our English and Spanish colleagues showed that the detection of MPXV in urine is not constant (never detected in 3 of 7 patients in blood samples and in 3 of 12 patients in urine samples). The presence of viraemia associated with [mpox] symptoms has been studied by a few teams. In the 2003 US mpox epidemic, only 3 of 12 patients investigated were viraemia and of the 2 cases in Nigeria in 2018, both were [viremic]. In the English series, MPXV was detected in the blood in 6 of 7 patients at least once, at the beginning of the disease, and [viremia] seemed to be undetectable within 1-4 weeks. In our series, MPXV was undetectable in urine from more than half of patients at diagnosis, and undetectable in blood from about 20% of patients.

We also found differences in MPXV viral loads depending on the anatomical sites and body fluids collected: they were significantly higher from skin than from throat, blood, and semen; significantly higher from the anus than from the throat; and significantly higher from semen than from blood. MPXV detection from clinical samples taken 14 days after the diagnosis supported a rapid viral clearance in body fluids and anatomical compartments.

We speculate that there might be a short [viremic] phase (accompanied by viral shedding in body fluids such as urine and semen) at the beginning of the symptomatic phase of [mpox] and that systemic viral circulation ends before healing of the skin lesions. However, studies about Ebola and Zika viruses have shown that viral shedding in semen can continue for several months after the [viremic] phase and after the end of symptoms, with a risk of late secondary sexual transmission.

Our findings should be taken with caution. We only had one sample per anatomical site, and differences in sampling procedures could alter the outcome (especially for skin [scabbing]). We also did not have samples at D14 for half of the patients, which could lead to a bias in the interpretation of the results, and not having samples available after D14 limits the ability to gather more information about viral kinetics. Furthermore, a molecular biology test investigates DNA, and we did not have evidence of the presence of infectious viral particles, which is a key point when making conclusion about the potentiality of sexual transmission of this disease. However, very recent data argue in favor of the infectivity of MPXV in semen. Lapa and colleagues have shown the viral viability of MPXV isolated from semen (Ct 29.3) in a case of [mpox], showing a clear cytopathic effect 48 h after inoculation of semen in Vero E6 cells. These results should precede longitudinal cohort studies exploring viral secretion in different body fluids over time, associated with assessment of viral infectivity using cell culture.

We hope that these findings, in addition to other recent reports, will contribute to the debate on sexual transmission of MPXV and a better understanding of the risk of MPXV dissemination to sexual partners, and will help define the best communication and prevention strategies for the most affected communities. All sexually active men who have sex with men should be informed about the presence of MPXV on the skin, in the throat, in the anus, and in body fluids in case of infection, to help decrease transmission via sexual contact or physical promiscuity during festive events.

[Much still needs to be understood regarding the mechanisms of transmission and the window of infectivity of a given patient. It would also be interesting to see how vaccination status, underlying immune disorders, and route of infection influence the presence or absence of the virus in various tissues and fluids and how long said virus remains truly infectious. - Mod.JH]
