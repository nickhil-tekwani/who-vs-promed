Scrapie-free Merino and Poll Dorset sheep from Australia and New Zealand
have normal frequencies of scrapie-susceptible PrP genotypes.
J Gen Virol 1998 Aug;79( Pt 8):2079-2082 Hunter N, Cairns D
As natural scrapie occurs only in sheep of specific PrP genotypes, one
proposed aetiology was that scrapie is simply a genetic disease. However,
Cheviot and Suffolk sheep of scrapie-susceptible genotypes are found in
Australia and New Zealand, both generally accepted to be scrapie-free
countries. A study of more common Australia and New Zealand sheep breeds
(Merinos and Poll Dorsets) was carried out in order to obtain more
generally applicable estimates of Australia and New Zealand sheep PrP
genotype frequencies. We have confirmed that animals of highly susceptible
PrP genotypes are found in Australia and New Zealand.
Interestingly, the Poll Dorset sheep, although born in New Zealand, were
brought to the UK as young adult animals and subsequently remained free of
clinical scrapie despite 21% of the sheep having scrapie-susceptible
genotypes. These results have implications for the genetic control of
occurrence of the equivalent human diseases.

emphasize the risks to Australia & New Zealand if they relaxed their
constraints on imported sheep. - Mod.MHJ]
