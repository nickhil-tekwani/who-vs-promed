Yellow fever kills three in San Martin
--------------------------------------------------
The the last five days, 15 persons have contracted yellow fever and 3 have
died.
The information was confirmed by the Regional director of Health, Miguel
Vela Lopez, who indicated that the cases had presented between the
localities of Pacayzapa and Jerillo, situated between the towns of Lamas and
Moyobamba.
Parallel to this, they have begun a vaccination campaign against yellow
fever that will also include persons in transit, as the affected communities
were located near the Marginal Northern Highway of the Department of San
Martin that runs from the coast to the mountains. The rains have increased
the number of insects, by which this disease is transmitted.

[The department of San Martin is to the north of Lima, with Tarapoto at 1487
kms from Lima. Tarapoto is to the west of Moyobamba and Lamas. Lamas is 30
kms from Torapoto. Moyobamba is the official Departmental capital. Tarpoto
and Moyobamba are in the High Jungle region of Peru at an altitude of 426
meters above sea level. In the Americas the forest cycle is maintained by
the mosquito _Haemagogus spegazzinii_ as the principal vector, with _H.
leucocelaenus_, _H. janthinomys_ and _Sabethes chloropterus_ also involved.
The urban cycle is maintained by _Aedes ageypti_. While this article does
not mention if the cases are urban or sylvatic, given the apparent rural
nature of the area, it suggests that this is sylvatic transmission.
Checking the WHO Diseases subject to regulation, the Juan Guerra and Sauce
Districts of San Martin province in Peru are listed as infected with yellow
fever -- see WER, 31 Jan 1999, http://www.who.int/wer/pdf/1999/wer7404.pdf
The area mentioned in this article is not in either of those districts, so
this may represent introduction of the disease to a new area - MPP
