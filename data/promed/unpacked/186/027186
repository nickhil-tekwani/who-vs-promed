Veterinarians have a warning for pet owners about a deadly cat virus. Already, it has claimed the lives of at least 50 cats at the SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] of Northeastern North Carolina.

It started in early July [2017] when a kitten unexpectedly died. "The kittens are just very fragile to begin with, health wise, so they're just more susceptible to it," said Ann Pitts, Executive Director of the SPCA Northeastern North Carolina.

An outbreak of panleukopenia tore through the SPCA over the last 2 months. It's a virus, only in cats, that attacks the GI system. Pitts said, "Immediately we started our quarantine and making sure all of our cleaning protocols are up to date."

The SPCA vaccinates every animal that comes in, but in the case of the kittens who died, many were too small to get the vaccinations.

The Pasquotank Animal Hospital is one of the places that helped the SPCA diagnose and attempt to treat the virus. Dr Leigh Rigler says in her 4 years of working at the hospital, this summer [2017] is the 1st time she's ever seen traces of the virus. She said, "With kittens, normally you can't even catch it, which is unfortunate."

She says it's especially easy for the virus to move through a shelter, because it's spread through feces, urine, even water bowls -- and normal cleaning agents won't kill it. "You don't know when the disease started, who first brought it in and which cat has been exposed and which cat can transfer the disease to another cat," Rigler explained.

Now, the SPCA says the virus is under control. They just hope people will take this as a lesson and remember to vaccinate their pets.

"Our shelter is all about giving every animal a chance here. And so it just breaks our hearts to see these little kittens having to deal with something like this," said Pitts.

Vets say if your cat is vaccinated, it should be immune to the virus.

["In the past, feline panleukopenia (FP) was a leading cause of death in cats. Today, it is an uncommon disease, due in large part to the availability and use of very effective vaccines. The disease is also called feline distemper or feline parvo.

"Feline panleukopenia (FP) is a highly contagious viral disease of cats caused by the feline parvovirus. Kittens are most severely affected by the virus."

"FP virus is everywhere in the environment, and virtually all kittens and cats are exposed to the virus at some point in their lives. While cats of any age may be infected with the feline parvovirus that causes FP, young kittens, sick cats, and unvaccinated cats are most susceptible. It is most commonly seen in cats 3-5 months of age; death from FP is more common at this age."

"Cats can shed the virus in their urine, stool, and nasal secretions; infection occurs when susceptible cats come in contact with these secretions, or even the fleas from infected cats. An infected cat tends to shed the virus for a relatively short period of time (1-2 days), but the virus can survive for up to a year in the environment, so cats may become infected without ever coming into direct contact with an infected cat. Bedding, cages, food dishes, and the hands or clothing of people who handle the infected cat may harbor the virus and transmit it to other cats. It is, therefore, very important to isolate infected cats. Any materials used on or for infected cats should not be used or allowed to come in contact with other cats, and people handling infected cats should practice proper hygiene to prevent spreading the infection.

"The virus that causes FP is difficult to destroy and resistant to many disinfectants. Ideally, unvaccinated cats should not be allowed into an area where an infected cat has been -- even if the area has been disinfected.

"The signs of FP can vary and may be similar to other illnesses such as _Salmonella_ or _Campylobacter_ infection, pancreatitis, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection, or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. Infected cats may even show signs that resemble those seen when a cat has been poisoned or has swallowed a foreign object."

"The likelihood of recovery from FP for infected kittens less than 8 weeks old is poor. Older cats have a greater chance of survival if adequate treatment is provided early. Since there are no medications capable of killing the virus, intensive care and treatment are critical to support the cat's health with medications and fluids until its own body and immune system can fight off the virus. Without such supportive care, up to 90 percent of cats with FP may die.

"Treatment focuses on correcting dehydration, providing nutrients, and preventing secondary infection. Although antibiotics do not kill the virus, they are often necessary because infected cats are at a higher risk of bacterial infections because their immune systems are not fully functioning (due to the decreased white blood cells) and because bacteria from the damaged gut may enter the cat's bloodstream and cause infection."

"Cats that survive an infection develop immunity that likely protects them for the rest of their lives. Mild cases that go unnoticed will also produce immunity from future infection.

"It is also possible for kittens to receive temporary immunity through the transfer of antibodies in the colostrum -- the 1st milk produced by the mother. This is called "passive immunity," and how long it protects the kittens from infection depends upon the levels of protective antibodies produced by the mother. It rarely lasts longer than 12 weeks.

Prevention is vital to your cat's health. Today, there are vaccines that offer the best protection from feline parvovirus infection. Vaccination is equally important for strictly indoor cats as well as indoor/outdoor cats because the virus is everywhere in the environment. Most young kittens receive their first vaccination at approximately 6 weeks old and follow-up vaccines are given until the kitten is around 16 weeks old. Adult vaccination schedules vary with the age and health of the cat, as well as the risk of FP in the area. Consult your veterinarian for advice on an appropriate vaccination schedule for your cat(s)."
