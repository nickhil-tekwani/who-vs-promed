WHO's Recommendation Concerns Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake of Dioxins,
Not Salmon
----------------------------------------------------------
Several recent news reports about farmed salmon have incorrectly conveyed
the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO), stating that WHO
reviewed new data on levels of dioxins in salmon and subsequently lowered
its "recommended daily intake of salmon."
This needs to be clarified. WHO has never recommended a daily intake for
salmon. Furthermore, WHO has not received or reviewed the purported data
showing higher levels of chemicals, including dioxins, in farmed salmon
compared to wild varieties.
In 1998, WHO lowered its recommended Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of
dioxins and related compounds, such as dibenzofurans and dioxin-like
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), to 1 - 4 picograms/kilogram body weight
from 10 picograms/kilogram body weight. This reduced recommended TDI was
based mainly on new information on the toxicity of these compounds, rather
than on exposure considerations.
WHO will again examine the safety of dioxins and related compounds when the
Joint United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization/WHO Expert Committee
on Food Additives (JECFA) meets in June 2001. JECFA welcomes the submission
of any data on dioxins in food, including farmed and wild salmon, for
evaluation by the JECFA experts.

[The 1998 report on the recommended Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of dioxins
can be found at
<http://www.who.int/pcs/pubs/dioxin-exec-sum/exe-sum-final.html>. The press
has been having a field day in response to the EU findings on increased
dioxin levels in fish from European waters. There have been a significant
number of press releases focusing on farmed salmon as well as wild salmon,
and this release seems to be focused at correcting misinformation contained
in these releases. - Mod.MPP
