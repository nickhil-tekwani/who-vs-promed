[1] Mumps - Virginia
Date: Thu 18 May 2006
From: Raymond Weinstein <AlaskaRay@aol.com>

I thought you might be interested to learn that today [Thu 18 May 2006] I
diagnosed what I believe is the 1st case of mumps in Virginia associated
with the current multistate outbreak. The patient is a 17 year old female
from Manassas with no known recent contact with anyone having mumps and no
recent travel or visitors from outside Virginia. She became ill with fever
and headache about 5 days ago and developed symptoms of bilateral parotitis
within the last 2 days.
Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is pending. What ties this case to
the other outbreaks is the fact that this patient is originally from Kansas
and received her 2 MMR vaccinations there in 1990 and 1994.
This occurrence makes me wonder: 1. Since this patient was vaccinated in
Kansas, but no longer lives there, could this be an indication of vaccine
failure? 2. Does her development of mumps, with no known contact with the
illness, in a community with a high vaccination rate and where an outbreak
is not occurring, indicate that there may be an intermittent subclinical
occurrence of the illness? I can imagine a scenario where this might occur
in patients who have partial immunity from previous vaccination and who
might shed virus without having any symptoms, or at least symptoms to
suggest mumps.

Update: multi-state outbreak of mumps - United States; 1 Jan to 2 May 2006
-----------------------------------------------------
CDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate an
outbreak of mumps that began in Iowa in December 2005 (1) and involved at
least 10 additional states as of 2 May 2006. This report summarizes
preliminary data reported to CDC from these 11 states and provides
recommendations to prevent and control mumps during an outbreak.
Cases of mumps are reportable through the National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS) (2). NNDSS reports are transmitted
electronically to CDC each week and include information on individual cases
such as age, sex, date of symptom onset, vaccination status, and
complications of illness. Mumps cases included in this report are those
with onset from [1 Jan 2006] (MMWR week 1) through [29 Apr 2006] (MMWR week
17) that were reported to CDC as of [2 May 2006] through NNDSS (or the Iowa
mumps outbreak-specific reporting system) from Iowa and 10 additional
states that reported one or more cases of mumps epidemiologically linked to
the multistate outbreak. In addition to cases reported through NNDSS, to
provide information rapidly during this outbreak, states have been
reporting aggregate numbers of mumps cases and mumps-related
hospitalizations and complications biweekly to CDC. Cases reported in this
manner through [2 May 2006], also are included in this report.
The clinical case definition of mumps* is an illness with acute onset of
unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or
other salivary gland, lasting 2 or more days, and without other apparent
cause. A confirmed case of mumps is one that is laboratory confirmed or
meets the clinical case definition and is linked epidemiologically to a
confirmed or probable case. A case is classified as probable if it meets
the clinical case definition but is neither laboratory-confirmed nor linked
to another confirmed or probable mumps case. In accordance with these
definitions, asymptomatic, laboratory confirmed infections were counted as
confirmed cases in all states except Iowa. In Iowa, laboratory-confirmed
cases that were asymptomatic or had clinical information pending, and cases
for which high suspicion for mumps existed but case classification was not
yet determined were classified as suspect.
During the period 1 Jan to 2 May 2006, 11 states reported 2597 cases of
mumps. Eight states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) reported mumps outbreaks with
ongoing local transmission or clusters of cases; 3 states (Colorado,
Minnesota, and Mississippi) reported cases associated with travel from an
outbreak state. The majority of mumps cases (1487 [57 per cent]) were
reported from Iowa; states with the next highest case totals were Kansas
(371), Illinois (224), Nebraska (201), and Wisconsin (176) (Figure 1 [see
URL link above]). Of the 2597 cases reported overall, 1275 (49 per cent)
were classified as confirmed, 915 (35 per cent) as probable, and 287 (11
per cent) as suspect; for 120 (5 per cent) cases, classification was
unknown. Twelve mumps viral isolates from 6 states were characterized; all
were mumps genotype G.
For 2067 (80 per cent) of the 2597 mumps cases with patient age available,
the median age was 21 years (range: less than 1 year to 96 years). In the 8
states with outbreaks, the incidence rate was highest among persons aged 18
to 24 years (17.1 per 100 000 population), followed by persons aged 5 to 17
years (5.2) and 25 to 39 years (4.8) (Figure 2 [see URL link above]). Among
the 2073 patients for whom sex was known, 1244 (60 per cent) were female.
Among the 2073 cases for which week of onset was known, 1426 (69 per cent)
were reported in April (Figure 3 in original text). The peak week of onset
has been April 2 to 8 (week 14) in Iowa and April 16 to 22 (week 16) in
other states.
However, additional cases with onset dates in April continue to be
reported. Parotitis was reported in 870 (66 per cent) of the 1327 patients
for whom such data were available. Data regarding mumps complications and
hospitalizations are incomplete. However, complications have included 27
reports of orchitis, 11 meningitis, 4 encephalitis, 4 deafness, and one
each of oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, and unspecified complications.
A total of 25 hospitalizations were reported, but insufficient data were
provided to determine whether mumps caused all the hospitalizations. No
deaths have been reported.
Vaccination status of reported mumps patients is being ascertained. In
Iowa, preliminary vaccination data were reported through [3 May 2006].***
Among 1192 patients, 69 (6 per cent) were unvaccinated, 141 (12 per cent)
had received 1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 607
(51 per cent) had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the vaccination status
of 375 (31 per cent) patients, the majority of whom were adults who did not
have vaccination records, was unknown. Preliminary data, as of [10 Apr
2006], from 2 mumps outbreaks on college campuses in an Iowa county
affected early in the outbreak, identified attack rates of reported mumps
cases*** of 2.0 per cent (31 of 1542 students) and 3.8 per cent (44 of 1168
students). Preliminary data from vaccine coverage surveys suggest that the
college with the higher attack rate had a smaller proportion (77 per cent
versus 97 per cent) of students documented as having received 2 doses of
MMR vaccine.
As of [10 May 2006], a total of 11 persons potentially infected with mumps
who traveled by aircraft during [26 Mar-25 Apr 2006] had been identified on
33 commercial flights operated by 8 different airlines. Notifications had
either been initiated or completed for persons potentially exposed on all
identified flights. As of [12 May 2006], of about 575 persons potentially
exposed on the flights, 132 had received follow-up greater than 25 days
after their potential exposure. Two cases of mumps were identified,
possibly associated with transmission during air travel. Both cases
occurred among Iowa residents, one of whom was a traveling companion of a
person known to have mumps.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
In the United States, the reported incidence of mumps declined after
introduction of mumps vaccine in 1967 and the recommendation for its
routine use in 1977 (3). After expanded recommendations for a 2-dose MMR
vaccine schedule for measles control in 1989 (3), mumps cases declined
further (Figure 4 [see URL link above]). During the period 2001 to 2003,
fewer than 300 mumps cases were reported each year, a 99 per cent decline
from the 185 691 cases reported in 1968 (2).
The current multistate mumps outbreak, with 2597 cases reported through [2
May 2006], is the largest number of mumps cases reported to CDC in a single
year since 1991, when 4264 cases were reported (2). The first cases in the
current outbreak were detected on a college campus in eastern Iowa in
December 2005; the source of these initial cases is unknown (1). Although
the age group most affected (38 per cent of cases) has been young adults
aged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are college students, the outbreak has
spread to all age groups (1). Multiple factors might have contributed to
the spread of mumps in this outbreak and on college campuses. First, the
college campus environment (such as living in dormitories with frequent and
extended close contact with other students) facilitates transmission of
mumps and other illnesses that are spread through respiratory and oral
secretions. Second, only 25 states***** and the District of Columbia report
a college admission requirement of 2 doses of MMR vaccine, including 3 of
the 11 states with outbreak-associated cases of mumps; no data on
implementation and evaluation of the 2-dose college admission requirement
are available (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). Thus, 2-dose coverage with
mumps-containing vaccine among college students likely is lower than the
median 97 per cent (range: 57 per cent --99 per cent) coverage for
measles-containing vaccine (almost exclusively administered as MMR vaccine)
for students entering elementary school and the median 98 per cent (range:
62 per cent -- 99 per cent) coverage for students entering middle school
reported in 2000 from 38 and 25 states, respectively (4). Third, delayed
recognition and diagnosis of mumps cases might have contributed to the
spread in this outbreak; younger physicians in the United States likely
have not seen mumps, and physicians might not consider the diagnosis in
vaccinated persons. Fourth, 2 doses of MMR vaccine are not 100 per cent
effective in preventing disease, and accumulation of susceptible persons
who were not successfully immunized might be sufficient to sustain
transmission in certain settings. In addition, the vaccine might be less
effective in preventing asymptomatic infection or atypical mumps than in
preventing parotitis, and persons with asymptomatic infection or mild
disease might contribute to transmission. Finally, waning immunity has been
postulated as a contributing factor in this outbreak. Young adults aged
18-24 years would most commonly have received their most recent dose of
mumps-containing vaccine (i.e., MMR vaccine) 6-17 years ago. High
vaccination coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, especially in school-aged
populations in the United States, likely prevented thousands of additional
cases of mumps in this outbreak. Post-licensure studies conducted in the
United States during the period 1973 to 1989 determined that one dose of
mumps or MMR vaccine was 75 to 91 per cent effective in preventing mumps
with parotitis that lasts greater than 2 days (5). Although fewer data are
available on the effectiveness of 2 doses of MMR vaccine against mumps, one
study from the United Kingdom documented vaccine effectiveness of 88 per
cent with 2 doses (6). In a mumps outbreak in a high school in Kansas,
students vaccinated with 1 dose of MMR vaccine had an attack rate 5 times
that of students vaccinated with 2 doses (7). In a mumps outbreak in a
middle school in 1982, before mumps vaccination became widespread, attack
rates of 25 to 49 per cent occurred among unvaccinated students, depending
on how cases were ascertained (8). During the 1986 to 1990, after
widespread implementation of a 1-dose mumps vaccination policy, attack
rates of 2 to 18 per cent (most greater than 6 per cent) were documented in
mumps outbreaks among junior high and high school students with vaccination
coverage of greater than 95 per cent (7,9). In contrast, preliminary data
from 2 colleges in Iowa during the current outbreak identified attack rates
of 2.0 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, with the lower attack rate
in the college with higher 2-dose vaccination coverage.
To prevent mumps, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommends a 2-dose MMR vaccination series for all children, with the first
dose administered at ages 12-15 months and the second dose at ages 4-6
years (3). Two doses of MMR vaccine are recommended for school and college
entry unless the student has other evidence of immunity (3). In a specially
convened meeting on [17 May 2006], ACIP redefined evidence of immunity to
mumps through vaccination as follows: 1 dose of a live mumps virus
vaccine** for preschool children and adults not at high risk; 2 doses for
children in grades K--12 and adults at high risk (i.e., persons who work in
health-care facilities, international travelers, and students at post-high
school educational institutions). Other criteria for evidence of immunity
(i.e., birth before 1957, documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps, or
laboratory evidence of immunity) are unchanged. Furthermore, health-care
facilities should consider recommending 1 dose of MMR vaccine to
unvaccinated health-care workers born before 1957 who do not have other
evidence of mumps immunity.
During an outbreak and depending on the epidemiology of the outbreak (e.g.,
the age groups and/or institutions involved), a 2nd dose of vaccine should
be considered for adults and for children aged 1-4 years who have received
1 dose. The 2nd dose should be administered as early as 28 days after the
first dose, the minimum recommended interval between 2 MMR vaccine doses.
In addition, during an outbreak, health-care facilities should strongly
consider recommending 2 doses of MMR vaccine to unvaccinated workers born
before 1957 who do not have other evidence of mumps immunity. An MMWR
Notice to Readers will be published, summarizing these interim
recommendations in more detail.
Additional means to decrease transmission in outbreak settings include
exclusion of persons without evidence of immunity to mumps from
institutions such as schools and colleges that are affected by the
outbreak. Once vaccinated, students and staff can be readmitted to school
immediately, even if they have been exposed to a case of mumps. The period
of exclusion for those who remain unvaccinated is 26 days after the onset
of parotitis in the last person in the affected institution. Students who
acquire mumps illness should be excluded from school until 9 days after the
onset of parotitis. After an exposure to mumps, unvaccinated health-care
workers without evidence of immunity should be vaccinated and excluded from
duty from the 12th day after the first exposure through the 26th day after
the last exposure. Health-care workers with mumps illness should be
excluded from work until 9 days after the onset of parotitis.
In response to the current outbreak, the Iowa Department of Public Health
(IDPH) issued vaccination recommendations in March targeting college campus
and health-care worker populations at high risk. On 14 Apr, CDC issued a
Health Advisory Notice summarizing vaccine policy recommendations for mumps
prevention and control. In conjunction with local health departments, IDPH
launched a statewide vaccination campaign during 24-26 Apr, targeting
persons aged 18-22 years in the 35 Iowa counties with the state's largest
colleges and universities. In the second phase of the campaign, conducted
2-4 May, vaccination was expanded to the remaining 64 counties, targeting
persons aged 18-25 years. A third phase of the vaccination campaign was
begun 10 May and targets persons aged 18-46 years. Vaccination activities
also are being conducted or planned in Kansas, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
The data presented in this report are preliminary; the case count is likely
to change as additional data become available. Certain reported cases might
not have been caused by mumps; cases in persons without parotitis might
have been masculinized on the basis of serologic tests. Because of the low
number of reported mumps cases during the last decade, laboratorians have
limited experience with mumps tests, particularly IgM antibody tests (10).
Several different mumps IgM antibody tests are in use; however, neither the
sensitivities nor specificities of these tests when used with serum
specimens from either unvaccinated or vaccinated persons have been clearly
defined. Consequently, interpretation of these antibody test results is
difficult, especially in previously vaccinated persons.
Studies to define the sensitivity and specificity of mumps IgM antibody
tests and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests
for mumps virus RNA are in progress. CDC continues to work with state and
local health departments to conduct mumps surveillance, assist with
prevention and control activities, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness,
duration of immunity, and risk factors for mumps illness.

[Despite the monotypic nature of mumps virus, different genetic lineages
exist and co-circulate globally. Genotypes A to J have been defined on the
basis of the nucleotide sequence of the most variable gene, the SH gene.
The different lineages are useful properties for tracking the spread of
mumps virus, but there is no clear association of the different lineages
with different clinical symptoms. This outbreak appears to be homogeneous
in that 12 isolates from 6 of the 11 affected states have been
characterised as genotype G viruses. It has been stated previously that G
genotype mumps virus has been rarely observed in the United States and most
recently has been associated with outbreaks in the United Kingdom. However,
the possibility of introduction of the virus and its spread to neighboring
states within the United States by exposure during airline travel could not
be confirmed conclusively. Only 2 of 575 airline passengers at risk might
potentially have been exposed to virus. - Mod.CP]
