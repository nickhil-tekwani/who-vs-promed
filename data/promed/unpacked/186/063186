Anthrax is revealed in one of the slaughterhouses in Naryn town [Naryn region], locals inform 24.kg news agency.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to them, the slaughterhouse belongs to a certain RO. "However, the owner denied the information and does not want to close the slaughterhouse. Up to now, cattle [are] slaughtered there. Sheep are slaughtered straight on a dirty floor, [with] lack of sanitation. We are concerned that people can become infected," residents say, and [asked] the relevant authorities to look into the matter.

The State Inspection for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Security was unavailable for comment. Recall, in Kyrgyzstan for 7 months in 2015, 10 people were infected with anthrax.

[Naryn is in the center of Kyrgyzstan. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg.

Presumably a sick animal, possibly a bovine, was taken into the slaughterhouse to be slaughtered and butchered, and someone told the veterinary authorities. This indicates that the prior reported outbreak in Ozgorush village in Naryn region is continuing, if not there then in surrounding villages. Their livestock vaccination response will have to be widened. - Mod.MHJ
