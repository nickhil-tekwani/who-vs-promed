A mysterious fever has killed 14 people and infected 37 others in
western Uganda over the last 3 months, a Health Ministry official
said on Friday [16 Nov 2007]. Sam Okware said the fever, though
deadly, was not hemorrhagic. Blood samples from it had already tested
negative for the killer Marburg virus that infected 3 people in a
nearby district in August [2007], killing one.

Victims of the fever in Uganda's Bundibugyo District, on the border
with Democratic Republic of Congo, [DRC] died not from bleeding but
from dehydration because of severe diarrhoea. All had complained of
fever and abdominal pains before dying. "We're investigating but we
really don't know what it is," Okware said. "We tested for Marburg,
thank God it was negative. It is most likely a virus, but we haven't
identified it." Okware said the disease was unlikely to be Rift
Valley fever, which has killed 96 people in neighbouring Sudan. "It
could also be leptospirosis, which comes from contact with rodents,
or typhus fever. [Neither of these diseases is a viral disease. -
Mod.CP]. There are a lot of funny viruses in those mountains," he
said. New cases were still emerging regularly. "It is not at all
contained," he said.

In 2000, Uganda was hit by an epidemic of the deadly Ebola virus, in
which those infected often bleed to death. It infected 425 people,
just over half of whom died.

[Marburg virus infection has been excluded now by laboratory testing.
Furthermore the occurrence of a similar hemorrhagic fever is unlikely
on the basis of symptomatology. The cause of the outbreak remains
obscure and the evidence for involvement of a viral agent is not
strong. Many possibilities remain in view of a previously suggested
association between rodent abundance in the environment and the
disease, and also the predominance on patients of symptoms of
dehydration and diarrhea. Further information is requested.
