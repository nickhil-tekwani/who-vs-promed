According to information supplied by the State Veterinary
Surveillance Center, a fox shot near at a lake about 3 km from
Liskovo was found to be rabid. Another incident occurred in a village
in the same area. A fox entered a private dwelling and was shot. The
animal was confirmed to be rabid. As a consequence additional
vaccination is being carried out in Liskovo. The most recent case of
rabies occurred at the beginning of November 2006 in the Gaginsk
region and involved a horse.

A case of human rabies has been recorded in the Mosal district of the
region of Kaluga. According to a Mosal newspaper a local man from the
village of Gulino contracted rabies from a dead fox as a result of
skinning the animal without adequate protection. The victim was not
wearing protective gloves. Medical assistance was sought only 21 days
after exposure.
This summer in one of the villages close to Mosal a cat was found to
be rabid and 5 people were vaccinated as a precaution.

Recently a rabid fox was found near Tolyatti. It was observed on Mon
27 Nov 2006 at the side of a road. A car driver stopped to take the
animal to the nearest veterinary clinic and was bitten while trying
to catch the animal. The driver was able to restrain the animal and
later deliver it to a nearby veterinary clinic, where rabies was
immediately suspected. By Wed 29 Nov 2006 the preliminary rabies
diagnosis was confirmed and the animal died shortly afterwards.
It is presumed that the car driver received post-exposure treatment
(vaccination), but this has not been confirmed.

[Travellers visiting areas outside the major cities should be aware
that rabies is rife in wild mammals throughout Russia and care should
be exercised in approaching both wild and domestic animals. Medical
attention for post-exposure vaccination should be sought immediately
if any injury or contact is sustained. - Mod.CP]
