RIYADH - The number of Saudi dead from Rift Valley Fever, which struck the
Saudi-Yemen border area in early September, has climbed to 88 the Health
Ministry said yesterday. "Three more deaths have been recorded in the Saudi
Kingdom [since the last report on Tue 23 Oct 2000," said a statement
released in Riyadh. The Ministry said 450 people have contracted the virus
[compared with the figure of 443 given on 23 Oct 2000, but 346 have been
able to leave hospital after recovering.
The virus has also struck neighbouring Yemen, where a statement from the
Health And Agriculture Ministries said "97 people have died and 1797
animals have perished". [This compares with a figure of 71 deaths quoted in
a report in The Times of India on Tue 24 Oct 2000. - Mod.CP The 2 Yemeni
Ministries have urged the World Health Organisation and the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organisation to help Yemen fend off this epidemic. The
World Health Organisation has launched an appeal for $975 000 to help boost
international efforts to counter the disease in Yemen.

Rift Valley Fever in Saudi Arabia & Yemen: Update
-------------------------------------------------
SANA'A/RIYADH- The [total death toll from Rift Valley fever has risen to
[at least 182 in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, after 28 new fatalities were
reported, official news agencies said yesterday. Yemen's news agency Saba
said the disease had killed 97 people in the Yemen and was spreading outside
Hodeidah province where it broke out last month.
Reports of fresh RVF cases have sent shock waves throughout Yemen as the
Sanaa government called for international help to combat the deadly fever.
Saba said 706 people had contracted the disease, which is transmitted from
infected livestock to humans through contact or by mosquitoes. It said 9000
animals had been infected.
The Saudi Press Agency said that as of yesterday, the viral disease had
claimed 85 lives in the Kingdom. SPA said a total of 443 people had been
diagnosed with the disease in the Kingdom, of whom 220 had been cured. Yemen
and Saudi Arabia have co-operated in using planes to spray mosquito-infested
areas along their common border.

[Taking these 2 reports together it appears that as of 26 Oct 2000 the
Rift Valley fever outbreak in Saudi Arabia has affected a total of 450
people, of whom 346 have recovered, 88 have died, and 16 remain ill. In the
Yemen the corresponding totals appear to be 706 affected, 220 recovered, 97
died and 389 still ill. The outbreak thus appears to be less
well-controlled in the Yemen than in Saudi Arabia.
There are no figures for affected animals in Saudi Arabia, whereas in Yemen
approximately 9000 animals have been affected, with the loss of 1797
animals. - Mod.CP
