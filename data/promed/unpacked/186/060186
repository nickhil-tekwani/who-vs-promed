[A] Case summary <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_06_20/en/>
There were no new probable cases today. Case totals stand as follows: 8461
total cases, 804 deaths, 7218 recovered. The most recent probable cases
anywhere were 2 reported from Taiwan yesterday (19 Jun 2003).
[B] Update 85 - WHO case definition for diagnostic purposes, Hong Kong
close to being removed from list of areas with local transmission

WHO case definition for diagnostic purposes
An article published in this week's British Medical Journal (BMJ) has
questioned whether the WHO case definitions for suspected and probable SARS
are adequate to pick up infected cases at the earliest stage when patients
are said to be most infectious <http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7403/1354>.
[BMJ 2003; 326: 1354-8, June 21: WHO guidelines for detecting SARS need to
be reconsidered: The WHO guidelines for diagnosing SARS have an 83 per cent
accuracy in detecting suspected cases. In an observational study of 556
people screened for SARS in Hong Kong, Timothy Rainer and colleagues found
that the best predictor of SARS was radiological evidence of pneumonic
change, which often preceded the onset of fever. The main discriminatory
symptoms in the early stages of the disease were fever, chills, malaise,
myalgia, and rigor -- not respiratory tract symptoms, as stated in the WHO
guidelines. The guidelines had a specificity of 95 per cent and a
sensitivity of 26 per cent for detecting SARS.]
The WHO case definition takes a "wide net" approach, and is intended to
assist in the identification and prompt isolation of any person who might
have been exposed to the SARS virus. WHO continues to recommend that
suspect cases be immediately isolated and remain so until either a probable
diagnosis is made or another agent is determined to be the cause.
While this definition has worked well to contain the outbreak in this
initial emergency response, WHO is fully aware that a more precise
definition is needed for longer term surveillance.
Pending the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test, case
definitions, based on an evaluation of symptoms and history of possible
contact with a SARS patient, remain the only way to find possibly infected
persons and reduce opportunities for further spread. WHO therefore welcomes
the BMJ study, which suggests that additional symptoms might contribute to
a more sensitive definition. However, this is a single study based on
patients presenting at a single hospital. Moreover, by inclusion of
symptoms such as diarrhoea, this definition risks picking up even more
false positive cases.
During the Kuala Lumpur global conference on SARS, WHO established a
working group specifically charged to develop better case definitions. The
group will draw on data from all the main outbreak sites.
"WHO regards an improved diagnostic test as a top priority," said David
Heymann, WHO's executive director for communicable diseases. "The next
influenza season will result in a large number of patients with symptoms
easily confused with SARS. In addition to a good diagnostic test, a more
precise and sensitive case definition is absolutely essential to keep
health services from being overwhelmed. We will be producing this as an
international collaborative effort, based on the best available evidence."
Dr Heymann estimates that SARS surveillance will need to continue for at
least a year. WHO recommendations for surveillance and reporting are also
being revised for this second phase, which moves from an emergency response
to sustainable vigilance.
Hong Kong close to being removed from list
On Sunday 22 June, 20 days will have passed since the last probable case of
SARS in Hong Kong was placed in isolation on 2 June. If no new cases are
detected over the weekend, Hong Kong will be removed from the list of areas
with recent local transmission on Monday.
Both WHO and health authorities in Hong Kong are taking a cautious approach
to what would be a very significant achievement in the history of SARS
control. WHO was given details today about a suspect SARS case who has been
in isolation since 9 June. The results of 3 PCR tests have been negative.
Serology tests, conducted 20 days after the onset of symptoms, have also
been negative.
Today's report on this case confers another layer of assurance that
surveillance remains intense and that new cases continue to be quickly
detected and isolated. As Hong Kong scientists and laboratories rank among
the best in the world, WHO has full confidence that the case in question is
not SARS.
Removal from the list means that the chain of person to person transmission
has been broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local
residents and travellers. On 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider
postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was
removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May. Travel recommendations are
presently in place only for Beijing, China.

[While the BMJ paper is only one study, the finding of a sensitivity of 26
per cent would suggest that a more sensitive case definition should be used
for screening purposes (for example, to determine which patients should be
placed in respiratory isolation and which should receive further testing).
As the WHO commentary points out, any such broadening of the case
definition will necessarily reduce the specificity of the definition until
better rapid testing methodologies become available. - Mod.LM]
