Mildew hits maize in TN
-----------------------
Maize production in Tamil Nadu (TN), which accounts for 83 per cent of the
country's maize production, has been hit by the downy mildew disease,
according to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

India has the world's 5th largest maize acreage with over 7 million
hectares (17.3 million acres) and it is the 3rd most important cereal. This
year [2008], maize production has been hit in Coimbatore, Udumalapet,
Darapuram, Odanchatram, Dindigul, and Theni, the major districts that
cultivate maize, due to the infestation of downy mildew disease.

The downy mildew group of fungi is seedborne. It affects plant development
as infestation is at the early stage (30 days) of crop development. The
disease could intensify when the relative humidity is high and could be a
major constraint in maize production, according to university's release.

Maize has gained in popularity with farmers in Tamil Nadu as a more
remunerative crop and simple management practices, and farmers have begun
to cultivate 2-3 crops in a year. Continuous cropping and congenial
environment has led to development of pests.

Grapes may turn sour for growers
--------------------------------
Grape output in northern Karnataka could fall by 25-30 per cent because of
a destructive fungal disease brought on by cold night temperatures.
Grapevines in the region have been afflicted by downy mildew as night
temperatures fall below 20 deg C (68 deg F), leaving farmers hoping for
warmer weather.

Grape growers told ET that the ideal night temperature for the fruit during
winter should be 22-25 deg C (71.6-77 deg F). "If the cold night conditions
persist, yield is bound to fall," a grape grower said.

While farmers are taking precautions to prevent the spread of downy mildew
by spraying fungicides, the cost of treatment has almost doubled.
Water-soluble fungicides, which used to cost INR 1200-1300 [about USD
25.3-27.4] for a 25-kg pack (55 lb) now cost INR 2200-2300 [USD 46.4-48.5]

[Downy mildews are important maize pathogens in many tropical regions of
the world. They are particularly destructive in Asia, where losses in
excess of 70 per cent have been documented. Around 10 different species of
downy mildew fungi in the genera _Peronosclerospora_, _Sclerospora_, and
_Sclerophthora_ have been reported to affect maize. In India, a number of
these pathogens occur, but _P. sorghi_ (sorghum downy mildew) and
_Sclerophthora rayssiae_ (brown stripe downy mildew) are considered common.

Symptoms of the different downy mildew species on maize are similar,
although they can vary with plant age, climatic conditions, and host
germplasm. Infection at the seedling stage results in stunting, chlorosis,
and premature plant death. Infection of older plants results in leaf
symptoms of mottling, chlorotic streaking, lesions, and may produce white
striped leaves that eventually shred. 'Downy' growth often occurs on leaves
and is more common on the lower leaf surface. Plants may be stunted, tiller
excessively, have malformed tassels and ears, and may not produce seed.

On grapevine, downy mildew is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara viticola_.
It causes lesions on leaves, which later become necrotic, and can also
affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm, extended wet periods during
bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. The disease
can cause severe crop losses.

Downy mildew spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain,
wind, or mechanical means. The fungi survive between crops on infected
plant material or alternate weed hosts. Some of the maize pathogens can
also be seedborne, although this is largely restricted to seed that is
fresh and has a high moisture content. Downy mildews are usually controlled
with fungicides.
