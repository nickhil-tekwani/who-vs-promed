Reynolds CJ, Pade C, Gibbons JM, et al. Immune boosting by B.1.1.529 (omicron) depends on previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Science. 2022; 10.1126/science.abq1841
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
The omicron, or Pango lineage B.1.1.529, variant of SARS-CoV-2 carries multiple spike mutations with high transmissibility and partial neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape. Vaccinated individuals show protection from severe disease, often attributed to primed cellular immunity. We investigated T and B cell immunity against B.1.1.529 in triple mRNA vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW) with different SARS-CoV-2 infection histories. B and T cell immunity against previous variants of concern was enhanced in triple vaccinated individuals, but the magnitude of T and B cell responses against B.1.1.529 spike protein was reduced. Immune imprinting by infection with the earlier B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant resulted in less durable binding antibody against B.1.1.529. Previously infection-na√Øve HCW who became infected during the B.1.1.529 wave showed enhanced immunity against earlier variants, but reduced nAb potency and T cell responses against B.1.1.529 itself. Previous Wuhan Hu-1 infection abrogated T cell recognition and any enhanced cross-reactive neutralizing immunity on infection with B.1.1.529.

Hybrid immune damping -- omicron infection doesn't boost immunity in people previously infected during the 1st wave -- immunity against SARS-CoV-2 imprinted by previous infection history

"That previous #SARSCoV2 infection history can imprint such a profound, negative impact on subsequent protective immunity is an unexpected consequence of COVID-19" -- @BoytonRosemary, @Daltmann10, and colleagues @ScienceMagazine

[Essentially, this means that people with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection infected with omicron variant develop enhanced cross reactive immunity to previous variants; alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants, in both the B and T cell immunity arms.

However, in subsequent exposures, there is reduced boosting against the omicron spike protein itself. In healthcare workers, who had previously been infected with the alpha variant, there was a less sustained antibody response against omicron. People infected during the 1st wave of the pandemic and later with omicron lacked any immune boosting, the study found. This may partially explain why breakthrough and repeat infections have been a common feature of the omicron wave of the pandemic, even among people who have been triple vaccinated.

Even though the authors have emphasized that vaccination remains effective against severe disease they caution that the impact of multiple reinfections on long term health, including long COVID, is not known. -Mod.UBA]

- The Americas region reported 29.3% of cases and 41.4 % of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 159.77 million cases, 2nd to the European region, the most severely affected region. The USA (114 807) reported the highest number of cases, followed by Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Panama, and Aruba. Peru reported more than 500, but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 47.0% of cases and 40.0% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 223.28 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Turkey, Ukraine, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland (6 cases), and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 13 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, 5 countries reported more than 10 000, 8 countries reported over 1000 cases, and 3 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries: the USA (209 617), Brazil (68 769), France (51 954), Germany (37 291), Italy (32 809), North Korea (26 020), the UK (25 300), Australia (23 282), Portugal (20 041), Japan (16 555), India (14 090), and Chile (10 648), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2190 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Jun 2022 to late 14 Jun 2022).

A total of 39 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 14 of the 39 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 7 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 6.4%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an a 8.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 0.26% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.48 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 542.52 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.33 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
