Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in these cases)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
