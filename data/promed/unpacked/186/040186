CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS & REPEATED GI OUTBREAKS (4)
===================================================
This is in response to the request for info about Clostridium
perfringens posted on Jan 19.

In a study of elderly long stay hospitalized patients by Stringer
MF, et. al. (Faecal carriage of Clostridium perfringens. J. Hyg.
(Camb.) (1985) vol 95, p 277-288), weekly stool samples were obtained
over 14 weeks. C. perfringens at levels exceeding 10 to the sixth
organisms/gram was found in 36% of the patients. This was not the
case for younger people. I have not looked for more recent
studies.
On the other hand, we have identified foodborne C. perfringens
outbreaks in nursing homes in Washington State. However, there
was epidemiologic as well as laboratory data to support that
conclusion.
Because most patients at an institution eat the same food, it is
frequently difficult to epidemiologically implicate a food.
However, this sometimes can be done, by looking for the presence
or absense of disease in employees, patients on special diets, or
in patients who were served at different times.
