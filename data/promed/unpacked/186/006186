The 1st case of Heartland virus, a tickborne illness, has been reported in Illinois, according to a press release from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). A Kankakee resident recently tested positive for Heartland virus. Reported cases of Heartland virus disease are relatively rare. Likely spread by the Lone Star tick, more than 30 cases of Heartland virus disease have been reported in the midwestern and southern USA.

Heartland virus was first identified in 2009 when 2 Missouri farmers who had been bitten by ticks were admitted to a hospital. Almost all individuals with Heartland virus have been hospitalized. Although most people infected have fully recovered, a few have died. There are no vaccines to prevent Heartland virus infections.

Signs and symptoms of infection are like those of other tickborne diseases and can include fever, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches and diarrhea. Most people have reported becoming sick about 2 weeks after being bit by a tick. There is no treatment, but doctors can treat some of the symptoms. If you have been bitten by a tick and think you may have Heartland virus or another tickborne illness, visit a health care provider. Other tickborne illnesses Illinois residents have been diagnosed with include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis and tularemia.

Ticks are commonly found on the tips of grasses and shrubs. Ticks crawl; they cannot fly or jump. The tick will wait in the grass or shrub for a person or animal to walk by and then climb aboard. Some ticks will attach quickly, and others will wander, looking for places like the ear or other areas where the skin is thinner.

Simple tips to avoid tick bites include the following:
- Wear light-colored, protective clothing -- long-sleeved shirts, pants, boots or sturdy shoes and a head covering. Treat clothing with products containing 0.5% permethrin.
- Apply insect repellent that contains 20% or more DEET, picaridin or IR3535 on exposed skin for protection that lasts several hours.
- Walk in the center of trails so grass, shrubs and weeds do not brush against you.
- Check yourself, children, other family members and pets for ticks every 2 to 3 hours.
- Remove any tick promptly by grasping it with tweezers, as close to the skin as possible, and gently, but firmly, pulling it straight out. Wash your hands and the tick bite site with soap and water.

Additional information about ticks can be found on the IDPH website (http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/environmental-health-protection/structural-pest-control/common-ticks#publications). A map of the geographical location of heartland virus cases is also available on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/heartland-virus/statistics/index.html).

[The case of Heartland virus infection adds Illinois to the list of states where the infection has occurred. This is not surprising, as neighboring states of Missouri and Indiana have had cases. People become infected with Heartland virus through the bite of the Lone Star tick [_Amblyomma americanum_]. Patients are most likely to be diagnosed with Heartland virus infections from May to September. Heartland virus causes a flulike illness, including fever, headache, muscle aches, diarrhea, appetite loss, and tiredness. The advice for avoidance of tick bites listed above is prudent not only to avoid Heartland virus infections but other tickborne pathogens as well.

As noted previously, a variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found signs that Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes, and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose. Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10% to 18% of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties. These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response. - Mod.TY
