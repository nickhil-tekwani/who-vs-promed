The anthrax scare has come back to Bandipur Tiger Reserve this summer [2018]. At least 10 head of cattle died due to this disease at Shivapura village over the past 2 weeks. This small village in Gundlupet taluk, 8 km [approx. 5 mi] from Melkammanahalli at the entrance to Bandipura Tiger Reserve, has triggered alarm among villagers and wildlife activists as the disease can infect humans as well as mammals.

In 2013, there was panic among forest officers after the death of cattle on the forest fringes due to anthrax. Even though the disease did not claim any wildlife that year, in 2004, elephants had died at Nagarahole Tiger Reserve and in Sathyamangalam forest bordering the BRT tiger reserve.

The disease was first noticed after 2 head of cattle belonging to L and one each of Sh & Su died in the village. Later, 6 head of cattle belonging to villagers Ma, Pr, Si, PS and Ch died in the past week. There was one death on [Mon 14 May 2018] too. All the cattle were cross-breeds. A few died in neighbouring Hundipura village.

After the disease was detected, health and animal husbandry department officials started vaccination. Gundlupet government veterinary officer Dr. Mallesh said due to drought over the past few years, the disease has spread. "Villagers may have buried dead animals near the lakes. As there was rain over the past few days, bacterial spores in the soil may have spread with rain water. As cattle graze near the lake, the disease spreads," he said.

Livestock anthrax is a chronic enzootic problem in Karnataka, and controlled with difficulty. Reading between the lines of this report it is clear that a number of villages are afflicted and possibly the number of cattle dead is twice that reported so far. The anthrax spores are hydrophobic and therefore could easy be floated to the soil surface as a result of the rains. The rain will have encouraged grazing growth and cattle graze by pulling up the plants, thereby consuming some 6 lbs of soil per day. And if that soil contains anthrax spores, cases may follow. And the rain may have sparked a hatch of biting flies, which will add to the problems. - Mod.MHJ
