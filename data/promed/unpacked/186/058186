WEST NILE VIRUS: PERSISTENT INFECTION (2): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

[A thoughtful ProMED-mail subscriber raised the following interesting
question in response to the post (ProMED archive no. 20091209.4194)
reporting West Nile virus persistence in kidneys of patients 6 years
after acute infection. ProMED requests receipt of any information
relating to transmission of West Nile virus via organ transplants. - Mod.TY]

What risk does this pose to organ donations? The CDC information on
West Nile states that organ donations are not screened for West Nile
Virus, although blood donations are. If the kidneys are "reservoirs"
for the virus, then could donor recipients get the disease if these
kidneys are transplanted?
