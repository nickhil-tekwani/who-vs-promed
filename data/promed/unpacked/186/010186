PNG: 5 die from turtle meat poisoning
-------------------------------------
5 people died on Rambutso Island in Papua New Guinea's Manus Province after
eating turtle meat at a feast during New Year celebrations. A further 4
people are still in hospital at the Panuselu Health Centre in the area.
Manus Provincial Administrator, Wep Kanawi, says he had received a report
on the matter from the Officer-in-Charge of the Health Centre in Manus. The
report stated that 33 Mouklen people on Rambutso feasted on the meat,
liver, and soup of the loggerhead turtle.
Mr Kanawi quoted the report, saying that people began to experience extreme
stomach aches and vomiting within a few hours of eating the turtle. He said
most of them, who ate only the meat, discharged all toxic material from
their bodies through vomiting and are now okay. But Mr Kanawi said that the
4 men and a woman who drank the soup and ate the liver and other intestinal
parts have died.
He also announced that his officers are going to the island to conduct
further investigations, and collect the bones and other parts of the turtle
for further laboratory tests.

[There has been concern that, because hawkbill turtles consume some
poisonous sponges, hawkbill meat may be toxic. There is a similar concern
regarding leatherbacks' consumption of jellyfish. But neither suspicion has
been scientifically proven. This article reports consumption of meat from a
loggerhead.
Further, as those who ate only meat were able to vomit and rid themselves
of the toxin, it suggests that the toxin was more bioavailable in the
liquid form -- the soup. It may be that the meat was not the primary source
of toxin. - Mod.TG]
