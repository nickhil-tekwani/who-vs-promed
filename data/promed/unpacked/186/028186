Advice on dealing with a newly emerging strain of salmonella in sheep has been issued by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), following identification in 2 UK flocks.

The outbreaks were classified by Public Health England as Salmonella typhimurium t5 3225, which has left sheep appearing "dull with diarrhoea" and has resulted in high mortality.

The strain can affect pigs, horses, dogs, cattle and wildlife, as well as humans, with the cause of the outbreak currently unknown.

In a statement, the APHA said proper hygiene when cooking meat was essential to stop cross-contamination and infection in humans.

Veterinarians have advised that good biosecurity and flock health practices are key to keeping the bacterium from infecting flocks.

Veterinary advice should also be sought on antibiotic treatment options. A vaccine is available in cattle, but little is known about its use and it is not licensed in sheep.

SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] Consulting Veterinary Services investigation officer Katrina Henderson told Farmers Weekly that biosecurity measures are critical to keep the strain off farms.

She said the organism can be introduced by infected livestock, equipment, machinery, personnel, contaminated feed, watercourses, birds and rodents.

"Stressors and reduced feed intake can predispose animals to infection," she said. "Wet weather, transport, alterations in diet, worm burdens, and poor nutrition will all increase the likelihood of clinical disease."

- Avoid purchasing as much as possible and buy from known sources. Avoid multiple sources.
- Good cleaning and disinfection are required (see "Cleaning and disinfection," below).
- Protect feed stores from rodents and birds where possible, and ensure that clean water is available. Limit the number of people and machinery entering the farm, and ensure good cleaning and disinfection of any unavoidable entries.

[The issue was addressed in ProMED-mail archive nos. 20190310.6358667 and 20181021.6103699. A relevant letter was published on 13 Nov 2018 in the weekly Veterinary Record. It was submitted by Amanda Carson, APHA Penrith, and Rob Davies, APHA Weybridge:

"Scanning surveillance activities in 2017 identified a potential new strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium following postmortem examination of sheep in a flock where a high level of mortality had occurred; 207 sheep had died over one month from a group of 512 sheep. In 2018, a 2nd incident was identified by the APHA with the same _S._ Typhimurium strain, and clinical signs in sheep included depression, diarrhoea, and death. This new strain of _S._ Typhimurium is different to previous outbreak strains in the UK and does not usually conform to a recognised phage type (RDNC) or is untypable (UNTY). It is sensitive to all antibiotics in the APHA panel. Public Health England (PHE) has classified this outbreak cluster as _S._ Typhimurium t5. 3225 on the basis of whole genome sequencing.

Isolates within this cluster vary by a maximum of 5 single nucleotide polymorphism mutations (SNPs), which is considered to be a reliable threshold for identification of isolates that are epidemiologically related within the context of a human disease outbreak. Examination of the genetic relationship of these strains (phylogeny) to others on record at PHE suggests that this strain is unusual in the UK, and the relatively low level of genetic diversity also suggests that it has only recently emerged from an unknown source.

Human cases of _S._ Typhimurium have been linked to consumption of lamb and mutton. An increase in cases of this particular type of _Salmonella_ 1st arose in July 2017. A number of control measures were put into place throughout the food chain, which were followed by a significant decline in cases from the end of that year until June 2018. A total of 118 cases were reported up until May 2018. Since June 2018, a further 165 cases have been reported (up to 19 Oct 2018).

The Food Standard Agency (FSA) has contacted food business operators, reminding them to maintain high hygiene standards during slaughter and processing, and joint FSA/PHE advice on handling and cooking raw meat has been placed on https://www.gov.uk/, with a particular emphasis on sheep meat. Consumers are reminded to cook meat properly, wash their hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, and avoid cross-contamination of other foods, surfaces, and utensils in the kitchen (https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/advice-on-cooking-raw-meat-following-rise-in-salmonella-typhimurium).

In the cases involving sheep, mortality was high in groups of cull various livestock markets for fattening before onward consignment for slaughter. Veterinarians have a vital role to play in surveillance and to look out for cases of high mortality in ewes or sheep flocks (or cattle herds) with a high level of diarrhoea. Human illness in farm staff or family members may also be associated, but the APHA should still be informed even in the absence of this. The APHA provides a ZO2 sample submission form when cases of Salmonella are identified, and it is vital that the information requested on this form is returned to the APHA to enable a risk assessment to be undertaken.

Postmortem services are available at APHA veterinary investigation centres and at postmortem facilities operated by partners working on our behalf. Together, we provide a surveillance network across England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."

From the current report, it appears that 2 new outbreaks of the described zoonotic pathogen have recently been recorded in UK's sheep flocks, the location of which not disclosed. This warrants alertness among sheep breeders, veterinarians and public/animal health authorities throughout the UK. - Mod.AS
