"WHO to Urge Bar on CJD-Risk Blood Donors" Financial Times (03/27/97) P.4;
Williams, Frances:
The World Health Organization reportedly will recommend barring those groups
at higher risk of having Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD) from donating blood.
The decision resulted from a three-day meeting in Geneva convened to look at
medicine and blood-product safety in light of findings on the transmission
of bovine spongiform encepalophathy disease--"mad cow disease"--and the
possibility of its link to a new variant of the brain-wasting disease CJD.
While experts determined they have no proof that CJD can be transmitted via
blood transfusions, they said there is potential risk. Three groups known to
have higher-than-normal incidences of normal CJD are people treated with
contaminated growth hormone early in the 1980s; people who have had brain or
other surgery in which duramater was used to patch tissue; and families of
CJD sufferers.
