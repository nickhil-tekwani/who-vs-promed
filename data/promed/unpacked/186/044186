The health official, in charge of cholera division, Anatercia

The reported cases were mostly associated with residents of Kashila

A total of 17 people from Rugombo commune in Cibitoke province have
been quarantined in the hospital due to cholera. These patients are
getting treatment free of charge.
There is a lack of clean water in Rugombo. In some areas, the
population has to walk long distances to get clean water. The
state-owned water and electricity company, REGIDESO, has closed
public fountains. The population draws its water from dirty rivers
that flow through this commune.
Other outbreaks of cholera were recently announced in Nyanza Lac in
the south of Burundi, but they have been brought under control.
