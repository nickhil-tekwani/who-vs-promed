Customers of McDonald's, located at 2000 McFarland Blvd, Northport (Tuscaloosa County) may have been exposed to hepatitis A virus through an infected employee. If you visited this McDonald's at any time on 14 Mar 2012, or during breakfast hours on 16 Mar 2012, please contact your health care provider as soon as possible. If you do not have a health care provider, you may contact the Tuscaloosa County Health Department at (205) 562-6900.

According to Dr. Donald Williamson, State Health Officer, "Hepatitis A vaccine and immune globulin can prevent hepatitis A virus infection, but only when given within 14 days of exposure." Therefore, individuals exposed on 14 or 16 Mar 2012 should receive treatment no later than this Fri 30 Mar 2012. Individuals previously vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine are considered protected from this exposure.

Customers visiting this McDonald's between 28 Feb 2012 and 14 Mar 2012 may have been exposed and become ill. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis A virus infection appear 2 to 6 weeks after exposure and commonly include mild fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, pain in the upper right side of the abdomen, dark urine, light stools, and jaundice (yellowness of eyes or skin). The disease varies in severity, from mild cases lasting 2 weeks or less to more severe cases lasting 4 to 6 weeks or longer. If you become ill, please contact your health care provider immediately.

Hepatitis A virus spreads when a person ingests contaminated food or water or is exposed to contaminated objects. Persons are at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus when they have been in close and continuous contact with an infected individual, particularly in a household. Frequent, thorough handwashing with warm water and soap for 20 seconds is key to stopping the spread of hepatitis A virus. Handwashing should include the back of the hands, wrists, between fingers and under fingernails (Source: Alabama Department of Public Health).

[Hepatitis A viruses are resistant to elevated temperature and low pH and can persist in the environment on contaminated surfaces for long periods. Hepatitis A vaccine has been licensed in the United States for use in persons 12 months of age and older. The vaccine is recommended (before exposure to hepatitis A virus) for persons who are more likely to get hepatitis A virus infection or are more likely to get seriously ill if they do get hepatitis A.

This alert is directed to people who visited a MacDonald's and are at risk of having contracted infection through contact with a hepatitis A virus infected employee. The circumstances are unexplained, and other people may be at risk who did not visit this MacDonald's but have or will have contact with the infected employee. The alert should surely be extended to cover such people.
