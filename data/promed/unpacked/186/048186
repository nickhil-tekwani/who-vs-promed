Viet Nam rice troubles could affect region: expert
--------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's farm sector is reeling from outbreaks of pests and disease
that could threaten its neighbours including China, according to one
of the world's leading rice experts. Hanoi and the world scientific
community have yet to find a way to prevent another crop failure
following a virus attack on rice crops, said Robert Zeigler, head of
the International Rice Research Institute [IRRI; Philippines].

Viet Nam is the 5th-largest rice producer and number 3 exporter in
the world, and the troubles hit some of the best rice-growing areas,
Zeigler said. "They got taken by surprise and had some significant
yield losses that they were just not expecting. Of course we are
concerned about Viet Nam. But some of these pests can migrate up into
China, and who knows if they could cause some serious problems?"

He noted that, while China is not a key player in the international
rice trade, the country is by far the world's largest producer and
consumer of the grain. Viet Nam also lies close to Thailand, the
world's top rice exporter, and rich rice-growing areas in Myanmar and
Cambodia. The severe winter in China and other climatic troubles have
helped lead to spiralling prices, with many nations relying on
Vietnamese exports. Prices have soared to more than 700 dollars a
tonne, more than 3 times the rate of 5 years ago.

Along with other disasters, the Vietnamese problems -- a viral
disease called tungro and infestations of the brown planthopper
insect -- have also led to global supplies being drained. Zeigler
said it was still not clear why the pest and virus attacks had swept
across the southern and central regions of Viet Nam. "(Farmers) did
shift varieties and the way they managed them, and so we're still
trying to sort out whether it was some change in the [viral] strain
or it was the change in the management practices, or both," he said.

Zeigler said nations in the region and across the world needed to
invest more in agricultural research, now that the vast yield gains
seen since the 1960s have begun to flatten out. "Certainly the kinds
of things that took (Viet Nam) by surprise are areas of work that
IRRI had to cut back on because of budget cuts," he said.

Pests damage Mekong rice fields
--------------------------------
More than 100 000 ha of rice fields in Mekong Delta provinces have
been infested by the brown planthopper. According to the Mekong Delta
Agriculture and Rural Development Department, the disease spread
quickly this year due to weather changes, particularly unseasonable
rains in the south.

The provinces of Long An, Dong Thap, Bac Lieu and An Giang have been
affected the most. Pests in Bac Lieu Province early this month
damaged 21 000 ha, with about 16 000 pests per square metre in the
fields in Hong Dan District. Bac Lieu Province has distributed over
10 000 tonnes of pesticide to local farmers in the past days.

The brown planthopper is known as the most devastating of rice pests,
as the fly-like brown insect inserts its sucking mouth into the soft
tissue of plants, extracting plant sap. The result is a field that is
susceptible to disease. After the outbreak in southern provinces
early this year [2008], many farmers uprooted plants and sprayed
fields with a mixture of different kinds of insecticides several
times a week. "This isn't proper and too much insecticide will harm
rice fields for the next crop and kill other insects that are
actually good for the fields," Nguyen Huu An, director of An Giang
Province's Vegetation Protection Office, said. The Mekong Delta's
Vegetation Protection Department predicted that new pest offsprings
will emerge on rice fields, bringing viruses that cause ragged stunt
rice disease.

Prof. Vo Tong Xuan, director of An Giang University, said farmers
would be provided with pest-resistant rice strains for cultivation.
"They also need to be armed with knowledge on modern farming
technology and the proper use of chemicals to protect their plants," he said.

[Several epidemics of planthoppers and leafhoppers infesting rice
crops and spreading virus diseases have been reported from this area
in recent years. The Asian brown planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_)
is reported to have reached very high numbers. It is one of the worst
pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region and is
also the vector of _Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV) mentioned above,
as well as _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV). A number of other rice
viruses are spread by the green rice leafhopper (_Nephotettix
virescens_) including _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_ and _Rice
tungro spherical virus_ (which together cause tungro disease), and
_Rice yellow stunt virus_. Crop losses of up to 100 percent due to
some virus diseases, for example tungro, have been reported.

Infectious vector insects transported on air currents or by people
movements can spread the viruses over long distances. Disease
management includes vector control, cultural practices to minimise
inoculum, and the use of rice varieties resistant to the vector, the
virus, or both. Cultivars resistant to the vectors have usually low
virus disease incidence.

At least 15 viruses are known to affect rice, and many of these occur
in Asia. A number of them are spread by different species of plant-
or leafhoppers. Virus disease problems seem to have been accentuated
worldwide by the introduction of modern agricultural techniques,
double cropping and high yielding rice cultivars. The pathogens may
have been present, but rarely reached epidemic proportions under
traditional cropping systems when average rice yield was low.
Intensified cultivation and increased use of agrochemicals have also
enhanced the possibilities for the emergence of more virulent strains
of both viruses and vectors.
