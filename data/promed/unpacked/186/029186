Peru: Rabid vampire bats kill 11 in southeast
-----------------------------------------------
Eleven people, 4 of them children, have died since Christmas Day in Peru's
southeastern artisan mining districts after being bitten by rabid bats,
health officials said on [Tue 30 Jan 2007].
Officials say victims in the Madre de Dios and Puno departments of Peru
were bitten by what they believe were the same bats and infected with
rabies. "There are 11 cases who had rabies and passed away. The diagnoses
have been [confirmed]," said Carlos Contreras, regional health director in
Madre de Dios province.
He said other people who had reported bat bites in the region were
vaccinated against rabies even if they weren't showing symptoms of the
disease. Contreras said many of the victims were poor people who slept in
open areas. He said other people in the region had been instructed on how
to avoid bat bites by sleeping under mosquito netting, for example.
Rabies is a fatal disease, and most cases of the [disease] in humans are
caused by bats.

[Coincidentally, earlier in the month ProMED-mail reported the deaths of
another 11 adults and children in the Amazonas region bordering Ecuador in
the north of Peru (see reference below). The deaths these people living
along the borders of Peru with Ecuador, Brazil and Bolivia are believed to
be a consequence of bites by rabid vampire bats, which are abundant in the
region. Standard rabies virus vaccine provides cross-protective immunity
against the rabies virus strain (or strains) carried by vampire bats and
anti-rabies vaccination in this region should be given the highest priority.
An interactive map of Peru that shows the location of the provinces of
Madre de Dios and Puno in the southeast, bordering Bolivia and the Amazonas
region of Brazil, is available at
