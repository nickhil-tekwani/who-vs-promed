To protect children from Japanese encephalitis (JE), Uttar Pradesh Health and Family Welfare Department has planned to organise vaccination of children from January next year [2018].

The department has also sought assistance of Bihar government in tackling the flow of patients to BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur as well as district hospitals located in bordering districts.

Talking to HT, health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said, earlier vaccination was launched before the onset of monsoon in April and May [2017] in 20 districts. This year 9.3 million children were vaccinated. Though the number of JE cases came down, the flow of the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) patients multiplied. "Learning lessons from the past we have decided to launch the vaccination programme earlier this year. The state government has written to the central government to supply the vaccine early," he said.

The department has also planned to increase 10 beds in the JE/AES wards established in the district hospitals and 100 beds in Mother and Child Hospital in Gorakhpur, he said.

Secretary, health and family welfare V Hekali Zhimomi said there is large flow of JE/AES patients to Gorakhpur and adjoining districts from bordering districts in Bihar each year. "Hospitals are overburdened due to sudden increase of patients during monsoon. We have urged Bihar government to provide facilities to such patients in their state. We have also invited doctors from Bihar for a training programme organised by the state health department," she said.

The health department has also hired the services of CMC Vellore and PATH Foundation to train the government doctors managing the critical care units in the hospital. The PATH Foundation will also submit a report on the gaps in the health services in the JE/AES sensitive districts. The aim is to strengthen the health service and provide better facilities to the patients, she said.

Meanwhile, Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANM), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and Anganwari [also termed Anganwadi; a type of rural mother and child care centre in India] workers posted in villages are also being trained to raise awareness among people.

The health department has also decided to deploy health education officers for awareness programme. The focus will be on early admission of the patients to nearby primary health centres and community health centres. The officers will also raise awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by the medical practitioner.

[The vaccination campaign carried out before the monsoon transmission season will be helpful in preventing cases of JE. The type of vaccine to be employed is not stated. If it's an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity will be relatively short and revaccination, perhaps annually, will be necessary to maintain good immunity. If the vaccine is live attenuated, immunity will be longer, perhaps life-long. Previous reports indicate that JE is a minor cause of encephalitis in northeastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. With the likelihood of multiple etiologies, a long-term and well integrated study will be required to determine the causes of AES. This complexity makes the public and physician education element much more complicated.

In the last 24 hours, 16 children including 10 infants died in the Baba Raghav Das Medical College and Hospital in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. The authorities said the infants were admitted in the neonatal and intensive care units of the hospital.

The authorities emphasized that the patients were afflicted with encephalitis. They added that the patients -- 6 from Deoria, 2 from Kushinagar, 4 each from Gorakhpur and Maharajganj, and one each from Basti and Balrampur -- were admitted to the hospital in the last 24 hours. The doctors at the college said the patients were admitted to the hospital in a critical condition.

The hospital was in the news after 63 children died within a week after the supply of liquid oxygen was affected in August [2017]. The principal of the medical college was fired and the state government ordered a probe into the matter. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who received severe criticism from all quarters for the incident, said the region has been battling encephalitis from the 1970s.

[The etiological agent responsible for the encephalitis cases is not mentioned. Some cases may be due to JE because this area is still in the JE virus transmission season. As mentioned above, AES has been attributed to many etiologies, but none is mentioned above. - Mod.TY]
