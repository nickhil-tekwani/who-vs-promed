significant increase in cases, or which have DHF & deaths. In order to make

The 1st confirmed case of dengue in Laredo [Texas] was found last
week. Laredo health authorities are hoping citizens will take action
in mosquito prevention after a 10-year-old girl caught dengue fever
from a mosquito. Preventing dengue means reducing breeding sites for
mosquitoes. That can be done by getting rid of old tires lying around
your yard or any container that collects standing water, even
swimming pools.
Back in 1999, Laredo and Nuevo Laredo had to deal with an outbreak of
almost 100 cases in Texas and thousands across the border [in Mexico].

Sri Lanka sounds alarm as dengue deaths rise to 24
--------------------------------------------------
Sri Lankan medical authorities expressed fresh alarm after 6 people
died of dengue fever [so far in June 2004], raising to 24 the number
of fatalities during the year.
The number of people infected with the mosquito-borne viral disease
rose to 4348 by Wednesday, up from 3300 at the end of May 2004, said
doctor Hasitha Tissera of the epidemiology unit of the health
ministry.
He said the problem was concentrated in 4 districts, including the
capital Colombo, but dengue cases were now being reported from
throughout the island mainly because of intermittent rains that
helped mosquito breeding.
During 2003, 33 people died of dengue out of 4600 who contracted the
disease, Tissera said, adding 2002 was far worse, with 67 deaths out
of 8900 cases.
Sri Lanka is a dengue-endemic country, and the number of new cases
reported has risen to more than 100 a day, Tissera said.

A 35-year-old male Saudi national died of dengue fever at King Fahad
General Hospital in Jeddah on Monday. This is the 1st dengue fever
death to be announced in the city.
In another development, 2 cases were suspected of dengue fever
Tuesday in Jeddah. The 1st case was that of a 28-year-old Saudi woman
who is 7 months pregnant and the 2nd was that of a 22-year-old woman.
They were provided with prescriptions for treatment and their blood
samples were sent to the regional laboratory for testing. The
analysis results are expected to appear during the next 3 days.
Meanwhile, results of analyses of 2 employees in King Abdul Aziz
Hospital showed that they were free from the disease, whereas 4 cases
were confirmed to be afflicted with dengue fever. Of these, 2 were
Saudi nationals who were treated for one week and then released from
hospital.
Abdul Aziz Ali Bouhi, director of Executive Services at King Abdul
Aziz Hospital in Jeddah, said that there is round-the-clock readiness
to receive any dengue fever case. He pointed out that one person was
afflicted with the disease during his visit to another person in the
hospital's residential building. The residence was evacuated and
sprayed fully due to fears of the existence of the carrier mosquito
there.
In another development, Jeddah Municipality carried out an urgent
plan for getting rid of the causes of dengue fever in collaboration
with the other departments concerned. Several insect-combating teams
have intensified the manual spraying operations and are adding
chlorine to stagnant water to get rid of the insect breeding grounds.
About 141 houses and 36 sites for mosquito breeding were inspected
and sprayed; 65 swamps were inspected and 11 stagnant pools were
filled with soil. In addition, the Jeddah mayor issued directives to
monitor the performance of the companies for cleaning and collecting
garbage. Any delay in collecting garbage should be reported, he said.

Dr. Talal Ekram, the assistant director at Health Affairs, said a few
days ago that 15 out of 45 suspected cases tested positive for dengue
fever at the Jeddah regional lab.
Dr. Ekram said that dengue fever has been around in Jeddah for 15
years because of the presence of mosquitoes and larval breeding
sites. The rash of new construction projects, where water can gather
without being noticed or drained, presents a particular challenge to
health affairs. Jeddah is full of pools of stagnant water,
overflowing septic tanks, a rising water table coming up through
holes in pavements and on waste ground, leaking sewage tankers,
leaking water pipes and inadequate if not non-existent drainage -- in
other words, a breeding ground for disease-bearing mosquitoes.
Arab News last reported on an outbreak of dengue fever back in August
2003. A committee was supposed to educate residents on ways to fight
mosquitoes. However, it seems that neither the spraying campaign nor
the educational campaign was effective. Dr. Ghazi Sheikh, the
director of preventive health and first aid, said "We're doing what
we can with the spraying, but the unfinished sewage and drainage
system makes it difficult. "
