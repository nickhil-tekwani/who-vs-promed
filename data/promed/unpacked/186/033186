Primary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis - Ivanovo Oblast, Russia, 1999
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This article presents the findings of an investigation of primary
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (P-MDRTB) in Ivanovo (Russia) from 1995 to
1998.
As part of an international collaboration with the World Health
Organization and others, CDC investigated high levels of treatment failure
and drug resistance to two or more first-line therapies (isoniazid and
rifampin) among 514 reported never-treated cases in this community. The
percentage of
P-MDRTB cases more than doubled from 3.8% to 9.4% between 1996 and 1998.
This study underscores the need for additional program strategies in areas
with drug resistance, including improved TB treatment supervision and
greater availability of second-line TB therapies. These efforts have
already been initiated to improve treatment outcomes in current TB patients
and prevent the further spread of MDR-TB. Global efforts to reach such
cases remain critical to worldwide control of TB.
