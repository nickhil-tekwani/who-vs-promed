San Diego Hepatitis A Outbreak
------------------------------
On [1 Sept 2017], the San Diego County public health officer declared a local public health emergency due to the ongoing hepatitis A outbreak in the county. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with fecally contaminated environments. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A during this outbreak have been homeless and/or illicit drug users. Efforts of the County and its community partners to halt the hepatitis A outbreak focus on three key areas: vaccination, sanitation and education.

Though the case count in San Diego's ongoing hepatitis A outbreak increased again [Mon 6 Nov 2017], officials said that the number of new infections continues to slow. In a presentation to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, showed a chart that indicated there were 31 cases in October 2017, significantly fewer than the 81 reported in September 2017 and 94 in August 2017 which saw the largest total of the outbreak so far.

After seeing the chart, board chair Dianne Jacob had a to-the-point question. "Is it getting better, the same or worse?" Jacob asked. "We feel it's getting better," Wooten replied.

The latest update bumped the outbreak's case total to 544, 8 more than the 536 reported last week. The number of deaths did not increase, remaining at 20 after 1 new death was reported last week.

Though the county has been providing weekly case, death and hospitalization updates, there has been some confusion, even among the Board of Supervisors, about what those numbers really mean. Supervisor Ron Roberts noted that the weekly escalation in cases [and] in deaths gives the public the feeling that, every time a tally grows, that means the outbreak has grown.

But that's not the case. Because new numbers are not added to outbreak totals until they've been confirmed by genetic testing that can take weeks to perform, the weekly numbers are not a perfect barometer of the outbreak's current severity.

Roberts directed officials with the county Health and Human Services Agency to find a way to give the public a better sense of how many cases have occurred since the last update. "It seems to me we can give a much clearer picture by organizing our material a little better so that people like me can understand this and get a better feel for what's happening," Roberts said.

Wooten said during her presentation [Mon 6 Nov 2017], as she and other local officials have said in recent weeks, that the number of new cases reported to her department on a day-to-day basis has continued to decline. "The number of cases that are being reported daily now has recently decreased to one or 2 a day compared to 3 or more a day," Wooten said.

[Cumulative numbers of an outbreak will continue to grow even as the process is markedly diminishing. Even though there is a delay in confirmation that a case is related to the outbreak until the confirmatory nucleic acid testing is done, an epi-curve which shows the number of cases with onset of symptoms on a specific day (or during a specific week) is the best measure of the status of an outbreak. Overall mortality is not a good measure of status as deaths can occur weeks after onset of infection. - Mod.LL
