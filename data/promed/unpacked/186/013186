Date: Wed 10 Mar 1999
Source: Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, Brazil, Foot-and-
Mouth Disease and Vesicular Stomatitis - Epidemiological Reports, 1999

These reports include a page headed:
Cooperation INPAZ-PANAFTOSA Notification of Syndromes Compatible with
Equine Encephalitis in Equids [in Portuguese
Their paper reports for weeks #4-7, ending 20 Feb 1999, which have just
come to hand, show outbreaks in 3 new localities in Mexico, with disease
continuing in 2 others.
According to the map coordinates given, the localities infected are
immediately to the north and south of Mexico City, and others within 300 km
(200 miles) of there, except for 2 foci in Chiapas. Therefore, there seems
to be no indication of a northward movement towards the USA, but a possible
threat in the south to Guatemala.
[We still do not know what type this is, and would be grateful to anyone
who can tell us. Jack
