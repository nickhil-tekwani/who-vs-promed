[Mapping the extent of RVF spread in animals is crucial for the
effectiveness of control measures in animals and of steps for the
protection of humans from exposure. In particular, reliable, rapid
field tests are essential. Advice and technical assistance might be
obtained from OIE's (sole) reference laboratory for RVF: Dr. G.H.
Gerdes, Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, Onderstepoort 0110, South
Africa, Tel: (27.12) 529.91.14 Fax: (27.12) 529.94.18,

[Clearly, this is a disease in which both people and animals are
dying. The prevalence in the ruminant herds reported here is low,
around 2-3 percent, but the case fatality rate of those infected
appears to be above 50 percent no matter what the species. Of course,
ruminants suffer significant loses, act as amplifiers of the virus
but also should serve as a warning to people in the area, because the
disease is often transmitted by mosquitoes to humans or people are
exposed to infected ruminants directly.
The location of these outbreaks is indeed unfortunate as they have
progressed through the new year 2007. Outbreaks have occurred in both
Kenya and now Tanzania. The new outbreak can be seen on the map
provided by OIE's WAHID interface referenced above. Unfortunately,
they are now occurring in the general area of the world famous
Serengetti, Masai Mara, Ngorongoro, Arusha and Mt. Kilimanjaro
tourist areas. The outbreak in Kenya centered around Garissa, which
is not a hub of international traffic. In either case, the outbreaks
will likely occur in both people and animals. So, I would echo the
comments of Mod.AS and encourage the development of the best
information and geographical and epidemiological data possible.
Unfortunately, this outbreak has been a case in which we have
ecological and animal early warning systems in place but lack the
disease prevention delivery systems necessary to prevent human
infection.
