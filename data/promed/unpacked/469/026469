2 more people have been hospitalized in Buryatia because of suspected anthrax
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of suspected cases of anthrax has reached 13 in Buryatia.
The diagnosis has been confirmed in 8 of them. The last 2 suspected
cases have been identified during the last week.

Animal die-off continues in the region. The testing of specimens is
being carried out in Irkutsk and the results are expected soon. The
1st cases appeared in the beginning of July [2008] in the settlement
of Bayangol.

[The cases have gone from 7 confirmed and one suspect to 8 confirmed
and 5 suspects, presumably awaiting laboratory confirmation in
Irkutsk. A more worrying aspect is that the livestock cases are
continuing unabated, apparently in spite of whatever veterinary
response is or is not in place. As long as the livestock deaths
continue we can expect associated human cases.
