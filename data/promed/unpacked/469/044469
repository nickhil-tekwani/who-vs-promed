A new blood and saliva test announced is to be tested in Guinea, which researchers involved say gives a faster diagnosis, and so increases the chances of survival and reduces transmission of the virus.

The trial, which is led by the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal, uses a "mobile suitcase laboratory" and will take place at an Ebola treatment centre in Conakry, Guinea. It is portable, solar-powered and can be used at room temperature.

The project is being funded by the Wellcome Trust medical charity and the UK's Department for International Development. Dr Val Snewin, the international activities manager at the Wellcome Trust, said: "A reliable, 15-minute test that can confirm cases of Ebola would be a key tool for effective management of the Ebola outbreak, allowing patients to be identified, isolated, and cared for as soon as possible. ..." - more

[2] Sierra Leone: new drug to be tested

Ebola patients in Sierra Leone will receive amiodarone, a well known and cheap anti-arrhythmia drug, in a randomised controlled trial led by the Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency. The trial is expected to start in a few weeks, when a 100-bed hospital recently built by the UK Department for International Development will be entrusted to Emergency. The hospital is one of 6 built as part of Britain's GBP 250 million [EUR 314 million; USD 395 million] effort to fight the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.

Roberto Satolli, the trial's coordinator, told The BMJ: "Amiodarone, a multi-ion channel inhibitor and adrenoceptor antagonist, showed in preclinical studies to be a potent inhibitor of filovirus cell entry [Ebolavirus is a filovirus]. Since it has been used for many decades on millions of patients, its safety profile is well known, and it appears to be a good candidate for a phase III trial... - more

[3] Sierra Leone: patient reinfected on return to his home?

"...Ebola is doing unpredictable things: it plateaus in some places and continues upwards in others; some people it kills, others recover, some of them from the brink.

A lot of it seems to be in synchrony with the viral load people are exposed to. I think the combination of good hydration, good food (mixed with "Plumpy nut," a peanut-based paste for treatment of severe acute malnutrition) and a sterile environment where we minimise patient risk of increasing viral load by rolling into their faeces and vomit, has given us a better cure/discharge to body bag rate.

There is an interesting case of a discharged patient being reinfected when returned to his home, where exposure to further viral load probably collapsed an already weakened immune system..."

[This is, of course, anecdotal, and there is no way of confirming how frequently reinfection occurs in this situation. We don't know the patient's age, sex, whether s/he had a concurrent infection (e.g. malaria) or other complication, the number of confirmed cases in the home, or other information needed to pinpoint a probable source of reinfection, if it actually occurred, or whether it was a relapse (not due to reinfection). - Mod.JW]

In a darkened Boston conference room, staring at projections from a laptop, John Brownstein is far from the front lines of the fight against Ebola. But the epidemiologist's work may help change the course of the epidemic. The disease forecaster and his team are combing through news reports, tweets, and Facebook posts to anticipate the disease's next move and help those on the ground head it off before the crisis grows.

"There are all these places where people are talking about disease outbreaks and the impact of infectious disease, but they were sort of scattered across tens of thousands of sources around the web," Brownstein told NBC News. "We came up with this idea of, what if we just start scraping the Web, organize all the world's content, bring a one-view approach to all this data and actually build our own surveillance system."

[The Ebola HealthMap shows where the epidemic is heading in real time: http://healthmap.org/ebola/#timeline. - Mod.JW]

Brownstein's HealthMap scours social media and local news from around the globe to locate potential hot spots and display them in an interactive map. In the past, HealthMap has spotted outbreaks ranging from H1N1 swine flu to dengue fever. Today, the team is building interactive maps that can guide the response to the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded.

While official numbers from government agencies can take precious time to confirm, Brownstein's team looks to more immediate, unconventional sources to help target the right communities at the right time. "It's enabling us to understand the impact of the disease on society," Brownstein told NBC News. "Are people fleeing particular towns? Are they trusting the government? Are they responding well to interventions like quarantine?"

The team's statistical toolkit creates data-driven visuals and can take something as simple as a public tweet and characterize whether the poster is discussing her own illness, someone else's, or a cluster of cases in a particular neighborhood. "Having this data in a map form helps us make sure we're getting to the people in the most need as soon as possible."

Brownstein co-founded the infectious disease surveillance website, headquartered at Boston Children's Hospital, with software developer Clark Freifeld in 2005. In the current outbreak, the insight of the HealthMap team has been tapped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help with their own efforts around tracking Ebola in West Africa...

Matthew Westercamp, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer who was on the ground in Liberia, said he worked with HealthMap to help visualize where unexplained deaths were spiking to focus the CDC's efforts with the Liberian health ministry. "The situation in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is fluid, and having this data in a map form helps us make sure we're getting to the people in the most need as soon as possible," Westercamp said.

Brownstein says that over the past months he's seen remarkable growth in the number of HealthMap users in the United States, suggesting Americans are really attempting to understand the epidemic. But the flipside of the increased U.S. interest is that there has been a lot of miscommunication about where the risk really lies. "Our goal has really been to build science around the data that we can collect but also to educate the general public on where the risk truly is, which is of course in West Africa right now."... - more
