With affordable AIDS drugs arriving in many poor countries, experts
say a startling and worrisome side effect has emerged: in some
patients, the treatment uncovers a hidden leprosy infection.
No one knows how widespread the problem is. Only about a dozen cases
have been described in medical literature since the 1st one was
found, in London in 2003. But AIDS specialists in Brazil, India,
Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere are reporting that some patients
on life-saving antiretroviral drugs are developing painful facial
ulcers or losing feeling in their fingers and toes. And in the
developing world, where 300 000 new cases of leprosy were discovered
in 2005 and where 38 million are infected with the AIDS virus, the
problem will inevitably get worse, experts say.
"This is just the peak of the iceberg," said Dr. William Levis, who
treats leprosy patients at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. "It's
early in the game. Most physicians don't even think about leprosy, so
there's probably much more around than we know."
Dr. Gilla Kaplan, a professor at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey and one of the 1st to study connections
between AIDS and leprosy, agreed. Antiretroviral treatment, she said,
"is going to flush out the silent leprosy by making it symptomatic."
Because leprosy, a bacterial disease, can be treated with specialized
antibiotics that are supplied free by the Novartis pharmaceutical
company, there is little prospect of a worldwide epidemic or large
numbers of deaths. "It's a matter of concern for the individual
patients," said Dr. Denis Daumerie, who leads the efforts by WHO to
eliminate leprosy. "It's not a matter of concern for public health."
In the mid-1980s, as it became clear that AIDS was not primarily a
disease of gay American men but was killing millions of people --
men, women and children in poor countries -- many public health
doctors prophesied that it would be a double disaster for those with
leprosy. It seemed a logical assumption, since leprosy is caused by a
germ from the same family of waxy-walled bacteria as those that cause
tuberculosis and _Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare_, 2 major
killers of AIDS patients. But it proved a false alarm.
"People expected a big surge in leprosy, but it didn't happen," said
Dr. Diana N. Lockwood, a leprosy expert at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. When the predictions did not come
true, she said, "we assumed that co-infected people just died before
their leprosy became manifest." The incubation period for the most
easily diagnosed form of leprosy is 8 to 13 years, while the
incubation period for AIDS is 8 to 10.
But leprosy in people known to have been already infected did not
seem to worsen when those patients developed AIDS too, showing that
the 2 diseases can apparently coexist without reinforcing each other.
So it came as a shock to doctors when AIDS treatment caused hidden
cases of leprosy to appear.
The 1st such patient described in a medical journal was Dr.
Lockwood's, a Ugandan exile in London who was being treated for both
tuberculosis and AIDS, and suddenly developed a swollen lesion on his
face. "It took us a while to realize it was leprosy," Dr. Lockwood
said. "Since then, we've seen more cases in people from Brazil and India."
Depending on symptoms, leprosy is often initially misdiagnosed as
arthritis or lupus. Painful facial lesions, which are less common,
can have many causes; in the Ugandan man's case, doctors said, his
immune system probably formed nodules around bacteria next to a facial nerve.
Dr. Michael S. Glickman, a bacteriologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center who treated the only co-infected case known in New
York, said he too had some difficulty diagnosing his patient's leprosy.
Dr. Glickman's patient, a man from Burkina Faso, was suffering from
advanced AIDS when he 1st saw Dr. Glickman 6 years ago, with a CD4
cell count below 10 (normal is 500 or more). As the patient recovered
on antiretroviral therapy to a CD4 count of 600, he developed a
lighter-colored patch of skin. Dr. Glickman noticed that it was
slightly numb to the touch. Fortunately, he had once visited Dr.
Levis's clinic at Bellevue, and made the connection. "It was so
unremarkable that, if I hadn't seen leprosy patients, I wouldn't have
known what it was," he said.
Treatment in cities like New York and London is relatively easy, but
the real crisis, experts said, will evolve in poor countries with
dual epidemics. In French Guiana, for example, Dr. Pierre Couppie,
chief of dermatology at the Central Hospital in Cayenne, said he
believed that about one in every 500 AIDS patients would develop
leprosy lesions soon after starting treatment.
Brazil has the world's highest per-capita leprosy rate and also one
of the most effective AIDS treatment programs in the developing
world, and 7 Brazilian cases have been mentioned in medical
literature. No countrywide study has been done, but Dr. Patricia D.
Deps, a leprosy expert at the Federal University of Espirito Santo in
Brazil, said it was "becoming more and more common."
"We don't have good numbers, but we think about 2 percent of the
leprosy cases in Brazil are co-infected with HIV," Dr. Deps said. The
country that most worries experts is India. Not long ago, it had 70
percent of the world's leprosy cases. Its official caseload is a bit
of a mystery now. After an aggressive 20 year campaign to find and
treat new cases, India officially declared leprosy "eliminated as a
public health issue" in 2005. However, that statement was carefully
crafted: it means there is a national average of lower than one case
per 10 000 citizens, which could be as many as 100 000 new cases a year.
At the same time, with about 5.2 million people infected with the
AIDS virus, India is poised to outstrip South Africa as the country
with the most AIDS victims. But its epidemic began much later than
South Africa's or Brazil's, and it has been slow to roll out AIDS
treatment. As treatment grows, leprosy may surge along with it. Other
countries with high numbers of leprosy victims are Myanmar,
Madagascar, Nepal and Mozambique.
Doctors have long known that dormant diseases can surge as a weak
immune system recovers. The recovering immune system regains its
ability to create fevers, flood infected tissue with white blood
cells, break bacteria down into toxic waste products and build
nodules around bacteria it cannot kill.

[What the posting describes -- a paradoxical exacerbation of disease,
when, due to antiviral therapy, an HIV-infected patient's CD4 cell
count rises -- is usually referred to as an immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or immune reconstitution reaction. IRIS
is not necessarily related to ongoing infection per se but can be due
to an immune system that has "woken up" and is now reacting, for
example, to residual bacterial (such as _M. avium-intracellulare_),
viral (such as cytomegalovirus) or fungal (such as _Cryptococcus
neoformans_) antigens.
Whether these reactions described in the posting as occurring after
the initiation of antiviral therapy represent an IRIS is not entirely
clear. As summarized by Diana Lockwood's group in a review in Lancet
Infectious Diseases (1), some individuals (they review 9 such cases)
develop post-HAART reactions as described in the posting, which are
similar in most cases to the so called Type 1 "reversal" reactions
that are associated with activation of T-cell reactivity to _M.
leprae_ antigens, CD4 cell migration into the lesions and production
of Th1-type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12.
These type 1 reversal reactions can occur after the institution of
therapy for _M. leprae_.
It is important to note, however, that these reactions have now been
described in _M. leprae_/HIV co-infected individuals who have not
been treated with antiviral medications. In an in-press manuscript
(2) from Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2 such cases are reported that cannot be
classified as IRIS in origin. These reactions, in a setting of very
low CD4 cell population, underscore the real paradox previously
recognized and now discussed by Lockwood's group.
The paradox relates to the observation that, despite dramatic effects
of HIV/AIDS infection on the clinical manifestations and
histopathological findings of _M. tuberculosis_ infection, there is
no such effect with _M. leprae_. Even in individuals with profoundly
low CD4 levels who are HIV/_M. leprae_ coinfected, there are
granulomas formed in tuberculoid leprosy and the number of CD4 cells
in the granuloma were no different than in cases without HIV (3). The
underlying mechanism for this dramatic difference is discussed at
length in the Ustianowski paper (1) and may be related to differences
in the mechanism of granuloma formation in the 2 mycobacterial
infections, or compartmentalization of the cellular immune response,
but still has to be clearly established.
