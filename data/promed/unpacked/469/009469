Republic of the Congo: Ebola Fever Death Toll Reaches 68
--------------------------------------------------
Congolese villagers have stoned and beaten to death 4 teachers accused of
casting an evil spell to cause an outbreak of Ebola fever that has killed
nearly 70 people, a local official said on Fri 21 Feb 2003.

The outbreak of Ebola in the districts of Kelle and Mbomo near the Republic
of the Congo's northern border with Gabon. Many locals believe occult
forces are at work. "In Kelle, people continue to believe that Ebola fever
is a spell that has been cast on them by witches, and 4 teachers accused of
being the cause of the disease have been beaten and stoned to death," said
Dieudonne Hossie, a local official.

On Wed 19 Feb 2003, the World Health Organisation confirmed the outbreak of
haemorrhagic fever was Ebola, and put the death toll at 64. State radio put
the death toll at 68 on Fri 21 Feb 2003.

This is the second Ebola fever outbreak in little more than a year in the
Republic of Congo's remote northwest. Kelle and Mbomo have been placed in
quarantine, schools and churches have been closed, and people are banned
from entering or leaving the area. Ebola killed at least 73 people in Congo
and Gabon in an outbreak from October 2001 to February 2002.
