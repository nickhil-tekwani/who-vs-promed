Health officials in Kikuube district have confirmed an outbreak of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the district.

The virus, caused by a tickborne virus, is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals, while human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. It has a case fatality rate of up to 40%.

Dr Nicholas Kwikiriza, the Kikuube district health officer (DHO), confirmed the outbreak of the disease in an interview with Uganda Radio Network on Friday afternoon [30 Apr 2021]. This came after a 16 year old girl, a refugee and resident of Musiinsa A village in the Kyangwali refugee settlement area, tested positive for the disease on 28 Apr 2021.

[Kwikiriza] said on 27 Apr 2021, the victim was rushed to Kagoma health center II within the settlement area with a high fever and a temperature of 38.1 deg C [100.6 deg F]. She also had a severe headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, and joint pain and was vomiting blood and bleeding from the nose.

Kwikiriza says her blood samples were immediately drawn and taken to Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, and on 28 Apr 2021, she tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The victim has been transferred from Kagoma health center II to Kasonga Ebola Treatment Unit, where she is currently undergoing treatment.

According to Kwikiriza, 12 people who are her close relatives and are said to have come into close contact with the victim have also been picked up and isolated at the same health facility, while awaiting the results of the blood samples drawn from them. He adds that, currently, they have intensified their surveillance network within the settlement area as they continue to trace for more contacts.

Uganda has had multiple Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever outbreaks since 2013 when the 1st outbreak was confirmed in the country. Tick exposure has been identified as the major risk factor, according to studies done during various outbreaks in Uganda.

[CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.

Crimean-Congo fever outbreaks

[https://www.independent.co.ug/crimean-congo-fever-death-uganda-placed-on-high-alert/ (This link is not currently [8 May 2021] available. - Mod.SH)]

- 23 May 2018: a 35 year old man from Nkoko sub-county in Kakumiro district dies at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.
- December 2017: a 9 year old girl dies; 2 other people develop symptoms in Nakaseke and Luweero districts.
- Nakaseke and Kiboga districts in central Uganda reported a CCHF outbreak, including 8 deaths in August 2017 (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (02) 20170906.5299656).
- 2015: a 33 year old male admitted to Mengo Hospital in Kampala tested positive for the infection.
- September 2013: a female patient dies in Nansana on the outskirts of Kampala city. The Ministry of Health had just declared that the country was Crimean-Congo-fever free.
- August 2013: a farmer in the northern Uganda district of Agago dies. This was the 1st confirmed case after more than 50 years of no reported human CCHF case; 3 others in the same area who had died before this case was confirmed were also suspected to have succumbed to the infection. Around the same time, another case was confirmed at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala.

According to the report above, the primary source of exposure to the virus has not been identified in this case, which merits an early epidemiological investigation to prevent spread of the outbreak. A One Health approach is needed for effective surveillance, with effective communication between animal health and human health professionals. Furthermore, public education, especially among individuals in contact with livestock or their products, is needed to prevent cases of CCHF infection. - Mod.UBA
