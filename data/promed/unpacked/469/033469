Dedza [district] potato farmers [are] reeling under heavy losses after their crop was devastated by late blight disease which drastically reduced the quality and quantity of their yield.

[A] research technician for International Potato Centre (CIP) in Dedza concurred with the farmers saying the just ended [2018] growing season has been bad for potato farming due to the disease. He said the situation was worsened by the fact that many farmers use poor quality seeds [tubers] for planting.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and may be what is referred to above as 'poor quality seeds'. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide.
