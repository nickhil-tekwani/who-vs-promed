Human Anthrax Cases Found in Mongolia
-------------------------------------------
According to local media, 4 cases of human anthrax were found
recently in Mongolia's Arhangay Aymag and Hovd Aymag [counties or
rayons], which border China. The patients have been isolated in
hospital for treatment, and their conditions have somewhat improved.
In addition, anthrax occurred in the livestock of a herding family in
Tomorbulag Soum of Hovsgol Aymag. In response, the county head
imposed a quarantine in the affected area on 14 Apr 2007 and adopted
disinfection measures.

[Background is being sought from Ulaanbaatar. There seems to be a
pattern of March and April reports in Mongolia, which is unusually
early for other countries on a similar latitude. So far, the
explanation eludes us. The proximity of both outbreaks to mountainous
country suggests that these outbreaks may be the result of feeding
contaminated hay.
The location of Hovd can be seen at:

Neither are close to the southern border of Mongolia. - Mod.MHJ]
