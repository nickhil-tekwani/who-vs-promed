[This is a continuation of an earlier outbreak of Asia1 FMD virus in
the provinces specified in this report. Previous reports have
contained sizeable numbers of animals affected by FMD but the numbers
here are extraordinarily small. So small, in fact, that the 2nd
outbreak in Khabarovsk Territory has no information on the number of
susceptible or case animals, while no animals are dead, destroyed or
slaughtered. Some clarification of whether there was an actual FMD
incident in Khabarovsk Territory would be helpful. - Mod.PC]
