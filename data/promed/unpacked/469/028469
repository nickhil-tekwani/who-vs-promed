The world needs better surveillance programs to quickly identify new
disease-causing viruses, an
international microbiology conference in Sydney was told yesterday. In his
opening address, "An Impending World Cup: Man versus Virus", Dr Donald
Henderson, one of the scientists responsible for the eradication of
smallpox, said many more infectious diseases were expected to emerge than
had arisen in the past.
Use of non-sterile injecting equipment in Africa and Asia provided new
opportunities for blood-borne organisms such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa
fever to spread, Dr Henderson, of the Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore,told the 11th International Congress of Virology.
Increasing numbers of poorly fed people crowding in tropical urban areas
with little sanitation also provided a fertile environment for organisms to
get a foothold in man.
If there had been better surveillance in Africa, the AIDS virus might have
been detected 20 years earlier, he said. "Surveillance systems are even
more critical today for dealing with new or emergent diseases which now
have a greater capacity than ever for rapid and widespread dissemination."
Conference organiser Professor John Mackenzie, of the University of
Queensland, said a surveillance system for Japanese encephalitis in Papua
New Guinea and the Indonesian archipelago could have prevented [sic] a
recent outbreak in Australia.

[ProMED-mail is not a disease surveillance system in the strict sense of
the term as used by epidemiologists -- but it IS an early warning system,
which alerts people all over the world to new
outbreaks of emerging infections in humans, animals and crops, and allows
them to take preventive measures. These range from health agencies
improving sanitation or invoking quarantine, to individuals changing their
travel plans, or ensuring that they have the proper vaccinations before
they depart.
