Wildlife officials are looking into the mysterious deaths of fish and
birds at Nashville's Centennial Park on Sunday [12 Jul 2009]. Park
police said they found at least 25 geese and ducks that were either
dead or dying at a park pond. Also, hundreds of fish were found dead.
It is unclear what caused the animals to suddenly die, but tests are
being done on the animals.

Metro [city] workers said they have seen natural deaths at the park in
the past but never to this degree.

[There is not much information given here but it seems likely that
something affecting the water may be involved. The birds mentioned are
water birds, and with the fish involved, it seems that some chemical,
or toxin, has entered the water. While botulism is a possibility, the
scenario described here does not fit a botulism scenario. - Mod.TG]
