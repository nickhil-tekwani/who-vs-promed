The International Monetary Fund loans money to countries with
financial problems, and in return requires governments to undertake
"structural adjustment" policies aimed at improving their financial
management.

These usually cut government spending to control inflation. Critics
have long charged that this reduces spending on health care, so much
so that some have called for the organisation to be renamed the
"Infant Mortality Fund."

David Stuckler and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have now
tested this by analyzing tuberculosis (TB) data in 21 countries in
central and eastern Europe that were involved with the IMF for
different amounts of time after 1989 and borrowed different amounts
of money. They found these were associated with 13 percent more TB
cases, and 16 percent more deaths.

The countries started with TB death rates averaging 6 per 100 000 of
the population. This rose to 12 per 100 000 by 2003 in countries with
IMF loans, but sank in countries without them. In a detailed
statistical analysis of the timing of the loans, the team found that
this was not because countries with worsening TB simply attracted
more IMF attention.

Care cuts
---------
"We found TB rates were falling or steady before the IMF programmes
began, and rose during the IMF programs," then fell again afterwards
to almost the rate they had been before the IMF, says Stuckler. The
team also found that death rates rose almost 1 percent for each
percent increase in the size of the loan, and by another 4 percent
for each year of IMF involvement.

The effect was not associated with other lenders, such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which invests in
Eastern Europe. Nor did it vary in step with other factors such as
HIV, conflict, or the rate at which people were put in prison, where
much TB transmission takes place the region. The team found that IMF
programmes were associated with less government spending, fewer
doctors per person, and a cut of nearly half in the number of people
with TB that received Directly Observed Therapy, or DOTS. DOTS is the
World Health Organisation's recommended method of managing TB, in
which health personnel directly ensure that TB outpatients always
take their medicine. The technique requires investment in public health staff.

'Aggressive policies'
---------------------
"TB takes time [to cause death], so the increase in mortality rates
must be linked to something that happened much earlier," objects IMF
spokesman William Murray. TB actually kills quickly when patients do
not get drugs and medical supervision, says Stuckler, so death rates
are likely an indicator of rapidly declining care, not of events
years previously. IMF's Murray also says that the increase in TB was
related to the fall of the Soviet Union. But, if that was so, says
Stuckler, the effect should have had similar timing and magnitude
across the old Soviet block, instead of being linked closely to IMF
involvement. In Slovenia, which got no IMF loan, he points out, TB
didn't worsen at all.

Murray says the IMF advises countries to spend on health care. "No
one wants to say that health spending is not a priority," says
Stuckler, "but, in practice, the IMF's aggressive anti-inflation
policies cut government spending."

[The IMF and the World Bank were established at the Bretton Woods
conference in 1944. The IMF lends money to countries that are in deep
economic trouble -- e.g., Russia in the late 1990s -- to help their
governments overcome balance-of-payments problems. At the outset the
impoverished state signs a so-called Letter of Intent that lays out
the elements of the recovery plan and in return the Fund commits
itself to grant loans in stages as and when economic targets
specified in the Letter are achieved; these will include cutting
budget deficits and inflation
(<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/95218.stm>).

The World Bank backs specific programs with loans to protect the poor
from some of the worst effects of the economic problems the IMF is
trying to overcome (<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/95218.stm>).
The World Bank says it has been a principal financier of TB programs
since the early 1990s
(<http://wbln0018.worldbank.org/HDNet/HDdocs.nsf/c840b59b6982d2498525670c004def60/a9aac02ae120c4db85256a16007b355c?OpenDocument>).

The World Bank states that it "has financed TB control in over 30
countries, mainly through the cost-effective Directly Observed
Treatment Short (DOTS) Strategy which focuses on identifying and
curing infectious patients. Total investments are now more than USD
560 million and include ongoing large projects in India and China --
together home to over 40 percent of the world's TB patients. Other
bank-supported operations include a USD 150 million loan to the
Russian Federation for TB and AIDS control (in 2003) and a similar
loan for $60 million to Ukraine."

The World Bank has also worked with WHO and the Stop TB Partnership to
help Russian pharmaceutical companies achieve Good Manufacturing
Practice (GMP) standards. This will enable them to produce drugs
locally at a standard that will make the companies eligible as
suppliers under the project
(<http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:20434739~menuPK:34480~pagePK:34370~piPK:116742~theSitePK:4607,00.html>).

After years of gradual decline, TB incidence increased during the
1990s in many former Soviet Republics, associated with the
deterioration of their health care systems after the breakup of the
Soviet Union in the early 1990s
(<http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/id/tuberculosis/countries/eande/russia_profile.html>).
Whether the worsening TB situation was an unintended consequence of
IMF activities in these countries or whether the results of the
Stuckler et al. study (PLoS Medicine (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050143;
<http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050143>)
represent a statistical but not a causal relationship remains for
further analysis. - Mod.ML

When I worked for WHO in the 1980's I led a team of economists to
Mozambique to assess the effect of IMF's "structural adjustment" on
the health of the people. They found that the IMF had insisted that
health services must no longer be free, but that patients should pay a
minimum flat fee. The government initially set this at a low figure,
but inflation had reduced the fee to the equivalent of the cost of a
box of matches, so health services were still essentially free. I
assume that IMF "structural adjustment" in the countries in the study
above also required a fee for health services, and
wonder whether different rates of inflation had any effect on TB incidence.
