Concerns a dog rescued from the streets of Cairo had rabies forced 4 dogs in New Jersey into quarantine for 6 months, according to the CDC.

The Cairo dog was one of 8 dogs and 27 cats brought to the United States in May [2015] and given to animal rescue groups in 4 states.

It was shipped with falsified papers and discovered to have had an unhealed fracture of the left forelimb in Virginia, according to the CDC. Because of possible rabies, the dog was euthanized and later was confirmed by the General Services Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services to have the disease.

Investigators then began looking at the exposure the rest of the animals had to humans during their time in the US from their arrival at John F Kennedy Airport to individual animal shelters, the CDC said.

The New Jersey Department of Health interviewed volunteers from a canine rescue group in New Jersey that had received 4 of the dogs. All 4 dogs received either their initial rabies vaccination or a rabies booster vaccination and were ordered to be confined inside for 6 months, according to the CDC.

NJ Advance Media reported that the dogs were at kept at a small Hudson County animal shelter and monitored by the shelter's owner. The quarantine period ended on [30 Nov 2015].

[What is lacking from this article is how many people were potentially exposed to all the dogs and cats who may have had contact with the infected dog. Furthermore, how many animals subsequently had to be euthanized because they developed rabies? It would be interesting to know how they determine that the rabies certificates had been falsified, and whether other animals had falsified certificates as well. More questions on this case than answers... - Mod.TG

A person is being treated for rabies after s/he was bit by a raccoon that tested positive for the virus, health officials said. The person was bitten by the animal in the Carmines subdivision of Poquoson, according to a Hampton Health Department news release. The raccoon was taken to the state laboratory in Richmond where it tested positive for rabies.

Gary Hagy, environmental health manager at the Virginia Department of Health, urges all residents to make sure pets have current rabies shots. He also advises residents to not feed wild animals or leave food outside for pets because it may attract wild animals. You should avoid all contact with wild or stray animals. "If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, immediately wash the wound thoroughly [with soap and water - Mod.TG] and contact your physician or the health department for further guidance," the release states.

Anyone who sees a sickly animal, such as a fox or a raccoon, should call the local animal control office and advise them of its location. For additional information about rabies, call your local health department or visit the state's website at http://www.vdh.virginia.gov.

[3] Canada (Toronto, Ontario): raccoon, human exposure
Date: Mon 28 Dec 2015

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-police-officer-taken-to-hospital-after-bite-from-sick-raccoon/article27944956/ [accessed 2 Jan 2015]


A Toronto [Ontario] police officer has been taken to hospital after he was bitten by a sick raccoon.

Police received a call at 12:18 p.m. [Mon 28 Dec 2015] from a store owner for a raccoon that "appeared to be in distress and possibly blind," hanging around a downtown store, said Const. Allyson Douglas-Cook. She said 2 officers showed up and tried to corral the raccoon, which is when one officer was bitten in the hand. The officer was taken to hospital to be treated for a minor injury, Douglas-Cook said, but is otherwise fine. "Obviously at this point there are concerns about rabies," she said.

Raccoon rabies had been eliminated in Ontario for more than a decade until one tested positive in Hamilton in early December [2015]. Since then, there have been 9 other cases in the area and the province's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has spread more than 200 000 [oral] rabies vaccines in the Hamilton region in an attempt to stem the outbreak.

The re-emergence of rabies only came to light after 2 dogs got into a fight with a sick raccoon in the back of a Hamilton Animal Services van. The raccoon was euthanized and tests revealed the 1st rabies case in raccoons since 2005.

Douglas-Cook said Toronto's Animal Services division showed up shortly after the officers arrived and captured the animal. Neither the city's Animal Services or Toronto Public Health could be immediately reached for comment.

[This article leaves us wondering if the raccoon was tested for rabies. While they acknowledge a raccoon rabies re-emergence, we are not told if the officer is receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies. Rabies is fatal and there is a limited time to start the post exposure shots.

The other question regarding the raccoon is whether it had distemper. Frequently raccoons are described as acting blind when it is distemper instead of rabies. But this article does not tell us there were any tests performed on the raccoon.

We wish the officer well and hope he is receiving PEP if needed.

Toronto, the provincial capital of Ontario, can be located on the maps of Canada at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/canada_pol_1986.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3906117,274

All of these articles involve individuals being bitten by animals that were not behaving normally. Yes, the animal in the 1st article had a broken bone, which may have caused the animal to react out of fear or pain. Nevertheless, the point is that animals not behaving normally or not in a normal environment (day vs night, or night vs day) should be treated cautiously. Rabies has a furious form (the form most often associated with foaming at the mouth) and dumb form (the form where an animal seems unusually quiet and docile), so it is important to be alert to animals and their behavior. If it seems odd, then it could be a disease, especially rabies. - Mod.TG]
