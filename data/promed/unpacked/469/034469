Abstract
--------
In 2018 and 2019, spotted fever was suspected in 3 dogs in 3 US states. The dogs had fever and hematological abnormalities; blood samples were _Rickettsia_ seroreactive. Identical _Rickettsia_ DNA sequences were amplified from the samples. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis showed the dogs were infected with a novel _Rickettsia_ species related to human _Rickettsia_ pathogens.

In the United States, tickborne _Rickettsia parkeri_, _R. philipii_ (_Rickettsia_ 364D), and _R. rickettsii_, causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), are well-documented human spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses (1). _R. rickettsii_ is the only known cause of SFG rickettsioses in dogs (2). The extent to which other SFG _Rickettsia_ are pathogenic in dogs is unclear; however, SFG _Rickettsia_ seroprevalence is high among dogs in the United States and Mexico (3,4). The increased _R. rickettsii_ seroprevalence in humans in the United States during the past decade has been attributed to SFG _Rickettsia_ cross-reactivity (1,5).

We report 3 dogs with febrile illness located in different US states. Samples from the dogs were _R. rickettsii_ seroreactive. Identical _Rickettsia_ DNA gene sequences were obtained from each dog's blood specimen and used to investigate _Rickettsia_ spp.

The cases
---------
On [15 May 2018], a 10-year-old male neutered mixed breed dog (case 1) from Tennessee was examined by a veterinarian for lethargy and hyporexia. The owner reported removing a tick (species unknown) within the previous 2 weeks. On physical examination, the dog had fever (39.8 deg C [103.6 deg F]) and possible hepatomegaly. Radiographic imaging results were unremarkable. Thrombocytopenia was the only abnormality noted on complete blood count (CBC). Serum biochemistry panel (SBP) abnormalities included hyperglobulinemia, increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia (Table 1 [available at the source URL above]). Results of urine dipstick and sediment examination were unremarkable. The dog's samples were _R. rickettsii_ seroreactive and PCR positive for _Rickettsia_ (Table 2 [available at the source URL above]). Clinical abnormalities resolved after treatment with doxycycline, and the dog remained healthy during the 1-year follow-up period.

On [8 May 2019], a 9-year-old male neutered Boston terrier (case 2) from Illinois was examined by a veterinarian for lethargy, difficulty walking, and painful elbows. Clinical signs developed 3 days after returning from a tick-infested area in Arkansas. Abnormalities noted on physical examination included fever (40.1 deg C [104.2 deg F]), dehydration, joint effusion, elbow pain, and shifting leg lameness. Thrombocytopenia and mild leukocytosis were the only CBC abnormalities (Table 1). SBP abnormalities included hypoalbuminemia, increased alanine amino transferase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypocalcemia (Table 1). Mild microalbuminuria was noted. Neutrophilic inflammation was documented by synovial fluid cytology in the right and left stifle joints, right tarsus, and left elbow joint. The left carpus contained moderate, chronic inflammation with very rare extracellular cocci; however, culture resulted in no bacterial growth. The dog experienced cardiorespiratory arrest during sedated arthrocentesis but recovered after CPR and sedative reversal. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. The dog's samples were _R. rickettsii_ seroreactive and PCR-positive for _Rickettsia_ and convalescent titers demonstrated 4-fold seroconversion (Table 2). Most clinical abnormalities resolved and after administration of doxycycline to treat rickettsiosis, prednisone to treat potential immune-mediated component, omeprazole to prevent gastric ulcers, and metronidazole to treat assumed dysbiosis. All SBP changes resolved within 5 months of treatment and the dog remained healthy during the 5-month follow-up.

On [28 Aug 2019], a 9-year-old male neutered terrier mixed-breed (case 3) from Oklahoma was examined by a veterinarian for lethargy, hyporexia, and polydipsia. Physical examination revealed fever (39.8 deg C [103.6 deg F]) and palpable abdominal tenderness. CBC abnormalities included a normocytic normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia. SBP abnormalities included hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, and mild azotemia. A protein-losing nephropathy (PLN) was documented by urine dipstick and protein/creatinine ratio. Blood samples were _R. rickettsii_ seroreactive and _Rickettsia_ PCR positive, and convalescent titers demonstrated 4-fold seroconversion (Table 2).

The year before, in August 2018, a dog of unknown age and species (case 3) was examined by a veterinarian for lethargy after tick attachment. At that time, fever (39.7 deg C [103.5 deg F]), anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoproteinemia were documented. IFA [immunofluorescence assay] serology tests performed by one diagnostic laboratory showed samples were _R. rickettsii_ seroreactive (1:320) but seronegative for _Anaplasma_ spp., _Borrelia burgdorferi_, and _Ehrlichia_ spp. by SNAP 4Dx Plus (IDEXX Laboratories, https://www.idexx.com). Doxycycline and immunosuppressive doses of prednisone were administered concurrently for RMSF and potential immune-mediated disease. Clinical and hematologic abnormalities resolved, and treatment was transitioned from prednisone to cyclosporine due to adverse side effects. Cyclosporine was discontinued in January 2019 and serial monthly CBCs remained normal through March 2019. When rechecked on [9 Aug 2019], for joint pain, hematocrit, and platelet count were normal, but hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia were detected. By [30 Aug 2019], the dog's anemia and thrombocytopenia worsened, despite treatment with doxycycline and prednisone. Marked abdominal effusion was documented by abdominal ultrasound, without evidence of an intra-abdominal mass. Prednisone and mycophenolate were administered for presumptive immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and within 3 weeks, the platelet count normalized and titers increased by 4-fold. Despite medical therapy for PLN, nephrotic syndrome developed, and the dog was euthanized.

We obtained identical _Rickettsia_ DNA gene sequences from each dog's blood specimen. We confirmed novel _Rickettsia_ sp. by PCR targeting 3 genes (gltA, htrA, and ompA) and 2 intergenic spacer regions (23S-5S and mmpA-purC) (Table 2). _Rickettsia_ amplicons were 100% identical among the 3 dogs. We amplified a larger region of the ompA and gltA genes by using 3 different quantitative PCRs from case 3. We submitted sequences from this dog's serum samples to GenBank (accession nos. MT050445-8 and MT066187). We also used the _Rickettsia_ sequences from case 3 to generate a phylogenetic tree (Table 2) based on concatenated novel _Rickettsia_ sp. DNA sequences and reference _Rickettsia_ spp. We generated the phylogenetic tree by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model (Figure [available at the source URL above]) (6,7). Multilocus phylogenetic analysis placed the novel _Rickettsia_ sp. in a clade among SFG _Rickettsia_ between the human pathogens _R. heilongjiangensis_ and _R. massiliae_. We attempted cell culture isolation of the _Rickettsia_ sp. from whole blood but were unsuccessful (Appendix [available at the source URL above]).

Conclusions
-----------
We report similar illnesses among 3 dogs from different US states associated with tick exposures occurring in summer months. All 3 cases demonstrated fever, lethargy, and thrombocytopenia, abnormalities commonly associated with RMSF. Case 1 had a typical acute onset fever and rapidly responded to treatment with doxycycline; case 2 had a neutrophilic polyarthritis, which has been associated with RMSF in dogs (8). Case 3 was examined for acute onset febrile illness 1 year before the novel _Rickettsia_ sp. infection was documented; _Rickettsia_ IFA seroreactivity was documented on both occasions. This dog likely had an unidentified, concurrent disease process that contributed to PLN.

The cases were geographically distributed among 4 states; the dogs resided in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, but the dog from Illinois had traveled to a tick-infested area of Arkansas. The tick species were not identified, but ticks common to these states include _Amblyomma americanum_, _Dermacentor variabilis_, and _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ sensu lato, all of which are known to transmit _Rickettsia_ (3). _Haemophysalis longicornis_, an invasive tick species recently confirmed in the United States, including in Tennessee and Arkansas, should be considered a potential vector for _Rickettsia_ spp. (9,10)

Based on serologic cross-reactivity, presence of ompA, and phylogenetic tree analysis, the new _Rickettsia_ sp. is an SFG _Rickettsia_, phylogenetically related to human pathogenic _R. heilongjiangensis_ and _R. massiliae_, with only 95% identity to each (11,12). Thus, we report a previously unknown and unique _Rickettsia_ sp. with clinical significance for dogs and potentially humans. Because this novel Rickettsia cross-reacts with _R. rickettsia_ on IFA, it could be underdiagnosed and more geographically widespread. Studies aimed at identifying the tick vector, potential animal reservoirs, and prevalence are ongoing. These 3 canine rickettsioses cases underscore the value of dogs as sentinels for emerging tickborne pathogens (13,14).

[While fascinating to realize we may have new _Rickettsia_ species recognized as causing a disease, with clinical signs in dogs similar to other _Rickettsia_ species diseases, it is nice to know the treatment is the same as how we would treat other _Rickettsia_ sp. diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Acute _Ehrlichia canis_ cases may resemble infection with _R. rickettsii_ (the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can also be transmitted by the brown dog tick). So it may also resemble this new _Rickettsia_ sp. - Mod.TG

The animal and human significance of infection by this new _Rickettsia_ needs to be determined. The authors of the report above indicate that the incidence of infections with the new _Rickettsia_ in dogs or in humans could well be underreported. Laboratories should become prepared to differentiate this _Rickettsia_ from other ones with which it may cross-react. Similarly, ticks should be tested to determine which ones are associated with this new _Rickettsia_ with follow up tests to determine transmission efficiency. - Mod.TY
