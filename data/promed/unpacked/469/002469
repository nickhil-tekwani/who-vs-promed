Smut disease hits cane crops
----------------------------
The Northern Rivers [region] sugar cane industry has been dealt
another blow, with the state's 1st case of smut disease found in a
crop at Condong. And it is likely that other farmers will also have to
battle the disease, according to the NSW Sugar Milling Cooperative.
Badly affected paddocks will be destroyed, and farmers are being urged
to look out for infected plants.

However, the cooperative's manager of agricultural services, Rick
Beattie, said the industry was 'well prepared'. "The spores are
wind-blown, so we knew it was coming," he said. Mr Beattie said it was
hoped the effects of the disease would be minimal. "We've made pretty
good preparations. We don't anticipate any production losses at this
stage," he said. "We're going to have to make some hard decisions
about whether to keep growing certain varieties." Over the past 3
years many growers have taken steps to minimise the potential impacts
of smut. More than 60 percent of cane in NSW is now planted with
smut-resistant and smut-tolerant cane varieties.

Smut has already affected every cane-growing area in Queensland. BSES
[Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations] extension officer,
Peter McGuire, said early replacement of smut susceptible varieties
was the best way to avoid productivity losses. Condong farmers have
access to 14 types of smut-resistant or smut-tolerant cane varieties.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It
is highly contagious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing
and machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure emerging from
the central core of meristematic tissues. The whip contains spores
covered with a thin membrane, which ruptures easily to release the
spores. Smut spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris.

Disease management may include removal of inoculum, burning of
infected cane fields, fungicides, and use of clean planting material.
However, smut control is best achieved by using resistant cane
cultivars available for different regions.

Cane smut was found in 1998 in Western Australia, and in June 2006 in
Queensland. Despite efforts to contain the disease, it has spread to
all sugar growing regions of Queensland. In NSW, spores were
discovered in monitoring programmes during 2008 (see ProMED-mail post
20080421.1412) in the Northern Rivers region, and smut symptoms were
expected to appear in local crops. Currently, susceptible cane
varieties are being replaced with smut resistant ones in all
Australian cane growing districts.
