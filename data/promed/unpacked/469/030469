New outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Western Nova Scotia, Kings, Subd. A, Kings, Nova Scotia
Started: 30 Jan 2022
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 11 800 / 6146 / 6146 / 0 / 0 / -

Affected population: NS-HPAIP-2022-001 Commercial turkey farm with 2 groups of 5900 birds each: 98% mortality in the 9-week-old birds and 6% mortality in the 3-week-old birds. The geographic coordinates do not represent the actual location of the premises.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive, contact with wild bird
Epidemiological comments: On 30 Jan 2022, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) was notified of high mortality in a commercial turkey farm in Western Nova Scotia. The CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease has confirmed that the virus was H5N1, similar to the viruses reported in non-poultry and wild birds recently in the provinces of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The virus has HA cleavage site motif "PLREKRRK/GLF" consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza strains of H5 subtype. The HA gene segment is A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage belonging to 2.3.4.4B clade. Phylogenic analysis indicates this virus corresponds to the Eurasian lineage circulating in 2021 in Europe. The CFIA has immediately quarantined the infected farm and is implementing strict movement controls and a stamping out policy. A protection zone (3 km [1.86 mi]) and a surveillance zone (10 km [6.21 mi]) are being put in place around the infected premises. Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Traceability; quarantine; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone
Domestic control measures to be applied: Disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; zoning
Wild control measures applied: Surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone

[On 4 Feb 2022, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) mentioned that "This situation serves as a strong reminder that avian influenza is spreading across the globe in wild birds as they migrate to and from Canada, and that anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds should practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from animal diseases" (https://bit.ly/3uvMtGj). For more information of the current situation of HPAI subtype H5N1 in Canada, see the following CFIA pages: Detection of high pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in Newfoundland and Labrador 2021 and Nova Scotia 2022 at https://bit.ly/3uvMtGj and Avian influenza (bird flu) at https://bit.ly/34zF65E. - Mod.CRD
