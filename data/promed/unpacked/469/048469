More typhoid cases reported
---------------------------
The Health Ministry has confirmed 39 cases of typhoid fever, says chief
executive Doctor Lepani Waqatakirewa. This is compared with 27 cases
confirmed earlier in Apr 2005. He said of the 39 cases, 25 were reported in
the Central and Eastern divisions, 13 from the North and 1 from the West.
"There was a death from multiple complications of which typhoid was a
confirmed contributing factor," he said.
Dr Waqatakirewa said most people who had typhoid had been treated, while
others were being followed up and monitored closely. He said there were
suspected cases of typhoid in the North and Central divisions who were
being treated and monitored by health officials.
He said the main areas which reported typhoid included Lami, Samabula,
Vatuwaqa, Ovalau and Koro in Lomaiviti. In the North, the areas were
Naweni, Rabi Island, Batiri, and Macuata. "The outbreak response teams have
worked meticulously to undertake field investigations, case diagnosis, and
conducted community mobilization and awareness prevention campaign programs
in villages," he said.
Earlier in April 2005, a man who suffered from typhoid fever died at the
Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva. It was the 1st fatal case of
typhoid this year. The man, who lived in Suva, had visited the hospital's
outpatient department complaining of vomiting. He was treated by the
medical officers, given some medication, and told to go home and rest. He
returned a few days later vomiting blood and was admitted but nothing could
be done to save him.
