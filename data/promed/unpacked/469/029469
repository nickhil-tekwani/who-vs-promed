The rising numbers of encephalitis cases in Mumbai are becoming a
cause for concern, according to city doctors.

Kasturba hospital, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) only
infectious disease hospital, is getting 2-3 cases per week. A senior
doctor from the hospital said: "Encephalitis cases are on the rise
since the last one month. We have been getting 2-3 cases every week."

However, the doctors are unsure whether it is encephalitis or Japanese
encephalitis, which is also a cause of major concern in parts of North
India.

"Japanese encephalitis is a kind of encephalitis [virus] which spreads
through the bite of _Culex_ mosquitoes. We are not sure whether the
cases in Kasturba hospital are Japanese encephalitis, but the cases
are a cause for concern," said the doctor.

Japanese encephalitis has infected 14 people in Delhi so far this year
[2011]. Interestingly, the hospital hasn't sent any samples for
testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. "Ideally,
they should have sent the samples to NIV, but it has not been done so
far," he added.

According to the doctor, the patients presently hospitalised in
Kasturba hospital are from various parts of the city, and some are
from outside Mumbai.

Dr Pratit Samdhani, a consulting physician at Jaslok hospital, said:
"Maharashtra generally sees sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis.
Otherwise, we keep getting viral encephalitis on and off."

[This report differentiates "encephalitis" of unspecified etiology and
Japanese encephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus. There is
no hint concerning what the etiology of this unspecified encephalitis
might be.

Earlier reports from northeastern Indian states, especially Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar, relate unspecified encephalitis to contaminated
water, suggesting that enteroviruses might be involved. One hopes that
the results of the laboratory tests come in soon so that the public
might be informed about avoiding mosquito bites, and vaccination in
focal areas could be considered should these cases prove to be due to
Japanese encephalitis virus infections. Another possible etiological
agent is West Nile virus infection, which has occurred sporadically in
various parts of India, most recently in Kerala state last month
(October 2011; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111105.3295).
