Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was confirmed Wednesday at hog farms in Penghu
County, located on the offshore Penghu island chain. The confirmation marks
the possible return of the deadly epidemic that ravaged the island's hog
population two years ago.
As of Tuesday, the Penghu County government's Health Department had killed
617 hogs in an effort to stop the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has dispatched 20,000 doses of
an FMD vaccine to Penghu. The vaccine will be administered to all hogs in
and around the area where the infections have been reported.
According to Yeh Chu-lin, an official in the Chungkuang district of Makung
City, the principal town in Penghu, a hog farmer reported to the Penghu
County government on Feb 20 that four of his hogs had developed blisters on
their cloven feet, which is symptomatic of FMD. County government officials
responded by sealing off the area and ordering the killing of an
unspecified number of hogs. The remains of the hogs were buried on a beach.
[This article does not tell us what kind of testing was done to verify FMD
before the hogs were killed. If blisters or vesicles are the only clinical
sign, then there are other differentials to be considered, such as
vesicular stomatitis, swine vesicular disease and vesicular exanthema. -

Officials kept quiet about the killings to avoid upsetting the local meat
market, said Yeh. Area fishermen stumbled across the burial site on Tuesday
after going to the beach to dig for shellfish. [Recommended disposal of
carcasses is either burning or burying, generally close to or on the
affected premises. However, it seems odd to bury the animal(s) on the
beach. - Mod.TG]
The COA admitted Wednesday that an FMD epidemic would likely return to
southern Taiwan after a two-year hiatus. The outbreak in Penghu, which was
spared from the 1997 epidemic, may have been the result of the transfer of
infected hogs from Yunlin County to hog farms on the island, COA officials
noted. Hog farms in Tainan and Pingtung may have been the source of the
infections, they said.
