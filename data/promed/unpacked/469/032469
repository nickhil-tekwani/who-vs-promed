Northern Vietnamese killed by anthrax
-------------------------------------
A man from the northern mountainous province of Lai Chau has been
killed by anthrax with suspected infection from buffalo, a province
medical official said Saturday [9 Jul 2011]. [The 40-year-old man],
was killed [sic] after hospitalization at the medical center of Than
Uyen District, said Pham Xuan Tan, a district preventive health
official.

Tan said [the man] was among 10 people admitted to the district
hospital with anthrax since the beginning of June [2011]. The dead man
was only sent in when his condition had become critical with bleeding
and sharp pains in the head, Tan said.

The man had earlier [been] involved in slaughtering a sick buffalo
and developed a black burned spot on his arm afterward, according to
investigation.

Anthrax is a highly infectious bacterial disease affecting mammals,
especially cattle and sheep. It is transmissible to humans and can
cause skin ulcers, pneumonia, and even death.

[Anthrax is sporadic in Viet Nam and most commonly seen in the
northern provinces where livestock vaccination is not practiced.
Cutaneous infections in humans need to be caught early and treated
aggressively.

In this case the man developed meningitis, which is more common with
human anthrax than many clinicians appreciate and bodes ill for the
patient's future. Without treatment cutaneous anthrax can carry a 20+
percent risk of mortality. Viet Nam under-reports human cases. They
appear to see some 3 to 7 outbreaks in buffalo each year with up to
more than 80 animals affected. This provides ample opportunity for the
poor villagers to butcher affected animals. - Mod.MHJ]
