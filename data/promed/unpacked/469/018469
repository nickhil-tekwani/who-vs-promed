On 24 Nov and 8 Dec 2011, 2 cases of botulism were diagnosed in adults
living in the urban district of Stuttgart and in the Ludwigsburg.

Botulism is quite uncommon, so the 2 cases diagnosed so close in time
is unusual. Whether a connection exists between the cases is unclear
especially since the source of the intoxication is still unknown. It
can not be excluded that other cases may occur.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pfaff for this first-line report and would like
more information regarding these cases as available, especially
regarding the vehicle(s). Most of the cases reported from the EU this
year have involved olives, a particularly high-risk food because it is
low acid. - Mod. LL]
