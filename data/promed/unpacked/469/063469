Mystery AIDS Strain 'Patient Zero' Found
----------------------------------------
U.S. doctors said they have identified the patient who is the source of a
mystery strain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that sent waves of
alarm through the AIDS community last February [2005]. Public-health
officials in New York City issued a warning because the patient apparently
had developed a virulent form of HIV --- the [virus] that causes AIDS --
that was resistant to virtually all drugs and caused a rapid destruction of
the man's immune system.
The original source of the infection is a patient in Connecticut who
infected the New York man during anonymous rectal intercourse at a sex club
in the city on 22 Oct 2004. Within 3 months, the New York man was
diagnosed with HIV, and his CD4 blood-cell count --- a marker of the
health of his immune system --- had been reduced to double digits. A CD4
count above 500 is considered normal for healthy individuals. Dr. Gary
Blick, a private-practice physician in Norwalk, Conn., reported that his
patient, identified as CT01, is the so-called "Patient Zero" --- the source
of the New York man's infection.
The new HIV strain appeared to be multi-drug resistant, but Blick said the
alarm may have been overblown, because his patient now has a stable
infection that is being controlled by 2 drugs. "We want to emphasize that
our patient is not rapidly progressing. Nor is that patient's life partner,
who is also infected with a similarly highly resistant strain, rapidly
progressing," Blick told United Press International at the 3rd
International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment.
Even though New York health authorities said the strain was unknown, Blick
said he knew the source was his patient just a few days later. He said he
had received an urgent call shortly after the alarm was sounded from
Quest/Nichols laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. Their HIV database
had produced a 99.5 percent match between the New York man and one of
Blick's patients, CT01. Blick later received another call from the lab that
there was a 98.5 percent match with CT01's partner, CT02. "When an HIV
strain is only about 1 percent different from another, they are usually
almost identical," he said. HIV mutates so rapidly that 100 percent
identical strains are uncommon if the patients are tested at different times.
Through interviews with his patients and New York authorities, Blick put
together the following scenario: On 20 Oct 2004, CT01 provided blood
samples that indicated a detectable viral load. The patient told Blick he
had missed a few doses of Fuzeon, an injected drug known generically as
enfuvirtide. Fuzeon, which prevents entry of HIV into cells, is one of 2
drugs the 52-year-old man -- who has a long history of HIV infection -- can
still take because his viral strain is resistant to all other medications.
The only other drug that keeps the virus at bay is efavirenz (Sustiva), a
non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, which prevents the virus
from replicating. "The only 2 drugs that are effective in the New York man
are also Fuzeon and Sustiva," Blick said.
2 days after visiting the doctor, CT01 and CT02 traveled to New York to
engage in sex at a club. "They thought all the people at the club were
HIV-positive," Blick said. "My patient is devastated that he infected the
New York man, whom he thought was already HIV-positive." At the club, CT01
had insertive anal intercourse with ejaculation into the New York man.
CT02, a 41-year-old man who has lived with CT01 for 12 years, had insertive
anal intercourse without ejaculation with the same man. 3 months later, the
New York man showed symptoms of recent infection and was seen at the Aaron
Diamond AIDS Research Center. When his CD4 count was measured at 88 cells,
the alarm was sounded.
Blick said, however, the New York man's use of crystal methamphetamine and
highly promiscuous lifestyle may be more of a factor in his low CD4 count
than the strain of virus. Marc Wainberg, professor of medicine at McGill
University in Montreal, said he thinks Blick is correct in identifying his
patients as the source of the highly-publicized New York case. "The
evidence is very convincing that he has identified the patient who is the
source of this strain of disease," Wainberg told meeting attendees. He also
agreed the New York man probably developed a rapidly progressing form of
the disease due to his frequent use of crystal meth, along with his
promiscuity. "Who knows what damage that drug does to a person's immune
system," he said.
The New York man had sex with at least 10 other partners before he
discovered he was infected. Blick said it is possible other infections with
that strain may show up later when those men are tested -- if they became
infected.

[Despite the multiple drug-resistance of this novel strain of HIV, there is
no evidence so far to suggest that it has properties that endow it with
greater transmissibility than other strains of HIV, or that it is spreading
widely in the community. The initial rapid progression of the disease in
the New York patient appears to have been contained by treatment and was
not a direct consequence of the multiple drug resistance of this strain of
HIV. Identification of the source of the infection of the index patient who
sparked this concern will facilitate analysis of the relevance of multiple
drug resistance in the epidemiology of HIV. This thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
