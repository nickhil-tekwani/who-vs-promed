A highly toxic rat poison caused the deaths of 24 children on Friday in a
remote Peruvian village, a teacher at the school said on Monday.
In statements to America Television, the teacher, Isaac Villegas, said the
mother of one of the deceased children said her daughter mistakenly took to
school a bag containing milk mixed with rat poison and added the mixture to
a pot in which the children's breakfast was being prepared.
A total of 60 children were poisoned. "The woman told me that she had
prepared the milk and rat poison to poison some dogs that had been eating
her livestock and that her daughter unwittingly took the bag to school
thinking it was only milk," Villegas said.
The tragedy occurred in the Andean community of Tauccamarca, a poor, remote
village in the province of Cusco, accessible only by foot.
The victims, all children between the ages of eight and 12, were buried
there Sunday night.
Surviving children have been admitted to the central hospital in the city
of Cusco, where doctors reported that all of the children are out of
danger, including two children who had been in intensive care.
