The prevalence of diarrheal diseases is alarmingly increasing in Dhaka and its adjacent areas. Some 1317 diarrhea patients were admitted to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) in Mohakhali on Tuesday [29 Mar 2022]. A total of 745 patients were admitted until 4pm on Wednesday [30 Mar 2022]. Another 1334 had been admitted last Monday [28 Mar 2022] -- the highest in the last 60 years. Almost every one minute, one diarrhea patient is being admitted to the hospital, according to the data.

The number of diarrhea patients started increasing on 15 Mar 2022. In the past 13 days, 17 680 diarrhea patients have been admitted at the facility. Dr Baharul Alam, head of Hospitals, ICDDRB, told The Business Standard there is no sign of the number of diarrhea patients declining -- 50 patients are going there every hour.

The ICDDRB has issued some instructions for diarrhea patients. It has suggested a packet of oral rehydration salts (ORS) saline mixed with half a liter of pure drinking water. The solution replaces the lost fluids and essential salts, thus preventing or treating dehydration and reducing the danger. Adults (10+ years of age) have to have one glass of saline once a day to make up for fluid loss. Patients need to take other fluids like green coconut water, soup, and juices. Children need to take saline based on weight. Supplementary feeding should be provided to under 2-year-olds alongside breast milk. Over 6-month-old babies have to take all types of liquid meals alongside saline.
