_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, which causes melioidosis, is a gram-negative saprophytic bacterium endemic to tropical and subtropical environments worldwide; to our knowledge, isolation from the continental USA has not been reported (1-3). The most overrepresented risk factor for melioidosis is diabetes mellitus (3,4). _B. pseudomallei_ is resistant to many antimicrobial drugs (3). Laboratory exposures might occur without appropriate biosafety precautions (2,5).

Surveillance is challenging because melioidosis is not nationally notifiable; however, _B. pseudomallei_ is a Tier 1 overlap Select Agent (6), and the CDC receives voluntary reports (2,7). We report a case of melioidosis in a Texas resident who had no recent travel history.

The study
---------
On 17 Nov 2018, a 63-year-old man from Atascosa County, Texas, came to hospital A with fever, chest pain, and dyspnea of 3 days' duration. At admission, he reported congenital unilateral renal agenesis. Renal function measures were unremarkable. Increased hemoglobin A1c level and hyperglycemia (glucose over 200 mg/dL) suggested undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Computed tomography of chest and abdomen with intravenous contrast showed left lower lobe pneumonia with a small left pleural effusion. Empiric antimicrobial drug therapy with intravenous azithromycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Blood culture yielded presumptive _B. pseudomallei_, which was sent for confirmation to the laboratory response network (LRN) site in Houston, Texas.

On 20 Nov 2018, a localized, violaceous, cutaneous lesion developed on the central anterior chest wall of the patient and progressed to become purulent and ulcerated (Figure 1 [for Figures and Table, see original source URL - Mod. LL]). The next day, he experienced respiratory failure, was emergently intubated, and was transferred to hospital B.

Hospital B was not aware of the presumptive diagnosis and performed a blood and chest wound culture. Both cultures showed gram-negative rods; blood analysis showed acute kidney injury. On 25 Nov 2018, _B. pseudomallei_ susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ceftazidime (Table) was identified, and treatment was switched to ceftazidime by using dosing for continuous renal replacement therapy (4).

On 26 Nov 2018, the patient was extubated and began hemodialysis (3 times/wk). He was discharged on 9 Dec 2018 and received 3 months of daily trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (4). Subsequent follow-up showed clinically recovery and resolution of renal insufficiency.

Because the isolate had an unremarkable resistance profile and _B. pseudomallei_ was not specifically listed on the Texas Notifiable Conditions List, the automated system at hospital B did not generate an alert indicating it required LRN confirmation, and the isolate was not promptly reported to Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). On 27 Nov 2018, Houston LRN reported to DSHS Region 8 (San Antonio, TX, USA) confirmation of the isolate from hospital A as _B. pseudomallei_. The Houston LRN and hospital A destroyed the remaining isolates because of regulations surrounding handling of select agents.

DSHS and CDC collaboratively investigated the source of the patient's exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ and performed risk assessments to identify potential laboratory exposures at both hospitals.

The patient's only reported travel outside Texas was a visit to Monterrey, Mexico, 30 years before illness onset. Before becoming ill, he resided on a small rural ranch without running water from a municipal source or private well. He purchased water for nondrinking use from a local chlorinated municipal water utility. He used a 500-gallon uncovered tank to store the water and then pumped the water into a 1600-gallon storage tank. He cleaned the tank 1-2 times/month by climbing inside to scrub the walls. The last cleaning was 2 days before illness onset.

During environmental sampling in December 2018, we collected 56 specimens from the patient's home and property. We concentrated large-volume (30-190 L) water samples on site and processed as described (8). We collected soil samples (50 mL) at a depth of 30 cm (9) from 8 sites in moist soil. Other environmental samples included surface swabs (10 x 10 inch) of the inside of both water storage tanks and swabs of indoor and outdoor plumbing fixtures. We processed specimens by using international guidelines (9) and tested for presence of _B. pseudomallei_ by using culture and real-time quantitative PCR (10). All specimens were negative for _B. pseudomallei_.

We identified 7 laboratory personnel at hospitals A and B who had low-risk exposures to the _B. pseudomallei_ isolates (5). Recommendations included temperature monitoring twice a day for 21 days and collecting serum samples at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks postexposure (5). We performed serologic testing by using an indirect hemagglutination assay (11). All samples were negative for _B. pseudomallei_ antibodies (cutoff value 1:40).

Hospital B submitted the patient's blood culture isolate (TX2018b) for whole-genome sequencing (National Center for Biotechnology BioProject no. PRJNA545616). Multilocus sequence typing identified the isolate as sequence type 297 (12). The 8 other sequence type 297 isolates are all associated with North America (1). A higher resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism comparison of the draft genome assembly with other public assemblies containing geographic data also indicated that the isolate is associated with others from North America. TX2018b grouped closest to TX2004 and to a lesser extent to AZ1999 (BioProject no. PRJNA545640) (Figure 2).

TX2004 was isolated in 2004 from a patient residing in the same Texas county as our patient (13). It was originally hypothesized that the 2004 patient was infected 62 years before disease onset, while serving during World War II in Southeast Asia (13). However, TX2004 is not related to strains from Southeast Asia but to strains from the Americas (1). Other regional travel by the 2004 patient was not reported. AZ1999 was isolated from a patient treated in 1999 in Arizona who had recently emigrated from El Salvador. Where exposure occurred for that patient is unknown, but that isolate groups closer to TX2004 and TX2018b than to other examples associated with Central America (Figure 2).

Conclusions
-----------
The source of this patient's infection remains unknown. However, genomic analysis showed that the patient isolate groups with existing isolates collected from other patients in the southwestern USA. Isolates TX2004 and TX2018b were collected about 15 years apart from patients living in the same Texas county at time of illness onset and group together, a finding that suggests _B. pseudomallei_ might be present in the environment in this area. Furthermore, these 2 isolates might represent a new clade endemic to the continental USA. Further investigation is warranted because this region is predicted to have suitable habitats for _B. pseudomallei_ (14).

These findings call into question possible reactivation of melioidosis decades after travel to melioidosis-endemic regions. Instead of a 62-year incubation period, the patient infected with TX2004 might have had an unknown local environmental exposure that preceded symptom onset. A 1991 case report of an 18-year latency for a Vietnam War veteran indicated that this patient was also living in the southwestern USA (New Mexico) at time of symptom onset and had not traveled outside the continental USA since 1971 (15). On the other hand, although geographic and genotypic links between the 2 Texas cases suggest a local source, _B. pseudomallei_ exposure for the patient infected with TX2018b could have occurred 30 years earlier, while visiting Mexico, and the patient infected with TX2004 might have had unreported regional travel before illness onset. Only when _B. pseudomallei_ is isolated from the environment can it be definitively stated that _B. pseudomallei_ is endemic to the continental USA.

_B. pseudomallei_ infection should be included in a differential diagnosis for a patient with compatible disease, even without reported travel history. Increased awareness among healthcare workers and diagnostic laboratory personnel for melioidosis as a disease potentially endemic to the southwestern USA is critical to improve case outcomes and prevent laboratory exposures.

In addition, melioidosis is caused by a Tier 1 overlap Select Agent, but reporting of cases to CDC is voluntary (2,7). Making melioidosis nationally notifiable could improve surveillance and recognition and clarify distribution and potential sources of _B. pseudomallei_ infection in the USA.

[This report suggests that melioidosis infections could be acquired in the continental USA. The infection is found primarily in southeast Asia and the Northern Territory of Australia. Despite this, cases of melioidosis have been acquired in other parts of the world, including the Americas. Flooding from the increasing number of severe tropical storms related to climate change is increasing.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy, and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
