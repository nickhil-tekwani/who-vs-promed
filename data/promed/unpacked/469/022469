Public health officials in Massachusetts have announced the state's 4th human case of the mosquito-borne disease eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] this season.

The latest case is a woman in her 60s who was exposed to the disease in Plymouth County. The state said on Friday [4 Sep 2020] that as a result, the risk level in the town of Plymouth been raised to high.

There are now 4 communities in the state at critical risk for the disease (10 at high risk and 18 at moderate risk), which causes brain swelling and is potentially deadly.

[The above report does not indicate whether the woman in her 60s is alive. Presumably she is, or a death would have been mentioned.

EEE virus transmission continues to be active in Massachusetts this year (2020), now with 3 human cases in Plymouth county. There is a human case in Hampden county, as well.

Last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEE virus transmission in the eastern USA, with cases in humans and horses, including in Massachusetts.

As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in the eastern and upper midwestern USA states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
