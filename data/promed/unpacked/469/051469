At least 10 people in the city of Dongguan in south China's Guangdong
province have been infected by chikungunya virus, the local public
health department reported on Monday [4 Oct 2010]. Chikungunya fever,
like dengue, is a disease spread by mosquitoes.

"All patients came from the Xinchun community in the Wanjiang
district," said the provincial Center for Disease Prevention and
Control in Guangdong, in a press release issued Sunday [3 Oct 2010].

According to the same source, 10 of the 15 blood samples were
positive for chikungunya virus detection done on Saturday [2 Oct
2010], and at least 76 people, possibly infected by the virus, are
still awaiting results [of laboratory tests]. Most of the patients
presented with symptoms such as fever, arthralgia and rash, and now
have recuperated, according to the release, which states that up
until the present no fatal or hospitalized cases have been reported.

The word "chikungunya," which in Swahili means "that which bends,"
makes reference to body posture of patients due to severe joint pain.

Chikungunya virus is generally transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
Most cases are reported in tropical areas of Africa and Southeast
Asia, where the mean temperature in winter [or rainy season] is above
18 C [64F].
