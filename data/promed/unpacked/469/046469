Tungro virus hits South Cotabato
--------------------------------
Agriculture experts in South Cotabato province have warned farmers in the
area to refrain from planting 2 varieties of palay [unhusked rice] at this
time because of the onslaught of the tungro virus. Reynaldo H Legaste,
provincial agriculture chief, said palay varieties RC 64 and RC 118 have
been ravaged by tungro. "Not all varieties are performing at this time, so
please refrain from planting those 2 varieties. Almost the whole of South
Cotabato has been affected by tungro. Many palay fields have turned
yellow-orange," he said.

Tungro, Legaste noted, is worse than the black bugs that infested the
province's nearly 2500 hectares (about 6200 acres) of palay fields worth
around PHP 4.5 million [USD 96 393] in the few months leading to April
2008. The provincial agriculture office has yet to release the damage
wrought by the tungro disease, which is primarily spread by 2 species of
green leafhoppers (_Nephotettix malayanus_ and _Nephotettix virescens_).
Worst hit by tungro is the farming town of Norala in the 2nd district of
South Cotabato, the official reported.

Legaste blamed the resurgence of tungro in the province on the continuous
palay planting in the area, which was prompted by the high prices of rice
back then. "Farmers should have given the lands a rest even for one
cropping season," he added. To help farmers from being hit by the tungro
virus, Legaste dangled government-subsidized certified seeds. The province
has a certified rice seed inventory of 2600 bags that can be available to
farmers at half the commercial price, he added.

[Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia with
reported losses of up to 100 per cent, and it is spreading in the region.
It is a syndrome (co-infection) involving _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_
(RTBV; genus _Tungrovirus_, family _Caulimoviridae_) and _Rice tungro
spherical virus_ (RTSV; genus _Waikavirus_, family _Sequiviridae_).
Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering, and few
or no grains are produced. Only _Oryza_ species are natural hosts, but some
other grasses are susceptible to vector inoculation under experimental
conditions.

Tungro disease is transmitted by leafhoppers, the most efficient vector
being the green leafhopper _Nephotettix virescens_. RTBV cannot be
transmitted unless RTSV is present. After acquiring the viruses the vectors
can immediately transmit the disease to other plants. All growth stages of
rice are susceptible. Infectious vector insects transported on air currents
or by people movements can spread the viruses over long distances. Disease
management includes vector control, crop rotation, and other cultural
practices to minimise inoculum, and the use of rice varieties resistant to
the vectors, the virus, or both. Vector adaptation on leafhopper resistant
varieties has been a problem, but virus resistant varieties from the
Philippines and other countries are available.

The use of certified seed, as suggested above, is certainly advisable to
prevent spread of other pathogens, but seed certification will not prevent
tungro because the disease is not seed transmitted. At present the use of
virus resistant varieties is considered the most economical means of
managing the disease.
