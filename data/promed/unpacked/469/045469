Children die of mysterious disease in Western UP
------------------------------------------------
A total of 32 children have died of a mysterious disease over the
last 2 days while several others have been admitted to various
hospitals in parts of western Uttar Pradesh, official sources said.

More than 100 children with complaints of severe headache, fever and
vomiting were brought to health-care centers and government hospitals
in Meerut, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Garhmukteshwar districts,
sources informed.

So far, as many as 14 children have died in Khekra town in Baghpat
district, 8 in Muzaffarnagar and 10 in Saharanpur, due to this
disease which has symptoms similar to that of encephalitis,
meningitis and cholera.

The disease, mostly prevalent among those residing in unhygienic
conditions, is a result of inflammation of the brain membranes and
patients generally vomit blood, informed S K Arora, Director of
Health, Meerut Division.

[The statement that the illness is "a result of inflammation of the
brain membranes" suggest a meningitis, either viral or bacterial, or
an encephalitis. Certainly Japanese encephalitis occurs in the area.
It is curious that these deaths are reported to have occurred in a
short period of time (48 hours) somewhat suggesting a possible common
source type outbreak, (if the above provided information is
correct). The additional symptom of hematemesis (vomiting blood) has
one wondering if the hematemesis is mechanically related to active
vomiting and retching or is a primary hemorrhagic phenomenon. ProMED
would greatly appreciate more information about this outbreak of
fatal illness from knowledgeable sources in the region.
