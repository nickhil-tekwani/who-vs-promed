[The above report indicates that there are 254 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases and 11 presumptive cases, and 2 cases have been confirmed. The YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and cases occur there sporadically. Because the 2019 outbreak that began in Edo State may have started as sylvatic (forest) yellow fever spread by various _Aedes_ species with subsequent rapid development suggesting urban yellow fever transmission spread by _Ae. aegypti_, it is reassuring to learn that the Edo state outbreak has been declared over with a reported vaccination coverage of 120% [This startling level of coverage may have occurred as a result of individuals vaccinated outside the state being vaccinated in the state as well, and/or by individuals being vaccinated twice within the state.]. Coverage in the 3 other states reporting suspected, presumptive or confirmed cases is not mentioned. Continued surveillance for new cases will be important. If coverage in these 3 states is less than 80-90%, one hopes that the vaccination campaign there will continue.
