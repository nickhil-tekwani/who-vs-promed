Russia: 95 People Diagnosed with Hepatitis A in Kaliningrad
-------------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis A is seriously affecting the population of the Kaliningrad
region. According to a representative of the Sanitary Epidemiological
Surveillance Center, the epidemiological situation is very unfavorable.
Last week 95 people were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of hepatitis
A, and 38 of them were children.
Due to the prevalence of hepatitis A among children, including school
children and pre-school children, officials has begun vaccinating contacts.
So far 292 people identified as contacts have been vaccinated.
Different anti-epidemic and disinfection measures have been organized to
prevent the spread of the infection. But the region urgently needs more
vaccine. The water supply system is undergoing urgent maintenance.
