Germany said today [2 Sep 2020] it has 'unequivocal proof' Russian dissident Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. Tests carried out at a military laboratory found evidence of the Soviet-era chemical weapon previously used to attack Sergei Skripal in Salisbury [UK] in 2018. Navalny, 44, remains in a coma in a Berlin hospital nearly 2 weeks after collapsing on a plane in Siberia, which made an emergency landing when he suddenly fell ill.'

Germany says it will inform its partners in the EU and NATO about the test results and consult with them 'on an appropriate joint response'.

After Navalny fell ill, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk, and he was initially taken to a hospital in the Siberian city. The following weekend [22 Aug 2020] he was airlifted to Berlin, where doctors at the Charite hospital have been treating him with the antidote atropine and keeping him in a medically induced coma.

The hospital said in an initial statement last week [week of 24 Aug 2020] the clinical tests 'indicate poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors', which are used in medicines and insecticides but also in nerve agents.

But Germany's announcement today said toxicological tests at an army laboratory had found 'unequivocal evidence' of a nerve agent in the 'Novichok family'. The military specialists were called in at the request of Charite hospital medics, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.

Navalny's wife, who has visited him every day in hospital without making any public comment, has also been informed of the test results.

Uglev [Vladimir Uglev, a former Soviet scientist who helped invent Novichok] has previously spoken of his role in creating Novichok, the nerve agent used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. The former double agent and his daughter were found slumped on a park bench in March 2018, causing a sensation when their identities were revealed. Russia denied involvement, but the poison plot sent Britain's relations with Moscow to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. British police eventually named 2 suspects, who were later identified by the investigative website Bellingcat as members of Russia's GRU intelligence service. Both Skripals survived and their current whereabouts are unknown, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, later died after accidentally handling the discarded nerve agent in a perfume bottle. Western weapons experts say Novichok, which was developed by the USSR at the end of the Cold War, was only ever manufactured in Russia.

The most recent update from the Berlin hospital said while Navalny's condition remains serious, 'there is no immediate danger to his life'. 'However, due to the severity of the patient's poisoning, it remains too early to gauge potential long-term effects,' the statement said. German medics have also asked for assistance from authorities in the UK and Bulgaria, who both have experience of previous poisonings.

A full probe would begin once it is determined what happened, he [Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov] said, while adding German medics were also uncertain how Navalny became sick. Meanwhile, Russian prosecutors have asked Germany to provide Navalny's biomaterial for investigations.

The German government said toxicology tests showed the Russian opposition leader was poisoned with a nerve agent from the same class used in a 2018 attack in Britain on an ex-Soviet spy.

Soon after a private plane carrying the poisoned Russian opposition leader, Aleksei A Navalny, touched down in Berlin last month [22 Aug 2020], doctors treating him at the prestigious Charite hospital there became so alarmed they called in the Army.

Mr Navalny was certainly not suffering from low blood sugar, as the Russian doctors who first treated his mysterious illness had claimed, or even a standard detective-novel poison like arsenic or cyanide.

It was, the German doctors suspected, something far more dangerous, requiring the attention of the Army's chemical weapons specialists, German officials said.

On Wednesday [2 Sep 2020], the German government confirmed the doctors' fears: Mr Navalny, 44, had been poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok family, a potent class of chemical weapon developed by the Soviet Union that was used at least once before in recent years in an attack on a Kremlin enemy. Mr Navalny remains in critical but stable condition at the Charite hospital, in a medically induced coma.

The Novichok revelation, which the German government said was based on "unequivocal evidence," provided the strongest indication yet that the Kremlin, which has denied involvement, was behind the poisoning, as Western intelligence agencies have assessed that only the Russian government would likely have access to such a dangerous weapon.

[Nerve agents are a class of chemicals designed to block the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages. The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. The acetylcholine builds up, causing the nerve to continue to fire, thus constantly stimulating a muscle or organ.

Among the lethal CW (chemical weapon) agents, the nerve agents have had an entirely dominant role since World War II. Nerve agents acquired their name because they affect the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. All nerve agents belong chemically to the group of organo-phosphorus compounds. They are stable and easily dispersed, highly toxic, and have rapid effects both when absorbed through the skin and via respiration. Nerve agents can be manufactured by means of fairly simple chemical techniques. The raw materials are inexpensive and generally readily available.

It was not until the early 1930s that German chemists observed organo-phosphorus compounds could be poisonous. In 1934, Dr Gerhard Schrader, a chemist at IG Farben, was given the task of developing a pesticide; 2 years later a phosphorus compound with extremely high toxicity was produced for the 1st time. According to contemporary regulations, discoveries with implications had to be reported to the concerned authorities, which was also done with Schrader's discovery. This phosphorus compound, given the name tabun, was the 1st of the substances later referred to as nerve agents.

A factory for production of the new CW agent was built, and a total of 12 000 tonnes [13 228 US tons] of tabun were produced during the years 1942-1945.

At the end of the war, the Allies seized large quantities of this nerve agent. Up to the end of the war, Schrader and his co-workers synthesized about 2000 new organo-phosphorus compounds, including sarin (1938). The 3rd of the "classic" nerve agents, soman was first produced in 1944. These 3 nerve agents are known as G agents in the American nomenclature. The manufacture of sarin never started properly, and up to 1945, only about 0.5 tonne [0.55 US tons] of this nerve agent was produced in a pilot plant.

Immediately after the war, research was mainly concentrated on studies of the mechanisms of the nerve agents in order to discover more effective forms of protection against these new CW agents. The results of these efforts led, however, not only to better forms of protection but also to new types of agents closely related to the earlier ones.

By the mid-1950s, a group of more stable nerve agents had been developed, known as the V-agents in the American nomenclature. They are approximately 10-fold more poisonous than sarin and are thus among the most toxic substances ever synthesized. Until now. The Novichok variants are believed to be much more toxic than the V-agents.

Most chemical ammunition can be described as unitary, which implies it contains one active ready-to-use CW agent. Binary technology implies the final stage in the synthesis of the nerve agent is moved from the factory into the warhead, which thus functions as a chemical reactor. Two initial substances which are stored in separate containers are mixed and allowed to react and form the nerve agent when the ammunition (bomb, projectile, grenade, etc.) is on its way towards the target.

Until the actual moment of use, the ammunition contains only relatively non-toxic initial substances. It is, therefore, considered to be safer to manufacture, store, transport, and, finally, destroy. However, some critics question whether this practically untested type of new ammunition is reliable. The technique for mixing substances in bombs and rockets is complicated and requires space. The reaction has to be controlled (e.g., the temperature), and the process should preferably take place without solvents.

In 1991, Iraq declared to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) a different binary munitions concept. According to this, the munitions were stored containing one component. Shortly before use, the munitions were opened, and the 2nd component was added. Thus, the reaction began even before the munitions were launched.

Binary components for the 3 most common nerve agents:
- Sarin: methylphosphoryldifluoride + isopropanol. The isopropanol is included in a mixture with isopropylamine, which binds the hydrogen fluoride generated;
- Soman: methylphosphoryldifluoride + pinacolylalcohol;
- VX-2: O-ethyl O-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite + sulphur

When exposed to a low dose of nerve agent, causing minor poisoning, characteristic symptoms are increased production of saliva, a running nose, and a feeling of pressure on the chest. The pupil of the eye becomes contracted (miosis) which impairs night-vision. The accommodation capacity of the eye is also reduced so that short-range vision deteriorates, and the victim feels pain when trying to focus on an object nearby. This is accompanied by headache. More nonspecific symptoms are tiredness, slurred speech, hallucinations, and nausea.

Exposure to a higher dose leads to a more dramatic development, and symptoms are more pronounced. Bronchoconstriction and secretion of mucous in the respiratory system lead to difficulty in breathing and coughing. Discomfort in the gastrointestinal tract may develop into cramps and vomiting. Involuntary discharge of urine and defecation may also form part of the picture. The discharge of saliva is powerful, and the victim may experience running eyes and sweating. Symptoms from the skeletal muscles are very typical. If the poisoning is moderate, this may express itself as muscular weakness, local tremors, or convulsions.

When exposed to a high dose of a nerve agent, the muscular symptoms are more pronounced. The victim may suffer convulsions and lose consciousness. To some extent, the poisoning process may be so rapid that earlier mentioned symptoms may never have time to develop.

Muscular paralysis caused by nerve agents also affects the respiratory muscles. Nerve agents also affect the respiratory centre of the central nervous system. The combination of these 2 effects is the direct cause of death. Consequently, death caused by nerve agents is a kind of death by suffocation.

However, the Novichok agents seem to affect the victim much more quickly than any of the previously mentioned agents.

Both atropine and an oxime (usually 2-PAM chloride) that directly reacts with the cause of the injury, i.e., nerve agent-inhibited acetylcholinesterase, are used to treat a patient with nerve agent poisoning. The oxime functions as a reactivator that restores the enzyme to an operational condition. Oximes have a poor penetration capacity into the brain and thus mainly work in the peripheral nervous system.
