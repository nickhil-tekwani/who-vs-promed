Two Cincinnati [Ohio] residents have been hospitalized with botulism after a nationwide recall of California sauces. Steven Englender, director of the Center for Public Health Preparedness in the Cincinnati Health Department, said they have found presumptive laboratory evidence of type B botulism and confirmed 2 clinical cases of botulism.

According to the CDC, botulism is a rare and serious illness, with only 145 cases reported in the USA each year. Of those cases, 15 percent are foodborne [most are infant botulism. - Mod.LL]

Englender said in an email to city spokesman Rocky Merz [Mon 4 Aug 2014] that the patients, both in their 20s, were improving. One patient was on a ventilator and had been transferred to an acute long-term care facility. The other patient was off assisted breathing. That patient may have since been discharged.

The Cincinnati Health Department says a pesto sauce seems to be the cause in both cases. The California Department of Public Health [CDPH] warned consumers last week [week of 28 Jul 2014] not to eat VR Green Farms jarred sauces because they were possibly contaminated with botulism. At that time, the CDPH announced they were working with the FDA as well as the Ohio Department of Health to investigate botulism infections possibly associated with VR Green Farms' Pine Nut Basil Pesto.

VR Green Farms voluntarily recalled Pine Nut Basil Pesto, Pickled Farm Mix, Old World Tomato Sauce, Sundried Tomatoes in Olive Oil, Tuscan Grilling Sauce, and Pasta Sauce.

[It is not entirely clear but appears that the recall was precipitated by the recognition of the 2 cases of what is now reported to be type B botulism.

An excellent editorial commentary on botulism was published in January 2014: Popoff MR: Botulinum neurotoxins: more and more diverse and fascinating toxic proteins. J Infect Dis. 2014; 209: 168-9; http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/209/2/168.long. Several paragraphs regarding taxonomy are extracted below (references can be found at the original URL):

"The taxonomic position of _C. botulinum_ was originally based on 1 phenotype, the production of a BoNT, whereas the nontoxic variant strains were assigned to different species, such as _Clostridium sporogenes_ and _Clostridium subterminale_. Subsequently, physiological differences between _C. botulinum_ strains were identified, and the species was divided into 4 physiological groups [6]: group I, consisting of _C. botulinum_ A and proteolytic strains of _C. botulinum_ B and F; group II, consisting of _C. botulinum_ E and nonproteolytic strains of _C. botulinum_ B and F; group III, consisting of _C. botulinum_ C and D; and group IV, consisting of _C. botulinum_ G. The latter group is metabolically distinct from the other groups and has been assigned to a different species, called _Clostridium argentinense_.

Since then, neurotoxigenic strains belonging to different _Clostridium_ species, such as _C. butyricum_ and _C. baratii_, have also been characterized and are now assigned to groups V and VI, respectively. Generally, 1 strain of _C. botulinum_ produces 1 type of BoNT, but strains synthesizing a combination of BoNT types (bivalent strains Ab, Ba, Af, and Bf ) have been observed [7]....Recently, Arnon and colleagues identified a _C. botulinum_ strain that contains 3 _bont_ gene clusters consisting of BoNT subtypes A2, F4, and F5 [11]."

The editorial commentary was part of a cluster of articles and editorials related to the description of the 8th toxin type (H). - Mod.LL
