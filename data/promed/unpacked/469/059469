[1] Germany: preventive measures

Farm poultry in German regions with a high risk of contact with migrating wild birds must be kept inside farm buildings to protect against the risk of contracting bird flu, German authorities said on [Mon 24 Nov 2014].

The decision was taken by federal and state authorities after a case of bird flu was found in a wild duck on [Sat 22 Nov 2014], the state government of North Rhine Westphalia said in a statement [see archive no. 20141122.2982721].

The 1st case of H5N8 bird flu in Germany was confirmed on 4 Nov 2014 on a poultry farm in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in east Germany. Dutch health authorities were on Saturday destroying 8000 ducks to prevent the possible spread of bird flu, which has infected 3 farms in a week in the Netherlands, a leading poultry and egg exporter.

Tests showed the bird flu viruses found in Germany, the Netherlands, and Britain are similar to one that devastated poultry flocks in South Korea earlier this year [2014], the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has said.

South Korea had to slaughter millions of farm birds to try to contain the outbreak.

Migrating birds are being investigated as a possible source for the European infections.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania] has already ordered that all poultry remain inside farm buildings regardless of whether they have a high risk of contact with migrating birds.

More humane free-range farming methods introduced in recent years, with poultry allowed outside, have increased the risk that farm poultry can contract diseases from wild birds.

[2] Japan (Tottori): wild duck

A highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N8 was discovered in the southwestern Tottori Prefecture in Japan, Kyodo news agency reported [Thu 27 Nov 2014].

The virus was detected in the analysis of duck fecal samples taken on 18 Nov 2014, according to the agency.

Japan's Ministry of the Environment has established a 10-km (6-mile) monitoring zone in the region, where the virus was detected. It is yet
unknown if the government is planning to test wild birds for the disease, according to Kyodo.

[According to a report (in Japanese) by Apital-Asahi, the information above refers to droppings of wild ducks, collected -- as indeed said above -- in Tottori on 18 Nov 2014. See at http://apital.asahi.com/article/news/2014112700005.html. -Mod.AS]

[3] EFSA: scientific experts advice requested
Date: Wed, 26 Nov 2014

http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141126a.htm


EFSA is assessing the current situation on the H5N8 avian influenza A virus in Europe and the world, following an urgent request from the European Commission. Experts are focussing on the possible entry routes of the virus into Europe- in particular on the role of wild birds.

The highly contagious avian influenza virus has recently been detected in 3 European countries: in a turkey holding in Germany; 3 chicken holdings in the Netherlands, and in a duck breeding holding in the United Kingdom.

The flu viruses found in the EU are similar to one that affected poultry flocks in South Korea earlier this year [2014]. To date, there are no recorded cases of humans contracting the H5N8 virus.

EFSA's role is to provide EU risk managers with independent scientific advice and assistance on animal health and welfare related to avian influenza and any possible food safety issues.

In previous risk assessments EFSA provided information on the risks of influenza viruses entering and spreading amongst poultry in Europe and made recommendations to prevent existing risks. EFSA experts also concluded that there is no scientific evidence that avian influenza can be transmitted to humans through consumption of food.

The scientific report will be delivered in early December 2014.

[OIE's document "Questions and Answers on High Pathogenic H5N8 Avian influenza strain" has been updated on 27 Nov 2014; see at http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-high-pathogenic-h5n8-avian-influenza-strain-update-27112014/.
Subscribers are encouraged to consult this useful document.

Under the segment "Where has influenza A (H5N8) been reported?", the OIE Q&A document says: "this virus was initially reported as a low pathogenic strain in the State of Idaho in the United States in 2008 and again in 2014 in the State of California."

A possibly earlier publication on HPAI H5N8 addressed a consignment of turkeys transported in 1983 from the Republic of Ireland to a processing plant in Northern Ireland. The nomenclature proposed by the authors for the isolate was "A/turkey/Ireland/83 (H5 N8)". The reference is:
