The Division of Parasitic Diseases, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, CDC, has been assisting the Chicago Department of Public Health,
Arizona health officials, the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC), and
the Ministry of Health, Jamaica, in the investigation of an outbreak of
eosinophilic meningitis thought to be due to _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_.
A group of 23 tourists from Chicago and other cities in the United States
traveled to Jamaica from 2-9 April 2000. Ten (43.5%) of the 23 tourists
have developed symptoms and signs of meningitis a median of 10 days after
leaving Jamaica (range, 5-20 days). Eight of the tourists have been
hospitalized; seven had eosinophils in their cerebrospinal fluid (range
3-48%). Chief complaints from patients have included headache, neckache,
backache, nausea, visual disturbances, nuchal rigidity, paresthesias, and
hyperesthesias. One patient has required steroids to treat severe
headaches. No patient has died.
Other findings typical of eosinophilic meningitis caused by _A.
cantonensis_ include abdominal discomfort, altered consciousness,
generalized weakness, flaccid paralysis of the extremities, diplopia,
reduced visual fields, optic atrophy, periorbital edema, and unilateral
facial paralysis; pulmonary findings have occurred in severe cases. The
incubation period for _A. cantonensis_ infection averages 2 weeks, but can
range from several days to a month or more. Autochthonous infection in
humans has been rarely reported in Louisiana, Hawaii, the Bahamas, Jamaica,
Puerto Rico, and Cuba.
Diagnosis is supported by a history of travel to or residence in an _A.
cantonensis_-endemic area, consumption of undercooked food potentially
containing infective larvae, compatible clinical and CSF findings,
including eosinophils, and a positive serologic test. Rarely, a definitive
diagnosis can be made by finding worm larvae in the CSF or ocular chamber.
Humans become infected with _A. cantonensis_ by accidentally ingesting
infected mollusks--either by eating improperly cooked intermediate hosts
(snails and slugs), or by eating raw paratenic (transport) hosts such as
freshwater shrimp. Infection may also be acquired by eating vegetation
(e.g., salad greens) contaminated by snails or slugs.
Disease is usually self-limited; most patients recover fully. However, some
cases cause severe illness with lasting neurologic sequelae or even death.
Symptoms typically persist for 2-4 weeks; treatment is mainly symptomatic.
Headache generally subsides dramatically following lumbar puncture.
Corticosteroids may be given to reduce cerebral edema but are not thought
to benefit those with mild symptoms. _A. cantonensis_ is susceptible to
mebendazole and other antihelminthics, however, The Medical Letter cautions
that using antiparasitic drugs can provoke neurologic symptoms. Surgical
removal of larvae is recommended for patients with ocular involvement.
If you are aware of a case of eosinophilic meningitis, we ask that you
report it to your state health department. If you would like additional
information, please contact Ms. Sue Partridge (Tel: 770-488-7775 or or Dr.
Tom Navin (Tel: 770-488-7760 or at the Division of Parasitic Diseases/NCID/CDC.
