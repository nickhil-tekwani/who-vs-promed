I understand that some species of Lorikeet are quite reasonable
mimics in captivity -- hence they learn to talk, bark like dogs,
dance, etc. From one who lived in Darwin for several years, at the
end of the wet season one may be inclined to ponder the significance
of that.

On a more serious note, I believe it is probably alcohol
intoxication. Quite common seasonally in several species of parrots
in various parts of Australia. I have seen it often in several
species of grain-eaters when they raid grain crops (particularly
sorghum) before it had ripened, occasionally in sulphur crested
cockatoos after feasting on a type of feral melon (we referred to as
a pie melon), numerous times in fruit/nectar eating Lorikeets and a
several of times in captive parrots during and after university
parties.

Should be quite easy to determine via a quick blood specimen at the
local booze bus (a booze bus is a police vehicle equipped to process
drivers suspected of driving in excess of the legal limit -- a few of
them in Darwin as well these days).

[While the syndrome is likely related to some type of alcohol
poisoning, and while the local "booze bus" may be able to test it,
someone skilled in taking blood from the avian victims would be
needed and the lorikeets still need treatment to get over their
drunken stupor. - Mod.TG]
