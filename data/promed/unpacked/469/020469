[Re: ProMED-mail Infectious salmon anemia - Canada (02): (BC) 20111108.3321]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to point out that infectious salmon anaemia [ISA] has not
been officially reported in the North Pacific as stated in your
commentary in the posting [referenced above]. Official reporting is
done by the competent authority of a country for aquatic animal
diseases that are regulated by that country under appropriate
legislative authority and/or through the World Organization of Animal
Health (OIE) for OIE listed diseases.

Infectious salmon anaemia is an OIE-listed disease, as well as a
regulated aquatic animal disease in Canada under the Health of Animals
Act and supporting regulations that are administered by the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). As you are probably aware, this
incident has not been reported by the OIE.

The CFIA is investigating the suspect ISAV detections in wild salmon
in BC. Information on ISA and updates on the investigation can be
found on our website at
http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/aqua/disemala/anaemia/anaemiae.shtml.

Currently, the CFIA cannot corroborate the test results that initiated
this investigation. However, the investigation is not yet complete and
further updates will be forthcoming. I invite ProMED-mail and your
readers to join CFIA's listserv at
http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/util/listserv/listasube.shtml?aqua,
if one wishes to stay updated on Canada's position on this matter.

[Special thanks to Dr Klotins for his very precise clarification on
this issue. I would like to apologize for mistakenly referring to the
1st report (ProMED-mail archive no. 20111019.3120) as official in my
commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20111108.3321. We recommend our
readers to follow the results of the ongoing investigation in the link
provided and by joining CFIA's listserv. - Mod.PMB]
