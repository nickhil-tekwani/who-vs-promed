[Bulgaria submitted an immediate notification and 2 follow-up reports to the OIE addressing this brucellosis event, caused by _Brucella melitensis_. Investigations in animals were applied in Bulgaria following the diagnosis of the disease in humans in July 2015, leading to the discovering and laboratory confirmation of _B. melitensis_ in livestock since 27 Jul 2015. This disease had reportedly been absent in Bulgaria since 2009.

The 2nd/last follow-up report has been submitted to the OIE on 7 Sep 2015. The accumulating statistics were summarized on 7 Sep 2015 in OIE archive as follows:

Total outbreaks = 5 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 368 / 6 / 0 / 6 / 0
Goats / 858 / 205 / 0 / 205 / 0
Sheep / 714 / 11 / 0 / 11 / 0
Equidae / 20 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep and goats / 58 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

In goats and sheep, the main clinical signs are abortions; the bacterium infects humans by direct contact with infected materials (mainly aborted foeti and placentae) and by unpasteurized milk and milk products. In cattle, abortions are rare and the disease essentially subclinical, but the bacterium infects the udders with consequent serious public health implications.

"Test and slaughter" policy is the common control/eradication system applied in relation to brucellosis in livestock, accompanied by quarantine and other sanitary measures.

An updated follow-up report is anticipated, as well as information on additional human infections, in case reported. The source of infection is yet to be unravelled. - Mod.AS
