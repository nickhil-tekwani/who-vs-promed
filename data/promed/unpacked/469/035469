Preliminary laboratory findings released by the Georgia Department of Public Health have identified the food source responsible for the November 2017 salmonellosis outbreak that sickened dozens and hospitalized 5 people who ate food catered for Toyo Tire employees. These findings indicate that turkeys handled and catered by Angelo's New York Style Pizza and Bistro were the cause of the outbreak among the employees who took part in the meals [Tue 14 Wed 15 Nov 2017], according to the Georgia Department of Public Health Northwest Health District.

"Our findings about the actual food product implicated are based on analysis of hundreds of surveys with employees of the company about what they ate at the event and, of course, investigation of the food-service facility involved," said spokesperson Logan Boss, adding they also tested stool samples of sickened employees to determine the disease. Boss added the laboratory investigation is ongoing, and that local and state epidemiologists will attempt to identify a specific supplier of the poultry. Angelo's, based in Cartersville, voluntarily closed its doors for a thorough inspection and training conducted by environmental health specialists.

While it was closed, Angelo's was inspected [Wed 22 Nov 2017] by Bartow County environmental health specialists, and was allowed to reopen [Mon 27 Nov 2017]. It was subjected to a follow-up inspection [Tue 28 Nov 2017] and received a perfect score. Boss said inspectors reviewed Angelo's catering opportunities dating back to [Wed 1 Nov 2017], and said "there have been no reported problems from any of them."
