The Tropical Disease Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City reported another
patient contracted _Streptococcus suis_ or "pig bacterium" on [16 May
2011], raising the number of infected cases to 11 since the beginning
of the year [2011].

The patient, 57 [years], resides in Ninh Thuan Province and was
hospitalized with high fever and organ disorder. Doctors say the
patient was infected with _S. suis_ because of eating pig-blood curd.
Fortunately, the patient is showing signs of recovery.

According to health experts, people can contract the _S. suis_
bacterium through unhygienic or diseased pork. Infected patients show
symptoms of nausea, fever, vomiting and bleeding. Doctors have warned
people not to eat diseased pigs.

[Infection with the gram-positive bacterium _S. suis_, especially
serotype 2, is a zoonotic disease. Infection in pigs can cause
septicemia, meningitis, arthritis and sudden death in young pigs after
weaning, but the infection can also be limited to the respiratory
tract, where it causes bronchopneumonia. More information on
streptococcal infection in pigs is available at
http://www.thepigsite.com/diseaseinfo/112/streptococcal-infections.

_S. suis_ can infect pigs and other animals such as ruminants, cats,
dogs, deer and horses. It is usually transmitted [in pigs] nasally or
orally, and colonizes in the palatine tonsils of both clinically ill
and healthy pigs.

The most important risk factor in acquiring the infection [in humans]
is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products. Transmission to humans
is most likely to occur through wounds on the skin, including minor
abrasions. The incubation period ranges from a few hours to up to 3
days. Prevention of the disease in humans depends upon control in pig
populations. People with open wounds should wear gloves when handling
raw or uncooked pork, and all those who prepare pork should wash their
hands and clean their utensils thoroughly after preparation. More
information is available at
http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/streptococcus_suis/.

Transmission can also occur by eating raw infected pork meat and
organs. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see
http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201.

The source of infection is reported to have been the consumption of
pig blood curd. However, it is not reported whether the blood curd was
raw. Consumption of raw pork and raw blood of chickens, ducks, geese
or pigs is a common tradition in Viet Nam and Thailand, where
infection with _S. suis_ associated with these products has been
frequently reported; see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.

In humans, _S. suis_ has been reported to cause, most commonly,
meningitis, but also toxic shock if the strain produces the
appropriate toxins, and less commonly bacteremia, pneumonia, septic
arthritis and endocarditis.

[Most clinically healthy pigs are carriers of multiple serotypes of
_S. suis_. During parturition, piglets become colonized with _S. suis_
from vaginal secretions or while suckling. Colonized piglets carry _S.
suis_ into the nursery. Transmission between herds occurs usually by
the movement of healthy carrier pigs
