France has a new case of BSE, the country's 31st since 1990. It was found
in a herd in the Brittany town of Plonevez du Faou. The animal was born in
1992, after a 1990 ban was imposed on cattle feed containing ruminant protein.
The 306 cows in the herd were slaughtered on Sunday and their carcasses
would be incinerated.
