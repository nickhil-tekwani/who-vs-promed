A man from Shenzhen province [Shenzhen is a city in Guangdong province], China has died from an infection with the "brain-eating amoeba", _Naegleria fowleri_ in early September [2016], according to a Chinese media account.

According to the report, the man contracted the lethal parasite after "bathing in water" at a scenic spot in the province with his family in August [2016].

In less than a week, the patient experienced symptoms including a headache, but attributed it to a cold. However, one week after bathing in the water, the man's condition worsened and he was admitted to the hospital, where he died on 3 Sep [2016].

The Department of Infectious Diseases at Shenzhen's No. 3 People's Hospital reported that the man died from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by _N. fowleri_.

_Naegleria fowleri_ is a relatively rare, pathogenic amoeba found in warm or hot freshwater like lakes, rivers and hot springs. It is also possible to get it from dirty unchlorinated or under-chlorinated swimming pools. The amoeba does not live in salt water or in swimming pools and hot tubs that are properly cleaned, maintained and treated with chlorine.

[This is the 1st report of meningoencephalitis due to _Naegleria fowleri_ from mainland China. A previous case has been reported from Hong Kong in 1993 (Wang A et al. Successful treatment of amoebic meningoencephalitis in a Chinese living in Hong Kong. Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 1993;95:249-52). _N. fowleri_ has been found in environmental samples from Taiwan (Kao PM et al. Application of TaqMan qPCR for the detection and monitoring of Naegleria species in reservoirs used as a source for drinking water. Parasitol Res. 2014;113:3765-71) and a single report from northeastern China reported _Naegleria_ spp. in 92.9 percent of surface water samples (Wang W et al. Isolation and identification of naegleria species from environmental water in Changchun, northeastern China. Iran J Parasitol. 2014;9:254-9).

It would be expected to find _Naegleria_ and other free living amoeba in all climate zones except the Arctic. A recent review of the distribution of _N. fowleri_ and its different genotypes discusses the evolution (De Jonckheere JF. Origin and evolution of the worldwide distributed pathogenic amoeboflagellate Naegleria fowleri. Infect Genet Evol. 2011;11:1520-8). It is important to genotype isolates from human cases to understand if _N. fowleri_ is evolving into a more pathogenic parasite and to elucidate reservoirs and transmission routes. - Mod.EP
