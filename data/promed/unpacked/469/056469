In Wajir, 2 more people have died of suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) bringing death toll to 4 as panic grips the county.

Wajir county's chief health officer Noor Sheikh Mohamed said the 2 deaths occurred outside the local referral hospital but have not independently verified the report. "We cannot exactly confirm the 2 deaths, but we have sent a team on the ground for confirmation since the area has low network connectivity and the victims died away from our facilities," Mr Mohamed said.

The 1st 2 victims, both male, died on [4 Jun 2018] at the Wajir Referral Hospital.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), RVF is an acute, fever-causing viral disease most commonly observed in domesticated animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels, which has the ability to infect and cause illness in humans. The disease is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) and was first reported in livestock by veterinary officers in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early 1910s. The disease has been reported in Basir and Lakoley areas in Eldas sub-county.

Hundreds of livestock continue to die in the area due to the outbreak with camels and goats the most affected. In an earlier interview with the Nation, Mr Mohamed said that all the victims had shown symptoms of RVF but they had sent blood samples to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for further tests. The county health chief said the county will issue a detailed report on the suspected RVF outbreak on [Thu 7 Jun 2018].

Medical personnel have already been deployed in the affected areas to treat victims and contain the disease.

[Interestingly, an alert was issued 2 weeks ago over the possible outbreak of RVF in parts of the country due to the ongoing rains. The alert from the ministries of health and agriculture named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703).

According to the director of veterinary services, Obadiah Njagi, there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF, a viral disease of livestock which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals," he said.

Mod. AS noted in that post, "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquitoborne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

"Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures.

"Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. Aedes mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.

"Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.

"Parts of the above information and much more on RVF, its epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention is available in Chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf. - Mod.AS"
