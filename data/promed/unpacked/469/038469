Struggling to recover from a devastating health crisis, the
once-booming salmon farming industry in Chile faces an uncertain
future, experts say.

Once 2nd in the world only to Norway, the country's industry saw
production cut in half by the infectious salmon anemia virus that
spread through the fish farms in the southern Chilean regions of Los
Lagos, Aysen and Magallanes, Inter Press Service reported Sunday [15 Aug 2010].

Experts blame the collapse on the speed of the industry's growth and
the lack of government control or oversight.

"Salmon farming expanded quickly, without a regulatory framework or
adequate controls to prevent and anticipate environmental problems or
the development of transmittable fish diseases," Carlos Chavez, an
expert in environmental economy and natural resources at the
University of Concepcion, said.

The virus forced producers to harvest fish early and shut down
operations in order to clear the waters, and the fish farms hit
bottom in January 2009.

In 2007 and 2008, Chile produced an estimated 650 000 tons, while
this year [2010], the yield is predicted to be between 250 000 and
300 000 tons.

Of the 55 000 direct and indirect jobs in the industry during its
boom times, only 25 000 remain.

"The situation is catastrophic, with former workers losing their
homes and no money to send their children to school or even to eat,"
Javier Ugarte, president of the National Confederation of Salmon Workers, says.
