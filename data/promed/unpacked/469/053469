West Nile virus is becoming a more serious issue in horses; rates are rising in Alberta, and 1/3 of the horses which become infected will die.

But there is a way to protect your horses, said veterinarian Melissa Smith of West Wind Veterinary Hospital in Sherwood Park.

"There are vaccines available for West Nile," she said. "It is one we consider a core vaccination for horses. We know any horse can be exposed, and it is a disease seen in our area, and it can have severe consequences such as death."

West Nile is mosquito borne, and horses can contract the virus from just one mosquito bite. Every horse is at risk of equal exposure, said Smith. "It is Canada-wide, and Alberta has the highest number of cases," she said.

In 2017, there were only 54 cases in Canada, with 11 cases in Alberta. But last year [2018], the number of confirmed cases nationally jumped to 123 with 72 cases -- nearly 3/5ths -- in Alberta. Saskatchewan had 32 cases, and Ontario was a distant 3rd at 11, with Manitoba, B.C., and Quebec accounting for the remaining handful.

"There will be some unreported cases as well, since some don't get diagnosed, and some die. It's likely higher. That's something to consider as well," said Smith, who so far, hasn't seen a case of West Nile at her clinic.

It takes about 2 weeks for a horse to show signs of the disease after being bitten by a virus-carrying mosquito. Many horses will not show any signs. Those that do often have flu-like signs, such as fever and lethargy. Some horses will show neurological signs such as being uncoordinated in their hind legs and stumbling. Others can suffer a seizure or become comatose, but this is less common. "Some report that they are hypersensitive to touch, but this is also less common," said Smith.

It's important to book an appointment with the veterinarian if a horse is acting in an off manner, because early detection of the disease can help to prevent a fatal outcome.

"You should have an exam done to pinpoint where the abnormality is coming from, because it could be something very mild in some horses and very severe in others," she said.

If a veterinarian suspects West Nile, he or she needs to confirm it with a lab (with positive cases reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which tracks disease surveillance).

West Nile is not transmissible from horse to horse, and a horse cannot spread it to a human. [It is spread to horses by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes also spread it to humans. - Mod.TG]

Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or drugs available for West Nile. The only option is supportive care. Smith said a horse infected with West Nile would likely need to be hospitalized. The main treatment is to try to prevent the disease from taking hold in the 1st place, which is why vaccines are so important. They are available as a single vaccine or in combination with vaccines for other common horse diseases.

Smith said her clinic recommends West Nile vaccines for all horses, and the majority of horse owners she works with are taking her advice. The initial vaccination requires 2 injections a few weeks apart and then a yearly booster.

"That coincides with other core vaccines like tetanus that come in a combination," said Smith, adding that her clinic uses a combination providing protection for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), tetanus, and West Nile virus (WNV).

Ideally, it's best to have a mare vaccinated since a foal is susceptible on its 1st day of life. However, a foal born to a vaccinated mare receives antibodies from drinking its mother's colostrum. The young horse should later start its own vaccination schedule.

To reduce the presence of mosquitoes around horses, producers can use fly sheets, sprays [approved for use in horses], or a burn pit producing smoke to reduce the presence of mosquitoes. Smith recommends minimizing free-standing water around the farmyard.

"If the horses are in a wooded or marshy area, they may be in an increased risk," she said. "All it takes is one mosquito. You can try to reduce your mosquito burden, but all it takes is one."

[Choosing to protect your horse from one disease also means it needs protection from multiple diseases. Use of combination vaccines in most cases is the best method.

Reduce or eliminate any standing water providing breeding places for mosquitoes. This may include the water in the catch pan of potted plants or in old tires, or persistent standing water from a break in a pipe. Sometimes with heavy rains or prolonged rainy seasons, eliminating standing water is even more important.

While using smoke to drive off the mosquitoes may work, it may also cause your horse some respiratory trouble. If using fly/mosquito repellent, be sure it is approved for use on horses. This is critical so as not to poison your horse when seeking to help it. - Mod.TG
