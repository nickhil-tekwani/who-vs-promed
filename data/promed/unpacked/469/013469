First Report of Onion yellow dwarf virus, Leek yellow stripe virus, and
Garlic common latent virus in Garlic in Washington State
--------------------------------------------------------
H. R. Pappu, Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State
University, Pullman 99164; B. C. Hellier and F. M. Dugan, USDA-ARS,
Western Regional Plant Introduction Station, Washington State
University, Pullman 99164. Plant Dis. 89:205, 2005; published on-line
as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0205C. Accepted for publication 23 Nov 2004.

Washington State ranks 4th in the country in garlic (_Allium
sativum_) production (2). The impact of viruses on garlic production
may be significant in Washington State, but little is known about the
occurrence or identity of specific viruses (2). The USDA-ARS Western
Regional Plant Introduction Station (WRPIS) collects, maintains, and
distributes garlic accessions. As part of the regeneration process,
accessions are grown in field conditions at the WRPIS farm in
Pullman, WA.
In June 2004, several WRPIS accessions developed symptoms indicative
of viral infection, primarily chlorotic spots and yellow stripes on
leaves and scapes. Cultivars Georgia Fire and Georgia Crystal showed
more than 90 percent incidence of symptomatic plants. Some chlorotic
spots appeared similar to those caused by Iris yellow spot virus on
other _Allium_ spp. such as _A. cepa_.
However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with IYSV-specific primers (1) did
not reveal the presence of IYSV. Degenerate, group-specific primers
to potyviruses (3) and carlaviruses (courtesy of S. D. Wyatt) were
used on total nucleic acids extracted from each symptomatic plant
with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The samples (n = 26) gave an
RT-PCR product of the expected size with the group-specific potyvirus
RT-PCR test. One sample was positive with the carlavirus group RT-PCR
test.
RT-PCR products from both tests were cloned and sequenced.
Comparisons with sequences in GenBank showed that all but one had
Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV), whereas one sample had a mixed
infection of OYDV and Leek yellow stripe virus. Sequence analysis
showed that the carlavirus was Garlic common latent virus. Sequence
identities ranged from 95-99 percent for each of the viruses when
compared with those available in GenBank. All samples were then
tested for each of these viruses with commercially available
antisera. Results of ELISA confirmed the findings of RT-PCR.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report for each of these garlic
viruses from Washington State. This finding prompts the need for
evaluating all garlic accessions for the potential impact of these
viruses on garlic germ plasm conservation and distribution.

[OYDV is transmitted by _Myzus persicae_ and other aphid species, or
mechanically to onions and other crops such as garlic, leek and some
narcissus species. It is not spread by seed, but infected bulbs (transplants
and volunteers) always produce diseased plants and serve as a source of
contamination for following seasons, especially when aphid populations are
high. Disease management relies on use of disease-free transplants and crop
rotation out of onion production for at least 3 years. Other disease
management recommendations include isolation from other susceptible crops or
volunteer [self-sown] onions. Insecticides may suppress vector populations
but generally are not necessary or effective.
Garlic common latent carlavirus is of minor significance, but combined
with other viruses can cause severe disease in Europe, South and
Central America, India and China. Leek yellow stripe potyvirus causes
severe disease in autumn and winter leek crops in western Europe and
is probably present in leek production areas worldwide.
