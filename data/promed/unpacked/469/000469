[There was a posting some time earlier this year in which I recommended
that horses and cattle be vaccinated for rabies. Some readers seemed to
think this was unnecessary. But I would ask you to note there was a horse
and a cow confirmed with rabies in July. Horses often eat out of your hand,
or your child's hand. This is a very cheap and reliable preventative for
this fatal disease. Cows can and do get rabies. Although not everyone hand
feeds their cattle, some may, especially show animals. This disease is not
something to toy with. It is worth the effort and the few dollars to
prevent this disease. -Mod.TG
