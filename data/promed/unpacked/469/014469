Viet Nam: 2 More Deaths Raise the Total to 9 in 3 Weeks
---------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam reported 2 more avian influenza deaths on Sat 22 Jan 2005,
bringing the human toll to 9 in 3 weeks and further raising the threat of
the disease emerging as the next global pandemic, officials said. The
string of deaths -- which include 5 this week alone -- has prompted the
World Health Organization (WHO) to ring alarm bells about the high fatality
rate (more than 70 percent of those infected have died) and the lack of
field research to answer critical questions about how the virus is
transmitted, especially since no vaccine or effective treatment exists.
A 35-year-old woman from the southern Mekong Delta province Dong Thap died
Fri 21 Jan 2005, a day after being admitted to the Hospital for Tropical
Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, said Nguyen Ngoc An, Director of Dong Thap's
Preventive Medicine Centre. She tested positive for the H5N1 serotype of
avian influenza virus, An said. The woman developed a high fever a week
after slaughtering a duck, but none of her family members who ate the bird
showed any sign of the disease, An said, adding the woman did not eat the
duck. An said authorities suspected the woman might also have been infected
by stork droppings in her lotus pond where she often worked.
A 17-year-old boy from southern Bac Lieu province, who died 15 Jan 2005.
15, also tested positive for avian influenza, a local health official said
on condition of anonymity. The boy slaughtered a chicken before showing
symptoms, officials said.
The WHO has warned that the outbreak is gaining momentum as Viet Nam's busy
Lunar New Year approaches next month. The latest deaths bring Viet Nam's
toll from avian influenza to 9 since 30 Dec 2004. During 2004, the virus
spread to 10 Asian countries, killing or forcing the slaughter of about 100
million birds.
Since that outbreak, 29 people in Viet Nam and 12 in Thailand have died.

[As of 21 Jan 2005, the WHO cumulative count of confirmed human cases of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam since 28 Jan 2004 was
35, of whom 27 had died.
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_01_
21/en/>
The 2 cases described above bring the total of confirmed cases in Viet Nam
to 37, 29 of whom have died. There may be some doubt about the reliability
of the diagnosis in the case of the 17-year-old boy, however, since the
official who released the report requested anonymity. - Mod.CP]

Prime Minister Orders Urgent Action to Prevent Further Spread of Avian
Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Health, 8 people have so far tested
H5N1-positive. Of them, 6 have died, one is in critical condition at the
Tropical Diseases Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, and the other is being
treated at the Tropical Diseases Hospital in Hanoi.
By Sat 22 Jan 2005, the Tropical Diseases Hospital in Hanoi has received 5
patients with pneumonia, 2 of whom have died. One has been confirmed to
have contracted the H5N1 virus and the other has no test results. Among the
3 remaining patients, one tested positive for H5N1. He is the younger
brother of the dead patient.
Meanwhile, 2 more patients were hospitalised at the Tropical Diseases
Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on Fri 21 Jan 2995. One of them, coming from
Dong Thap province, died several hours after being hospitalised. Doctors
took blood samples for tests. 6 other children suspected of avian
infections are being treated at Nhi Dong 1 (Children 1) hospital in the city.
The Ministry sent a report on developments of the disease to the Government
and asked for VND80 billion [USD 5 million] to purchase medical equipment,
respirators, and chemicals for the 3 regions across the country. Earlier,
on Thu 20 Jan 2005, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem, on behalf of the
Prime Minister, ordered ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government
agencies and provincial and municipal People's Committees to take strict
measures to prevent the spread of pneumonia caused by avian influenza type
A (H5N1) virus. According to the Health Ministry, pneumonia caused by the
H5N1 avian virus has been developing and becoming complicated. To take
urgent prevention measures, the Government assigned the Health Ministry to
co-operate with other ministries, services and localities to immediately
discover how the H5N1-infected patients contracted the disease; and
urgently to work out a plan to mobilise all existing resources, workforces
and equipment to treat patients when an epidemic occurs, and submit it to
the PM before 27 Jan 2005.
The prevention of avian influenza and its transmission to humans must be
given top priority, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dzung told an
inter-provincial meeting in Hanoi on Fri 21 Jan 2005. He asked localities
and the mass media to boost information dissemination to raise public
awareness about avian influenza. He requested both unaffected and affected
areas to tighten control over poultry slaughtering, processing, and
transportation to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
