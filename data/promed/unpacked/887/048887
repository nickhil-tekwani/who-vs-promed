A 31-year-old man, resident of Aparecida de Goiania, but who worked on
a farm in Uruacu, 287km from Goiania [capital of Goias state], was
employed 60 days ago in cutting down forest on [another] farm near the
Rio Tres Passos, in the north of the state. He fell ill and was
hospitalized in Uruacu with typical symptoms of jaundice, hemorrhages
in the skin and eyes, and liver failure. He was transferred to the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Goiania. The results of lab tests
will be ready in a week. The patient said he was vaccinated against
YF more than 20 years ago. [Although revaccination is recommended
every 10 years, it is believed that protection is actually life-long.
? Mod.JW] The patient died on Fri 4 Jan 2007.
Monkeys have been dying in 36 municipalities in the state (none of
which were where the victim had worked), and 3 have been confirmed as
YF deaths, including 2 in Aparecida de Goiania [where he lived before
going to Uruacu] and one in the capital, Goiania, itself. Amid fears
of an urban outbreak, 734 000 people have already been vaccinated
against YF across the state, and the campaign against _Aedes aegypti_,
the mosquito which transmits both YF & dengue in the cities, has been
intensified.

[The incubation period of YF is 3-6 days, which excludes the Rio Tres
Passos area as being the source, and suggests the Uruacu area -- unless
he made a short visit home to Aparecida de Goiania before returning to
Uruacu and falling ill.
On 20 Dec 2007, in the light of human and monkey cases of YF, the
state of Sao Paulo issued a YF alert to travelers in the north of the
state, part of the so-called "transition zone" between the endemic
and the risk-free zones -- see
<http://www.cve.saude.sp.gov.br/htm/zoo/fa_alerta.htm> [in Portuguese].
The hospitalization of an acute case of YF in Uruacu and subsequently
in the state capital, Goiania, which are both infested with the vector
mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, carries a risk of urbanization (spread in
the cities) of the disease, as is well recognized by the Brazilian
authorities.
International travelers to Brazil should, if not contra-indicated for
age or medical reasons, make sure they are vaccinated at least 10 days
before arrival for their own protection, even if their travel agent
and/or travel
clinic tells them it is not required for entry into the country (which
is technically correct). However, for travel to endemic and
transition zones within the country, all travelers may be required to
show proof of YF vaccination -- and there is always the risk, as shown
here, of an urban outbreak.

Aparecida de Goiania is immediately south of the capital, Goiania.
Uruacu is found well to the north:
