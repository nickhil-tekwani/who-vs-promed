Woman struck down by bat virus 2 years after bite
-------------------------------------------------------------
By CHRISTOPHER NIESCHE
9 Dec 1998
A WOMAN was seriously ill in a north Queensland hospital last night,
suffering from the effects of bat Lyssavirus - two years after being
bitten by a sick bat.
The woman was bitten before the infection was identified in humans in
Australia and before any information about vaccination and
bat-handling precautions had been circulated.
Australia's only other case of the virus occurred in 1996 when a
woman, 39, from Rockhampton in central Queensland, died two weeks
after being bitten by a bat.
Jeffrey Hanna, of Queensland Health's tropical health unit, said the
disease had apparently been lying dormant in the woman's system until
she admitted herself to hospital last week complaining of fever and
muscle aches. The woman, in her 30s, had encephalitis - a viral
infection of the brain.
Dr Hanna said: "She is extremely ill. We assume the outcome is going
to be poor."
The woman was bitten at a party when a bat attacked a child. The
woman tried to remove the bat and was bitten on the finger.
Dr Hanna said: "With hindsight, it's quite clear this bat was
behaving abnormally and aggressively - after testing, those bats
often tend to come back Lyssavirus-positive."
Other people at the party, who might have come into contact with the
bat, had been contacted by Queensland Health for testing.
The two-year incubation period for the disease was much longer than
usual, but not out of the ordinary [see below, and there could be
similar cases.
Dr Hanna said: "There may, of course, have been people who have
been bitten and chosen not to seek medical advice. It's inevitable
there will be more cases."
Bat Lyssavirus, a rabies-like disease, causes inflammation of the
brain and is thought to be spread by being bitten or scratched by an
infected bat.
Since the first case was diagnosed, [rabies vaccines have been
supplied to people who regularly come into contact with bats and
procedures [have been implemented for bat handling.
Dr Hanna said anyone finding an injured bat should contact a wildlife
carer who was trained to handle native animals, and not try to treat
the animals themselves. "Bat handlers are encouraged to follow all
necessary precautions," he said. "People need not be concerned about
bats or flying foxes in trees or if they fly overhead."

We have spent the past 24 hours attempting to obtain details additional
to those in this press report. We understand that Jeff Hanna is in
the field investigating the epidemiology of this case and, although we
have sent an e-mail message asking him for more details, these would be
inevitably delayed in returning.
Informally, we have learned that the bite occurred at Mackay, some 250 km
north of Rockhampton on the Queensland coast, in late August 1996 at a
party, indicating that the incubation period was about 27 months. The
bite occurred before the virulence of the virus for humans was confirmed
by the Rockhampton case, the first evidence of human disease.
Post-exposure vaccination was recommended by the public health
authorities subsequently, but not taken up by the patient.
Second hand reports have it that the clinical presentation of this most
recent case was typical of rabies with parasthesia and CNS signs; the
requirement for ventilation was rapid. Diagnosis was made by PCR.
Perhaps Greg Smith, Queensland Health, Brisbane, might be willing to
provide additional details as time permits.
The etiologic agent, variously called Australian bat lyssavirus,
Pteropid lyssavirus & Ballina virus (for the place where the first
human infection was contracted), is a rhabdovirus, closely related to
but distinguishable from rabies virus. Still, rabies vaccine protects
against infection with this virus and so it would seem that these
viruses might be genetically and even antigenically distinct but, at
the end of the day, they are sufficiently close that it would not be
incorrect to call the disease in Australia rabies and the virus a
rabies virus. That's a virologic and biologic view. The political
view from Australia seems quite distinct as Australia has never
admitted the presence of rabies virus there, except when introduced
by humans already incubating rabies virus acquired elsewhere.
The long incubation period of Ballina virus is not inordinate when one
recognizes similar incubation periods in rabies virus infections acquired
by peripheral inoculation, i.e., bites on extremities.
People in Australia love flying foxes and some are taking great care to
look out for their welfare; I have heard of humans breast-feeding
suckling bats there. Nice gesture but no one knows
about the age of acquisition of Ballina virus in bats, the prevalence of
infection, or the human risk factors for acquiring infection, other than
being bitten or scratched.
I'd hate to say that two human cases caused by this virus represents an
emerging disease but what else can one call it?
