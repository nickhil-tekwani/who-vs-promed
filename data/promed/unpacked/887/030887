An analysis of human exposure to H7N9 avian influenza in China's Zhejiang province over the past 3 waves found that patterns haven't changed much since live poultry markets were shuttered in central urban areas and that a spike in infections during the 5th wave was mainly linked to areas where the poultry markets weren't closed, such as in suburban areas. A team based in Zhejiang province, which has the highest proportion of cases since the virus was first detected in 2013, reported their findings today [15 Dec 2017] in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.

In an attempt to curb human illnesses, Zhejiang province in July 2014 permanently closed live poultry markets in the biggest urban areas. Across all 3 waves, most cases were reported from rural areas, and a similar percentage in all 3 waves reported exposure to poultry markets, raising poultry at home, or in occupational settings. However, during the 5th wave, the team saw a shift toward exposure at markets that weren't closed.

Researchers found no major demographic changes over the 3 waves that might shed light on the surge of illnesses seen in the 5th wave. However, like earlier reports from China as a whole, they did see a wider geographic distribution of cases. They also noted that an increasing proportion of rural cases were linked to contact with sick and dead poultry.

New H7N9 cases were also reported from major urban areas in Zhejiang province's 5th wave, hinting at possible illegal trade. Also, they said massive closures in central urban areas could be driving the distribution of infected poultry to markets in outlying areas. They concluded that more efforts are needed to educate the public about the risk of exposure to sick and dead poultry and that stronger surveillance is needed in rural areas. Also, they said further expansion of live poultry market closures should be considered, if possible.

[The summary of the paper referred to above (Ref 1) follows:
"1. Background: The sudden increase of the number of human cases infected with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus after September 2016 raised global concern.
"2. Objectives: To assess the changes of epidemiological characteristics of H7N9 cases since the massive closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in the main urban areas in Zhejiang province.
"3. Methods: We used descriptive statistics to compare epidemiological characteristics of the three distinct waves of H7N9 cases in Zhejiang province. The rural or urban cases were defined according to the location where the patients had exposure within 2 weeks before illness onset.
"4. Results: Between July 2014 and June 2017, 166 H7N9 cases were reported in Zhejiang province, with 45, 34, and 87 cases reported in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th waves respectively. Across the 3 waves, most reported cases were from rural areas. A similar percentage of cases in all 3 waves reported exposure to LPMs, raising poultry at home or around the house, as well as occupational exposure. Compared to the 3rd (80 percent) and 4th waves (70.59 percent), a significantly larger proportion of cases from the non-LPMs closure areas were observed in the 5th wave (89.66 percent) (p=0.034).
"5. Conclusion: Epidemiological characteristics of human cases infected with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus had generally remained unchanged since the massive closure of LPMs in the main urban area of Zhejiang province. The sudden increase of the number of H7N9 cases in the 5th wave were mainly attributed to the excessive cases reported from areas where LPMs were not permanently closed."

On 17 Dec 2017, Chinese media reported the detection of the H7 virus (assumed, H7N9) in 4 of 32 poultry samples collected from live bird markets in Changde City, Hunan Province. It was indicated that no human H7N9 cases have been reported in Changde City this year, but that the findings were a reminder that the virus remains active, particularly in live bird markets (see http://afludiary.blogspot.fr/2017/12/china-4-h7-positive-samples-taken-from.html).
