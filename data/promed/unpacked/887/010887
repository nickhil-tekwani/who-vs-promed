[The recurrence of Bluetongue in Spain, after its absence since the
beginning of 2005, might indicate that the virus has become established in
the Iberian peninsula. The virus, borne by culicoides midges, has
demonstrated for decades a seasonal pattern in the affected Mediterranean
countries, mainly in the Middle-East. The disease began its spread
westwards and northwards in 1999. Mainland Spain was initially affected in
Oct 2004 by BTV serotype 4, the outbreak subsiding as expected when
temperatures dropped, namely at the end of December.
In susceptible breeds of sheep, Bluetongue manifests as clinically severe
with high mortality rates. Clinical Bluetongue disease in cattle in the
Middle-East and Africa is rare; most infected bovines are asymptomatic,
though viraemia might reach high titers. The disease in cattle is generally
diagnosed retrospectively, serologically. However, according to the current
report, the disease seems to have been diagnosed 3 days after onset. Have
cows manifested clinical symptoms? The disease in sheep allows virus
isolation from blood, particularly during the febrile period.
This notification is missing required data pertaining to symptoms,
morbidity and mortality rates, the diagnostic methods applied, and the
serotype involved. - Mod.AS]
