The Ministry of Health and Social Services yesterday, 3 Mar 2014, said 18 people have died of cholera countrywide since November 2013, while 554 cases were confirmed. The ministry announced in a statement recently that it was working closely with WHO and Unicef and other stakeholders, to contain the cholera outbreak reported in 6 regions across the country.

The disease was first reported in the Opuwo district in the northwestern region of Kunene in November 2013 where 493 cases were confirmed. "Since then other regions such as Omusati, Oshana, and Ohangwena were affected," said health spokesperson Ester Paulus.

Paulus said on 20 Jan 2014, the ministry declared that the situation had completely stabilised in all the regions. She said the 1st confirmed case of cholera in Windhoek was on 5 Feb 2014 in the informal settlements of Katutura, where overcrowding, as well as poor hygiene and sanitation conditions put the population at risk and increased the risk of further transmission.

"So far 39 suspected cases have been recorded in Windhoek with 2 confirmed cases, including 2 deaths," she said.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Northern Province)

The cholera that has broken out in Mpulungu district [Northern Province] should be brought under control as soon as possible to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the country. That there have been 10 cases recorded already in the rural district is worrying because human life is at risk.

District commissioner Juliana Chizu said on Thu 27 Feb 2014, 3 people are admitted to Mpulungu Health Centre and that 6 others had been discharged.

Cholera is not new to Zambia as it has been breaking out almost every rainy season.

In January 2013, it broke out in Nchelenge where it killed 3 people and left 64 others hospitalized, but an intensive intervention by the government and members of the community prevented the loss of more lives and the further spread of the disease.

No fewer than 10 people have died of cholera outbreak, out of 61 cases recorded in Bauchi State in the last 3 weeks.

The Executive Secretary, Primary Health Care Development Agency in Bauchi State, Dr Nisser Umar, disclosed this on Sat 1 Mar 2014, in an interview with newsmen in Bauchi.

While lamenting the high level of poor sanitation among the people, especially those in the rural areas of the state, Umar said of the 61 cases recorded, more than half of the number were Amajiri children. He said the government was doing all within its power to control the epidemic.

Cholera outbreak has claimed more than 30 lives in Benue State within 30 days, while several victims are on admission in health facilities across the state.

Weekly Trust survey of several hospitals in Makurdi revealed that many adults and children had been afflicted by the epidemic who were seen helplessly on their sick bed. Though, the state Ministry of Health said it has recorded lesser number of deaths, reliable sources said more than 30 people had lost their lives in Wadata and North Bank area of Makurdi, worst hit by the disease within the last month.

At the Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH), the head of Public Relations Unit, Cephas Hough, said no such single case has been reported and that the hospital is well equipped to take care of any eventuality. But the Jolua Hospital, Wadata in Makurdi, Dr Adole Edoh who said 2 deaths had been recorded from cholera, also noted that 80 percent of the cases treated so far since the return of the dry season with its many epidemics were cholera-related.

Similarly, authorities of the Hope Hospital, Wadata said the ailment has claimed 2 lives in their facilities while many others are admitted in different critical stages. The hospital's matron, Agata Zack Nyitgher, said their personnel were currently handling over 30 cases of cholera. "So far, we have lost a boy and a 37-year-old man," she added.

While at the Madonna Hospital Wurukum, the Medical Director, Dr Ameh Idoko, explained that the WHO has confirmed cases of cholera in his hospital.

The situation is no different at the Musab Hospital located on Ikeja Street, Wadata with over 10 deaths recorded and more than 85 cases attended to. A medical personnel who spoke on condition of anonymity said at least 20 persons were currently on admission at the facility based on suspicion of the disease.

Weekly Trust gathered at the workshop that Benue State government has so far recorded 307 cases of cholera with 10 deaths since the outbreak of the disease.
