[There clearly is an outbreak ongoing in the Riyadh area. In the 3-day hiatus since the last update, there have been a total of 5 newly confirmed cases, all of whom were from Riyadh. Since 11 May 2015 there have been 28 cases reported from Riyadh, with 18 having been reported since 21 Jul 2015. All but 2 of the cases reported since 21 Jul 2015 have given either a positive history of contact with other known cases or a possible history of contact that was stated to be currently under review (the 2 denying a history of contact with cases were reported on 5 and 6 Aug 2015 and are detailed above). As the information provided on the Saudi MOH website just specifies any contact with known MERS-CoV infected case(s), and WHO follow-up confirmations do not always contain full details of investigations into possible high-risk exposures, it has been difficult to determine if this outbreak is community based or in the healthcare environment. From the occurrence of cases in healthcare workers (see case no. 1 in today's report above, and case no. 3 in MERS-CoV (100): Saudi Arabia, South Korea 20150804.3558326), and the report of a hospital acquired case (case no. 1 in the WHO update from 6 Aug 2015 in section [2] below), it is clear there is a healthcare environment component to this outbreak.

That being said, according to a MOH statement on 6 Aug 2015, there has also been the involvement of a large family cluster in Riyadh with the index case having a history of camel contact (the father -- most likely the 56-year-old male reported on 22 Jul 2015), and involvement of his wife (a fatality, most likely the 52-year-old female reported on 23 Jul 2015), one of their sons, the father's brother and an asymptomatic infected individual (not reported as a case as it was asymptomatic) detected through contact tracing. According to the MOH, there have been other family clusters, a family of 7 in Al-Ahsa province, and also clusters in Taif and Riyadh, all related to an index case with contact with camels. The commonality of the family clusters involves contact with camels and camel products as well as living in a large common household (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News-2015-08-06-001.aspx for details of MOH statement -- in Arabic).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [28 and 29 Jul 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the cases
1- A 67-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [11 Jun 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [14 Jun 2015]. On [26 Jul 2015], while hospitalized, he developed pneumonia. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [28 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases that were admitted to the same hospital (case n. 2 -- see DON published on [24 Jul 2015]; case n. 3, 5 -- see DON published on [29 Jul 2015]) or with shared health care workers is ongoing. [Reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 Jul 2015 and as a fatality on 4 Aug 2015. - Mod.MPP]

2- A 44-year-old female from Alkharj city developed symptoms on [16 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [26 Jul 2015]. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [27 Jul 2015]. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. [Reported as a newly confirmed case on 28 Jul 2015. - Mod.MPP]

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 2 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in a previous DON on [29 Jul 2015] (case n. 3, 6).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1384 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 495 related deaths.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.

Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.

[Periodically it is interesting to review the WHO Advice section contained in each of the MERS-CoV update reports by WHO as it serves as a reminder of the persistent challenges facing the public health community with respect to MERS-CoV. Paragraph 2 serves as a reminder to use precautions on all patients with respiratory infections as early symptoms/signs of MERS-CoV can be the same as other respiratory agents -- with the recurrent health facility based outbreaks in the Middle East and the recent episode in South Korea, it appears as though this advise is not routinely adhered to. Paragraph 3 starts with "Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, ..." a reminder that although MERS-CoV in humans has been documented as occurring now since April 2012 (over 3 years), we still do not understand the disease, the risk factors for more severe disease, and how to prevent the sporadic infections. - Mod.MPP]

Coronavirus rampant due to camels: WHO
--------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has attributed the lack of control over the MERS coronavirus in the Kingdom [Saudi Arabia], compared to South Korea which got rid of the disease completely within 2 months, to camels.

Christian Ndmir, WHO spokesman, said: "In the Kingdom, camel is the animal source that causes coronavirus outbreak, although the virus is transmitted by infected persons who are often in health care facilities, such as hospitals and medical clinics."

In contrast, there was one source for the disease outbreak in South Korea, represented in an infected individual returning from the Middle East with coronavirus, therefore, it was somehow easier to break the chain of transmission there, Ndmir said.

On the WHO plan for Umrah and Haj seasons, Ndmir said: "There will be coordination with the Ministry of Health, as has been over several years, to strengthen oversight and ensure that pilgrims from other countries be notified in advance of the best ways to protect themselves from infection."

Generally, the WHO urges all pilgrims to pay special attention on personal hygiene, following the health prevention procedures. Moreover, travelers should head immediately to the medical staff if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities.

[My key question when reading the above media report was: why is there no mention of the index case in Korea's high-risk exposures? According to the earlier reports related to this case that include media reports, the MOH of South Korea reports, and the WHO reports, all mentioned the index case had a history of travel to several Middle Eastern countries where cases of MERS-CoV have been reported (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar) ... but (and this is a big BUT) the index case denied a history of exposure to camels and camel products, and denied a history of having sought health care at a health facility or healthcare provider while in the Middle East. Hence, this most likely reflects community-based transmission in one or more of the locations this individual visited. Yes, the body of literature has been making a strong case for implicating the camel in the transmission cycle in the Middle East, where infected juvenile camels have active nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV infections, and similar viruses have been identified in human cases with known contact with these infected camels (see suggested references below). But that being said, a large proportion of the "sporadic cases" reported from the Middle East are individuals such as the index case in the South Korean outbreak -- individuals with no history of exposure to camels or camel products, and no history of contact with other known MERS-CoV cases. The retrospective serosurvey conducted in Saudi Arabia from 1 Dec 2012 to 1 Dec 2013 (ref. 3 below) speaks to that observation as the estimated seroprevalence for past exposure to the MERS-CoV was that 44 951 individuals older than age 15 years had been previously infected with the MERS-CoV, whereas during the same period there were approximately 700 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV (38): Saudi Arabia, new fatalities, serosurvey 20150416.3291924).

So yes, there is zoonotic transmission of the MERS-CoV and most likely involving the dromedary camel, but that is not the only explanation for the continued transmission of the MERS-CoV in the Middle East.
