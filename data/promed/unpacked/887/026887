Spain: Mumps outbreak in young adults following a village festival in
the Navarra region, August 2006
---------------------------------------------------
On 10 Aug 2006, 12 cases of mumps were notified from a village of
around 3500 inhabitants in Navarra, northern Spain. In 2005, the
Public Health Institute of Navarra received only 33 mumps
notifications for the whole region of Navarra (population 560 000).
Since December 2005, mumps outbreaks have been reported from several
regions of Spain [1] including the neighbouring region of La Rioja.
An investigation into the outbreak in Navarra was begun and
information on the patients' vaccination status and possible sources
of infection was collected in order to recommend measures to prevent
further spread of mumps in the area.
Mumps is a notifiable disease in Spain and vaccination was introduced
in 1981. A seroprevalence study for measles in Navarra in 1993 showed
that more than 95 percent of people between 0-34 years were
protected, indicating a high vaccine coverage for measles, mumps and rubella.
Since 1995, the childhood immunisation programme has included 2 doses
of trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, initially given
at 15 months and 11 years of age, and since 1999, given at 15 months
and 6 years of age. Since 1985, the annual incidence of mumps in
Spain has decreased, although 3 epidemics have occurred, most
recently in 2000. Between 1996 and 1998, as in most regions of Spain,
the mumps component used in Navarra included the Rubini strain, and
this was withdrawn in 1998 because it was found to have reduced
effectiveness [2,3].
Methods
-------
A probable case was defined as a person from village A who had acute
inflammation of the parotid glands on or after 1 Jul 2006. A
confirmed case was defined as a probable case with mumps IgM or an
elevated IgG or isolation of mumps virus. The mandatory notifications
of the region of Navarra was checked for patients fulfilling the case
definition. The general practitioner who worked in the only
healthcare centre in village A was asked to report additional cases
to the regional epidemiology division and to collect samples. Blood
was tested for IgM and IgG against mumps virus with ELISA; saliva and
urine were tested by PCR. A telephone questionnaire was administered
to all patients, asking them about their vaccination status, symptoms
and activities since the 15 Jul 2006. Mumps vaccination status was
verified through regional vaccination records and personal vaccination cards.
Results
-------
A total of 19 cases was identified in village A, 10 (53 percent) of
whom were male. Patients' ages ranged between 18 and 37 years.
Samples from 2 cases were laboratory tested and both were confirmed
by serology. None of the 18 patients interviewed was admitted to
hospital. One patient had orchitis. Symptom onset of the 18 patients
interviewed was between 3 to 31 August, with a peak on 8 August
[These data are presented graphically by date of onset in the
original text, which should be consulted for more detailed information].
Six patients reported that they had never been vaccinated, and a
further 2 patients reported that their vaccination status was
unknown. Eleven patients reported having been vaccinated twice, and
this was verified for 10 cases. Two of these were verified through
personal vaccination cards only, and 2 through the regional
vaccination records only; the remaining 6 were verified by checking
both records. Six of the patients who had been vaccinated twice had
received 2nd dose of mumps vaccine between 1996 and 1998, when the
Rubini vaccine was being used (Table). No patients received their 1st
MMR dose between these dates.

Village A, Navarra, Spain, August 2006 (n=19).
Vaccination history / No. of cases ( percent) / Vaccine status verified
Unvaccinated / 6 (32 percent) / 2
1 dose / 0 (0 percent) / 0
2 doses, date unknown / 1 (5 percent) / 0
2 doses, 2nd <1996 or >1998 / 4 (21 percent) / 4
2 doses, 2nd 1996-1998 / 6 (32 percent / 6
Unknown / 2 (11 percent) / 0
Total / 19 (100 percent) / 12
17 (94 percent) of the 18 patients interviewed about their activities
since 15 Jul 2006 reported attending the annual festival held in the
village from 21 to 25 Jul 2006. These traditional festivals (fiestas)
include bullfighting, processions, music, fireworks, and eating and
drinking special dishes. They are attended by people who live in the
village and many people from neighbouring villages. Other common
activities reported in the interviews included visiting the swimming
pool in the village (9 cases, 50 percent) and bars in the village (10
cases, 56 percent).
Discussion
----------
Considering the mean incubation of 18 days, the outbreak probably
began with transmission at the village festival. As we did not
conduct an analytical study, it was not possible to identify risk
factors or transmission routes. The places where there was a
possibility of close contact, and where exposure could therefore have
taken place, include the swimming pool, bars and the village
celebrations. These may well reflect the average summer activities in
villages in Spain.
Our results suggest that this outbreak occurred partly because of the
presence of susceptible people in cohorts who received a second dose
of MMR vaccine between 1996 and 1998 with the Rubini strain, even
though this group had received a different vaccine strain in the
first MMR dose. As the data for calculating vaccine effectiveness was
not collected, the precise role of the Rubini vaccine remains
unclear. The outbreak follows the known cyclical pattern of mumps,
and the presence of other susceptible persons (including
non-vaccinated people and non-responders') in the population may have
contributed to its occurrence.
Recommendations
---------------
Cases in neighbouring villages started to appear from 14 August and
further spread of mumps in Navarra seemed likely. We recommended
enhanced surveillance in schools and universities where there would
be people who had received the Rubini strain-containing vaccine at
the start of the new academic year in September. Susceptible contacts
of the cases, including those people who had been vaccinated with the
Rubini strain, were vaccinated soon after the cases were ascertained.
Follow up
---------
Despite these measures, from 1 Sep to 15 Oct 2006, 58 further cases
of mumps were notified in different places in Navarra. As the current
measures do not seem to have been effective in preventing further
spread of mumps, further studies in Spain and in other countries that
used the Rubini strain such as Switzerland, Italy and Portugal
[2,4,5] are needed to investigate whether large scale vaccination
campaigns in people vaccinated with the Rubini strain of the vaccine
would be appropriate to prevent further outbreaks within a country.
These studies should include an estimation of the costs and side
effects of revaccination with MMR in young adults and the amount
(burden) of disease that can be prevented.

[The mumps virus component of the MMR triple vaccine has varied.
Since 1990, 3 strains of mumps virus -- the Urabe, the Rubini and the
Jeryl-Lynn vaccine strains -- have been used in MMR triple vaccines
at various times. The Urabe strain was withdrawn in 1992 after an
increased risk of aseptic meningitis was reported in some countries
and replaced by the Rubini strain in some triple vaccines between
1993 and 1995 and in turn by the Jeryl-Lynn strain in most current
triple vaccine formulations.
