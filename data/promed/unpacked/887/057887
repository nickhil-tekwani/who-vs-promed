Imported Lassa Fever --- New Jersey, 2004
-----------------------------------------
Lassa fever is an acute viral illness caused by Lassa virus, which is
hosted by rodents in the _Mastomys natalensis_ species complex and rarely
imported to countries outside of those areas in Africa where the disease is
endemic (1). Lassa fever is characterized by fever, muscle aches, sore
throat, nausea, vomiting, and chest and abdominal pain. Approximately 15
percent to 20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the
illness; however, approximately 80 percent of human infections with Lassa
virus are mild or asymptomatic, and 1 percent of infections overall result
in death (1). On 28 Aug 2004, a man aged 38 years residing in New Jersey
died from Lassa fever after returning from travel to West Africa. This
report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic investigations conducted
by federal, state, and local public health agencies. The findings
illustrate the need for clinicians and public health officials to remain
alert to emerging infectious diseases and to !
institute appropriate measures to promptly identify and limit spread of
unusual pathogens.
Case Report
-----------
The patient, a businessman who was born in Liberia, had resided in the
United States for 5 years. During the 4-month period preceding
hospitalization, he had been in West Africa, commuting frequently between
Liberia and Sierra Leone, where he owned farms. One day in August 2004, the
patient began to experience fever, chills, severe sore throat, diarrhea,
and back pain. 2 days later, he left Freetown, Sierra Leone, and traveled
by airplane through London, England, arriving in Newark, New Jersey. He
then traveled from Newark to his home by train.
Within hours of his arrival in the United States, the patient sought
treatment and was hospitalized in Trenton, New Jersey, for persistent
fever, chills, sore throat, diarrhea, and back pain. On admission, the
patient was alert and had a temperature of 103.6 F (39.8 C). Differential
diagnoses at this time included malaria and typhoid fever. On the 3rd and
4th days of hospitalization, despite treatment with antimalarial and
antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, and adult
respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed. He was subsequently intubated
and mechanically ventilated. Yellow fever and Lassa fever were considered
as possible diagnoses. The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services (NJDHSS) was notified, CDC was consulted, and arrangements to
administer intravenous ribavirin under an investigational new drug protocol
were initiated. However, 6 hours later, the patient died before the drug
could be administered.
Clinical and postmortem specimens were sent to CDC for specific diagnostic
testing. Lassa fever was confirmed by using serum antigen detection,
immunohistochemical staining of postmortem liver-biopsy specimens, virus
isolation in cell culture, and sequencing of Lassa virus by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Investigation
-------------
An investigation was conducted to identify persons who might have had
direct contact with the patient or his body fluids while he was ill.
Contacts were categorized into low- and high-risk categories on the basis
of multiple criteria.
A total of 188 persons had contact with the patient during the period when
he was likely infectious; of these, 5 persons were classified as at high
risk and 183 as at low risk. The 5 at high risk were the patient's wife, 3
of their children, and the patient's brother, who was a hospital visitor;
each reportedly had unprotected exposure to the patient's body fluids
during his illness. Contacts at low risk included 9 other family members,
139 health-care workers employed at the Trenton hospital (including 42
laboratory workers, 32 nurses, and 11 physicians), and 16 laboratory
workers employed at commercial laboratories in Virginia and California. In
addition, 19 contacts at low risk were exposed as passengers on the flight
from London to Newark.
The NJDHSS notified CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine
(DGMQ) of possible travel-related exposures. Because the patient reported
illness onset 3 days before air travel, DGMQ searched for those airline
passengers who had been seated within 6 feet of the patient. Passengers
were traced by using information from travel reservation records and
customs declaration forms. 19 passengers seated near the patient were
identified. Within 5 days of notification, 13 of the 19 passengers had been
interviewed; within 8 days, 3 more had been contacted. The remaining 3
could not be contacted. 17 of 19 passengers were citizens of the United
Kingdom, and authorities in that country were notified; 2 of the passengers
were U.S. citizens. Interviewed passengers did not report contact with the
patient's body fluids and were considered to have low-risk exposure. All
passengers contacted were healthy; none reported fever as of 14 Sep 2004,
which marked the end of the 21-day incubation period for Lassa fever for
this group.
All contacts at high risk (i.e., 5 family members) were monitored for
temperature of >101 F (>38.3 C) twice daily for 21 days after their last
potential exposure to the patient on 28 Aug 2004. A public health nurse
visited the family contacts each morning and recorded their temperatures.
In the afternoon, the contacts recorded their own temperatures and reported
the results.
The majority of contacts at low risk (i.e., 9 other family members and 139
health-care workers) were instructed to record their own temperatures at
least twice daily and report the results. Other contacts at low risk (i.e.,
the 16 laboratory workers and 19 air passengers) were asked to self-monitor
for temperature of >101 F (>38.3 C) and other symptoms compatible with
Lassa fever.
No restriction was placed on work or movement for asymptomatic adults at
either high or low risk. However, to facilitate monitoring, the patient's
children were restricted from participating in school activities. None of
the contacts at high risk reported any illness compatible with Lassa fever
as of 18 Sep 2004, which ended their 21-day incubation period.

MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
This report describes the 1st case of imported Lassa fever diagnosed in the
United States since 1989 (2). In West Africa, Lassa fever is endemic,
causing 100 000 to 300 000 human infections and approximately 5000 deaths
each year (1).
Other than in regions where it is endemic, Lassa fever is encountered
rarely. Cases identified in areas where Lassa fever is not endemic usually
are imported, often by persons returning from West Africa (2). To date,
approximately 20 cases of imported Lassa fever have been reported
worldwide. The risk for human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever is low
(3,4); however, healthcare-associated transmission has occurred in areas
where Lassa fever is endemic, and one instance of asymptomatic
seroconversion was reported in a European physician (4). Meticulous
adherence to appropriate infection-control practices to prevent unprotected
exposure to blood or other body fluids is essential to the safe management
of patients with possible Lassa fever and to the protection of health-care
workers (2). Family members and others visiting a hospitalized patient must
be instructed to adhere to infection-control precautions and avoid exposure
to potentially infectious blood or body fluids.
In the absence of proven effectiveness, oral ribavirin prophylaxis was not
recommended for persons who might have been exposed to the patient
described in this report. Instead, a standard treatment regimen of
intravenous ribavirin was recommended for any contacts with clinical
evidence of infection during the incubation period. However, none of the
contacts had illness compatible with Lassa fever.
Increasing international travel has resulted in importation of microbial
agents not endemic to the United States, posing diagnostic challenges to
health-care providers. In addition to routine evaluation, clinicians should
consider both uncommon and common causes of fever (e.g., malaria) in
persons arriving from Africa. Clinical histories should include careful
assessment of travel to regions where uncommon diseases are endemic (e.g.,
for Lassa fever, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone). Every effort should
be made to expedite delivery of clinical specimens to appropriate
diagnostic laboratories.
The nonspecific presentation of Lassa fever and related viral infections
that can cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes underscores the need for
consistent application of infection-control practices. Suspected cases of
Lassa fever or related infections should be reported immediately to
hospital infection-control professionals and to state and local health
departments for treatment recommendations and to facilitate implementation
of infection-control precautions and tracing of contacts. Clinicians also
should consult CDC's Special Pathogens Branch (telephone 404-639-1115),
where specialized containment facilities exist to allow diagnostic
confirmation by serologic, virologic, molecular, and pathology techniques.
State health departments should notify DGMQ immediately of travel-related
importations of suspected communicable diseases to ensure that prompt risk
assessments, notifications, and appropriate containment measures are
implemented for exposed travelers.

[It is interesting to contrast this report with the somewhat more relaxed
attitude of the UK authorities to a similar case of imported Lassa fever in
London in early September (see: Lassa fever - UK ex West Africa (02)
20040924.2639). The patient, who arrived in London from West Africa (having
spent time in Ivory Coast and Chad), survived. Only 20 cases of Lassa fever
have been reported outside of West Africa. It appears to be no more than an
unfortunate coincidence that these 2 cases were exported from West Africa
within a month of each other - Mod.CP]
