The State Secretariat of Health (SESA) confirmed the 1st death of a monkey from yellow fever in Paraná in the epidemiological period 2022-2023. No deaths were recorded in humans in the period. The bulletin was released on Wednesday [21 Sep 2022].

According to the agency, the identification in the capuchin monkey occurred in the municipality of Fernandes Pinheiros, in the central region of the state.

SESA also explained that this confirms the circulation of the virus in Paraná and stressed that monkeys do not transmit yellow fever. The instruction is that the population should not harm monkeys and they should contact the municipal health surveillance if they find a sick or dead animal.

In addition to the confirmed case, Paraná has another 15 reported epizootics in 9 municipalities. Of these, 6 are under investigation and 3 are undetermined without sample collection..

In relation to humans, 4 cases were reported, 3 of which were discarded and one still under analysis. Half of them were identified in women and the other half in men. All are aged between 40 and 59 years.

Therefore, to avoid cases in humans, the secretariat highlighted the need for preventive measures, especially vaccination against yellow fever, available for free in the Unified Health System.

Prevention
----------
According to the Ministry of Health, the only way to avoid yellow fever is vaccination. It is free and available at health posts at any time of the year.

In addition, as the virus is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the recommendation is also to prevent containers from being filled with standing water. Some measures are:
- Put sand in plant dishes;
- Cover containers that accumulate water -- trash cans, tires, water tanks, vats;
- Remove water from slabs;
- Unclog gutters;
- Store empty glass or pet bottles, buckets and vases upside down.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus continues to cause fatalities in monkeys in Parana state. The state Health Secretariat confirmed the death of one monkey from yellow fever virus infection with 3 more undetermined but might be possible cases. The death of the monkey confirms the presence of the sylvan (forest) cycle of virus transmission in Parana. The concern about the presence of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes mentioned above is due to the risk of the virus becoming introduced into the urban transmission cycle if the proportion of vaccinated humans is less than 80%. The proportion of the Parana state human population that has been vaccinated for YF is not mentioned.

Finding monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Efforts to reach 80-95% YF vaccination coverage in the state are prudent, given the evidence that active yellow fever virus transmission is occurring currently. - Mod.TY]
