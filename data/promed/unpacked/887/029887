Farmers are urged to keep an eye out for signs such as fever and reluctance to move in their cattle.

Central West Local Land Services has had a confirmed case of 3-day sickness, also known as bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), diagnosed in the Coonamble district. The agency said this is a significant disease of cattle carried by biting insects that pops up in our district periodically, especially during or following a wet summer.

Central West Local Land Services district vet Jillian Kelly said the signs of BEF were a fever, inappetence, depression, and reluctance to move.

"Typically, affected animals recover in a few days, hence the name '3-day sickness'; however, some animals, particularly heavy animals such as bulls and cows, can take longer to get up, and in some severe cases can die," Dr Kelly said.

Reports from areas further to the north and east who have already experienced the BEF wave show that the signs are more severe than in previous outbreaks, and cattle are showing more pronounced neurological signs.

"With the high price of stock and the focus on herd rebuilding, producers will be looking for ways to prevent this disease, ease signs, and minimize losses," Dr Kelly said. "While there is a vaccine on the market, it is too late now to offer immunity to cattle in our area."

[It should be noted that bovine ephemeral fever is not a zoonotic disease.

The following is excerpted from Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th edition:

"Diagnosis
-----------
Although the clinical and epidemiological presentations of bovine ephemeral fever are highly characteristic, laboratory confirmation is required. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer, or preferably, seroconversion, can be detected by enzyme immunoassay, including blocking ELISA, by neutralization assays, which are virus specific, or by immunofluorescence or agar gel precipitin tests, which are cross-reactive with related rhabdoviruses. Although virus isolation was the traditional 'gold standard,' real-time RT-PCR assays are now routinely employed to achieve rapid (i.e., 'same day') confirmation of bovine ephemeral fever.

"Immunity, prevention, and control
---------------------------------
Infection results in solid, long-lasting immunity. Because outbreaks tend to involve a high proportion of animals in a herd, repeat clinical episodes usually involve young animals born since previous outbreaks. Prevention by vector control is impractical in the areas of the world where this disease is prevalent. Vaccination has been used in endemic countries, including Australia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey. Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are used, although repeated immunization is often required. Problems with conventional vaccines stem from their lack of potency: inactivated vaccines require more antigenic mass than it has been possible to achieve economically, and live-attenuated vaccines suffer from a loss in immunogenicity linked to the attenuation process (see Chapter 4: Antiviral Immunity and Virus Vaccines). Immunization with the bovine ephemeral fever virus G protein alone can confer protective immunity in cattle, as can recombinant vectors that express this protein." - Mod.TG
