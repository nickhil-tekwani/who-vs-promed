The [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [22 Jul 2013] investigating a suspected case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) affecting a 13 year old boy and hence urged the public to take precautions against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The patient, with good past health, developed fever, headache, and dizziness on[15 Jul 2013]. He consulted a private doctor, but symptoms persisted, and he was subsequently admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on [19 Jul 2013] with confused speech. He was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit on [20 Jul 2013] and is currently in a serious condition.

Upon preliminary laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB) of the CHP, his serum specimen tested negative for antibodies against JE. Further specimens will be taken from the patient later for laboratory testing.

The patient lives in Tin Shui Wai and has no recent travel history. His home contacts remained asymptomatic and have been put under medical surveillance. The CHP's investigation is proceeding.

To date, 2 JE cases have been reported to the CHP this year [2013]; 3 cases were reported in 2012 (including 2 imported cases and one local case), while one (a local case) was reported in 2011. Locally, no cases were reported from 2008 to 2010.

"Regarding the 2 confirmed cases reported last week, latest investigations by the CHP revealed that both male patients aged 59 and 52 were in Hong Kong during most of the incubation period, so both were hence classified as locally acquired," the spokesman said.

The spokesman explained that JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal. It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields.

The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic in the mainland and South East Asia.

Most JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infections are clinically characterised by quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants), and paralysis.

To prevent contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:

- wear long-sleeved clothes and trousers;
- use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body when outdoors; and
- use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.

Travellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:

- avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;
- apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and
- consider vaccination, which should be completed at least 10 days before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for staying over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.

[Eastern China is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), so having cases this year (2013) is not surprising. Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by several species of _Culex_ mosquitoes. Wild birds (especially ardeids) are the vertebrate hosts of JEV. Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV. In 2012, there were 3 cases of JEV infections, 2 locally acquired and one imported from the mainland (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121013.1340684). A ProMED-mail posting from 2004 (archive no. 20040623.1672) indicated that from 1992 to 2003, there have been 7 sporadic cases of JE reported in Hong Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, and one local case in 2003, 2004 and 2011.
