Philippines: Dengue Fever Alert in the Cordilleras
--------------------------------------------------
All provincial health officials in the Cordilleras were alerted over the
possibility of a dengue outbreak in remote barangays of the region. The call
came following reports that at least 20 dengue cases were already confirmed
in remote Paracelis town in Mt. Province, prompting health officials to
contact the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council (PDCC) to help them in
the conduct of massive fogging activities.
In Baguio, Dr. Cecilia Brillantes, chief of the City Epidemiology
Surveillance Unit (CESU) reported that there was a 500 percent increase in
dengue admissions from Jan to Apr 2003 in several sentinel hospitals in the
city. Some 25 cases of dengue were already confirmed compared to only seven
during the same period last year, she added. Brillantes, however, was quick
to claim that there was no dengue outbreak in the city. Still, health
officials have intensified their fogging and information dissemination
activities. "The CESU is on top of the situation," she said.
On the other hand, the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) of the
DOH-CAR also advised the Mt. Province Provincial Health Office to dispatch
health workers from Paracelis to prevent possible dengue outbreak in the
eastern part of the province. The Philippine Information Agency in the
province reported that Dr. Bonifacio Magalong, head of the Bontoc General
Hospital, already had appealed for a massive fogging activity with the PDCC.
Paracelis Mayor Cesar Rafael, however, said that a massive fogging activity
is already being implemented in identified dengue endemic areas to eliminate
the dengue carriers.
Magalong reported that all dengue patients are suffering from different
ailments and are presently confined in the municipal hospital, which is also
undergoing rehabilitation. He also asked the PDCC to help in the monitoring
of medicines directly delivered to local officials but without proper
prescriptions from health authorities. He cited the dangerous practice of
many villagers on stockpiling of medicines at home for so long, thus, even
expired medicines are kept for future use.

Philippines: Increase in Number of Cases in Cordillera AR
---------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities have declared a dengue outbreak in Paracelis, Mt.
Province following 107 cases of dengue fever recorded from January to May
this year. The number cases also continue to increase, said Dr. Teresita
Bonoan, director of the Department of Health in the Cordillera
Administrative Region (DOH-CAR).She added that an upsurge in dengue cases
reported was noted last month with 51 out patients and admittance. Poblacion
has the highest number of cases at 81 and clustering in sitios Dagawe and
Banilag is now being implemented, Bonoan added.
No fatality had been recorded but some of the dengue patients, whose ages
range from one month old to 68 years old, are in critical conditions at the
Bontoc General Hospital, DOH-CAR reports said. Those 11 to 20 years old were
the ones mostly affected, it added. Severe headache, joint pains and skin
rashes characterize the disease.
Bonoan said that a team from the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit
(RESU) had been dispatched in Paracelis in close coordination with the
Provincial Health Office and Mt. Province Provincial Disaster Coordinating
Council. An initial report from the RESU team showed that: "The present
outbreak can be attributed to the onset of rainy days, which signaled an
increase in mosquito breeding sites." The report added that most of these
breeding grounds include artificial containers like uncovered drums, pails
and discarded litters like tins, bottles, coconut shells and tires.
Since the first outbreak in 1998, dengue fever has always been characterized
by health authorities as the "disease that should be watched" and contained
immediately. Paracelis Mayor Cesar Rafael earlier said that a massive
fogging activity has already been implemented in identified dengue endemic
areas to eliminate the dengue carriers.
Paracelis, a fifth-class municipality, has a total population of almost 19
000. With the dengue outbreak occurring in the remote eastern part of the
province, Bonoan expressed hopes that other remote towns in the region would
not suffer from another dengue outbreak. Bonoan said that all provincial,
municipal and barangay health offices in the region were ordered to mobilize
a community clean-up drive for the destruction of breeding sites of the
vector mosquito. She added that the posting of public advisory on dengue
fever and control are necessary.

Thailand: 24 000 Cases Reported So Far This Year
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health have reported over 24 000 cases of dengue
fever so far this year (June 2003). The media previously reported over 800
cases of dengue fever in and around Bangkok (Jan 2003).
A number of tourists visiting Koh Phangan were amongst the cases reported
last year. This flu-like virus is transmitted by daytime biting mosquitoes.
Avoid mosquito bites, there is no vaccine.

Thailand: Dengue Fever Cases expected to Increase
-------------------------------------------------
The authorities are predicting a deadly wave of dengue fever this year, the
third consecutive year the kingdom has been hit hard by the mosquito-borne
disease. The public health ministry said that so far this year there have
been 24 004 registered cases of dengue fever, with 23 deaths. But it warned
that infections would rise during the approaching rainy season. "I would
like to ask people in communities such as housing estates and shophouses to
get rid of mosquitoes, particularly in the rainy season," said Charal
Trunvuthipong, director of the disease control department. "This is the
third consecutive year that dengue fever has hit hard in Thailand, and not
every two years which is the normal dengue fever cycle," he said.

Australia: Confirmed Cases in Queensland Now Total 19
-----------------------------------------------------
The Tropical Public Health Unit says it has no plans to enact
legislation against people who are lax about preventing the spread of
dengue fever. The number of confirmed cases in the twin cities has
jumped from four to 19 this
week, and most have been acquired locally.
The director of environmental health, John Piispanen, says he is
getting access to three quarters of the homes he is approaching for
inspections, so there is no need to enact any powers. "We are
supported by legislative background, and EHOs [environmental health
officers] generally are regulators, but we think while we're getting
the support we are getting from the people of Townsville generally we
don't need to progress to that," he said. "It is something we've been
talking about for a long time, but basically while we're getting
access to people's houses and yards it's not something we have to
pursue."

Myanmar: WHO Calls for Greater Public Involvement in Dengue Control
-------------------------------------------------------------------
YANGON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for increased public
involvement in the control and prevention of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF),
a life threatening disease occurring in Myanmar intermittently especially in
the northern Mandalay division.
A team of WHO specialists, who visited the division recently, suggested that
this disease could be controlled and eradicated through wider community
participation as done in Central Java, Indonesia, where they have evaluated
the dengue eradication programs, the local Myanmar Times reported in its
latest issue. The experts called for building stronger partnership in the
campaign with the Myanmar Red Cross Society and local and international
non-governmental organizations to achieve more success, based on the
on-going campaign with limited resources. DHF mostly causes death among
children aged under 15 in Southeast Asia including Myanmar and the factors
that contribute to DHF include population increase, urbanization and a lack
of effective mosquito control.
DHF was first detected in Yangon in 1969 and a major outbreak of the disease
followed in 1970, which was confined to Yangon until 1973. The first case in
Mandalay division was detected in 1974 and major outbreaks have occurred in
the division about every four years with the most recent in last year.

Honduras: Total of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Deaths Rises to Nine
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Minister of Health, Elias Lizardo, confirmed the death of one person
from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the township of Trinidad, Santa
Barbara. This brings to 9 the number of cases of DHF in 2003, 4 of them in
San Pedro Sula. The previous case was a 5-year-old child, who recovered.
People who do not clean up their vacant properties, or who have mosquitoes
breeding in their homes, will be fined.
During 2002, the Health Secretary recorded 3096 cases of dengue; in 2003,
2096 cases have been reported nationwide so far. But the peak of the
epidemic in 2002 fell in weeks 26-38 [July through September].
