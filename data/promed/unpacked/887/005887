Measles outbreak alarms health authorities
------------------------------------------
Health authorities across New South Wales and Queensland are urging
residents to make sure they are immunised against measles. A spate of
outbreaks across the eastern seaboard [of Australia] has doctors
worried that a pandemic that was raging in South Africa during the
World Cup is quietly spilling across the Indian Ocean. GPs [General
Practitioners] say the reluctance by some parents here to immunise
their children has put the public in danger of a major outbreak.

Queensland Health officials believe the most recent case of measles
was contracted by an adult from north Queensland, who was returning
home on a flight from South Africa last month [August 2010]. Public
medical officer Dr Steven Donohue says since then another 2 people
have been infected in Townsville after they came into contact with
the traveller.

"Measles is not a trivial illness -- this thing is the worst of the
childhood diseases [and] used to kill a lot of children," Dr Donohue
said. "In the last 2 weeks 7 cases were confirmed at Tweed Heads on
the New South Wales/Queensland border, and a local mine worker in
Moranbah to the south-west of Mackay contracted the disease. Another
2 [people] in Townsville are still waiting on results." Dr Donohue
says he is concerned the disease is spreading undetected, as the time
between contracting the virus and showing symptoms can be up to 2
weeks.

"You can walk past somebody with measles in a supermarket while
they're infectious and if you're not immune, then it's quite possible
for you to get this disease," he said. He says adults under the age
of 45 are most at risk, as they may not have received a vaccination.
"Basically anyone born during or after 1966 should be checking if
they received 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine and
if not, then our advice is to go along to your GP and get a free
additional dose of MMR just to make sure," Dr Donohue said.

Townsville GP network chairman Dr Kevin Arlett says there has been a
reduction in vaccinations over the last decade, and that could be
disastrous. "Because a lot of people haven't seen these diseases,
there's been a whole generation basically who hasn't seen a lot of
these infectious diseases," he said. "People are feeling a little bit
blase about it perhaps, but they're also being fed some information
by some of the anti-vaccination lobby groups suggesting that
vaccinations are more dangerous than the disease itself."

He says the Australian public may have forgotten what toll the
measles disease can take on the human body. "It can lead to all sorts
of problems, but as [with] most viral infections it affects the whole
body so you can end up with problems of the lungs, you can end up
with problems with the brain and that's obviously where disasters
occur."

[Current measles activity includes outbreaks in several countries in
southern Africa. Over the past year, high numbers of measles cases
have been reported in many countries, including Lesotho, Malawi,
Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Several
hundred deaths have also been reported. Travellers attending the FIFA
World Cup in South Africa in June/July 2010 were warned of the risk
of measles virus infection and advised to review their vaccination
status. Despite this recent cases of measles in Australia appeared to
have been introduced by this route.

Because of this risk of measles in both developed and developing
countries, all international travelers should be up to date on
immunizations, irrespective of their travel destination. Measles
virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected
surfaces for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected
person from 4 days prior to the onset of the characteristic rash to 4
days after the rash erupts. It is possible that persons travelling in
the same aircraft as the imported cases of measles also may have been
exposed to measles virus infection.
