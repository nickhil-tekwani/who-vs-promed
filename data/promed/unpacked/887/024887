Royal Melbourne likely source of _Legionella_
------------------------------------------------
It was likely that a man who died last month from legionnaires' disease
contracted the [_Legionella_ bacteria while he was a patient at the Royal
Melbourne Hospital, according to tests by the hospital. Hospital
spokeswoman Allison Sloan said today that latest tests of samples from 2 of
the hospital's air-conditioning cooling towers found several strains of
_Legionella_ bacteria, including the one contracted by the patient. [It is
not reported what testing was done to demonstrate that the strains were
identical. These tests vary in their ability to distinguish differences
between strains. -Man. Ed. DS.
The hospital commissioned tests of the cooling towers on 12 Dec 2000, the
date of the death of the patient, believed to have been aged in his 60s.
The man, unnamed by authorities, was being treated for an unrelated
condition when he displayed fever symptoms later diagnosed as legionnaires'
disease. Tests showed small traces of the bacteria in two of the hospital's
cooling towers, with further testing matching a strain of the bacteria to
that contracted by the man.
"It makes it likely he did acquire legionnaires' disease while in (the)
hospital," Ms Sloan told AAP today. She said there were more than 40 known
strains of the disease. [A total of 3 other people known to have visited
the hospital were also diagnosed with legionnaires' disease. But sample
testing has failed to match the strain of bacteria they acquired with the
cooling tower water, Ms Sloan said. [Which makes one question whether the
infections in these patients is related epidemiologically to the hospital
cooling towers -DS Two of those people had been treated and discharged
from the hospital, while a third man remains hospitalized for an unrelated
condition.

[Through the years ProMED-mail has posted hospital associated outbreaks of
legionellosis. I hesitate to use the term nosocomial as not all of the
cases were in patients hospitalized prior to onset of their illness, but in
some cases just walking past the outside grounds of a hospital has been
associated with legionellosis and therefore do not meet a purist definition
of hospital acquired but rather meet the definition of a community acquired
legionellosis where the contaminated source in the community happens to be
the hospital's cooling towers. In this case, the outbreak was originally
felt to be a hospital associated/community acquired outbreak, but it
appears as though only one of the four cases, a nosocomial case, was truly
associated with proximity to the hospital. - Mod.MPP
