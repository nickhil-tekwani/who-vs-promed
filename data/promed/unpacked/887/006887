Three Royal Bengal tigers, an endangered species, have died from an unknown
disease at Dhaka zoo (Bangladesh) in the past 3 days, zoo officials said on
Saturday. An investigation had been ordered after the third tiger died early
on Saturday, they said.
"We are not yet certain about the cause of their deaths. But we suspect the
deaths have been caused by a disease called trypanosomiasis, a protozoan
disease of African origin. The disease could spread through mosquito or fly
bites,'' Dr. Nazrul Islam, chief veterinary physician at the zoo told
Reuters.
"I believe all the tigers who belonged to the same family and lived in the
same cage were attacked by bot fly. No other tiger of the zoo is affected by
the disease.''
Two Bengal tigers were killed by food poisoning at the zoo last year.
Apart from 15 tigers remaining at the zoo, Bangladesh has some 400 Bengal
tigers left in the coastal Sundarban forest, nearly 400 km (250 miles) south
of Dhaka, according to official estimates.

[This is a strange coincidence. A human case of suspected trypanosomiasis
(probably *not* of African origin) turns up in Sri Lanka last month, & now
suspected cases, of alleged African origin, appear in tigers in Bangladesh.
We wonder what gave the zoo veterinarians the idea of that inherently
unlikely diagnosis? Do they have game animals recently imported from Africa
in the zoo?
And we would still like to hear the final diagnosis from Sri Lanka - Mod.JW
