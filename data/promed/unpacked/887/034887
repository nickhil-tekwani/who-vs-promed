The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported Thursday [12 Jul 2012] the year's 1st case of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by [a] hantavirus and urged the public to avoid exposure to rodents, which are carriers of the virus.

"The 63-year-old pig farmer from Kaohsiung has been discharged from the hospital following treatment," said CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw. "Although the infection was likely caused by rodent bites, further laboratory tests are needed for confirmation," he said.

The patient began displaying symptoms of fever, vomiting, stomach pain, muscle soreness and shortage of breath 18 Jun [2012], one month after being bitten on the toes by a rodent, according to a press statement released by the CDC. Blood test results obtained 11 Jul [2012] confirmed that the man was infected with the [a] hantavirus, which caused HFRS, it said.

With a hantavirus mortality rate of as high as 10 per cent, Chou urged those active in areas where rodents are present to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the disease.

Previous studies have concluded that individuals residing or working in wet markets tend to be in the high-risk group, he added.

People usually get infected through exposure to the urine and droppings of infected rodents or after exposure to dust, which can also carry the virus. Human-to-human transmission is rare.

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case. Most likely it is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus spp._, as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100415.1221).
