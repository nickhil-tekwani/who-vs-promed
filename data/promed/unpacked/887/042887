[In posting 20051225.3681, we mentioned the conflicting reports on
the avian species which, reportedly, had suffered die-off in Malawi,
initially identified as drongoes (birds belonging to the family
_Dicruridae_) and later as European sparrows (_Hirundo rustica_). We
requested, if possible, an accurate determination of the avian in
question. The following response has been received from Dr. Alen
Kemp, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South
Africa. - Mod.AS]

From: Alan Kemp <alank@nicd.ac.za>

As an African and bird ringer/bander, I've learnt that indigenous
languages and the folk that speak them do not discriminate too well
amongst similar-looking bird species. Animals are named uniquely only
if they have a particular use or a cultural significance. Therefore,
any similarly-sized bird with black plumage and a longish tail,
whether _dicrurid_ or _hirudiniid_, would share a common name in that
language/dialect. This may be the source of the confusion, as the
original description of the event was obtained by word-of-mouth from
villagers in the affected area. I tend to lean towards _Hirundo_
spp., probably _rustica_, because of the mention of flocks and the
timing of the event. Drongoes are highly territorial by nature,
especially in the breeding season, and are thus unlikely to form
flocks.
Heavy rainfall may lead to mass mortality of birds, particularly when
accompanied by hail, as commonly occurs in the eastern and southern
parts of the continent, although birds like swallows normally go to
roost in reed beds in anticipation of heavy weather. Having
speculated freely, it certainly is a bit of a mystery, and I hope
your request for confirmation of identity is answered.

[Thanks to Dr. Kemp for his authoritative comment. His tendency to
lean towards _Hirundo_ spp., probably _rustica_, might be further
supported by the following piece of information from a newswire of 23
Dec 2005: "Locals started collecting to eat the birds, which were
believed to have migrated from Israel after one of them had a ring
inscribed with the word "Israel" on it." (See
<http://www.todayonline.com/articles/91714.asp>).
We are looking forward to the results of the tests on specimens sent
from Malawi to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South
Africa, which, hopefully, will also include a confirmation of the
birds' identity.
