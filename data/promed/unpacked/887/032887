----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the previous ProMED-mail post the last paragraph of the article stated, "Although research is not yet confirmed the cause of the poisoning, it is presumed that the tamales were prepared at the same table where the host had previously had been agricultural poison, which was used to kill tacuacines coming to eat their chickens.]

It's very doubtful that this was an organophosphate or carbamate given that they were using it to kill opossums that were trying to eat their chickens (or their eggs).

[While "tacuacines" does seem to mean opossums, and while organophosphate or carbamates may not necessarily be used to kill opossums, the clinical signs in those exposed certainly bring those chemicals (organophosphate/carbamates) to mind.

Organophosphates/carbamates may not be the 1st choice of many to kill opossums but it does not preclude that they may have been used.

Hopefully officials will communicate the exact cause of the situation.

Photos of opossums may be viewed at http://www.opossumsocietyus.org/opossum_photo_page.htm.

El Salvador may be found on the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at http://healthmap.org/r/1obh.

Also, I wish to thank Dr Peat for his keen eye on pointing this out. - Mod.TG]
