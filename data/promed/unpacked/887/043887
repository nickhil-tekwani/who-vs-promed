Toronto Public Health is investigating an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157
among individuals who attended a picnic in Scarborough's Morningside
Park on 1 Jul 2007. Several hundred people attended the event, which
was a reunion for the Punqudutivu Students Association of Sri Lanka.
So far, 6 cases of _E. coli_ 0157 have been confirmed. 4 individuals
were hospitalized, with one developing serious kidney complications.
"Toronto Public Health is asking anyone who attended this picnic on 1
Jul 2007, to watch for symptoms of _E. coli_," said Dr. Barbara
Yaffe, Associate Medical Officer of Health for Toronto. "Symptoms
include diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting."
The organism can be contagious, especially among family members and
people who live in the same household. "Therefore, we are asking
anyone who went to the event, as well as members of their household,
to watch for these symptoms," said Dr. Yaffe. Anyone experiencing
symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.
The exact source of contamination in this outbreak is under
investigation. _E. coli_ cases in the summer are often associated
with picnics and barbequing. "This outbreak reinforces the importance
of safe food handling practices, especially at picnics and
barbeques," said Dr. Yaffe.

[The vehicle responsible for the outbreak is not yet clear. A recent
recall of ground beef occurred in Canada, primarily affecting the
western provinces, but western Ontario as also mentioned. Toronto
is, however, in southeastern Ontario, as can be seen at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto>.
The scope of the outbreak is no yet known. The day of the picnic, 1
Jul 2007, is Canada Day, formerly Dominion Day, Canada's national
holiday, marking the establishment of Canada as a self-governing
country on 1 Jul 1867. - Mod.LL]
