I have been in conversation with Terry Boldingh (VMO) and Richard Danila
(MN Dept of Health) on the ongoing outbreaks. A new outbreak has been
located 8 miles from the Canadian border.
The affected farm is in Roseau County. On 6 Aug 2000 a cow was found dead
following a rain storm with thunder and was ascribed to lightening strike.
On 13 Aug 2000 a cow was found collapsed near to the farm buildings and
moribund, and was shot by the owner. On 22 Aug 2000 a yearling was found
dead and necropsied by the farm's veterinarian; the North Dakota diagnostic
laboratory diagnosed anthrax. On checking the pastures 4 more cows were
found dead and from the state of the bodies death had occurred during the
previous 1-2 weeks; because the pastures are badly overgrown with brush and
scrub there may be more carcasses out there. At the beginning of Aug 2000
the farmer had 38 cows, one bull, some 8 or 9 yearlings and 35 calves.
The dead yearling is being burnt, the other carcasses have yet to be burnt;
there has been almost continuous rain. While he has been strongly advised
to get his remaining stock vaccinated the owner is procrastinating and they
may never be vaccinated this year.
This farm is in an area that was once properly ditched and drained but has
fallen into disrepair. With the repetitive wet years there is also
extensive flooding. The area is now of only marginal productivity. With
Stuartburn (Manitoba) only some 30 miles away NW and Pembina County (North
Dakota) about 45 miles due west, one may suspect that anthrax may now be
widespread in this triangle and affecting a number of herds, with or
without the owner's knowledge. However as night time temperatures are down
to 40 degrees F it should be over soon. With the Labor Day holiday next
weekend, no one should consider utilizing any sick stock for family or
community barbecues in that part of the country. As such holiday hamburgers
tend to be thicker and juicy in the middle, consumers might also be wise to
ask where the meat came from before eating them.
