A bacteria outbreak is making sea lions sick along the Oregon Coast, so state officials are warning people and their dogs to stay away from the animals.

The outbreak began in September [2017] and likely will last into December [2017], said Jim Rice, a researcher at Oregon State University. He studies and helps sick or stuck animals along the entire Oregon Coast as stranding coordinator with the Oregon Marine Mammal Stranding Network. Calls about distressed or dead sea lions have been coming in regularly. "I'm getting at least one a day," he said on [Thu 26 Oct 2017]. "It's sometimes 4, maybe 5."

OSU's Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed at least 8 cases of leptospirosis in dead sea lions since the outbreak began, Rice said. The most recent such outbreak in Oregon was in 2010.

The number of sea lion deaths in a year along the Oregon Coast increased 3-fold during the last outbreak, Rice said, with researchers tallying about 350 deaths due to all kinds of causes. "We are likely to see another big spike in mortalities," he said.

But the number of California sea lions, the species of marine mammal found along the U.S. and Canadian western coasts, will barely be affected. More than 300 000 sea lions live along the coasts, from Alaska down through California.

Sick sea lions this fall have been found mostly on beaches in Lincoln, Tillamook and Clatsop counties, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. "I expect there have been cases in Lane County," Rice said. "We just haven't been able to document them yet."

Dogs are more likely to come into contact with sick or dead sea lions, particularly the animal's urine, so Rice said canines are more at risk of infection than people. "Pets should be kept away from sea lions, as leptospirosis can cause severe disease," Emilio DeBess, state public health veterinarian at the Oregon Health Authority, said in a statement.

An inexpensive vaccine is available to protect dogs and horses from the bacteria. DeBess and Rice advised dog owners to keep their pets on a leash while at the beach during the outbreak.

Leptospirosis can lead to weakness, fever and kidney failure in sea lions, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The bacterium typically affects young male sea lions, ages 2 or 3 years. Symptoms might include dehydration, depression or reluctance to use their hind flippers.

The disease is zoonotic, meaning it can spread to people, but cases in dogs are much more common than in people, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Symptoms for dogs and other mammals, including sea lions, include increased drinking, urinating and vomiting.

Signs of leptospirosis in people also include high fever, severe headache, chills and muscle aches.

[The 1st mortality event in sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_) caused by _Leptospira interrogans_ was reported in 1970, in wild populations along the coast of California and Oregon (USA). Thereafter, leptospirosis outbreaks have been occurring at regular intervals, and leptospirosis has been implicated as a cause of premature parturition in California sea lions. The serovar implicated is Pomona. The occurrence of the disease appears to be cyclic. Every 4-5 years there are peaks of exposure (seroprevalence increases), which coincides with sea lion strandings due to leptospirosis. - Mod.PMB
