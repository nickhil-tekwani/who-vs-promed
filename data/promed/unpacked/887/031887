A vaccination program to immunize all susceptible farm livestock against
the bluetongue virus was launched today [Mon 3 Nov 2008]. Scotland is the
only part of the UK to implement a compulsory vaccination program of cattle
and sheep. The decision has been taken in partnership with the industry and
will ensure that there is sufficient uptake of vaccine to prevent the
spread of bluetongue [serotype] 8 [BTV-8] in Scotland.

The Scottish Government is also recommending that other susceptible animals
-- deer, goats, camelids (camels, llamas and alpacas) and other exotic
animals kept in zoos and wildlife collections -- be vaccinated, though this
is voluntary. Half of the manufacturing costs of the vaccine [BP 2.6
million, USD 4 142 800] has been paid by the government for the 1st year of
the vaccination program.

Launching the program, Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural
Affairs and the Environment said: "The bluetongue virus poses a real,
potentially devastating, threat to the Scottish livestock sector. A
whole-scale compulsory vaccination program is the only way to properly
protect our industry. Farming is the lifeblood of the rural economy and of
rural communities. That is why we are doing all we can to support it though
difficult times and to ensure our rural economy is well positioned for
recovery. By paying half the manufacturing costs of the vaccine in the 1st
year, the Scottish government has taken a unique position in easing the
financial impact on farmers. While the compulsory approach will ensure that
all farm animals are protected against bluetongue, it is only one line of
defense. It remains vitally important that care is taken in sourcing stock
and that high risk areas are avoided."

NFU [National Farmers' Union] Scotland president Jim McLaren said: "It
remains a major disappointment to Scotland's farmers that control policies
elsewhere in Europe have failed to curb the threat that bluetongue disease
poses to our lifeline livestock sector. Industry stakeholders have agreed
that compulsory vaccination now presents the best option to protect our
livestock against this devastating disease. We have a window of opportunity
between now and the end of April [2009] to put that protection in place,
and we would urge all producers to take the time to discuss their vaccine
requirements and vaccination timing with their vet."

A compulsory vaccination program was agreed upon by industry and
stakeholders on 2 Sep 2008. The Scottish government has worked in full
cooperation with stakeholder groups -- including NFU Scotland, the National
Beef Association, Scottish Beef Cattle Association, National Sheep
Association and the Scottish Agricultural College -- to hold a series of
farmers' meetings across Scotland in November and December 2008.

Advice on the vaccination program and the use of the Merial vaccine is
available to farmers by contacting their area animal health office.

[The Scottish government deserves to be congratulated for its efforts to
preemptively vaccinate the valuable Scottish livestock population against
BTV-8 in a timely manner. It seems that the vaccination period, from the
beginning of November 2008 to the end of April 2009, has been planned to
bestow upon the susceptible animals optimal immunity levels just ahead of
the next disease/vector activity season. - Mod.AS]

Comment on "Bluetongue - Europe (70): BTV-8, Spain (Andalusia)"
-----------------------------------------------
According to the above posting, the period between 1 Dec 2008 and 31 Mar
2009 is considered to be a vector-free season. I wonder whether this
statement is right, particularly taking into account the climatic
conditions in South Spain (mild winter). How is vector activity being
monitored?

[The doubt raised by Dr Gonzalez concerning the validity of the term
"vector-free season" in relation to bluetongue vectors in Europe, in
particular when related to Andalusia, is justifiable. In fact, it falls in
line with the scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA). The EU Panel on Animal Health and Welfare submitted its opinion on
bluetongue virus in June 2008, covered by ProMED-mail in posting 20080724.2250.

The opinion was published in The EFSA Journal 2008; 735: 1-70, available
online at
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/cs/BlobServer/Scientific_Opinion/ahaw_op_ej735_bluetongue2008_en.pdf?ssbinary=true>.
It included, among other things, the following statement:

"Although recent data showed that in different geographical areas across
Europe some _Culicoides_ midges may remain active indoors through winter,
the role of these insects in prolonging the transmission period of the
virus is still not clear. The Panel concluded that in some geographical
areas in Europe, there may not be an absolute vector-free period.

"The Panel added that more information is needed on the daylight and indoor
winter activities of _Culicoides_ and on their ability to spread the
disease. Experts, therefore, recommended that Member States carry out
in-depth analyses at regional levels, since the life pattern of these
insects may vary depending on location and season."

We fully agree and will be happy to include available/obtained results in
future reports on bluetongue in Europe. - Mod.AS]
