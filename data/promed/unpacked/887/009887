[This year's increase in tick activity has been observed in a several
regions of Russia (the Republics of Khakassia and Buryatiya, Irkutsk,
Sverdlovsk, Pskov and other regions). It is necessary to increase the
areas receiving anti-tick treatment: woods, parks and communal
gardens. For prevention of spring outbreaks of tick activity, it is
necessary to undertake anti-tick treatment now, in the autumn, and to
repeat it in the spring. This means insecticide spraying with
sulfur, various derivatives of sulfur (colloidal sulfur, limy
sulfuric broth and organic derivatives of sulfur), chlorine, and
organic phosphorus compounds.
Their trade names in Russia are oktametil, milbex, keltan, chlorbenzid, etc.
The Pskov region is located in the northwest of Russia in the area
surrounding the Baltic Sea. On the west it borders Estonia and
Latvia, to the south Belarus, to the north the Leningrad region, and
to the east with the regions of Novgorod and Tver. Its population
numbers over 840 000. The region covers more than 55 000 sq. km. - Mod.NP]
