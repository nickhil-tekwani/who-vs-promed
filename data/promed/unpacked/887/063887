Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) - Ebola situation report 35
------------------------------------------------------------------
Fast facts
----------
- The Ebola outbreak in the northeast of the DRC, the 2nd-largest in world history, claimed the lives of 2287 of the 3324 patients affected. The new outbreak, in Equateur province, has affected 13 of the province's 18 health zones, with 130 confirmed cases and 55 deaths.
- 372 848 people have been vaccinated against Ebola (including 39 859 in Equateur province).

International Medical Corps' response
-------------------------------------
- International Medical Corps' Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have managed more than 900 patients at Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in Bikoro, Mbandaka, and Buburu, including 29 confirmed cases.
- On 30 Jun 2020, when the Mangina Ebola treatment center (RTC) was decommissioned, the facility had cared for 3859 suspected and 422 confirmed Ebola patients.
- International Medical Corps is providing infection prevention and control (IPC) support to 196 health facilities to ensure that healthcare delivery is safe, including 20 new facilities in Equateur.
- Since 21 Aug 2018, screening and referral units (SRUs) supported by International Medical Corps have provided more than 2 million screenings for Ebola and 941 125 screenings for COVID-19

Situation update
----------------
Responding to the outbreak of Ebola in Equateur Province
The outbreak of Ebola in Equateur province has progressively subsided over the past 5 weeks, with no new case being reported during the month of October [2020]. As of 9 Nov 2020, the province had reported zero positive cases for 34 days, edging closer toward the 42-day mark when the outbreak could officially be declared over. Between 1 Jun and 28 Sep 2020, 72% of the health zones in the province (13 of 18) reported a total of 130 confirmed cases, including 55 deaths and 75 recoveries. At 42% mortality, the Ebola mortality rate in this latest outbreak has been lower than the 10th Ebola outbreak in the northeast of the DRC, which recorded a mortality rate of 67%. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 40 000 people have been vaccinated during this outbreak.

Since the beginning of the latest outbreak, International Medical Corps has worked alongside the MoH to isolate and manage 938 patients -- 29 of whom were confirmed -- at 2 Ebola Treatment Centers, which were set up in the 2 health zones (Wangata and Bikoro) that registered the highest number of confirmed cases. A 3rd treatment center that was integrated into an existing health center in the town of Buburu, in Bomongo health zone, helped reduce the risk of the disease spreading to the neighboring Republic of the Congo. A key driver of this success has been the deployment of an RRT, reinforcing the ability of local health providers to rapidly identify and isolate suspect cases while safely managing those confirmed. Furthermore, through mentoring and by providing basic PPE [Personal protective equipment] and WASH [water, sanitation, and hygiene] supplies, the RRT reinforced IPC measures at these treatment centers, as well as 20 other health facilities in the affected health zones, and helped to improve management of medical waste. With donor support, International Medical Corps would like to support the 90 days of heightened Ebola surveillance that will follow the end of the outbreak, which will begin on 18 Nov 2020 if no new cases are confirmed. This will require interventions to reinforce community-based surveillance, IPC at health facilities, rapid response deployment capacity of the local MoH RRT, facilitation of access to primary healthcare, and Ebola survivor-care programs (including ring surveillance).

[It is noteworthy that the mortality rate in this last Ebola outbreak was significantly lower at 42%, compared to that of the previous outbreak, 67%. If this were due to improved treatment of patients, that would be a great step forward. Taken together with the vaccine, Ebola is becoming a more manageable disease, but 42% mortality is still unacceptably high. - Mod.LK

[2] FDA approves Inmazeb
Date: Thu 15 Oct 2020 4:22 IST

https://www.news18.com/news/world/us-regulators-approve-1st-treatment-for-ebola-2965793.html


US regulators Wed approved the 1st drug for the treatment of Ebola. The Food and Drug Administration OK'd the drug developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for treating adults and children with the Zaire Ebola virus strain, the most deadly of 6 known types. It typically kills 60% to 90% of patients.

The drug was one of 4 tested during an outbreak in Congo that killed nearly 2300 people before it ended in June [2020]. Survival was significantly better in study participants given Regeneron's Inmazeb or a 2nd experimental drug.

The study was ended ahead of schedule last year [2019] so all patients could get access to those drugs. Regeneron's treatment is a combination of 3 antibodies that work by killing the virus. It's given once IV.

When you have 3 drugs that bind to the (virus), there's a low probability that the virus can evade all of them, said Leah Lipsich, who heads Regeneron's global program for infectious diseases.

She said that should help prevent the virus from becoming resistant to the drug.

Seeking US approval first is a common strategy for drugmakers developing treatments for diseases mainly found in the tropics and in developing countries.

The FDA's action will make it easier for Regeneron to get approval or allow emergency use during outbreaks in African countries, where the approval process is not straightforward, Lipsich said.

The study in Congo involved 681 people, who were given one of 4 treatments. After 4 weeks, about a 3rd of those who got Regeneron's drug had died.

Results were about the same for a 2nd drug. But about half had died among the groups given one of the other 2 drugs, ZMapp or remdesivir.

Gilead Science's remdesivir is now being used as a treatment for coronavirus.

The US government, which helped fund the approved drug's development, will buy thousands of doses over the next 6 years to go into the Strategic National Stockpile. Ebola cases are rare in the US but occasionally are diagnosed in travelers returning from areas with an outbreak.

[Inmazeb lowered the risk of dying from the infection. Out of 154 patients treated with Inmazeb, 52 patients (34%) died within 28-days in comparison to 78 out of 153 patients (51%) who were treated with another experimental drug. The drug worked similarly in males and females and in all age groups. The FDA approved Inmazeb based primarily on evidence from a clinical trial (Trial 1/ NCT NCT03719586) of 322 patients with Zaire ebolavirus infection. The trial was conducted at 4 sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo during an outbreak that began in August 2018.
