Doubts about sensitivity of avian influenza diagnostic testing in humans
------------------------------------------------------
A diagnostic test designed by Canadian researchers and used in Viet Nam to
detect avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection is out of date, scientists
from the National Microbiology Laboratory admit, raising the possibility
that some human cases may have been dismissed in error. The test was
designed at the Winnipeg lab using genetic sequencing information from
samples of the virus that circulated in the 1st quarter of 2004. But the
virus has changed enough since then that questions have surfaced about the
test's sensitivity. Tracking the virus's forays into and among humans is
critical, given fears that the H5N1 virus may acquire the ability to
transmit easily from person to person, sparking an influenza pandemic.
"Well, you have to be concerned," says Dr Earl Brown, a virologist at the
University of Ottawa who specializes in influenza [virus] evolution. Brown
was not involved in the design of the test. "You want to have a good idea
of how much infection is going on out there. And if you're starting calling
certain people with pneumonia, or whatever, infection negative when they're
not, then you're not recognizing the full situation."
This is not the 1st suggestion that labs in Viet Nam may have
underestimated the number of positive cases there. Earlier this year
[2005], Japanese scientists retested a number of specimens that technicians
at a lab in Ho Chi Minh City had determined were negative. The re-analysis
found several of the rejected cases were actually positive. A scientist
from the Winnipeg lab says at least part of the problem behind the
out-of-date test stems from the fact that Vietnamese laboratories have had
limited success in isolating and growing stocks of the circulating viruses
this year [2005]. For reasons that are not clear, the virus is not growing
well in the cell culture medium that was used in the past, says Darwyn
Kobasa, a respiratory virus researcher who recently returned from Viet Nam.
"That has largely failed this year. They haven't been able to grow
isolates. So that's been impeding the collection of new sequence
information," Kobasa says.
Genetic sequences from more recent versions of the H5N1 virus are needed to
produce more up-to-date test components, called primers. Primers are tiny
strands of synthetic nucleic acid used in PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
testing. If they are a perfect match for the influenza strain, primers used
in tests should bind to the RNA of the virus. Kobasa and lab technician
Laura Hart spent several weeks at the National Institute for Hygiene and
Epidemiology in Hanoi sharing diagnostic expertise and helping Vietnamese
scientists assess their testing proficiency. That is when the problem with
the primers came to light. "There have been enough changes in the viruses
between last year [2004] and this year that we found some of our PCR
primers did not work that well," says Kobasa, a researcher in the division
of respiratory viruses. "With our own testing, we found there were some
issues with sensitivity. You can appreciate from a clinical sample that the
amount of virus that might be in there is very small. So it can be quite
difficult to detect."
The National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology has been using the
Canadian test as a screening tool. All specimens from suspected H5N1 cases
were tested using the Canadian assay. Samples that tested positive were
then re-tested using primers designed at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta. If the 2nd test came back positive as well, the case
was considered confirmed. But samples that tested negative during the
screening phase were not subjected to the 2nd test. The primers designed in
Winnipeg are aimed at 3 different genetic targets on the H5N1 virus,
including the HA or hemagglutinin gene, explains Dr Frank Plummer,
scientific director of the lab, which is part of the Public Health Agency
of Canada. Plummer believes the primers may still be sensitive enough to
catch most or all H5N1 cases, but that needs to be confirmed. "It seemed to
be working OK for the HA gene," he says. "But we have limited information.
And the fact is, they (Vietnamese authorities) have limited information
too. So until we know more about the whole sequence, we won't know really
[whether] they've been missing a lot [of cases] or not."
Still, Plummer says it's possible the out-of-date primers have generated
false negative tests. "It's conceivable. I don't think it's that likely. If
it can detect one, it should be able to detect others that are closely
related," he says. Whether that's the case would depend on where mutations
have occurred on the HA gene. "These tests don't span the whole gene, they
only take little portions of it. So if the mutations are in that little
portion, they may not work as well," he admits. Kobasa says the Winnipeg
lab will now try to design more sensitive primers. He and Hart returned
with some genetic material from 2 recent virus samples, which the lab will
try to amplify, isolate and sequence for that purpose.

[The increasing difficulty in obtaining isolates of infectious virus from
patients with suspected avian influenza is not necessarily directly related
to a loss of sensitivity of primers used in RT-PCR diagnostic tests.
Failure to isolate infectious virus may be dependent on the amount of virus
present in an infected individual, whereas failure of RT-PCR diagnostic
testing can be presumed to be sequence-mismatching as a consequence of
genetic drift. But there may be a real decline in the number of cases of
avian influenza in humans, rather than a divergence of sequence - Mod.CP]
