A 57 year old woman, who hasn't travelled abroad, is the 1st registered case of West Nile fever in Macedonia this year [2013]. The woman is in stable condition and under necessary treatment, the Ministry of Health said in a press release on Tuesday [23 Jul 2013].

West Nile infection is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Most people infected with West Nile virus don't experience any signs or symptoms, or may experience only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache. However, some people who become infected with West Nile virus develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the brain.

Exposure to mosquitoes where West Nile virus exists increases people's risk of getting West Nile virus infection. Using mosquito repellent and wearing clothing that covers the skin are the best measures for reducing the risk of West Nile virus infection.

[West Nile virus (WNV) infections have occurred sporadically in Macedonia and surrounding countries, especially Greece in recent years. There were 4 WNV human, 2 equine and 7 avian infections in 2011 in Macedonia. It would be of interest to know if there are any equine or avian cases in the area where the woman became infected this year (2013).
