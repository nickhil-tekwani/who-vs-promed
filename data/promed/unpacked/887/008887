Seattle King County Public Health is currently investigating an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 -- one of the most serious foodborne illnesses you can contract. Our thoughts are with the families affected by this outbreak, and we appreciate the support of the community as we work to protect the health of the public.

A person can get an _E. coli_ O157 infection from many different sources: by eating or drinking something contaminated with animal or human fecal matter, through animal contact, or through contact with another person who has an _E. coli_ infection. One of our responsibilities at Public Health is to track down these sources. When there are illnesses associated with any one of the more than 12 000 food establishments in the county, we search for contaminated products, ill food workers, or improper food handling.

We follow specific steps to find clues that help us pinpoint the source(s) that may be linked to illness. Here are key steps of this current investigation.

We interviewed people who got sick
At this time, we know that 6 people have been infected with the same strain of _E. coli_ (3 have been hospitalized). When Public Health determines that anyone is sick from a serious foodborne illness like _E. coli_, we interview them to determine what may have caused their illness. We do this to find the source of the outbreak and prevent others from getting infected. In this instance, through a few initial interviews with ill people, we determined that everyone who became sick had something in common -- they ate food prepared by a local food vendor called Los Chilangos. Public Health took swift action and required Los Chilangos to cease operations.

We investigated a food business that was associated with the people who got sick
But we didn't stop there. Los Chilangos serves food at 7 farmers markets in King and Snohomish Counties, operates 2 food trucks, and also caters events. Los Chilangos utilizes a shared kitchen space, called a commissary kitchen. The kitchen that they use is Eastside Commercial Kitchen, where they share space and equipment with about a dozen other food businesses.

We intervened at the specific site and operation
The condition of the commissary and the potential for cross contamination were deemed an imminent health hazard, and the health officer issued a cease and desist order to the commissary on [Thu 27 Aug 2015]. Additionally, all of the food vendors permitted by Public Health that use this kitchen were also told to cease operations. Recognizing that this lapse in operation hurts business, our team has worked diligently with these vendors to find new places for them to resume their work and remind them about important food safety measures.

Next steps: tracing the source
As of today [2 Sep 2015], the investigation isn't over. We are still investigating the source of the _E. coli_. If we determine that a food contained the bacterium, we will try to trace it back to stores, suppliers, and even farms to address the root of the problem with corrective actions, if possible. But, it's possible that the source of _E. coli_ may never be determined. _E coli_ is often linked to beef, but it can also be linked to produce, such as spinach and sprouts, along with a variety of other foods such as unpasteurized juices, raw milk, game meats, and other common foods.

For outbreaks such as this one, we continue to monitor the situation and look for other common factors among ill people. While we know Los Chilangos is linked, they may not be the only ones involved. For instance, the source of _E. coli_ could be served by other vendors. We are currently working with all of the businesses connected to this outbreak to make sure that they are not using any products that may have become contaminated and that they have food safety measures in place. This includes having the businesses address needed repairs to their equipment, providing education to their staff, and ensuring their operations are safe to open.

Though Los Chilangos has been linked to this outbreak, they deserve credit for their dutiful cooperation during our investigation. No food vendor wants to make people sick, and we know everyone is very concerned about the people who have become ill. We will be updating this blog as the picture becomes clearer.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope and source of this outbreak. Although classically associated with uncooked ground beef, a number of other sources including a variety of fresh produce, contaminated with the organism anywhere from the farm to the table, can be the source.

The following is derived from Lutwick LI: Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting Emerging Zoonoses: The One Health Paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds) Springer, Tokyo, Japan, 2014, pp 77-112.

"_E. coli_ is by far the most common facultative (can grow both aerobically or anaerobically) Gram negative bacillus in the human intestinal tract. Within its niche in the intestinal tract, the organism is part of the normal bacterial flora with many functions to help its human host, including preventing pathogen colonization, degrading dietary and in situ-produced compounds, and producing nutrients. Although the pathogenicity of these normal flora strains of the organism occurs when the commensal is allowed to enter sterile parts of the body including the peritoneum, urinary tract, and blood stream, some _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become enteropathogenic for man. There are currently 6 enteropaths of the bacterium described (enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, diffuse adhering, enteroaggregative, and enterohemorrhagic). The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is the potentially most dangerous and is the one which is zoonotic in origin (primarily from cattle) and the one generally just called _E. coli_ in the lay press." - Mod.LL
