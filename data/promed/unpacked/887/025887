Food poisoning bacteria death tied to transfusion
--------------------------------------------------
Bacteria were detected in the blood of a 65-year-old woman who
died of blood poisoning after receiving a transfusion at an Osaka
hospital in Sep 2003, hospital officials said Sat, 4 Oct 2003.
_Yersinia_, which can cause food poisoning, has been found in
blood from the woman and in blood that was used for the
transfusion at the Saiseikai Suita Hospital in Suita, Osaka
Prefecture, the officials told a news conference. The Japanese
Red Cross Society is looking into the contamination and the
patient's death, the officials said.
If it is confirmed that the woman died of _Yersinia_ contamination,
she will be the first person in Japan to have died of bacterial
contamination from a transfusion. Hospital officials said the
hospital had taken care in handling the blood and the patient, and
that it was "an accident which could not have been prevented."
Officials from the hospital and the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry said the woman was admitted to the hospital with a bone
fracture. While she was undergoing dialysis treatment for chronic
kidney failure on 22 Sep 2003, she received a transfusion of red
blood cells to prevent anemia, the officials said. Shortly after the
transfusion, however, her condition deteriorated and her condition
became critical, they said. She died on 25 Sep 2003 of
complications of _Yersinia_ bacteremia.
The hospital contacted the Red Cross and the Osaka Prefectural
Police on Sept. 25, and the Red Cross notified the health ministry,
according to the officials.
The Red Cross said the blood used for the transfusion came from
blood donated from one person. As it has recalled other blood
products made from the same blood, there is no danger of the
blood being used for transfusions involving other patients, it added.
Although the hospital had refrigerated the blood at between 0 C and
4 C, the bacteria can still grow at temperatures below 5 C.
Yoichi Yasuno, head of the hospital, told the press conference,
"There was no problem with how we kept blood within the hospital
nor in how we responded after the patient's condition deteriorated."

[Bacterial infection transmitted by blood transfusion remains a
persistent but underemphasized problem that has existed since
blood transfusion therapy began. As reviewed by Krishnan and
Brecher (1), in the USA between 1986 and 1991 there were 29
deaths related to the bacterial contamination of blood or blood
products. This represented about 16 percent of the transfusion-
related fatalities during that time period. 8 of the 29 deaths (1-2
fatalities per year) were related to contaminated red cell products,
a risk of 1 death per 9 million red cell transfusions. Relevant to this
case, 7 of the 8 episodes were due to _Yersinia enterocolitica_
(1,2). Other Gram-negative bacilli that have been implicated are
_Serratia_, _Enterobacter_, and _Pseudomonas_ spp. The
source of the organism is thought to be [asymptomatic] transient
bacteremia [in the donor].
Of note, most of the episodes occurred in blood older than 25
days. It has been demonstrated that at 4 C storage, _Yersinia_ can
multiply to high concentrations (3).
Typically, fever and rigors occur within 30 minutes of the
transfusion and may rapidly progress to hypotension, disseminated
intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and death. As in the
Japanese case, the organism was isolated from the patient's blood
and the red cell transfusion (2). In a report from New Zealand, the
fatality rate was 1 per 104 000 per red cell transfusion, a rate 80
times higher than in the USA (4).
The other 21 deaths were related to platelet transfusions,
translating into a fatality rate of 1 per 1 million platelet transfusions.
The microbiology of these episodes was more variable, including a
variety of Gram-negative bacilli (but not _Y. enterocolitica_),
staphylococci, and streptococci.
