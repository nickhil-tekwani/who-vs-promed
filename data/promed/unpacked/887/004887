A one-year old girl from the Shushui native community died in Bagua
Hospital, after being bitten by a vampire bat. Now there are 8 people
who died because of rabies in Imaza district, Amazonas region.

Healthcare personnel sent from Lima are trying to locate more cases
of persons bitten by vampire bats and who may develop clinical
features of rabies, and they are also immunizing persons reporting
having been bitten by vampire bats.

The deceased are 8 indigenous children from the Aguaruna tribe, all
of them less than 15 years old, who were brought from the San Ramon
native community, Yupicusa village.

[The number of vampire bat-transmitted rabies deaths continues to
slowly increase. It would be of interest to know why only children,
and no adults, have been affected so far. Perhaps their sleeping
arrangements in their dwellings make them more exposed to vampire bat
attacks.

Of the 3 species of vampire bats in South America, the most common is
_Desmodus rotundus_, which is most likely responsible for the rabies
virus transmission in these cases. An image can be accessed at
