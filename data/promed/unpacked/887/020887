The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [5 Aug 2013] investigating an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in a kindergarten/child care centre in Sham Shui Po affecting 21 pupils, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent HFMD.

The affected pupils, comprising 15 boys and 6 girls aged from 1-5, have developed oral ulcers as well as rash and vesicles on their hands or feet since 7 Jul 2013. All affected pupils subsequently sought medical consultation and did not require hospitalisation. They are currently in stable condition.

The stool specimen of one of the affected pupils tested positive both for human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and human coxsackie virus A6 upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP.

Officers of the CHP have conducted site visits and provided health advice to the staff. The school has been put under medical surveillance. HFMD is a common disease in children and is usually caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses and EV71. To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:
* Maintain good air circulation;
* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;
* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; and
* Avoid going to overcrowded places.

[Outbreaks of HFMD are frequently attributed to infection by coxsackievirus A6 or enterovirus 71, the latter being associated with a higher frequency of more severe cases. Individual cases of HFMD are a consequence of inadequate attention to basic rules of hygiene, and outbreaks can occur in situations such as day-care centres and kindergartens, where susceptible individuals congregate together and are exposed to infection. It is likely that confection is not unusual, because many human enteroviruses may be capable of causing the symptoms of HFMD. EV71 and human coxsackievirus A6 may have been the only enteroviruses identified specifically. It would be interesting to have information on the progression of the disease in the child with the dual infection relative to the other children. - Mod.CP
