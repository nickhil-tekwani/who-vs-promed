Dozens of residents of the Eshkol region and Gaza perimeter have been
recently bitten by sand flies and suffer from infection and wounds
which leave ugly scars. The sores are locally known as the "Rose of
Jericho" (leishmaniasis).

In Kibbutz Urim alone [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/01/Urim.html>], 27 members have
been infected. "I feel like a leper," said a resident of the area,
both she and her daughters having been bitten. "It started last month
[December 2010], causing hard, red, itching sores. I waited a few days
for it to disappear, but it did not. The pain was really strong, like
the stabbing of needles. Colleagues at work told me it sounds like the
Rose of Jericho, so I went to the clinic."

Eshkol residents are not alone. Even in the Jerusalem area, the number
of bitten persons recently increased. Several children from
Maale-Edomim have been hospitalized in recent days in Shaare Zedek
Hospital in Jerusalem after severe lesions were discovered on them as
a result of fly bites. At the same time, the phenomenon spread to the
Beth-Shean Valley area [northeast Israel].

Israel has always been considered a country with a high incidence of
[cutaneous] leishmaniasis, but in recent years, its spread has
increased. "Leishmania is big trouble, and control efforts are
insufficient," says Professor Eli Schwartz, director of the travellers
clinic and tropical disease specialist in the Sheba Medical Center.
"It is not fatal, but no doubt it is very disturbing and causes
serious aesthetic problems. Vast areas throughout the country are
infected, from north to south. In some places, the situation is really
terrible. We see people bitten dozens of times, showing 30 and 40
lesions on the body."

The disease is transmitted by the bite of the female sand fly. The
flies bite an infected animal, often the rock hyrax [but in several
parts of Israel, other rodents], and transmit the disease to people
they bite. The red ulcers will appear after the incubation time,
several weeks after the bite. It is not life-threatening, but painful
and unaesthetic. "A friend showed me online photos of the scars. I
thought she was crazy," says a bitten woman. "But today, I see that
it's worse than that on the Internet. It looked awful."

Disease management is carried out by drugs: in mild cases, an ointment
that kills the parasite; in severe cases, intravenous application may
be required. Recovery takes a long time, sometimes more than a year.
In any case, the drug does not prevent the ugly scars left behind by
the wounds.

Authorities, as it turns out, do not rush to eradicate the fly. For
example, Eshkol residents who approached the Department of the
Environment in the Regional Council were told that so far, fly
eradication measures could [not] be applied since by law the
authorities are committed to eradicating mosquitoes only.

Until the authorities find a solution, the only way to protect oneself
against the fly is by wearing suitable (long sleeved) clothing after
sunset and applying insect repellent. Nets on the windows will not
help in this case, since the sandfly is very small, and in any event,
pest control measures have a limited effect.

"We are investing great effort to study new methods in order to
control the phenomenon, but there is no magic solution," said Prof.
Itamar Grotto, head of the Public Health Services in the Ministry of
Health, yesterday [19 Jan 2011]. Prof. Schwartz added: "Anyone who has
had an unhealed wound for a week to 2 weeks, and who has stayed in
affected areas, should contact the doctor to check for possible
infection."

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by _Leishmania major_, is known
to be present in Israel in low-lying arid and semiarid deserts,
particularly and traditionally in the Jordan valley, where it acquired
its vernacular name "Rose of Jericho," (synonyms: Aleppo boil,
Oriental sore, Delhi boil, Baghdad sore, etc). Throughout the 1990s it
remained at a relatively stable 0.5-2.5 cases/100 000, but since the
late 1990s, spread into and within areas hitherto not known to be
infected, such as the Jerusalem area (see ref. 1), northern Israel and
the Gaza perimeter, where the Eshkol regional council is located,
including Kibbutz Urim. The total population (all ages) of Urim, where
27 CL cases have allegedly been reported now, is 493 (December 2009
figures).
