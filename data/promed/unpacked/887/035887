Comment on: Yellow fever vaccine-associated death - Spain (20041028.2913,
posted on 28 Oct 2004)
---------------------------------------------------------
The patient was a 26 year old woman. From the description, it appears to be
a case of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD)
in a prospective traveler. The case is unusual in that most of the fatal
cases reported in the literature in prospective travelers have been in
elderly individuals. Other host risk factors include a history of
thymectomy (20040916.2572, 16 Sep 2004) in 17 per cent of patients with
YEL-AVD. Additional causes of thymus dysfunction might very well increase
that percentage, particularly since a fulminant case of disseminated
_Herpesvirus hominis_ type 2 has been reported in an adult patient who had
a dysplastic thymus (Sutton et al, 1974). If an autopsy has been performed,
descriptions of the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen are particularly relevant.
In addition to host factors, at least 2 instances have been reported in
which virus isolated from vaccine recipients had increased virulence for
laboratory animals (Jennings et al, 1994; Martin et al, 2001).
Consequently, both host and virus should be thoroughly investigated.
Neither effective antivirals nor killed vaccines are available for yellow
fever. Accordingly, despite the increases in the number of serious
reactions to yellow fever vaccine reported since 2001, the high mortality
rates of yellow fever amply justify the continued use of this live virus
vaccine in endemic areas.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Seligman for this observation. But almost
half of the adverse events following YF vaccination have been in people who
were not elderly. The 2002 MMWR report referenced below describes the 1st
US case of YEL-AVD in a person aged less than 50 years; of the 12 cases
reported worldwide, 5 were in people under 50 years of age. One case was 16
years old. - Mod.JW]
