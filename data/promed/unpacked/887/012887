[This is the 1st MERS-CoV laboratory confirmed infection reported since the last ProMED-mail update on 29 Sep 2018. One suspects that this individual either had a mild infection or was asymptomatic and detected during testing of known contacts of active cases. As there was only one prior case (Case No. 18- 1753) reported from Afeef in the 2 weeks prior to this confirmation, I suspect this individual was a household contact of this 50 year old male reported as a confirmed case on 24 Sep 2018, and as a fatality on 29 Sep 2018.

Note: UI = Under Investigation

From 2012 through 16 Sep 2018, the total global number of laboratory-confirmed MERS cases reported to WHO is 2254 and 800 associated deaths.

The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR 2005 to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with camels) or a human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[This WHO update is very helpful to fill in some of the gaps in demographics. To summarize, in the period of this update (1 Jun 2018 - 16 Sep 2018), there were a total of 32 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported from Saudi Arabia to WHO, bringing the global total of cases to 2254 including 800 associated deaths (reported case fatality rate of 35.5%.

The 32 cases came from Riyadh (11), Najran (7), Al Qasim (6), Northern (2), Al Ahsaa (2), Jeddah (1), Tabouk (1), Eastern (1), and Al-Bahah (1).

Only 4 of the 32 cases reported during this period were in women, and only 4 were reported in non-Saudi nationals (expats). 23 of the cases had a history of co-morbidities (71.9%). 12 had a history of exposure to camels (37.5%); only one case was in a healthcare worker; all cases were symptomatic; and 10 of the cases were reported to have died (reported case fatality rate 31.3%).

What is impressive about this update are the clusters. Of the 5 clusters, only one involved the healthcare environment, while 4 were household clusters. One of the clusters involved 4 cases in household contacts that were part of a larger cluster that began in May 2018; the remaining 4 clusters involved 2 cases each. Hopefully, the days of large, nosocomial outbreaks are historical. - Mod.MPP]
