Presumptive Case of Mother-To-Baby Transmission of nvCJD
--------------------------------------------------------
LONDON: A report in the Sunday Telegraph on Sun 17 Sep 2000 stated that
doctors in Britain believe that a baby has been born with the human form of
the deadly "mad cow" disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Four
specialists who examined the 11-month old girl, whose mother died of new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) earlier this year, believe that
she has the symptoms of the disease. They believe that the baby contracted
the disease in the womb, the report said. The baby, who was 7 months old
when her mother died, has brain damage and suffers from fits and
convulsions. A final [diagnosis could only be made with a post mortem
examination if the child dies. If the child's disease is confirmed, it
would be the first known case of nvCJD being transmitted from a mother to
her baby.
The latest government figures, released in August, showed that the number
of "definite and probable" cases of the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy had risen to 79 from 77 in the previous month. Mad cow
disease first broke out in British herds in 1986 and peaked in 1992. Four
years later scientists identified nvCJD and suggested it could be
contracted by eating contaminated beef.

[Interviewed on BBC Radio on Mon 18 Sep 2000, Professor Peter Smith of the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Acting Chairman of SEAC
(the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee), stated that the
evidence
so far is circumstantial and there is no conclusive proof of transmission of
the nvCJD agent in utero. There are no records of in utero transmission of
the sporadic form of CJD, or as a consequence of the outbreak of the human
transmissible encephalopathy (Kuru) in New Guinea in the 1950's. - Mod.CP
