WHO recommendations relating to travelers coming from and going to
countries experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza - November 2005
-----------------------------------------------
These recommendations are in line with phase 3 in the WHO 6-phase
scale of pandemic alert: human infections with a novel influenza
virus subtype are occurring, but the virus does not spread
efficiently or in a sustainable way among humans. These
recommendations may change according to the change in the
epidemiological situation and related risk assessments.

WHO guidance for the application of measures before and during
different phases of an influenza pandemic are summarized in the WHO
global influenza preparedness plan issued in 2005.

Advice to countries
-------------------
WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to any areas
affected by H5N1 avian influenza.

WHO does not recommend travel restrictions to areas experiencing
outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds,
including countries which have reported associated cases of human infection.

WHO does not recommend screening of travelers coming from H5N1 affected areas.

WHO does not, at present, recommend the routine screening of
travelers coming from affected areas. Local authorities may, however,
usefully provide information to travelers on risks, risk avoidance,
symptoms, and when and where to report should these symptoms develop.

Advice to Travelers
--------------------
WHO advises travelers to avoid contact with high-risk environments in
affected countries

Travelers to areas affected by avian influenza in birds are not
considered to be at elevated risk of infection unless direct and
unprotected exposure to infected birds (including feathers, feces and
under-cooked meat and egg products) occurs.

WHO continues to recommend that travelers to affected areas should
avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms and any
free-ranging or caged poultry. Large amounts of the virus are known
to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in
affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory
birds or wild birds showing signs of disease.

Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects
contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of
human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during
slaughter, de-feathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for
cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry
products can be a source of infection.

Travelers should contact their local health providers or national
health authorities for supplementary information.
