The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) today
[24 May 2010] releases a risk assessment providing a summary of the
best available scientific evidence for Q fever in Europe. ECDC
developed this risk assessment at the request of the European
Commission, which was initiated due to the high number of Q fever
cases observed in the Netherlands over the last couple of years. The
aim of the risk assessment is to clarify the implications for public
health.

Q fever, caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, often develops
as outbreaks, mainly in the vicinity of sheep or goat farming
activities. The bacteria is transmitted from animals to humans by
airborne transmission and can cause an acute form of flu-like
disease, which is usually self-limited.

If the acute disease is not treated, Q fever occasionally evolves
into a more serious chronic disease, especially among people with
underlying health conditions, such as heart valve disease, vessel
grafts, cancer, or compromised immune system, and it can be fatal
without treatment.

Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC says; "The main conclusion of
the report is that chronic Q fever can be a serious disease. Since
the acute infection can be mild and unspecific, it is easily
overlooked, both by the patient and by the physician, and the
evidence suggests that chronic Q fever is often under diagnosed and
underreported."

The management of Q-fever is the responsibility of national
authorities, and the report aims to provide an additional assessment
of the best available evidence and suggests possible interventions to
prevent and control Q fever. ECDC Chief Scientist, Johan Giesecke
adds: "Early detection and correct treatment for both acute and
chronic infection is essential, and health authorities must work
together with veterinary authorities at a national and a local level
to be able to take necessary actions to stop an outbreak."

The report states that preventing and controlling the acute form of Q
fever can be addressed by various strategies such as public awareness
campaigns to make patients and doctors more observant of mild or
unspecific symptoms, measures to limit Q fever bacteria in the
environment and to limit contact with possibly infected animals.

The present outbreak seems largely limited to the southern parts of
the Netherlands, but since the bacteria can spread over considerable
distances, the risk in neighbouring countries cannot be neglected.

The ECDC risk assessment has been developed in close collaboration
with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide
decision-makers with integrated European-level advice on Q fever
covering both human and animal health, as well as the transmission of
the disease from animals to humans.

The following is a segment from the Executive summary:

"Chronic Q fever is a serious complication of an acute Q fever
infection that develops in some 2 percent of acute symptomatic cases,
and the fatality rate may vary from 5 percent to 50 percent. Chronic
Q fever causes endocarditis in risk groups like people with previous
heart valve disease, a prosthetic valve or vascular graft. Patients
with cancer or those who are immunosuppressed are also at a higher
risk. Chronic Q fever must be treated for at least one year, in some
cases for the lifetime with more than one antibiotic. Surgical
replacement of damaged heart valves might be needed.

Effective detection of, and treatment for, acute Q fever is the best
strategy for avoiding chronic cases. Three possible strategies are
described: (1) awareness raising among healthcare staff and the
public to address the risk groups; (2) active follow-up with serology
for known risk groups to detect and treat an acute Q fever infection
early; or (3) refer all known acute Q fever patients to
echocardiography for active case finding and follow-up.

There is a need to initiate good prospective cohort studies and
controlled trials (when ethically feasible) to obtain more robust
evidence on how to prevent and inhibit outbreaks of Q fever in the
public health field, and on how to diagnose and treat acute and
chronic disease at the clinical level.

Evidence on Q fever in pregnancy is very limited and comes mainly
from observations and research in domestic and experimental animals,
seroprevalence studies, case reports, and one case series including
53 pregnant women over a 15-year period. The risk for pregnant women
of severe Q fever outcomes compared with the risk for the general
(female) population cannot be quantified based on currently available
evidence. Several cases of _Coxiella burnetii_ infection during
pregnancy resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported.
In some of the cases _C. burnetii_ was found in the placenta and in
fetal tissue. _Coxiella_ has also been identified in human breast
milk, but no case of transmission to the breastfed child has been
validated.

There is some indication that long-term antibiotic therapy with
cotrimoxazole has the potential to prevent severe pregnancy outcomes,
but the evidence is based on a case series without randomisation and
without controlling for potential biases. As long as no further
evidence from high quality treatment studies is available, pregnant
women with diagnosed Q fever infection should be treated with
antibiotics throughout the remaining pregnancy. However, the
scientific basis for this recommendation is weak, and ECDC would
strongly recommend that randomised controlled trials are performed to
obtain more reliable evidence.

Pregnant women should be advised not to visit farms in affected
areas. ECDC does not recommend against breastfeeding except in cases
of chronic disease that need long-term treatment of the mother.

A formaline-inactivated whole-cell Q fever vaccine is produced and
licensed in Australia. The vaccine is effective, but pre-vaccination
testing is necessary due to high reactogenicity in persons who have
earlier been infected with _C. burnetii_, making the vaccine more
suitable for defined risk groups than for general vaccination.
Available evidence suggests an effective range of airborne spread of
_C. burnetii_ of less than 5 km. The risk of airborne spread from the
Netherlands is therefore limited to neighbouring countries (i.e.
Germany, Belgium), and to areas close to outbreak sources. Active
surveillance or case finding for acute Q fever in possible risk
groups (i.e. pregnant women, patients with heart valve or vascular
diseases) on a local level and for a defined period of time is
reported feasible and an efficient method for detecting acute
infections. In areas adjacent to epidemic settings (0.5 km from the
source), awareness campaigns among healthcare providers should be
initiated. If the area also affects other Member States, the
responsible public health authorities need to inform their
cross-border counterparts. Sharing of information between public
health and veterinary authorities would facilitate an early
recognition of an outbreak. Further, the health and veterinary
authorities at national and local levels should take the necessary
action to stop an outbreak." - Mod.AS]
