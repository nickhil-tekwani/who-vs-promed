A 27-year-old veterinarian died at Port Elizabeth's St George's
Hospital last week after a 24-day coma, dashing hopes she would
recover from the disease she fought so hard to combat [in her role
as] Cradock's state veterinarian.

The deceased vet's father said his daughter had taken the utmost
precaution when carrying out autopsies on farm animals suspected of
being infected with the disease. She had been "scared" of contracting
Rift Valley fever, which can be passed on to humans who come into
contact with the tissue of infected animals. He said she had
complained of flu symptoms, but tests had repeatedly come back
negative for the disease [Rift Valley fever], which is spread among
animals by mosquitoes. He recalled that "she would wear a protective
suit and 3 sets of gloves when she was doing autopsies on animals
suspected of dying of Rift Valley fever." But when he called her on
Sat 15 May 2010, she sounded incoherent and slurred. Subsequently,
she was taken to hospital when she was already in a coma. She was
declared brain dead, and her life support switched off on Fri 11 Jun
2010. A colleague said that "it was so hard to see her in the coma,
because only about 2 percent of humans who contract this disease die of it."

The Eastern Cape now has 17 confirmed human cases of Rift Valley
fever. South Africa has 221 human cases of the disease, which has
claimed 23 lives nationally.

[Whereas most human cases of Rift Valley fever are relatively mild, a
small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the
disease. This usually appears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes:
ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis
(less than 1 percent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent).

In the ocular form of the disease, the usual symptoms associated with
the mild form of the disease are accompanied by retinal lesions. The
onset of the lesions in the eyes is usually one to 3 weeks after
appearance of the 1st symptoms. Patients usually report blurred or
decreased vision. The disease may resolve itself with no lasting
effects within 10 to 12 weeks. However, when the lesions occur in the
macula, 50 percent of patients will experience a permanent loss of
vision. Death in patients with only the ocular form of the disease is uncommon.

The symptoms of the haemorrhagic form of the disease appear 2-4 days
after the onset of illness, and begin with evidence of severe liver
impairment, such as jaundice. Subsequently, signs of haemorrhage then
appear such as vomiting blood, passing blood in the faeces, a
purpuric rash or ecchymoses (caused by bleeding in the skin),
bleeding from the nose or gums, menorrhagia and bleeding from
venepuncture sites. The case-fatality ratio for patients developing
the haemorrhagic form of the disease is high at approximately 50
percent. Death usually occurs 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms.
The virus may be detectable in the blood for up to 10 days, in
patients with the hemorrhagic icterus form of RVF.

The onset of the meningoencephalitis form of the disease usually
occurs one to 4 weeks after the 1st symptoms of RVF appear. Clinical
features include intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations,
confusion, disorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma.
Neurological complications can appear later (over 60 days). The death
rate in patients who experience only this form of the disease is low,
although residual neurological deficit, which may be severe, is
common. It is evident that the young Eastern Cape vet experienced
this form of the disease, and the fatal outcome was unexpected. It is
surprising that according to this account, diagnostic tests were
negative during the course of her illness.

[RVF is extremely contagious and doesn't pick and chose. You don't
want to be anywhere nearby when an RVF animal is being necropsied; in
an incident in Somalia in the early 1980s everyone within 25 paces of
a field necropsy came down with it. This case is a tragedy but it
will be bring home that RFV is a threat to all, not just indigenous
villagers. - Mod.MHJ]
