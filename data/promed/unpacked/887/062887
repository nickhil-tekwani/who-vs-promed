SALMONELLA, FINCHES - AUSTRIA
==============================
In the spring of 1995 mass mortalities amongst Finches (Spinus spinus,
Coccothraustes coccothraustes, Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were reported to the
Salzburg Zoo, unsolicited, by members of the general public. The reports
all came in within a period of 3 weeks from various regions in Austria. On
a number of birds necropsy/histo-path and bacteriology were performed. The
diagnosis was Salmonella typhimurium. The phagetype and antigene was
identical in all cases and in all locations. The central salmonella lab
pointed out that this was a rare type and that they had diagnosed identical
salmonella in 2 clinically sick infants, cows and various small pets.
A review of the literature has so far only come up with a few meagre papers
(though everyone always seems to say we know all about salmonella!). We
would appreciate any info on this matter, and literature pertaining to the
zoonotic potential would be most helpful.
Thanks
