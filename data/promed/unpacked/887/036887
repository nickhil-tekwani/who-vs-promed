An equine property in Otero County is under quarantine after a horse was found with a viral disease.

The New Mexico Livestock Board and the USDA Veterinary Services are working jointly to ensure the case of vesicular stomatitis at a property outside Tularosa remains an isolated case. The agencies are conducting examinations of all livestock in the Tularosa area to see if the infection is contained. No further cases of vesicular stomatitis have been identified at present, the Livestock Board reported.

The quarantine was ordered Monday [30 Apr 2012] by the state veterinarian after being notified of the case by USDA Veterinary Services.

Vesicular stomatitis is a disease that primarily affects cattle, horses, and swine, according to a fact sheet from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Humans also can become infected when handling affected animals, but human infection is rare.

The southwest and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks in recent years. The viral disease normally does not cause animals to die, but is painful. Usually detected around the mouth and nostrils of horses, the disease forms blister-like lesions that swell and break. Animals typically recover in about 2 weeks though quarantine periods continue for several weeks after affected animals have healed.

The infected horse is among a herd of 5 equines. None of the 5 has been off the property in the past year. The area where the infection was discovered is very low density in terms of livestock numbers.

Managers and producers of major equine shows and events are encouraged to call the state veterinarian at (505) 841-6161 for guidance on how to minimize disruption of shows and events.

[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus is one of those interesting diseases that emerges every once in a while without much warning until it bursts uninvited into our livestock population. It does not occur every year, but in the past several years it has almost yearly.

The problem with vesicular stomatitis is two-fold. One, there is inevitably a disruption of production in cattle; not only will the sick animal produce less, but disease management tactics must be very stringent. The 2nd problem is that the clinical signs are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), with which it can easily be confused (though horses are resistant to FMD and susceptible to VS).

In this case, the diagnosis of the disease in an equine first forestalls any worry about FMD, until an animal susceptible to FMD, such as a bovine, appears with similar clinical signs. Consequently, surveillance must be ever vigilant. Likewise, it seems that states will slam their doors shut to animals from a state that has experienced this disease.

VS can be transmitted by contamination by transcutaneous or transmucosal route and by arthropod transmission (_Phlebotomus_, _Aedes_, etc.). Incubation of the disease may be as long as 21 days.

According to the OIE, clinical signs can be summarized as follows:
- excessive salivation
- blanched raised or broken vesicles of various sizes in the mouth:
Horses: upper surface of the tongue, surface of the lips and around nostrils, corners of the mouth, and the gums;
Cattle: tongue, lips, gums, hard palate, and sometimes muzzle and around the nostrils;
Pigs: snout
- Lesions involving feet of horses and cattle are not exceptional
- Teat lesions occur in dairy herds
- Foot lesions and lameness are frequent in pigs
- Recovery in around 2 weeks
- Complication: loss of production and mastitis in dairy herds due to secondary infections, lameness in horses

There are 2 major serotypes: New Jersey and Indiana. We would like to know which of the 2 strains this one is.
