I have been in discussion with Patrick Bastiaensen and Peter Turnbull on
what the "Symptomatic Vaccine" may be. I believe we have an answer. If
there are mistakes in what follows, they are my errors, not theirs.
Patrick stated that he thought that 'symptomatic vaccine' meant a vaccine
against black-quarter, which is called 'charbon symptomatique' in French
(and Portuguese), as opposed to 'charbon bacteridien' or anthrax.
Apparently it is listed in the WHO Anthrax Guide that Laboratorio Prondil
in Montevideo, Uruguay, makes a combined black quarter/anthrax vaccine
(Blanthrax); they also list "Supervax," which will cover anthrax,
blackquarter, and Botulism C & D.
<http://www.who.int/emc-documents/zoonoses/docs/whoemczdi986.html#_Hlk436471728>
The Central Veterinary Laboratory in Lusaka did produce a mixed vaccine at
one time, and in 1997 Onderstepoort sold a combined vaccine. Whether they
still sell such combined vaccines we don't know.
Obviously if you have to routinely vaccinate cattle against both diseases,
it would be sensible and cost-effective to have the 2 in the same bottle
for loading syringes or vaccination guns. And from the control point of
view, it doubles the chances that stock will actually be vaccinated on
time. Blackleg gives you 9 months grace and then WHAM! if you miss.
Which raises the very sensitive question as to exactly which disease(s)
was/were diagnosed in Guinea Bissau, or was an attempt being made to merely
optimise a vaccine request for another disease under the flag for one more
spectacular. Guinea Bissau had separate vaccine orders in their budget,
which minimally indicates a tradition of vaccinating for both conditions in
the absence of a combined vaccine.
