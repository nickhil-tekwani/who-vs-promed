Fire and corrections officials in the District of Columbia say over a dozen employees at the city's jail complex fell ill after a package that likely contained the powerful opioid fentanyl was opened.

The Washington Post reported on Thu 15 Mar 2018 that 4 workers in the mail room were immediately taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, and 3 decided to go later. Nine others were treated at the jail facility. Officials described the symptoms as relatively minor.

Assistant Fire Chief John Donnelly and D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy L. Booth confirmed the package most likely contained fentanyl. They also confirmed that federal authorities have joined district police and others in an investigation.

Officials say mail deliveries and visits to inmates have been suspended until further notice.

[While fentanyl is suspected, I am not sure it has been confirmed.

The opioid fentanyl is most often thought of as a pain medication. Many times, it is used concurrently with other medications for anesthesia. This is a drug of choice for rapid onset but lasting effects of only a few hours. It has several forms; injectable, a skin patch and an oral formulation for absorption through the skin.

Although we are not told the form involved in the package, it was possibly a powder form, which may have exposed more than one person.

We are not told precisely what sent these workers to seek medical care, but generally, this opioid has side effects including nausea, respiratory depression, confusion, sleepiness and low blood pressure. While it is reported to be more potent than morphine, its analogues may be substantially more potent.

If fentanyl has not been confirmed, then carfentanil should be considered as a differential.

DEA has issued a warning to the public and law enforcement nationwide about the health and safety risks of carfentanil. Carfentanil is a synthetic opioid that is 10 000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl, which itself is 50 times more potent than heroin. DEA, local law enforcement, and 1st responders have recently seen the presence of carfentanil, which has been linked to a significant number of overdose deaths in various parts of the country. Improper handling of carfentanil, as well as fentanyl and other fentanyl-related compounds, has deadly consequences.

"Carfentanil is surfacing in more and more communities." said DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg. "We see it on the streets, often disguised as heroin. It is crazy dangerous. Synthetics such as fentanyl and carfentanil can kill you. I hope our 1st responders -- and the public -- will read and heed our health and safety warning. These men and women have remarkably difficult jobs, and we need them to be well and healthy."

Remember that carfentanil can resemble powdered cocaine or heroin. If you suspect the presence of carfentanil or any synthetic opioid, do not take samples or otherwise disturb the substance, as this could lead to accidental exposure. Rather, secure the substance and follow approved transportation procedures.

Carfentanil is a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substances Act and is used as a tranquilizing agent for elephants and other large mammals. The lethal dose range for carfentanil in humans is unknown. However, as noted, carfentanil is approximately 100 times more potent than fentanyl, which can be lethal at the 2-milligram range, depending on route of administration and other factors.

Exercise extreme caution. Only properly trained and outfitted law enforcement professionals should handle any substance suspected to contain fentanyl or a fentanyl-related compound. If encountered, contact the appropriate officials within your agency.

Naloxone, the reversal agent for many opioid and synthetic opioids is readily available at many overdose treatment centers, hospitals and other treatment facilities.

Remember that carfentanil can resemble powdered cocaine or heroin. If you suspect the presence of carfentanil or any synthetic opioid, do not take samples or otherwise disturb the substance, as this could lead to accidental exposure. Rather, secure the substance and follow approved transportation procedures.

We wish the workers a speedy and uneventful recovery.
