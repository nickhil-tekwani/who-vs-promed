---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Livestock Development (DLD) would like to update you with
information regarding this article as follows:

On 16 Oct 2008, Sukhothai veterinary officials were notified of suspected
cases of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] according to DLD case
definition (a clinically suspected HPAI case for poultry raised in a low
biosecurity system is defined as that experiencing 5 per cent mortality
within 2 consecutive days) in Paknam sub-district, Sawankalok district,
Sukhothai province. Preliminary investigation revealed that, on 10 Oct
2008, the farmer observed the initial one death out of 14 chickens in an
index household. The cumulative mortality as of 16 Oct 2008 was 5 out of
14. The abnormal death of poultry was confined within an household. On the
date of discovery, animal health officials commenced control interventions
according to national protocols, some of which were

- immediate stamping out: 789 poultry were destroyed, including those
remaining of the index household;
- cleaning and disinfection of the index household and surrounding areas;
- village gathering as part of the public communication and education;
- restriction of movement in and out of the affected village;
- submission of samples to responsible laboratory for confirmation.

Surveillance within a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius surrounding the index household
has been intensified. A total of 200 cloacal swabs samples were collected
from 50 villages in 5 sub-districts. Samples were sent to Lower-northern
Veterinary Research and Development Center (LN-VRDC). Results from LN-VRDC
for the samples submitted from Sukhothai and other provinces thus far have
shown no evidence of HPAI infection.

As a precaution following the preemptive culling policy, an additional 4740
birds from 240 household in 12 villages were destroyed, with 75 per cent
compensation (45 Baht or USD 1.3 per kilogram).

From 26 Jan to 31 Oct 2008, DLD received 1293 notifications of sick or
dead poultry conforming HPAI suspicions. All reports were followed by
prompt investigation. The collection of samples for laboratory confirmation
was emphasized, if available. To date, there has been no laboratory
evidence of HPAI.

[In ProMED-mail posting 20081101.3440, dated 1 Nov 2008, we commented: "The
current suspected outbreak at Sukhothai province is pending official
notification, supported by laboratory confirmation." The immediate response
above from Thailand's official authority with first hand, detailed
information, is much appreciated, attesting for Thailand's remarkable
transparency regarding its avian influenza situation, as meticulously
practised since February 2004.

Thailand has managed to control H5N1 rather effectively following the major
outbreak, which severely affected the country during 2004 and 2005. This
was done mainly by the application of stamping out, animal movement
measures, and related zoosanitary measures, while officially prohibiting
vaccination, and accompanied by extensive surveillance. Compared to 136
outbreaks in poultry farms during 2005, 2 outbreaks were reported in 2006,
and none during 2007. In January-February 2008, single outbreaks were
reported from Phichit and Nakhon Sawan.

According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE; Office
International des Epizooties) WAHID interface, HPAI is not a notifiable
animal disease in Thailand.

It would be interesting to note if laboratory tests have been carried out
in samples from the affected household to confirm the epidemiological,
clinical (and postmortem?) suspicions. Otherwise, the authorities have
treated the event as a suspected outbreak, applying a justifiable severe
precautionary disease control policy which included, among others, the
stamping out of the index household and the preemptive culling around it. -
