While no new measles cases have been reported since a Northeast Tarrant County resident became infected last week after attending a softball tournament in Kansas, officials still believe there will be more. Russell Jones, chief epidemiologist at Tarrant County Public Health, said about 50 people have been vaccinated who came in contact with the Northeast Tarrant County resident. Tarrant County officials are continuing to keep in contact with those individuals. "We are following up with them again this week," Jones said. "I do expect we'll get others as a result of contacts from that person who were not immune. Unlike last year [2013], we know who those people are."

Last August [2013], there were 16 measles cases in Tarrant County and 5 in Denton County. In a typical year, Tarrant County doesn't see any measles cases. The Northeast Tarrant County resident became infected while visiting Wichita, Kansas for an informal softball tournament on the Fourth of July [4 Jul 2014] weekend. Texas health officials have said more than 30 people from Texas who went to the tournament may have been exposed to the measles virus. There were reportedly 3 recreational softball teams from Texas who played in Wichita that weekend but only one from Tarrant County.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has reported 14 cases of measles in Segwick and Johnson counties. Tarrant County Public Health said the incubation period for some of the people who came in contact with the infected person will last for another 2 weeks. It can take up to 21 days for some people to show symptoms. Dallas County Health and Human Services has also been monitoring for any possible exposures from the Northeast Tarrant County case, but so far none have surfaced.

Measles cases have been recorded in Nizhnevartovsk for the 1st time in 11 years, This situation was discussed at a meeting of the interdepartmental Commission on Anti-epidemic affairs held in Nizhnevratovsk. The Head of the territorial department of Rospotrebnadzor [Health and Welfare] reviewed the situation in the capital since 2003. The new measles-infected patients have been accommodated in District Hospital No. 3 and are now in quarantine. The medial staff have received anti-measles vaccination.

According to the Senior Physician, Ilya Salmanova, the institution has adequate supplies of all necessary disinfectants and medicines. Doctors were reminded that the only way to protect themselves from the severe consequences of measles is vaccination.

During the meeting of the interdepartmental commission, the Deputy-chief of staff of the Nizhnevartovsk Social and Youth Policy Department, Marianne Parfenov, drew attention to the fact that Nizhnevartovsk is now hosting a large number of foreign nationals, including many who had been forced to leave the territory of Ukraine. The Commission recommended that all Federal Services should provide any necessary assistance required by the local authorities in coping with the influx of measles cases.

The Department of Health in Region 11 (DOH-11) said yesterday [28 Jul 2014] that the spread of measles in the region has become more alarming, with latest statistics showing a total of 1810 cases and 9 deaths. Mary Divene C. Hilario, officer-in-charge of the DOH-Human Advocacy Promotion, clarified that out of the 9 deaths recorded, only one was confirmed to be measles. The 8 other deaths "were clinically compatible with the same disease," said Hilario.

In data sent by DOH 11 to Manila Bulletin, for the same period last year [2013], it revealed that only 125 cases of measles were recorded, with no deaths.

Among the provinces in Region 11, Davao City leads with the greatest number of measles cases at 1086 and with 6 deaths; followed by Compostela Valley with 294 cases; Davao del Norte with 213 cases and 2 deaths; Davao del Sur with 147 cases and one death; and Davao Oriental with 70 cases.

A public health alert about measles has been issued after a person contracted the highly infectious virus in Sydney's inner west. Sydney Local Health District is urging anyone who has visited Leichhardt Market Place, Norton Plaza or the library during the last 10 days to be aware of the symptoms, after an infected person visited these venues many times between 15-24 Jul 2014. Currently, the patient is now well, but specific details have not been released.

All Australian children are routinely immunised against measles, in conjunction with mumps and rubella (German measles), in a vaccine commonly known as MMR. Children receive the 1st immunisation dose of MMR at 12 months and the 2nd dose at 18 months. Those at risk of infection are people born during or since 1966 who have never had measles and who have not had 2 doses of the vaccine.

West Australia health authorities are warning of a "surge" in measles cases, following reports that passengers on a Singapore Airlines flight may have been exposed to the disease. A statement issued by the Health Department this afternoon [31 Jul 2014] said passengers who travelled on flight SQ225 from Singapore to Perth on 26 Jul 2014 26 may have been exposed to measles. They said a passenger who was on this flight had been confirmed with the highly-infectious disease.

The passenger also travelled on Singapore Airlines flight SQ5066 from Davao in the Philippines to Singapore earlier the same day. Dr Paul Effler from the WA Health Communicable Disease Control Directorate said passengers who may have been exposed to measles on this flight could expect symptoms to appear any time between 2-12 Aug 2014.

"Measles is highly infectious and is spread through coughing and sneezing," he said. "Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough and sore red eyes, which usually last for several days before a red, blotchy rash appears. He said passengers who develop these symptoms should seek medical attention but should phone ahead 1st to ensure they don't share the waiting area with other patients and risk infecting them.

"WA is experiencing a surge in measles cases," he said. "So far in 2014, we have had 33 measles infections reported; that's already more than we've seen in any previous year for the past decade."

Dr Effler said 9 of the patients had been hospitalised, and half were adults aged between 20 and 49 years of age.

A 2nd case of measles in Gisborne has been confirmed, said Dr Geoff Cramp Medical Officer of Health.

"Measles is very infectious, even being in the same room as someone with measles after they have left the room can lead to infection. The only way to help prevent measles is to be fully immunized. Someone is only considered immune to measles if they were born before 1969 or they have had 2 documented doses of MMR, or they have had confirmed measles in the past."

Dr Geoff Cramp says that "if you are not immune and there is a case in the classroom or at work, then you will have to stay off work or not go to school for 2 weeks and remain isolated away from other people in case you develop measles and then pass it on. This can be a difficult time for people. So the advice at the moment would be to make sure that you are immunised; you can check with your local medical centre if you are not sure. If there is any doubt, you should get a further vaccination. The measles vaccine (MMR) is free."

Measles has been confirmed in an unimmunised child in Northland this week. The child had been in contact with children from the Waikato, where there has been a large measles outbreak [see preceding ProMED reports] with cases still being reported.

Northland DHB medical officer of health Dr Clair Mills says a family with confirmed measles from the Waikato -- despite having been asked to self-isolate -- recently visited people living in Northland.

"Measles is highly-infectious, and if children are not immunised, there is a very high chance they will get sick if exposed to someone with measles." Dr Mills advises Northlanders to ensure their families are protected from measles. "We are following up over 120 children and adults who were in contact with this case, 40 percent of whom are not fully immunised. Sadly, this is to be expected, given very low immunisation coverage in much of Northland over the last 30 years."

This year [2014], 265 confirmed measles cases have been reported from the Auckland region, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Lakes, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Wellington, with over 100 cases from the recent outbreak in a high school in Hamilton. "Measles can be a very serious illness, with one in 3 sufferers experiencing complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis or diarrhoea," says Dr Mills. "While one in 10 on average require hospitalisation, admission rates in the Hamilton outbreak have been higher. This is an avoidable disease where there is an effective vaccine. Immunisation protects not only the individual but also stops the spread of this disease within our communities."
