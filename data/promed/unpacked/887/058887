A strange fatal virus [see comment below] causing diarrhea among
piglets in Bulacan [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RP/13/Bulacan.html>] has continued
to baffle veterinarians who now fear that if the viral ailment
spreads, there could be a shortage of pork in Metro Manila in 3 months.
Dr. Jose Carillo, chief of the veterinary disease prevention and
regulatory division of the Bulacan provincial government, told The
STAR that at least 5 medium-sized swine farms have been placed under
full quarantine amid reports that the viral diarrhea is highly contagious.
He said cases of the diarrheal virus were reported in the contiguous
towns of Pandi, Sta. Maria and Marilao.
"The virus seems to be a mutation of an ailment we know, but this
time, it seems to be more virulent and contagious. It is a more
advanced virus, " he said.
He said newly born piglets seem to be more susceptible to the ailment
up to their weaning period or about 30 to 40 days after birth. Some
piglets were reported to have died.
Since Bulacan provides about 60 percent of Metro Manila's daily pork
supply, or about 3000 head per day, Carillo fears that if the
mysterious virus spreads in the province, there could be a pork
shortage in the metropolis in 3 months.
"Shortage (of pork in Metro Manila) is possible if the piglets die
before they grow up for slaughter," he said. "Laboratory studies are
still being done."
Carillo declined to give estimates of how many piglets have been
infected by the virus.
Experts from the Bureau of Animal Industry have already stepped in to
investigate the virus, he said.
Carillo lamented that for some reasons, swine farm owners have not
been "open" about giving information on the strange illness.
He said he was not aware of similar cases elsewhere in the country.
Carillo cited the need for "virus security" measures similar to those
adopted during outbreaks of the foot-and-mouth disease. Besides
quarantine, Carillo also urged swine-raisers to look into the feeds
that they use.
"It is possible that the feeds are the sources of contamination,
especially protein sources such as fishmeals," he said.

[There are more than 100 possible diagnoses -- infectious as well as
non-infectious -- for diarrhea among piglets. Among the more common
viral infections involved in such cases, one may include:
- Transmissible Gastroenteritis in Pigs (TGE), which is caused by a
coronavirus, affecting all ages but significant deaths only in
suckling pigs; almost all susceptible piglets under 10 days of age
die within 7 days of exposure to the virus, and about half of pigs
10-21 days of age die;
- Porcine rotavirus of suckling or weaned pigs;
- Porcine adenovirus; and
- Reovirus.
However, additional agents are not excluded; more information will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
