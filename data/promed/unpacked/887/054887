Geographical Spread of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Birds; Situation Assessment
and Implications for Human Health - WHO Update 28
--------------------------------------------------
Beginning in late July 2005, official reports to the OIE from government
authorities indicate that the H5N1 avian influenza virus has expanded its
geographical range. Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian
influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative
agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds infected with the virus
have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed
to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water
sources. These are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza recorded in the 2 countries. Both countries were previously
considered free of the virus.
Since the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has
remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6
administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the
initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease
in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the 2 countries have involved some large
farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120 000 birds dead or
destroyed in Russia and more than 9000 affected in Kazakhstan.
In early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of
89 migratory birds at 2 lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian
influenza A virus has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain
[serotype] has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO
reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early
August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China. In all
of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in
line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian
influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high,
and rumours are being investigated by local authorities.
The outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses
have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where
outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003.
Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus
continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in
some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos. The
south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction
of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for
agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on
small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have
been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas,
have been confirmed in 4 countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and
Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have
been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan,
Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled.
WHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection
in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild
waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all
influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their
low-pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs
of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory
birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of
highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood.
Very large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the
one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which
more than 6000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in
July 2005 indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to
viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last 2 years.
Analyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the
OIE website, show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory
birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian
outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on
these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian
H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously
characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk
of pandemic influenza.
Implications for human health
-----------------------------
The poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that
has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997,
in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the
species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high
fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with
H5N1 disease in poultry.
Experience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are
rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans.
To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most,
but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or
diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food
preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No
cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat
or eggs.
Factors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different
countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a
2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7
strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were
detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one
veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the
destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly
affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when
undertaking control measures in affected farms.
Pandemic risk assessment
------------------------
The possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional
countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for
outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid
introduction of containment measures, as recommended by FAO and OIE.
Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a
history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries
with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and
viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories
allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps
ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course.
The expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern, as it
creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human
case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility,
through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1
strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a
pandemic.

[The cumulative numbers of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection reported to WHO since 26 Dec 2003 remains as
published on 5 Aug 2005: i.e. Viet Nam, 90 cases with 40 deaths; Thailand,
17 cases with 12 deaths; Cambodia, 4 cases with 4 deaths; and Indonesia, 1
fatal case; in total, 112 cases including 57 deaths. - Mod.CP]
