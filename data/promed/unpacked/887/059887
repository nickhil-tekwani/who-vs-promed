[Unfortunately, this alert did not indicate the source of the original information nor did an internet search provide it. The dates and circumstances under which these individuals acquired their hantavirus infections are not given in the report above, nor is there an indication of the specific hantavirus involved in these cases.

ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving this information. There have been 3 previous fatal cases of a hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province this year (2015). There were several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during 2014, 3 of which were fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

Public education is essential to prevent rodent populations, the reservoir hosts of the virus, from becoming established in houses and other buildings. The hantaviruses involved in the report above and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
