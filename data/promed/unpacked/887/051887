From: Walter M. Woolf <Petsfly@aol.com>

The discussions of the West Nile virus on ProMED-mail brings to mind the
teachings in my epidemiology classes at the School of Veterinary Medicine
at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1950's.
Those of us who yet and still enjoy so called private practice, like
myself, and are involved in global animal health issues, are the sentinels
of epidemics and enzootics in this real world we enjoy.
Several years ago, in conducting post-mortems for a client whose the
animals were dead on arrival here in Tampa, we came across a sole tick and
submitted same for identification through Florida's Department of
Agriculture Diagnostic Laboratory in Kissimmee. The tick was subsequently
identified as a tick heretofore never seen in the United States. The
origin of the animals was Sierra Leone. The Kissimmee laboratory notified
the USDA, the field inspector showed up, we reviewed the history of the
shipment of animals with the information we had available from the
documentation on hand.
The essence of writing and hopefully contributing to the betterment of
animal health issues is to simply state we're all players on the issues of
global health, whether the issue is people, animals or whatever. That which
made us veterinarians, physicians, epidemiologists, etc. continues to drive
the process by which we individually contribute to a better world, a more
informed world, through communications at all levels.
