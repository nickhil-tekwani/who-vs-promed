ASF situation in Asia & Pacific update
-------------------------------
[1] The Philippines
Situation update
The 1st outbreak started in July 2019. As of 31 Mar 2022, active ASF cases are present in 20 barangays in 4 provinces (Camarines Norte, Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Northern Samar) and 7 municipalities in 2 regions. However, in Mindanao, new ASF cases have recently been confirmed in Malapatan town in Sarangani province after years without new cases and in 3 balangays in Banga town in South Cotabato.

[2] Malaysia
a. Situation update
The 1st ASF outbreaks were confirmed in Sabah state (on Borneo) in both wild boars and domestic pigs in February 2021 and in Sarawak state in January 2022. ASF has also been confirmed on the Malay Peninsula in domestic pigs and in wild boar since October 2021. Recently, the Negeri Sembilan [state, on the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia] Veterinary Services Department (JPVNS) confirmed ASF on a farm in Port Dickson. ASF occurred recently also in Hilir Perak and Batang Padang districts [both in the state of Perak, Malay Peninsula]. ASF has also been confirmed in pigs in Mapu Kijabu and Daha Kisau villages, in the Serian division, by the Sarawak [state in East Malaysia, northwest Borneo Island] Veterinary Laboratory.

b. Actions taken
The Penang state government approved a control order to give the State Veterinary Services more comprehensive powers for promptly controlling the spread of ASF, including the ability to withdraw licenses/permits for the importation of live pigs or pig carcases.

[3] Lao People's Democratic Republic
Situation update
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak in Salavan province on 20 Jun 2019, ASF outbreaks were reported in all 18 provinces. During the latter part of March 2022, ASF was confirmed in samples from 4 villages in different provinces, namely Namxao village, Longchaeng district, Xaysomboun province; Phonephai village, Salavane district, Salavan province; Khanthachane village, Xayphouthong district, Savannakhet province; Phonemee Tai village, Viengkham district, Vientiane province.

[4] Republic of Korea
Actions taken
The government (Min agriculture, Min environment) released the "Wild boar ASF blocking management measures (April-December 2022)" targeting whole country year-round. The whole country is divided into 3 areas: 1. focused control area, 2. outbreak present area, and 3. preventive area (area without outbreak). Control/preventive measures are reinforced. The wild boar density survey will be strengthened and systematized, setting capture targets to reduce the wild boar density to below 0.7 animals / sq km, nationwide. At the same time, online awareness/education training and distribution of audiovisual materials for pig-farming association/farmers will be conducted.

[5] Papua New Guinea
Actions taken

NAQIA shared a map demarking infected zone, buffer zone 01, buffer zone 02, and movement between with permit (https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=284386243865837&set=a.115384237432706).

After ASF cases were detected in Sikkim, a technical meeting was held on 1 Apr 2022 by Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department in Gangtok. The following measures are imposed: SOPs [standard operating procedures] on PRRS shall be followed and adopted by field veterinarians and piggery farm managers for ASF; the movement of the pigs from affected districts to ASF-free districts (Gyalshing and Soreng) is prohibited. In Mizoram state, the ban of import of pigs and pork products has been reinforced as part of measures against recent ASF outbreaks according to media.
