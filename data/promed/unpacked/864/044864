By 8 Jun 2006, 139 cases of legionellosis had been reported in an
outbreak in Pamplona, northern Spain. All cases presented with
clinical signs of pneumonia, compatible radiography and positive
urinary antigen test.
The outbreak was recognized on 1 Jun 2006, when 4 confirmed cases
were reported to the Public Health Institute of Navarra. The number
of cases diagnosed up to 8 Jun 2006 are presented in the figure, by
date of diagnosis [for the figure, see the original URL - Mod.LL]. Of
the patients (55 percent), 76 were admitted to hospital, and the
other 63 patients have been given treatment to take at home.
A total of 7 patients have required intensive care, and 6 patients
remained in intensive care on 8 Jun 2006, 2 of whom are seriously
ill. No deaths have occurred. Men represent 47 percent of cases. The
patients range in age between 21 and 97 years.
Most of the initial cases occurred in a neighborhood close to the
city center, and the investigations began on 1 Jun 2006 with the
inspection of 30 cooling towers in 11 buildings in this part of the
city. Rapid tests for Legionella antigen were positive in 4 of the
towers, located in 3 buildings, on 2 Jun 2006, and these 4 towers
were shut down immediately. Culture and PCR for Legionella have been
positive in 2 of these cooling towers but could not be confirmed in
the other 2.
The Public Health Institute in Navarra found Legionella with low
bacterial load in 2 further cooling towers, which were shut down on 6
Jun 2006. A helicopter inspection of the area was carried out on 2
Jun 2006 and identified 8 structures that resembled undeclared
cooling towers in the investigated area, but further investigation
has found that none of these structures is a cooling tower.
Microbiological culture of respiratory samples from patients are in
progress. Legionella isolates from the 4 positive cooling towers have
been sent to the reference laboratory in the National Centre of
Microbiology in Majadahonda, Madrid.
The local health authorities have been issuing regular press releases
giving the details of the outbreak.
