A wild boar captured on 19 Dec 2018 in the Aichi prefecture, in Inuyama city, was confirmed on 22 Dec 2018 as infected with hog cholera (classical swine fever [CSF]) virus. Since September [2018], the infection has expanded in the neighboring Gifu prefecture, but this is the 1st time it [has been] found in Aichi prefecture, across the prefectural border.

According to officials, after the capture of the wild boar on 19 Dec 2018 in Inuyama city, a preliminary test conducted by the prefecture resulted in a positive result on 21 Dec 2018. A more precise examination, conducted by a national agency on 22 Dec 2018, confirmed the diagnosis as hog cholera.

Hog cholera affected a pig breeding farm in Gifu prefecture in September [2018], confirmed in Japan for the 1st time in 26 years. The pigs on the farm died one after another. In November [2018], the disease was identified in wild boar in the mountains of Kani city, Gifu prefecture, close to the Aichi prefectural border. Aichi prefecture banned hunting in Inuyama city, Komaki city, and Kasugai city, which are included in the 10-km [6.2-mile] radius area.

[Japan submitted its most recent follow-up report (no. 9) to the OIE addressing CSF on 19 Dec 2018. It addressed a new CSF outbreak on a pig farm and 3 infected free-roaming wild boars, all in the Gifu prefecture.

The said report included, within the epidemiological comments, the following summary of the wild boar surveillance: "As of 14 Dec 2018, 526 wild boars (56 dead and 470 captured) in Gifu prefecture have been tested and 73 were found to be positive for CSF by RT-PCR since 13 Sep 2018. Among the other prefectures, 141 wild boars (132 dead and 9 captured) in 37 prefectures were tested and all found to be negative by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018. All prefectures are requested to conduct CSF testing on dead wild boars."

OIE's summary of the event, since its start on 3 Sep 2018 and as of 18 Dec 2018, follows:
