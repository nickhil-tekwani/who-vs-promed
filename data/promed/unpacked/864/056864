Local media reports that a 65-year-old herder in Tuvshruulekh sum
[district] of Arkhangai Province in Mongolia recently contracted
anthrax. The herder had contact with sick sheep a week ago and later
was confirmed to have contracted anthrax. The county head has already
ordered the outbreak area closed and more than 2000 heads of
livestock vaccinated.
Recently, cases of anthrax in humans and livestock have occurred in
several provinces of Mongolia, and one person has died. Mongolian
agencies remind citizens not to touch the carcasses of diseased
livestock, [so as] to prevent transmission of anthrax.

[The form of anthrax that occurred in the herder is not stated. There
is no mention of a fatality in this case so it may well be that the
disease was limited to the cutaneous form. Mongolia has had a number
of reports of livestock and human cases of anthrax as can be seen by
the archives listed below.
Arkhangai aimag is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia. It
is located slightly west of the country's center, on the northern
slopes of the Khangai Mountains. More discussion, and its location on
a map can be found at:
