People struck down by a stomach bug sweeping the UK have been urged
not to go back to work. Doctors estimate more than 100 000 people a
week are catching norovirus, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting.
Workers need to remain at home for 48 hours after the symptoms have
gone and stay away from surgeries [doctor's offices] and hospitals,
the Royal College of GPs [general practitioners] warned.
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed the number of cases [in
2007 was] the highest since 2002. Norovirus [infection] -- also known
as winter vomiting disease -- is the most common cause of infectious
gastroenteritis in the UK.
Illness can occur at any age because immunity to it is not long
lasting. It is not normally dangerous but the very young and very old
are most at risk of complications from dehydration. The bug can be
spread by contact with an infected person, through contaminated food
or water or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.
Outbreaks are common in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and cruise
ships.
Professor Steve Field, chair of the Royal College of GPs said its
surveillance unit in Birmingham had confirmed the number of cases was
the highest in 5 years. He said the number of new cases each week may
even top 200 000 across the UK. He advised those affected to stay at
home, drink lots of fluids, and take paracetamol.
Dr Darren Simpson, a GP in Bradford said they had seen a large number
of people with norovirus in recent weeks. "Very few people follow the
advice of staying away from work, however, due to unsympathetic and
often nagging bosses. It's the worst time of year to catch it as a
lot of places are understaffed due to leave and bank holidays so
there is increased pressure to attend work if you can."
In December [2007], the Health Protection Agency warned the norovirus
season had started particularly early. In 2007, the number of cases
reported to the HPA in England and Wales from early September to early
December were double those seen in 2006 -- 1325 compared with 685. The
actual number of cases is much higher as most are not reported --
perhaps as much as 1500-fold.

Calls to NHS Direct soared over the extended Christmas break as
hundreds of thousands of people fell ill with a violent stomach bug.
More than 1.2m people logged on to the NHS Direct website or called
for advice over the 11-day period, more than 2/3 higher than the same
time last year [2006]. Dental pain was the most common complaint [no
connection with norovirus. - Mod.JW], followed by vomiting and
abdominal pain.
The figures confirm warnings from doctors and Government scientists
that cases of the winter vomiting bug, called norovirus, have reached
the highest level for 5 years. Almost 2 million people are thought to
have suffered with the 2-day vomiting and diarrhoea bug between the
beginning of September and the 1st week in December [2007].
New cases will peak in the next month [January 2008] and doctors
warned up to 200 000 a week could fall ill as schools and offices
return after the Christmas break. Anyone with symptoms should stay at
home and only visit GPs if their
illness continues for more than 3 days, to avoid [spreading it] further.
Dr Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors and
hospital casualty departments had been 'innundated'." The bug usually
lasts 2 days and can sweep through schools, offices, hospitals, and
prisons. It has struck passengers on the Queen Victoria cruise ship
and cases have been found in more than a dozen hospitals. Dr Field
said its surveillance unit in Birmingham
confirmed that cases were the highest since the 2002 epidemic. Dr
Field, a GP in Birmingham, said: "I know hospitals have been inundated
by referrals and through casualty and local GPs are seeing a lot more
of it. People are at home with it over the holiday, which is the best
place for them, then next week the schools go back, and you get a
child outbreak, and the children go home, and give it to their
parents." He said the best thing to do was stay at home, take
paracetamol, drink plenty of fluids, and call the GP for advice.
Europe & USA
------------
The norovirus season began a month early, with cases across Europe
and America by October [2007]. Dr Mike Sadler, the NHS Direct chief
operating officer, said calls for advice began earlier than normal
and it has consistently been one of the top 5 illnesses that patients
have contacted it about. The disease can cost the NHS up to GBP 100
million [about USD 198.4m) in an epidemic year as operations are
cancelled when patients are struck down and agency staff have to
cover staff sickness. A report from the Health Protection Agency,
which monitors the disease, said: "The number of cases reported this
year [2007] surpasses all other recent years, except 2002, which was
the most severe season recorded and was associated with the emergence
of a new virus type. Outbreaks affect health care facilities
worldwide and may cause massive disruption to providing care,
substantial economic loss, and, according to some reports, mortality
in vulnerable patient populations."
Alastair Henderson, the director of NHS Employers, which finds staff
for the NHS -- Britain's biggest employer -- said: "Obviously this is
a problem for all employers and it does appear there is more of it
about this year [2007-08]. In hospitals it is particularly important
that people who are ill or contagious do not come in to work to
ensure others are not infected."
Economists say the country could lose GBP 12 million (about USD 23.8m)
a week from workers contracting the virus. Since October [2007], the
total loss is estimated at GBP 234 million (about USD 464.3 million).

[ProMED-mail now rarely reports norovirus outbreaks in view of their
ubiquity and short duration. The current outbreak in the United
Kingdom is exceptional in both its extent and potential duration.
Immunity to norovirus infection is short-lived and the immune
response of the host can be evaded as a consequence of the mutability
of noroviruses. New norovirus variants are appearing as a consequence
of both mutation of the virus genome and, it is now recognised, by
genetic recombination of existing strains. Information on the
phylogeny of the virus responsible for the current outbreak in the UK
is awaited with considerable interest. - Mod.CP
