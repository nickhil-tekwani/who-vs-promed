Sources from the Spanish Food Safety Agency said that the batch of
preserved artichokes from a Navarra company which caused last Thu, 4
Jan 2007, the hospital admission of a Guipuzcoan couple has "been
virtually removed" from stores. No additional cases have been reported.
The same sources explained that the fast removal of the batch was
facilitated because it comprised only 800 jars, which were
exclusively sold in the Basque Country. The jars were about to be
distributed also in Valladolid, but this was stopped after the
botulism cases were detected.
Health Services were alerted on 6 Jan 2007 about the consumption of a
batch of "Viuda de Mateo" brand of preserved artichokes, after the
Basque Government reported the occurrence of 2 botulism cases caused
by this product, as it was confirmed according to the tests performed
by the National Food Center. They are a middle-aged couple that
developed early symptoms on 4 Jan 2007. Both of them are being
treated at a local hospital.
The potentially contaminated batch is ND2430512, and its expiration
date is 31 Dec 2011. According to the Spanish Food Safety Agency,
only preserved artichokes from the aforementioned brand, batch, and
expiration date are considered suspicious. "It is also likely that
there is no other affected jar, or there may be only few contaminated
jars", they said.
Health Services pointed out that those consumers who may have used
these preserved foods in heat-cooked meals, as it is the case for
vegetable stews, "should be reassured, since heat inactivates
toxins." In the unlikely case that any consumer, after eating these
preserved foods without cooking them, experiences symptoms compatible
with botulism (impaired vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
difficulty for speaking and swallowing), he/she must seek medical
care at local health facilities", they added.

[The specific symptoms manifested by the affected couple are not
stated nor is the botulinum type -- which is probably A or B.
When unqualified, the term "artichoke" nearly always refers to the
globe artichoke, of which the above-ground part is eaten, in contrast
to the other two (Jerusalem and Chinese), where a root part is eaten.
A picture of the mostly edible buds can be found at:

The Globe artichoke (_Cynara cardunculus_ var. _scolymus_ L.) is a
species of thistle. The edible part of the plant is the base
(receptacle) of the artichoke head in bud, properly called a
vegetable, as it is harvested well before any fruit develops. With
regards to America, it was first brought to California by Italians in
the 1880s, and is farmed mostly in that state.
In this map of the 7 historical provinces of the Basque people in
Spain and France, Guipuzcoa can be seen as part of the Basque
Autonomous Community in yellow:
