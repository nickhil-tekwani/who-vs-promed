About 2000 head of cattle have already died of foot and mouth disease, according to the [Kerala] State Animal Husbandry Department. More than 50 per cent of the dead animals were calves.

Though the government claims to have taken steps to contain the disease, farmers and officials of milk cooperatives remain a dissatisfied lot. The viral disease appears to have been contracted from infected bovines brought in from other states. "A ban has been imposed on the import of cattle from neighbouring states," said V. Brahmanandan, Additional Director, Animal Husbandry Department.

About 8000 head of cattle died of FMD in Karnataka last month [November 2013], according to an official report made by the Karnataka government a week ago. Cattle in about 5000 villages have been affected there. Tamil Nadu has also been facing cases of extensive infection among milk animals.

A senior official associated with the dairy sector told The Hindu that the system of inoculating cattle at the check posts [into Kerala] had failed. The cattle brought from neighbouring states require vaccination certificates from veterinary authorities. But the checking at the check-posts remains much to be desired. In most cases, only 50 per cent are inoculated, with certification being provided clandestinely to the rest without vaccination, he said.

The break in cold chain arrangements has fanned FMD as well. The vaccine has to be kept at low temperatures, but the vaccine in possession of the Animal Husbandry Department could be exposed to higher temperatures due to failure of the refrigeration system arising out of power cuts for 3 hours or more. Such vaccines become ineffective, according to him.

There are also a lot of cases in which the farmer refuses to cooperate with the animal husbandry officials on preventive vaccination because inoculated animals develop fever for a few days, resulting in a temporary fall in milk production. The farmer persuades the vet to issue a vaccination certificate, which is essential to claim medical reimbursement of up to Rs. 2000 [USD 32.17] per year for an animal under a state government scheme.

"New strains of the viral disease have started appearing in cattle, making it difficult to tackle," said George Thomas, in-charge of Farm Support wing of Milma in the Malabar region [northern Kerala]. Vaccines have been developed for the existing strains of the virus. But Mr. Brahmanadan is optimistic about containing the contagion. Booster doses are being administered, and teams have been deputed across the state.

All panchayats have veterinary doctors, and vets have been appointed on a contract basis wherever required. About 60 posts of veterinary doctors are vacant in [Kerala] state, according to him.

[The last EUFMD monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" for October 2013 included the following commentary in relation to India:

"The FAO reference laboratory PD-FMD (Mukteswar, India) analyzed 167 samples for virus serotype confirmation during [October 2013]. The molecular epidemiological studies were carried out for 27 type O isolates, from Madhya Pradesh, Asom, Karnataka, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh, and revealed the circulation of 'Ind2001' lineage FMD virus in the country. (South Asia is known to be an FMD endemic area, but very limited data on serotypes are available (Map 4). The PD-FMD at Mukteswar (FMD Reference Laboratory for South Asia) is active in this region and is requested to provide information on FMD circulation that will assist improved understanding of virus circulation)." The report, which includes -- on page 8 -- map 4 with the details from India "FMD distribution by serotypes 2011-2013," is available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/October_2013_FMD_global_report_DRAFT.pdf.

In view of the seemingly unusual dimensions of the current epizootic in India's 4 southern states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh), which, according to the media-derived reports, are related to the above suggested reasons with special emphasis upon the possible appearance of new FMDV strain(s)/genotype(s), an interim official report from India's central authorities would be helpful. Ideally, it would cover disease distribution, number of outbreaks, cases and mortalities, control measures applied/planned, vaccination coverage, and vaccine-strains used. - Mod.AS
