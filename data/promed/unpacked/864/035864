A British-made COVID test that gives results in just 5 minutes is expected to be at the heart of Boris Johnson's plans to reopen live events, nightclubs, schools, and hospitality, HuffPost UK can reveal. The lateral flow test developed by Yorkshire biotech firm Avacta boasts a higher accuracy than American devices currently imported in huge numbers by the government, but is also much faster.

The UK has spent more than GBP 1billion [about USD 1.4 billion] on tests made by the US company Innova, which has a test result time of around 30 minutes. But the rival Avacta test gives results in between 5 and 10 minutes, a factor that could suddenly make viable so-called "Operation Moonshot" plans to open up theatres, cinemas, and sports stadiums.

It is understood that the final assessment of the British test has been conducted by the government's Porton Down laboratory and industry insiders predict that it will be published either to coincide with the PM's COVID roadmap or soon after. Johnson this week himself floated the idea of the impact such tests could have, saying lateral flow tests could be used for "the toughest nuts to crack -- theatres or nightclubs, for example -- areas of the economy that we couldn't get to open last year [2020]."

Most of the controversial Test and Trace service's GBP 22bn [about USD 30.9 bn] budget is now going on testing rather than contact tracing, with nearly 90% of its GBP 7bn [about USD 9.8 bn] extra from the Treasury going on lateral flow tests. The bulk of test spending has gone to US firm Innova, which manufactures its products in China, but British biotech companies are seen by several government insiders as better for the taxpayer and the UK economy. Once regulators approve the Avacta test, it is expected to be ready for a rollout in huge numbers across the country by early April [2021].

Specialist British manufacturers BBI and Abingdon, which produce the Avacta-designed test, are on track to help meet a target of providing 2 million tests a day after Easter [4 Apr 2021].

Another UK test developed by a company called Mologic offers results within 10-15 minutes and the Department of Health and Social Care is currently waiting on trial results to give either or both approval.

Omega Diagnostics in Scotland has been selected by the government to manufacture the British tests, along with Mologic spin-off Global Access Diagnostics. In an example of the high degree of partnership and collaboration now in the UK industry, Mologic has partnered with Avacta to produce its tests and to get EU regulatory approval. The companies also aim to provide rapid tests to low and middle income countries around the world.

One criticism of lateral flow tests has been their reliability, with fears that while they are excellent at picking up positive asymptomatic cases, they can produce "false negatives" depending on the sensitivity of the test. An initial evaluation of the Avacta test conducted on patients in a Spanish hospital found that it had a "sensitivity" of 96.7% on cases with high viral loads, seen as the key measure by government advisers Sage. On a similar measure, the Innova test had a sensitivity of 78.3%.

The high degree of confidence in accuracy would for the 1st time mean that lateral flow tests could be used as "green light" devices to allow people to do things rather than their current "red light" use to weed out and isolate asymptomatic cases. The super-fast results are also seen as transformative by some in the industry, with sources saying that the time has been brought down considerably over the past few months after experimentation with hundreds of different test strips.

Critics had complained that the 30-minute wait time for an Innova test made it impractical for theatre, nightclub or football match attendance, but the 5-minute test means "entry to venues will be truly rapid", one insider said. "This is of huge significance to the economy." Under one "ticket and test" scenario considered within government, lateral flow tests would be sent out with tickets to live events and used the day beforehand, with a positive result enabling a refund as well as triggering isolation.

But for nightclubs and theatres, a 5 minute test conducted on entrance could now be viable with the new technology. Parents too will benefit from the speed of the British test, as ministers plan twice-weekly home tests conducted on pupils once schools return after 8 Mar [2021]. It is expected that parents would take a simple "breakfast time" nose swab before getting a quick result.

Behind the scenes work has gone on for months to pivot from the US tests, which are imported from China on Virgin Atlantic jets, to home-grown and made rival products.

Issues such as tech transfer agreements and the creation of a common standard have delayed development. One clue to the closeness of the working between the UK government and biotech firms is that the DHSC [Department of Health and Social Care] has loaned manufacturing equipment to Omega Diagnostics to allow it to expand its capacity. Test and Trace has now shifted dramatically towards the use of lateral flow tests in its service, and they now outnumber laboratory-based PCR tests.

A record 2 400 724 lateral flow device (LFD) tests for COVID-19, or rapid tests, were conducted in England in the week to [10 Feb [2021], according to the latest Test and Trace figures. By contrast, 1 295 051 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were conducted in the same week.

The UK Rapid Antigen Test Consortium, a growing coalition of industry scientists and manufacturers, has been created to secure lateral flow tests and manufacturing capability for the UK. One of its members, SureScreen Diagnostics, this month [February 2021] signed a contract for 20m tests that produce a result in under 30 minutes. SureScreen's were the 1st British tests to be validated in the laboratory by Public Health England (PHE).

In a separate development, Nottingham-based SourceBio International has taken over the contract for a pilot scheme using mobile testing labs for "surge testing" of new variants in the UK.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for the DHSC said: "With up to 1/3 of individuals with COVID-19 not displaying symptoms, broadening asymptomatic testing is essential to breaking the chains of transmission.

"All lateral flow tests used by the UK government go through a rigorous evaluation process by the country's leading scientists which means they are accurate, reliable and successfully identify those with COVID-19 who could pass on the virus without realising."

A previous version of the Avacta test, which relied on saliva rather than nasal swabs, did not pass testing by Porton Down last month [January 2021]. However, the latest updated version has shown excellent preliminary results and is currently being assessed.

22 Feb 2021 update
------------------
Avacta said in a statement that Porton Down had assessed its nasal swab test, which did not rely on saliva.

"The evaluated test was the anterior nasal swab test that has subsequently generated the excellent initial clinical performance data outlined above. However, in its evaluation Porton Down used artificial samples and did not use clinical samples," it said.

"We believe an accurate, rapid antigen test, that has been appropriately validated, will help to limit the spread of the coronavirus and support the safe return to work and play.

"In the UK, the DHSC is a potential customer and partner in the roll out of such a validated test. While Avacta continues to be in dialogue with the DHSC, and with other organisations in the UK and abroad, with a view to future supply of its rapid antigen test, it is prioritising the full clinical validation of its nasal swab-based SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test as a pre-requisite for CE marking and broad commercialisation."

[The Prime Minister said, "I think inevitably there will be great interest in ideas like, can you show that you had a vaccination against COVID in the way that you sometimes have to show you have had a vaccination against yellow fever or other diseases in order to travel somewhere." (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14104995/nightclubs-theatres-sports-could-reopen-covid-test). This is exactly what has been advocated by a group of scientists (among which I am one) for COVID vaccination to become included on the WHO yellow card. [ref: Petersen E, Lucey D, Blumberg L, et al. COVID-19 vaccines under the International Health Regulations -- We must use the WHO International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Int J Infect Dis. 2021 Jan 20; 104: 175-177. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.039. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33482380; PMCID: PMC7817399; https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(21)00050-3/fulltext] This would be a global certification of immunization, making it easier for countries to reopen borders. But even with the card, rapid testing will be a guarantee the individual is not going to transmit virus. Michael Mina (Harvard Public Health/Medical School) has been advocating rapid testing for some time now. - Mod.LK]

[2] Results from Israel's vaccine rollout (Pfizer)
Date: Sun 21 Feb 2021

What other countries can learn from Israel's COVID vaccine rollout
------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are falling among vaccinated age groups in Israel, which could be a sign that the nation's rapid vaccination campaign is working. Israel's vaccination campaign kicked off [20 Dec 2021], giving priority to medical professionals, people with high-risk conditions, and adults 60 or older. On [10 Jan 2021], 2nd doses began for those groups, and by 6 Feb 2021], 30% of Israel's entire population -- 80% of individuals 60 or older -- had received 2 doses of the vaccine.

Today, 32% of Israel's population is fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, the United States has fully vaccinated about 5% of its population.

To examine the effect of widespread vaccinations among older Israelis, researchers from Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel-Aviv University, and Technion analyzed Israeli Ministry of Health data on hospitalizations and PCR testing from March 2020 to February 2021. The researchers found that infections fell among all age groups between mid-January and mid-February [2021], but the effect was most striking among the largely vaccinated group -- people 60 or older. In the weeks that followed a peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-January [2021], cases among those 60 and older fell 66%, according to an extended dataset sent to ABC News by Uri Shalit, who worked on the analysis.

"Israel is way up there, with 78 doses per 100 people, compared to the United States, which is 16.7 doses per 100 people," Dr Anthony Fauci said during a White House press briefing on Wednesday [17 Feb 2021]. "We have been hearing and seeing in the press that Israel has a remarkable diminution in cases associated with the efficiency of their vaccine." Hospitalizations similarly fell 57% in the vaccinated 60-and-older group.

"It's pretty clear that we're seeing an impact for the populations that got vaccinated," said Shalit, who is an assistant professor at Technion Israel Institute of Technology. As younger age groups are vaccinated and additional data is collected, Shalit said his team is seeing hospitalizations plummet among 50-55-year-olds. Since the January [2021] peak, hospitalizations have fallen 40% for the 50-55 group compared with 10% for those 54 years old or younger.

Although vaccinations started in late December [2020], it took until February [2021] to see a sharp decline in cases and hospitalizations. "We thought we'd see the drops earlier," Shalit said. "In Israel, a lot of people were vaccinated and we still saw cases going up. One thing we think is pretty clear is that you need the 2nd dose for protection."

One complicating factor in Israel's vaccination story is that the country went into a national lockdown on [8 Jan 2021] including closing stores, restricting travel, and partially shutting down schools. While the lockdown likely had an effect on cases and hospitalizations, groups that were vaccinated earlier are seeing the biggest declines. When the researchers compared cities where people were vaccinated earlier to cities that were vaccinated later, the drop came earlier for the cities that vaccinated first, Shalit explained. "It would have to be a very particular set of events for it not to be the vaccinations," he said of the declining cases and hospitalizations.

Additional research from Israel's largest health care provider, Clalit, is also on the horizon. Clalit, which covers more than half of all Israelis, has been conducting a study on 600 000 people who received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. While peer-reviewed published results from the study are not yet available, data from Clalit's study are showing a 94% drop in symptomatic COVID infections among those vaccinated and that those individuals also were 92% less likely to develop severe illness than those not vaccinated.

"It shows unequivocally that Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is extremely effective in the real world a week after the 2nd dose, just as it was found to be in the clinical study," Ran Balicer, Clalit's chief innovation officer, said in a statement to ABC News.

[Although it is stated above that you need the 2nd dose for protection, a study that drew from a group of 9100 Israeli healthcare workers, published in The Lancet correspondence (see reference below) on Thu 18 Feb 2021 showed that "Pfizer's vaccine was 85% effective 15-28 days after receiving the 1st dose.

Pfizer and BioNTech's late-stage clinical trials, which enrolled 44 000 people, showed that the vaccine was 95% effective if 2 doses were given 3 weeks apart." It is not known how long protection lasts following only a single dose. Thus even with the high level of effectiveness observed 2-4 weeks post single vaccination, protection may drop sharply with time, necessitating the booster dose.

The results discussed in the report above are very encouraging. It is recommended the reader looks at the figures included in the report showing the drop in cases and the drop in hospitalizations.

[3] Vaccine impact on transmission

There is "early data" showing a reduction in transmission in people who have had a coronavirus vaccine, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said hospital admissions were falling "much more sharply" than they were in the pandemic's 1st wave.

The government aims to offer a 1st jab to all adults in the UK by the end of July [2021], with one in 3 adults already vaccinated.

Boris Johnson will unveil his plan for ending England's lockdown on Monday [22 Feb 2021]. The PM is due to present his plans to MPs in the Commons in the afternoon, before leading a Downing Street briefing at 19:00 GMT.

A further 9834 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday [21 Feb 2021] and 215 more people have died within 28 days of a positive COVID test, according to the government's daily figures.

The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds:

- In Scotland, the government hopes to publish a route out of lockdown next week, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to book Easter holidays.
- In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced up to 4 people from 2 different households can exercise outdoors together from Saturday [?20 Feb 2021]; he said he hoped the "stay-at-home" requirement could end within 3 weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time
- Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter -- a review of current measures will take place on [18 Mar 2021].

As part of the road map, Public Health England will publish new data on the impact of vaccines on transmission rates.

Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday [21 Feb 2021] that he was "absolutely delighted" with the progress of the vaccine rollout. But he added that while hospital admissions were falling, the number of people in hospital -- currently around 18 000 -- was still "far too high."

The health secretary reiterated the government's new plan to offer a jab to adults aged 50 and over and those in the top 9 priority groups by [15 Apr 2021], followed by all adults by the end of July [2021].

The government's previous target was to offer all adults the 1st dose by September [2021], but the PM has said he wants the rollout to "go further and faster." Mr Johnson has said that this would give vulnerable people protection "sooner" and help to further ease lockdown restrictions across the country.

However, the order of priority for the under-50s has yet to be outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Prof Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, told BBC Breakfast earlier that he expected a public announcement would be made on vaccine priorities at some point in the next week.

https://fortune.com/2021/02/19/do-covid-vaccines-stop-infections-or-just-make-you-less-sick-transmission-are-you-still-infectious-after-coronavirus-vaccine/


One of the biggest questions surrounding COVID-19 vaccines from the likes of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca is whether or not, and to what extent, they can prevent actual transmission of the coronavirus rather than just making someone less sick if they do contract it (the latter an important goal itself). We're beginning to get more answers to that crucial query -- and the early findings are promising.

There was already preliminary evidence in early February [2021] that the AstraZeneca vaccine, created in conjunction with the University of Oxford, cut transmission rates for the virus by about 2/3 with just a single dose.

That data will soon be confirmed, reports the Telegraph, citing sources from Public Health England (PHE), not just for the AstraZeneca vaccine but for a single dose of the 2-dose Pfizer vaccine as well. And that protection against transmission appears consistent across all age groups.

This adds to evidence from 2 Israeli studies published this week, finding that Pfizer's COVID vaccine significantly reduces the virus's transmission. The joint analysis between Pfizer and Israel's health ministry found that a 2-dose regimen of the shot reduced infections by 89.4% overall (including asymptomatic cases) and 93.7% in symptomatic cases. Results were tracked via testing for COVID infections, fueled by a national COVID-tracking database in Israel. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed.

The 2nd study examined more than 7000 hospital staff and found about a 75% reduction in infections with Pfizer's vaccine.

To be clear, it's important to get vaccinated when your turn comes, regardless of how effective a vaccine is against preventing infection, as public health officials have made clear. Given the high efficacy rates of the Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and AstraZeneca vaccines, getting some kind of shot would still weaken the virus and at the very least lower the chances of spreading it to others.

We already know that these vaccines significantly reduce the risk of COVID-related hospitalization and deaths for those who may go on to contract it. But the ideal would be to achieve a significant level of "sterilizing immunity," the kind that can stop widespread community spread of the coronavirus. And the information rolling in suggests this class of vaccines may meet that challenge.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (58 950), Brazil (29 026), and France (22 046) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 6349 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 20 Feb 2021 to late 21 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, India (13 980), Italy (13 450), and Russia (12 742). Countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Venezuela, among others. Other countries are showing marked reductions in reporting from prior days consistent with previously noted weekend artifact. A total of 43 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 43 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.2%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 21.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 22.5% decrease in daily reported cases and 39.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments, the global daily reported cases totaled over 313 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 111.95 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.47 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. - Mod.MPP]
