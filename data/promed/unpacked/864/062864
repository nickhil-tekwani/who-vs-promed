Tests have shown that a Finnish seagull suspected of having a deadly strain of
bird flu had a "mild," more common type of the virus, the European Union said.
"The Finnish chief veterinary officer said this is not the H5N1 virus,"
European Commission spokesman Philip Tod told journalists in Brussels
today. "This is a mild, low-pathogenic strain of avian influenza [LPAI] that
is commonly found in wild birds." The Finnish case poses a minimal risk to
poultry and humans, he said.
Finland's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said on its Web site that tests
on the seagull were carried out in the northern Finnish town of Oulu on 26 Aug
2005. Finland has never had a case of H5N1.
