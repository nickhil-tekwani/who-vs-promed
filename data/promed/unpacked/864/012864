9 typhoid fever reports probed
-----------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection is reviewing 9 reports of typhoid fever in
the past 3 weeks: 7 in Yuen Long, one in Sham Shui Po and an imported case.
The 7 cases in Yuen Long included 4 children aged 9 to 13 in a single
family, a 51-year-old man, and 2 girls aged 8 and 17. The Sham Shui Po case
involved a 7-year-old boy.
They developed symptoms, including fever, stomach pain and vomiting,
between 18 Nov and 6 Dec 2005.
All the Yuen Long patients were admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital. The 4
children from the same family and the 17-year-old girl are in stable
condition, while the 8-year-old girl and the 51-year-old man have been
discharged. The 7-year-old boy in Sham Shui Po was admitted to Caritas
Medical Centre and is now in stable condition.
Community Medicine Consultant Dr. Thomas Tsang said initial investigations
did not reveal a single common food shop or hawker all the patients had
patronized.
The center is conducting detailed tests to find out whether the cases
originated from a common source. More definitive laboratory results are
expected in about 2 weeks.
Typhoid fever is endemic in Hong Kong, Dr. Tsang said, adding there were
from 0 to 11 cases reported monthly in the past 2 years. A total of 33
cases have been reported so far this year [2005]. There were 53 cases in
2004, 49 in 2003, 67 in 2002 and 67 in 2001. Yuen Long district had from
one to 9 cases each year from 2001 to 2004, Dr. Tsang said.
