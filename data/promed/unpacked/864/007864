Dysentery Plaguing Volgograd Region.
VOLGOGRAD -- Three group cases of dysentery have been registered in the
Volgograd region of Russia this August. Sources in the regional health care
committee told Itar-Tass 17 residents of the village of Zholoby were
hospitalised with acute intestinal infection on Thursday. A day earlier, 11
residents of the village of Vishnevy in the region's Zhirnovsky district
had to be hospitalised with the same symptoms. The first case was
registered in the summer camp Serebryannye prudy (Silver ponds) of the
Frolovsk district at the beginning of August. In all three cases, children
made up one half of the patients.
