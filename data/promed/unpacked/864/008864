Abstract
--------
To determine the occurrence of feline bartonellosis in Israel, blood samples were collected from 179 stray and 155 domestic cats from 18 cities or villages in central and north central Israel. Samples were screened for _Bartonella_ infection by culture isolation and molecular detection using high-resolution melt (HRM) real-time PCR assay targeting the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). All positive samples were confirmed by 2 additional HRM real-time PCR assays targeting 2 fragments of the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and the 16S rRNA genes. The prevalence of _Bartonella_ spp. infection in the general tested population was 25.1 percent (84/334). A higher prevalence was detected in the stray (30.7 percent; 55/179) than the domestic cats (18.7 percent; 29/155). _Bartonella henselae_, _Bartonella clarridgeiae_, and _Bartonella koehlerae_ were highly prevalent in both cat populations, however their distribution among the 2 populations varied significantly (p=0.016). _B. clarridgeiae_ and _B. koehlerae_ were found to be more prevalent in stray than domestic cats, whereas _B. henselae_ was evenly distributed. Co-infection with 2 or more different _Bartonella_ spp. was determined in 2.1 percent (7) of the cats. The ITS HRM real-time PCR assay used in this study was shown to have a greater screening power than bacterial isolation, detecting 94.0 percent (79/84) compared to 35.7 percent (30/84), respectively, of all positive samples. The high prevalence of these zoonotic _Bartonella_ species, coupled with the overpopulation of stray cats, and increased numbers of domestic cats in the major urban centers in Israel represent a significant threat for the public health in this country.

[Bartonellae are vector-borne, fastidious, pleomorphic Gram negative and facultative intracellular bacteria that cause persistent bacteremia in mammalian hosts. Cats are acknowledged as a reservoir for several _Bartonella_ species. The most common _Bartonella_ species detected in cats are _B. henselae_ and _B. clarridgeiae_, both implicated as the cause of 'cat scratch disease' in humans. A 3rd species, _B. koehlerae_, has been isolated from cats and was implicated in a single case as the cause of endocarditis in a human patient.

Although some clinical manifestations were associated with natural and experimental infections in cats, most feline _Bartonella_ infections are considered to be subclinical in that species.

The authors included in their discussion chapter comparable data from other countries, which deserve to be cited here (for the references, please go to the original paper):

"This study demonstrates a high overall molecular prevalence (25.1 percent) of _Bartonella_ infection in cats from 18 cities and villages in central and north central Israel. Recent studies that included both stray and domestic cats have reported lower infection rates in the overall feline populations in Spain, China, and Thailand ranging from 0.3 to 15.1 percent. However, higher rates were reported from South Korea, reaching 40.4 percent of the total cat population. In our study, the infection rate was significantly higher in stray (30.7 percent) than domestic cats (18.7 percent) (p = 0.012). Such findings were also described in Spain, China, and Thailand, and varied from 0.7 to 23.9 percent in stray cats as compared to 0 to 11.1 percent in domestic cats. The reported prevalence in the South Korean stray cats was 43.9 percent compared to 33.3 percent in domestic cats. The latter prevalence was higher compared to recent reports from Brazil (4.3 percent), Germany (16.6 percent), and Thailand (17 percent), where domestic cats only were included in the studies. Additionally, infection rates in stray kittens in our study were significantly higher than in mature cats, as has been previously reported in domestic cats from the United States and Germany. In [contrast], no significant differences between any categorical ages were detected in the domestic cats in this study, probably due to the relatively small number of cats with available data in this group."

The authors mention in the abstract the "overpopulation of stray cats" in Israel. This is indeed a striking and, from a public health perspective, worrying phenomenon. Subscribers will probably be surprised to note that, due to modifications in Israel's legislation, stray cats have become protected to the extent that a relocation of a feline from the street where it is straying to another location is an offense liable to penalty. Their number is estimated at around 2 million (Israel's human population is about 8 million). _Bartonella_ spp are just one of the zoonotic agents disseminated by uncontrolled stray cats. Recently, their possible potential role in the epidemiology of MERS-COV in the Eastern Mediterranean was subject to discussions. - Mod.AS

Human infections with _B. henselae_ do occur in Israel. The following is a short CDC discussion on the process (http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/catscratch.htm):

What is cat scratch disease?
----------------------------
Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a bacterial disease caused by _B. henselae_. Most people with CSD have been bitten or scratched by a cat and developed a mild infection at the point of injury. Lymph nodes, especially those around the head, neck, and upper limbs, become swollen. Additionally, a person with CSD may experience fever, headache, fatigue, and a poor appetite. Rare complications of infection are bacillary angiomatosis and Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome [conjunctivitis that is often unilateral, with swollen lymph nodes, and usually associated with a bacterial infection].

Can my cat transmit _Bartonella henselae_ to me?
------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, yes, cats can spread _B. henselae_ to people. Most people get CSD from cat bites and scratches. Kittens are more likely to be infected and to pass the bacterium to people. About 40 percent of cats carry _B. henselae_ at some time in their lives. Cats that carry _B. henselae do not show any signs of illness; therefore, you cannot tell which cats can spread the disease to you. People with immunocompromised conditions, such as those undergoing immunosuppressive treatments for cancer, organ transplant patients, and people with HIV/AIDS, are more likely than others to have complications of CSD. Although _B. henselae_ has been found in fleas, so far there is no evidence that a bite from an infected flea can give you CSD.

How can I reduce my risk of getting cat scratch disease from my cat?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Avoid "rough play" with cats, especially kittens. This includes any activity that may lead to cat scratches and bites. Wash cat bites and scratches immediately and thoroughly with running water and soap. Do not allow cats to lick open wounds that you may have. Control fleas. If you develop an infection (with pus and pronounced swelling) where you were scratched or bitten by a cat or develop symptoms, including fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, contact your physician." - Mod.LL]
