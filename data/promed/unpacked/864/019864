More than 23 000 people, most of them children, have been infected by the measles in 2015 in the Katanga region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the United Nations and Doctors without borders, more than 400 have died from the virus, The New York Times reported.

One small village of just 500 people lost more than 30 children, all of whom were less than 5 years old, in a 2 month time span. Augustin Ngoyi, the response coordinator for Doctors Without Borders said: "Their little graves are still visible in the cemetery."

The epidemic began in February 2015, but the central government in Kinshasa did not recognize the problem until early September 2015 and deaths have not been properly counted, Ngoyi said.

According to The New York Times, Doctors Without Borders has put tremendous effort into vaccinating children, who are the group most susceptible to the virus, and have succeeded in vaccinating about 300 000. However, the process is difficult as 2 shots, weeks apart, are need to protect a person fully, and the vaccine must be kept refrigerated. A combination of poorly maintained railroads, fuel shortages, and bad roads makes it problematic to deliver the vaccine to villages. Additionally, many children's immune systems have already been compromised by malaria and malnutrition, said The New York Times.

The country's southernmost region of Katanga is known for its cobalt and copper mines but also has a long record of trying to secede from the country, instigating clashes between the Congolese army and local militia groups. Many people flee from their villages to escape the fighting, and doctors have a hard time tracking them down to administer the vaccines.

By the end of 2014, the Philippines saw more than 58 000 measles cases and 110 deaths linked to the vaccine-preventable disease. However, 2015 is a new year, and after extensive vaccination campaigns one year ago called "Ligtas sa Tigdas," (Safe from Measles), we see that the measles case count is dramatically down during the 1st 7 months of the year [2015].

From 1 Jan-31 Jul 2014, health officials saw 44 624 suspected and confirmed measles cases in the country. During the same period in 2015, that number has dropped to 2384 total cases. In addition, the measles death tally this year [2015] is 2.

According to the World Health Organization, measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. The disease remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Approximately 145 700 people died from measles in 2013, mostly children under the age of 5.
