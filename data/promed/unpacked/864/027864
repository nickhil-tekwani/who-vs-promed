Hong Kong: parainfluenza virus detected in 3 specimens
------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today
(Thu 18 Nov 2004) received a report from the University of Hong Kong that
laboratory tests using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) method on 3 out of the 7 specimens taken from patients of the
Caritas Medical Centre (CMC) outbreak yielded positive results for
parainfluenza virus (PIV), but all 7 specimens were negative for other
common respiratory pathogens.
A CHP spokesman said PIVs are spread by respiratory secretions through
close contact with infected people or contact with contaminated surfaces or
objects. "Infections caused by PIVs are common, especially in infants and
small children. Severe illnesses, however, could occur among young children
and patients with immunodeficiencies. The incubation period is generally
from one to 7 days. "Infection can occur when infectious material contacts
mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth or nose, and possibility through the
inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough," the spokesman said.
Laboratory tests on other specimens are still proceeding.
As at 10 am today [Thursday], a total of 32 children comprising 19 boys and
13 girls, aged between 4 and 17 [years], in the Development Disability Unit
of CMC are found to have suffered from respiratory disease. 2 of them are
still having fever. The spokesman said the enhanced infection control
measures being implemented at the affected wards in CMC are effective to
prevent the spread of PIV. "In a hospital setting, spread of PIVs can and
should be prevented by strict attention to droplet and contact precautions,
such as handwashing, as well as wearing of masks, gowns and gloves," the
spokesman said.

Hong Kong: mystery illness at Caritas Centre identified
-------------------------------------------------------
The mystery outbreak of illness at Caritas Medical Centre was caused by the
parainfluenza virus, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the
Department of Health confirmed on Thu 18 Nov 2004. Another patient at the
hospital fell victim to the respiratory disease on Thu 18 Nov 2004, taking
the total number of cases -- including those recovered -- to 32, with 2
still suffering from fever.
The CHP received a report from the University of Hong Kong that 3 of 7
patients from the medical centre had tested positive for the virus.
Specimens from all 7 patients yielded negative results for other common
respiratory diseases. "Infections caused by the parainfluenza virus are
common, especially in infants and small children. Severe illnesses,
however, could occur among young children and patients with
immunodeficiencies. The incubation period is generally from one to 7 days,"
a spokesman for the centre said. The spokesman said the virus is spread by
respiratory secretions through close contact with the infected or
contaminated objects or surfaces. "Infections can occur when infectious
material comes in contact with mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth or nose,
and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or
cough."
The spokesman said enhanced infection control measures implemented in the
affected wards in the Caritas Medical Centre are effective to contain the
spread of the virus. "In a hospital setting, the spread of the virus can
and should be prevented by strict attention to droplet and contact
precautions, such as washing hands, and wearing masks, gowns or gloves," he
said. The centre is still conducting laboratory tests on other specimens,
he added.
