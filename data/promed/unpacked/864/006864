HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has indeed occurred in Apache County
prior to this latest case. The 1993 outbreak of HPS in the Four Corners
region occurred after a mild, wet winter (aided by the El Nino in force
that year) which combined with the rains in the previous year, finally
resolved about 6 years of drought. This in turn resulted in a superbloom
of the vegetation and insects that deer mice dearly love. They responded
with a population explosion. Because of their numbers and a propensity to
invade human dwellings, unlike [most other wild rodents, contact between
them and people within their habitat increased. Presumably, this is the
sequence leading to the outbreak.
Given the rains induced by this year's El Nino, it is natural and
prudent of Arizona health officials to become concerned. Precautions
certainly include taking measures to rodent-proof dwellings, opening
long-closed buildings with proper equipment, and intensive education of the
population.

[The area in which this patient acquired her infection is under more than a
meter of snow. For those of you who asked, this does not indicate that the
patient was under a snow drift but that her house was surrounded by snow.
Under such circumstances deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), a very
adaptable rodent ("the quintessential generalist"), infected or uninfected
with a hantavirus, often invade human domiciles, increasing the probability
of human infections. The concern on the part of state health authorities
is genuine. They may fear that public education efforts will need to be
reinforced.
This Arizona case-patient appears to have been exposed to a hantavirus,
probably Sin Nombre virus, sometime in January at her home in a subalpine
habitat at >3,000 m elevation. The occurrence of an HPS case in the middle
of winter at high elevation seems a little unusual in that onset of most of
Arizona's previous cases at higher elevations have occurred in spring,
summer and fall.
Arizona and the southern portions of Colorado, New Mexico and elsewhere
here in the U.S. west have been receiving inordinate amounts of
precipitation (rain, snow). Here in northern Colorado we have received
essentially none on the plains, plenty in the mountains. Southern Arizona
is "greening up" and this should be an especially good year for preseason
baseball and for wild flowers in the southern deserts, just as it was after
last year's wet winter and as after the winter of 1992-1993, the period
just prior to the first recognized outbreak of HPS in the Four Corners area.
First indications are that peri-domestic rodents are an increasing problem
in the southwest. CDC-sponsored longitudinal studies should provide
further information as the winter progresses. Whether this will translate
into increased incidence of HPS remains to be determined. - Mod.CHC
