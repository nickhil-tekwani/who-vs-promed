[Since Myanmar confirmed the first ASF outbreak in August 2019, a total of 4 ASF outbreaks were reported in Shan State. According to its final report submitted 8 Jan 2020, no new outbreaks were detected and the event was considered as resolved on 29 Dec 2019. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31365. However, with this new case detected in Lashio, located in the same state, it is clear that the virus continues to be present and spreading in that area.

Shan State is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the east, Thailand to the south, and by 5 administrative divisions of [Myanmar] to the west https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State.

Since the disease was first officially reported by China in August 2018, the disease has spread to Mongolia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, The Philippines, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Timor-Leste, Indonesia and Myanmar.
