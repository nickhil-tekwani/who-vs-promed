[Our intrepid Top Mod, Jack Woodall, looked over the previous postings on
Flaccid Trunk disease which is more appropriately called Floppy Trunk
Syndrome as we don't yet know anything more about it than it's symptoms. Jack
came up with the questions below. I sent them out to the appropriate field
people and recieved the thorough reply appended below. Mike Kock sent in a
message of concurrence, thus this thread is cut. - Mod.PC
1. This is an Island herd, therefore should be possible to get
denominator info, hence incidence & prevalence data?
2. If they think its due to a weed on the island, why not move
the herd off it? Or do they still think it might be infectious?
3. Is the Island cut off from the mainland in the rainy season?
4. Is there seasonal incidence in the condition?
In reply to Jack's questions I have the following comments however I
would recommend soliciting the comments of the principle investigators in
this study: Drs. Nancy Kock (ndkvet@samara.co.zw), and Chris Foggin
(chrisf@sni.co.zw). Also, Mike Kock (kock@info.bw) did much of the
earlier work.
Fothergill Island is not actually an island anymore - following prolonged
droughts in southern Africa in the 80's, the water levels in the
surrounding lake Kariba dropped and Fothergill became part of the
mainland. This decreased water level exposed large areas of foreshore,
which then became colonized by various species of plants (such as
Panicum, Boerhavia and Indigofera etc.). These areas are utilized by a
large variety of species including elephant. Elephants, however,
frequently move from one geographical location to another and are
undeterred by expanses of water, often swimming many miles to reach their
destination.
Most of the animals afflicted with FTS appear to be adult males (20+
years) and so would not form part of a herd. Elephant herds tend to be
comprised of females and immature males. In this case then, it is not
feasible to evaluate 'herd incidence' or to 'move the herd off the
island'. There is obviously an environmental source for FTS in the
Fothergill area as the lakeshore area at Bumi Hills (nearby and
topographically similar), has seen no cases. Comparing the two areas has
resulted in the observation that a significantly larger number of males
than females frequent the shore area at Fothergill. The gender
specificity is therefore likely due to behavioral factors - females spend
little time on the foreshore and tend not to be affected. Logically, it
would seem that prolonged exposure to a toxic or infectious agent in that
area is leading to the development of FTS in males that spend an extended
period there. Individual animals are currently being monitored by means
of simple observation, radio telemetry and by the use of satellite
collars.
Gross pathology and histopathological findings in conjunction with
hematology and serum chemistry evaluations (by Drs. N.Kock, M.Kock and
Foggin) do not suggest any infectious cause. Ruling out other likely
etiologies by evaluating soil and water properties, minerals and
contaminants (for example, selenium deficiency, chronic lead toxicity and
chronic organophosphate intoxication were considered potential causes)
has led to the increased attention currently being paid to 'toxic' plants
which may exist in the area. By using indices of 'possible involvement'
for different plant species found in vegetation transects at Fothergill
and at Bumi Hills, several plants have been identified for closer study.
This is currently where the investigation stands.
There is an important fact to remember when considering what work is
being done on this problem in Zimbabwe - the number of affected animals
identified in the past ten years totals between 35 and 40. The current
estimate (checked and verified by independent researchers) for the total
population of elephants in the country for 1997 was >60,000. This means
that this syndrome is affecting only a very tiny portion of the
population. In a small, developing country, it is simply unrealistic to
expect adequate financial backing to mount a largescale investigative
project. The research in this area is being carried out by a dedicated
group of highly skilled scientists but it will be, by necessity, a slow
but ongoing process. FTS is an interesting and challenging clinical
problem but its significance to the elephant population should not be
overemphasized.
