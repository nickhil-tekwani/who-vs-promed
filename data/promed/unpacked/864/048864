An outbreak of bovine rabies has been detected in Costa Rica. Sanitary and quarantine measures have been implemented on the farm where the outbreak was detected in the province of Alajuela.

The Ministry of Agriculture has provided for the implementation of sanitary and quarantine measures to control the disease on the farm where the outbreak was detected in San Jose de Upala, and [to] prevent its spread to other areas.

Nacion.com reports that "...The organization is investigating neighboring farms to search for new animals affected. Exposed animals (cattle, horses and dogs) are being vaccinated, and communication is being maintained with the farmers in surrounding areas. ... In June this year [2015], another outbreak in Canas, Guanacaste also killed several animals."

The National Animal Health Service (SENASA) of the Ministry of Agriculture has detected an outbreak of bovine paralytic rabies in a farm located in Puriscal, in the district of Mercedes Sur, specifically in the village Quebrada Honda, in the Province of San Jose, where a bovine has died.

Given this situation and in order to protect the health of people and animals, SENASA has established sanitary and quarantine measures on the affected farm, where there is an exposed population of 65 cattle and 2 horses. In addition, the capture of bats is being undertaken in the area in order to lower the existing population of this flying mammal, because it is the most important vector for the transmission of this disease.

[Currently, bovine rabies has been reported in San Jose de Upala (Alajuela Province) and Puriscal (Province of San Jose). In December 2011, bovine rabies was reported in Alajuela (see ProMED archive 20111220.3640), which is in northern Costa Rica on the Nicaraguan border; San Jose is in central Costa Rica; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/costa_pol87.jpg. Both outbreaks are clearly a result of infections from vampire bats.

To quote my co-moderator TG: "Vampire bats are distributed in tropical areas of the western hemisphere from Argentina to Mexico and have been responsible for transmitting rabies virus, most frequently to cattle and equine animals, and infrequently to humans [by bite]. Of the 3 vampire bat species, _Desmodus rotundus_ is by far the most common rabies virus transmitter.

There are 2 options for rabies control in these situations: vaccination of animals upon which the vampire bats feed, or reduction of the vampire bat populations, or perhaps a 3rd option would be a combination of the 2 approaches. Eliminating vampire bat hosts is the fastest and most effective approach when vampire bat-transmitted rabies appears in an area. In areas where repeated vampire bat-transmitted rabies occurs, control of these bats has been employed in some countries. Controlling vampire bats by eliminating their roosts is extremely difficult because these roosts can be hard to find. Effective vampire bat control has been accomplished by capturing bats in mist nets when they come to feed on livestock and applying anticoagulant jelly (warfarin and similar products), which they and their roost-mates ingest on grooming."
