Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), or monkey fever, a viral infection which had been confined to the Pali area of Thane village panchayat in Sattari taluka [sub-district], this year, has returned to haunt the residents, this time in the Mauxi region of the Thane village panchayat [local system of government].

It has been reported that in Mauxi village, 2 people have been infected with the disease and the cases were subsequently referred to the Goa Medical College at Bambolim for further treatment. In February this year [2015], there was an outbreak of the disease in Pali village, affecting many people and killing 4.

When contacted, health officer of the Valpoi Community Health Centre, Surekha Parulekar, confirmed that 2 cases were reported last week and immediately referred to the GMC. "Both the patients from Mauxi were referred to the Goa Medical College from the Community Health Centre at Valpoi and they are now in good condition," she said.

According to a virologist, this virus has been isolated from several species of ticks found in the Western Ghats. Among animals, only monkeys seem to succumb to the infection after they come in contact with the infected ticks. A monkey's death in a locality is often an indication that human infections might follow. "The disease has a pattern and human cases are usually reported from November through March when young ticks become active in forests," said Parulekar, adding that they have already started an awareness drive in the areas of Mauxi.

"The only strategy that can be adopted to guard against KFD outbreak would be a regular surveillance for ticks and testing them for virus positivity, much ahead of the 'season' in August-September. We are carrying out this activity in a systematic manner. Of course, the disease could emerge in new areas, so Manipal Centre for Virus Research has started its virology centre at the CHC, Valpoi. The 2 patients from Mauxi infected by the disease were diagnosed there. The centre has started its studies and is investigating KFD and other viruses free of cost in Sattari," Parulekar said.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases have occurred in Goa earlier in 2015. A 17 Apr 2015 report indicated that 18 of 20 samples from Pali villagers from Sattari taluka, Goa, sent for testing were positive for KFD, which has claimed 4 lives since the 1st death was reported on 4 Mar 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150418.3306895).

As noted in the previous post, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case-fatality rate is 3-5 percent (see the CDC fact sheet at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
