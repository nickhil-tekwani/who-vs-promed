["Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterized by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; oedema of the skin; and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and, occasionally, death."

"Lumpy skin disease outbreaks tend to be sporadic, depending upon animal movements, immune status, and wind and rainfall patterns affecting vector populations. The principal method of transmission is thought to be mechanical by various arthropod vectors."

"Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. Between 2012 and 2018, LSD spread into south east Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus as part of the Eurasian LSD epidemic." - Mod.CRD
