The Asian tiger mosquito has been identified at 7 locations in the Netherlands and efforts are under way to eradicate it, government safety experts said on Wednesday [14 Aug 2013].

The mosquito, which can carry dangerous diseases [pathogens] such as yellow fever, has been identified at used tyre import companies in Oss, Weert, Montfort, Almere, Lelystad, Emmeloord and Harderberg, the NVWA [Nederlandse Voedsel- en Waren Autoriteit; Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety] inspectorate said in a statement.

The European Centre for Disease Control said earlier this year [2012] that the tiger mosquito, an aggressive, day-time biting mosquito which can transmit some 20 viruses and parasites, had made its home in the Netherlands, but that was denied at the time by local officials.

The tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) is a native of South East Asia and is thought to spread via bamboo plant imports and on car tyres. Dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis are among the diseases it spreads. However, none of the mosquitos found in the Netherlands have been carrying disease, the NVWA said.

"Preventative measures" are now being taken to make sure the mosquito does not become established in the Netherlands, the organisation said. Locals living close to the affected areas are being informed, and the clean-up process will take several months.

The organisation said the "substance" used to kill the insects wipes out both adults and larvae, but does not give further details.

[This observation is yet another example of the steady spread of _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe. There is no reason to think that this mosquito's European geographic range will halt. Predictions have indicated considerable spread into areas in Europe where it is not found currently. The effort to eradicate _A. albopictus_ in the Netherlands before it can become established is prudent, and one hopes that their efforts will be successful. Introduction of viruses and other pathogens that can be transmitted by this mosquito is not improbable. A chikungunya virus outbreak was initiated when a viremic traveler arrived in Italy where the mosquito had become established, resulting in ongoing transmission of the virus.
