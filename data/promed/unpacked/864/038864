Severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children - multi-country
--------------------------------------------------------
Outbreak at a glance
--------------------
As of 8 Jul 2022, 35 countries in 5 WHO Regions have reported 1010 probable cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children, which fulfill the WHO case definition, including 22 deaths. Since the previous Disease Outbreak News published on 24 Jun 2022, 90 new probable cases and f4 additional deaths have been reported to WHO. In addition, 2 new countries, Luxembourg and Costa Rica, have reported probable cases. WHO has launched a global survey with an aim to estimate the incidence of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in 2022 compared to the previous 5 years, to understand where cases and liver transplants are occurring at higher-than-expected rates.

This Disease Outbreak News provides updates on the epidemiology of the outbreak, as well as updates on the response to this event, including the launch of the clinical case report form on the WHO Global Clinical Platform, and updates on infection prevention and control (IPC) and risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).

Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
Between [5 Apr 2022] (when the outbreak was initially detected) and [8 Jul 2022], 35 countries in 5 WHO Regions have reported 1010 probable cases (Figure 1) [for figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL] and 22 deaths. These include new and retrospectively identified cases since [1 Oct 2021], which fit the WHO case definition as stated below. There are 3 additional countries that have reported cases which are pending classification and are not included in the cumulative probable case count. Of the probable cases, 46 (5%) children have required transplants, and 22 (2%) deaths have been reported to WHO.

Almost half (48%) of the probable cases have been reported from the WHO European Region (21 countries reporting 484 cases), including 272 cases (27% of global cases) from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK) (Table 1, Figure 2). The 2nd highest number of probable cases have been reported from the Region of the Americas (n=435, including 334 cases (33% of global cases) from the USA), followed by the Western Pacific Region (n=70), the South East Asia Region (n=19) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (n=2). 17 countries are reporting more than 5 probable cases. The actual number of cases may be underestimated, in part due to the limited enhanced surveillance systems in place. The case count is expected to change as more information and verified data become available.

Laboratory testing of cases
---------------------------
Based on the working case definition for probable cases (Box 1), laboratory testing has excluded hepatitis A-E viruses in these children. Pathogens like adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were detected by PCR in a number of the cases, although the data reported to WHO are incomplete.

Adenovirus continues to be the most frequently detected pathogen among cases with available data. In the European region, adenovirus was detected by PCR in 52% of cases (193/368) with available results (see Annex). In Japan, adenovirus was detected in 9% of cases (5/58) with known results. Due to limited adenovirus surveillance in most countries, it is challenging to assess whether these rates are higher than the expected rates in the population.

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a number of cases, however, data on serology results are limited. In the European region, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR in 16% of cases (54/335) with available results (see Annex). Preliminary reports from the USA indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 8% of cases (15/197) with available results. In Japan, SARS-CoV-2 was also detected in 8% of cases (5/59) with available results. These figures may change as new data becomes available.

For further details, please refer to the EURO/ECDC Joint surveillance report, Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases report, UKHSA Case Update, UKHSA Third Technical Briefing, and the USCDC Technical Report.

Most reported cases did not appear to be epidemiologically linked; however, epidemiologically linked cases have been reported in Scotland, and the Netherlands.

Epidemiological characteristics of cases
----------------------------------------
Of 571 probable cases (57% of all probable cases) for which data are available, there has been a decreasing trend in cases over the last month [June 2022] (Figure 2). However, this trend should be interpreted carefully as there are reporting delays and limited surveillance in many countries.

As of [8 Jul 2022], of 479 cases with information on gender and age, 48% are male (n=232), and the majority of cases (76%, n=364) are under 6 years of age (Figure 3).

Out of 100 probable cases with available clinical data, the most commonly reported symptoms on presentation were nausea or vomiting (60% of cases), jaundice (53%), general weakness (52%) and abdominal pain (50%). Of all global cases with available data, a total of 167 cases (16% of all probable cases) had both date of symptom onset and date of hospitalization available. Among these, the median number of days between date of symptom onset and date of hospitalization was 4 days [interquartile range (IQR) 7].

Public health response
----------------------
Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, histopathological and toxicological investigations of the possible etiology (or etiologies) of the cases are underway by several national authorities, research networks, across different working groups in WHO and with partners. This includes detailed epidemiological investigations to identify common exposures, risk factors or links between cases.

On [11 Jul 2022], WHO launched a global online survey with an aim to estimate the incidence of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in 2022 compared to the previous 5 years, to understand where cases and liver transplants are occurring at higher-than-expected rates. WHO has shared the voluntary survey across 9 global and regional networks of pediatric hepatologists and other specialist pediatricians working in major national units, requesting aggregated data as part of the global event investigation. Interim results of the survey will be made available publicly by WHO as soon as they are available.

The specific objectives of the survey are to:
- assess whether there has been a recent increase or not in incidence of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology (with and without acute liver failure) in children â‰¤16 years, including those requiring liver transplantation, in different countries and regions (number of cases in 2022 compared to 2017-2021);
- assess any changes in the age distribution and severity of reported cases over time (2022 compared to 2017-2021).

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The risk at the global level is currently assessed as moderate considering the following factors:
- The etiology of this severe acute hepatitis remains unknown and is being investigated.
- Limited epidemiological, laboratory, histopathological and clinical information are currently available to WHO.
- The actual number of cases and the geographical distribution may be underestimated, in part due to the limited enhanced surveillance systems in place.
- The possible mode of transmission of the etiologic agent(s) has not been determined.
- Although there are still no available reports of healthcare-associated infections, human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out following a few early reports of epidemiologically linked cases.

WHO advice
----------

- Laboratory testing:
WHO has developed interim guidance for member states on testing considerations and strategies for suspect cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children. The guidance includes advice to support member states with diagnostic prioritization and can be modified for regional considerations of endemic diseases. The guidance also considers assessments for other etiological factors of severe acute hepatitis in children, including other infectious agents, environmental exposures (toxins, medications), metabolic hereditary conditions, or autoimmune disorders, which should be considered in consultation with a pediatric hepatologist.

Prioritization should be given to routine collection of various specimens from as early after symptom onset as possible, to allow for later testing as required and to identify aetiology(ies). If laboratory capacity is limited, storage and referral to regional or global laboratories should be considered for the suggested investigative diagnostics. Any positive specimens should also be stored for further testing and/or investigation.

To further support member states with laboratory testing, WHO is establishing a network of regional and global referral laboratories.

- Case reporting:
WHO strongly encourages member states to report cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children matching WHO's case definition, through established IHR mechanisms. For more information, please see the Suggested minimum variables for reporting cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children.

- Reporting clinical data through the WHO Global Clinical Platform
WHO has developed a clinical case report form (CRF) to facilitate reporting of anonymized case-based data. The analysis of standardized global clinical data will contribute to understanding the aetiology as well as clinical characterization of disease, its natural history and severity; aiming to guide the public health response and the development of clinical management guidance including approaches to investigations and infection prevention and control interventions. WHO strongly encourages member states' participation in the Global Clinical Platform for all cases meeting the WHO case definition, even if the CRF cannot be fully completed. Patient clinical data may be collected prospectively or retrospectively through examination and review of medical records.

The clinical CRF can be accessed through the WHO Global Clinical Platform for severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology.

- Infection Prevention and Control
Until more is known about the etiology of these cases, WHO advises implementation of general infection prevention and control (IPC) practices including:
- Performing frequent hand hygiene, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand-gel
- Avoiding crowded spaces and maintaining a distance from others
- Ensuring good ventilation when indoors
- Wearing a well-fitted mask covering your mouth and nose when appropriate
- Covering coughs and sneezes
- Using safe water for drinking
-F ollowing the 5 Keys to Safer Food: (1) keep clean; (2) separate raw and cooked; (3) cook thoroughly; (4) keep food at safe temperatures; and (5) use safe water and raw materials. Regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces
- Staying home when unwell and seeking medical attention
- Health facilities should adhere to standard precautions and implement contact and droplet precautions for suspected or probable cases.

- Risk communication and community engagement
Until more is known about the etiology of these cases and appropriate prevention measures, WHO advises that information is shared on general IPC practices. Efforts to communicate with empathy in a timely and transparent way, acknowledging what is known and unknown and what is being done to investigate will help to reassure parents and caregivers, maintaining trust in health authorities and interventions.

Abstract
--------
Background: Since January 2022, there has been an increase in reports of cases of acute hepatitis of unknown cause in children. Although cases have been reported across multiple continents, most have been reported in the United Kingdom. Investigations are ongoing to identify the causative agent or agents.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study involving children referred to a single pediatric liver-transplantation center in the United Kingdom between [1 Jan 202] and [11 Apr 2022]. These children were 10 years of age or younger and had hepatitis that met the case definition of the UK Health Security Agency for confirmed acute hepatitis that was not hepatitis A through E and did not have a metabolic, inherited or genetic, congenital, or mechanical cause, in the context of a serum aminotransferase level greater than 500 IU per liter. We reviewed medical records and documented demographic characteristics, clinical features, and results of liver biochemical, serologic, and molecular tests for hepatotropic and other viruses, as well as radiologic and clinical outcomes. The outcomes were classified as an improving condition, liver transplantation, or death.

Results: A total of 44 children had hepatitis that met the confirmed case definition, and most were previously healthy. The median age was 4 years (range, 1 to 7). Common presenting features were jaundice (in 93% of the children), vomiting (in 54%), and diarrhea (in 32%). Among the 30 patients who underwent molecular testing for human adenovirus, 27 (90%) were positive. Fulminant liver failure developed in 6 patients (14%), all of whom received a liver transplant. None of the patients died. All the children, including the 6 who received liver transplants, were discharged home.

Conclusions: In this series involving 44 young children with acute hepatitis of uncertain cause, human adenovirus was isolated in most of the children, but its role in the pathogenesis of this illness has not been established.

Abstract
--------
Background: Human adenoviruses typically cause self-limited respiratory, gastrointestinal, and conjunctival infections in healthy children. In late 2021 and early 2022, several previously healthy children were identified with acute hepatitis and human adenovirus viremia.

Methods: We used International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes to identify all children (<18 years of age) with hepatitis who were admitted to Children's of Alabama hospital between [1 Oct 2021], and [28 Feb 2022]; those with acute hepatitis who also tested positive for human adenovirus by whole-blood quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in our case series. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were obtained from medical records. Residual blood specimens were sent for diagnostic confirmation and human adenovirus typing.

Results: A total of 15 children were identified with acute hepatitis - 6 (40%) who had hepatitis with an identified cause and 9 (60%) who had hepatitis without a known cause. A total of 8 (89%) of the patients with hepatitis of unknown cause tested positive for human adenovirus. These 8 patients plus 1 additional patient referred to this facility for follow-up were included in this case series (median age, 2 years 11 months; age range, 1 year 1 month to 6 years 5 months). Liver biopsies indicated mild-to-moderate active hepatitis in 6 children, some with and some without cholestasis, but did not show evidence of human adenovirus on immunohistochemical examination or electron microscopy. PCR testing of liver tissue for human adenovirus was positive in 3 children (50%). Sequencing of specimens from 5 children showed three distinct human adenovirus type 41 hexon variants. Two children underwent liver transplantation; all the others recovered with supportive care.

Conclusions: Human adenovirus viremia was present in the majority of children with acute hepatitis of unknown cause admitted to Children's of Alabama from [1 Oct 2021], to [28 Feb 2022], but whether human adenovirus was causative remains unclear. Sequencing results suggest that if human adenovirus was causative, this was not an outbreak driven by a single strain.

For months, scientists around the world have been investigating cases of severe, unexplained hepatitis, or liver inflammation, in previously healthy children. At least 920 probable cases have been detected in 33 countries since October 2021, according to WHO. About 5% have required liver transplants, and 18 deaths have been reported.

So far, explanations have remained elusive. A significant share of hepatitis cases in children have always been unexplained. There is still no consensus on whether such cases have become more common, and it is not clear whether the recently reported cases, which remain rare, are part of a new medical phenomenon or share an underlying cause. But more detailed case investigations are beginning to provide clues.

Two new studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on [Wed 13 Jul 2022], report that 2 medical centers -- one in Birmingham, Ala., and another in Birmingham, England -- have seen increases in the number of children with acute, unexplained hepatitis in recent months.

The research also presents more circumstantial evidence that adenovirus 41, which often causes gastrointestinal symptoms, may be a contributing factor. In both studies, adenovirus infections were detected in about 90% of children tested, and children who developed acute liver failure or required transplants had higher average levels of the virus in their blood than those with milder cases.

"I think that adenovirus could be a player," said Dr Helena Gutierrez Sanchez, medical director of the pediatric liver transplant program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an author of 1 of the new papers. "It seems to be that common signal, not only in our cohort but across the globe." But the evidence is far from definitive. And neither study found clear evidence that the virus was in the liver cells of any of the affected children, which suggested that if there were a link between adenovirus infections and hepatitis, it might not be a straightforward one.

"I don't think that's a subtle point," said Dr Saul Karpen, a pediatric hepatologist at Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta who wrote an editorial that accompanied the 2 new papers. "I think that's a main point." Not all medical centers have seen the same increase in cases, he noted, and a recent study from the CDC did not find evidence that unexplained hepatitis had become more common among American children overall. The new cases may not necessarily represent "something new and frightening," he said. "On the other side, you can't ignore it."

Hepatitis has a variety of causes, including certain medications and medical conditions, toxins, heavy alcohol use and the hepatitis A through E viruses. Adenoviruses, a family of viruses that usually cause cold- or flu-like symptoms, are not typically associated with liver inflammation in otherwise healthy children. But clinicians have detected adenovirus infections in many of the recent cases, including in a group of children in Alabama, the first cluster of cases reported in the USA.

One of the new papers provides more details about hepatitis cases at the Children's of Alabama hospital in Birmingham. During the 5-month period from October 2021 through February 2022, the hospital admitted 9 children with acute, unexplained hepatitis, 3 times as many as were admitted in the entire previous year. "At least in our center, we had a spike," Dr Gutierrez said. Blood samples from of those 9 children tested positive for an adenovirus. Viral samples from 5 children yielded genomic sequences good enough to be analyzed further; all turned out to be adenovirus 41. During that same time period, the hospital also admitted 6 children whose hepatitis had a known cause. Of the 5 tested for adenovirus, all were negative, and a review of lab records suggested that the infections were not widespread in the hospital's overall patient population at the time.

In Britain, 44 children with acute, unexplained hepatitis were referred to the pediatric liver transplantation center at Birmingham Women's and Children's between [1 Jan 2022] and [11 Apr 2022]. A total of 13 were admitted, more than the 1 to 5 patients admitted in the same time frame in previous years. Of the 30 children tested for adenovirus, 27 were positive. The UK Health Security Agency later determined that the virus was adenovirus 41, said Dr. Chayarani Kelgeri, consultant pediatric hepatologist at Birmingham Women's and Children's and an author of the study.

The picture became more complicated when the scientists analyzed liver samples from a subset of affected children. Laboratory tests turned up no evidence of viral proteins or particles in the liver cells themselves. PCR testing did find adenovirus DNA in liver samples from several children, but these samples might have included blood mixed with liver tissue, making it difficult to determine whether the genetic material came from the liver or the blood, the scientists said.

"That leads us to question whether virus was there but what we are seeing in the liver samples is an aftermath of the viral injury," Dr Kelgeri said. Perhaps, she said, an adenovirus infection triggers an abnormal immune response in some children, and it is that immune response, rather than the virus, that damages the liver.

Why some hospitals are seeing a rise in cases remains unknown, though. If hepatitis has always been a rare outcome of adenovirus infections in children, cases could rise when the virus becomes more prevalent. The new hepatitis cases in Britain did coincide with "a report of increased adenovirus" in the broader population, Dr Kelgeri noted. It is also possible that the virus has changed or that other factors -- such as a previous bout of COVID-19 -- might have left some children more vulnerable to a subsequent adenovirus infection, scientists said. Of those tested, 28% of the British children tested positive for the coronavirus, while 38% tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.

Dr Karpen said that he was not yet convinced that there was a link between adenovirus infection and pediatric hepatitis -- or that the incidence of either was increasing overall. Regardless, more systematic data collection and analysis is needed, he said. "I'm very happy that registries are being created so that we will know whether or not there truly is a new virus in town that needs attention," Dr Karpen said. "We really need to just continue to collect information and keep our eyes open."

[The etiology or etiologies of this severe liver inflammation still remain unclear, although adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 remain in the equation, separately or together. While aminotransferases of over 500 is part of the case definition, the height of these assays does not necessarily correlate with severity, as such patients can be without jaundice and may be totally asymptomatic. There remains little information about asymptomatic hepatitis in sibling or adult contacts and evidence for past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even if adenovirus 41 is involved, the lack of finding of virus in the liver suggests an indirect mechanism, involving SARS-CoV-2 or not. That the strains of ADV 41 were not all the same is of note.

Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable, but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by the following report:

Zhang Q, Bastard P, Liu Z, et al. Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19. Science. 2020; 370(6515): eabd4570; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd4570.

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening CoVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr Casanova, the senior author of this paper, has published many articles showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL
