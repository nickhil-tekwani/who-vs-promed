A veterinary examination revealed that the horse owned by Yerevan Circus died on 11 Dec 2012 of anthrax, according to Zhoghovurd daily.

However, in conversation with the paper's reporter, the employee of the hippodrome said the examination had not revealed the cause of the animal's death, citing kidney problems as reason.

The hippodrome the horse was kept in is owned by the X group owner, the paper reported.

[Normally I would assume this was not anthrax because it is the wrong time of year -- animal anthrax is essentially a summer disease except when contaminated feed has been used. But the numbers of recent human cases show that Armenia is different. If only once horse came down it is unlikely, if it is anthrax, to be contaminated feed as a circus by definition will contain many horses more or less of the same age. The Hippodrome employee saying it was "kidney disease" could be telling the truth or covering for his bosses. Either way confirmation is needed. - Mod.MHJ
