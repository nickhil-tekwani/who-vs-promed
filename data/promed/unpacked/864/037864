Manitoba's 1st anthrax case of the year identified in cattle
------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax caused the sudden death of an animal in south east Manitoba's Rural
Municipality of Stuartburn this spring, laboratory testing indicates. The
farm involved also had anthrax last summer [2006], Sandra Stevens, a
disease control specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA),
told CBC News.
Last year, an anthrax outbreak in Manitoba and Saskatchewan was the worst
in recent years. In Manitoba, between 14 Jul and 11 Oct 2006, anthrax
killed 148 livestock spread across 22 premises in 8 rural municipalities,
according to the CFIA website. In Saskatchewan, more than 800 animals died.

re: Manitoba's 1st anthrax case of the year identified in cattle
----------------------------------------------------------------
This particular beef herd is large for Manitoba at around 700 cattle of
various ages. It is also pastured in mixed woodland where the Canadian
Shield meets the Prairie.
They attempted a "herd" vaccination last year [2006] but the extended
family that owns these cattle had few farm records and really very little
knowledge on actually how many cattle were in the herd. Most of the cattle
(the ones they were able to catch) were vaccinated, but I could not
attribute this case to vaccine failure.
It is also a presumptive positive; it was PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
positive at both the provincial and the federal lab but was culture
negative. CFIA is proceeding with their assistance with the provision of
vaccine based on it is probably a true positive. I have cc'ed the local
CFIA vets on this message. If I am in substantive error they will correct
the detail.

[I copied this report to Terry with a request for clarification before
posting, so I am very grateful for his replying with more information and
clarification. It seems clear that we are going to get more reported
outbreaks this summer in SK and MB if only from greater awareness, quite
apart from any residual ground contamination. Most Canadian ranchers are
sensible about spring (re)vaccinations but there is always a residue that
procrastinate and believe in the power of prayer. Such keep us busy.
Stuartburn is about 20 miles from the Canada/US border in the Roseau River
drainage, on Rt 201 equidistant between Hyws 12 and 59, and was in the
middle of last year's (2006) outbreaks. To find the town, go to
<http://www.mapquest.com/maps/> and enter Stuartburn. The province is MB
... The link is too long to include here. - Mod.MHJ]
