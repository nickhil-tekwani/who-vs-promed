Department of Public Health officials said an elderly woman in Connecticut has died of Powassan virus. A woman in her 90s became the 2nd Connecticut resident to test positive for the virus this year [2022].

A Windham man was the1st person to test positive for Powassan virus this year [2022], according to DPH officials.

The woman lived in New London County and became sick in early May [2022]. She was admitted to a hospital with symptoms including fever, altered mental status, headache, chills, rigors, chest pain, and nausea, according to DPH. Her condition worsened, and she ultimately became unresponsive. Officials said the woman died of the virus on 17 May [2022], according to DPH.

DPH officials said the woman had been bitten by a tick, which was removed 2 weeks before her symptoms began.

Lab tests performed by the CDC confirmed the presence of Powassan virus antibodies.

Health officials are urging residents to take action to prevent tick bites.

"This incident reminds us that residents need to take actions to prevent tick bites now through the late fall," said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD. "DPH stresses the use of insect repellent this summer and avoiding high-risk areas, such as tall grass, where ticks may be found. It's also important to check carefully for ticks after being outside, which can reduce the chance of you and your family members being infected with this dangerous virus."

Powassan virus in Connecticut
----------------------------
From 2017 to 2021, 12 cases of the virus were reported in Connecticut, including 3 in 2021. Of those 12 cases, 2 were fatal.

What is Powassan virus?
-------------------
Powassan virus is a rare, but often severe disease that is caused by a virus spread from infected ticks [that have acquired the virus from infected wild mammals such as deer and white-footed mice] to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It belongs to a group of viruses that can cause infection of the brain, or encephalitis, or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord, meningitis, according to the CDC.

The CDC said the number of reported cases of people sick from Powassan virus has increased in recent years.

Powassan virus symptoms
------------------
It takes from a week to one month after the bite from an infected tick to develop symptoms of the disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches.

Health officials said that while most people infected with Powassan virus likely experience no symptoms or a mild flu-like illness, some people will develop severe illness affecting the central nervous system.

About one out of 10 cases of severe illness are fatal, and approximately half of survivors experience long-term health problems.

Severe cases might begin with fever, vomiting, headache, or weakness and rapidly progress to confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, or seizures.

They said there is no vaccine nor a specific treatment for the associated illness. Severe illness is treated by hospitalization, respiratory support, and hydration.

[As mentioned in the comments of the post for the previous case, May is a time of year when ticks become active and cases of Powassan virus (POWV) infection start to occur, as this case did. POWV transmission is active in Connecticut again this year (2022) as it has been in recent years. Cases of Powassan virus infection have been reported every year in recent years from one or more of the eastern and northeastern or midwestern states of the USA including Connecticut. An important point of this report is that POWV can be rapidly transmitted to humans a short time following the bite of infected deer ticks (black legged ticks, _Ixodes scapularis_). In areas where this tick is common, inspection for the presence of this tick and their swift removal are important.

Ticks become infected when they feed on groundhogs, squirrels, white-footed mice, or other rodents that have the virus in their blood. Infected ticks can then spread POW virus to people and other animals by biting them. People do not develop high enough levels of the virus in their blood to infect biting ticks. As a result, people are considered "dead-end" hosts for Powassan virus. There is no vaccine for POW virus, so avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure. The CDC has good guidance concerning avoidance of ticks at https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html. - Mod.TY
