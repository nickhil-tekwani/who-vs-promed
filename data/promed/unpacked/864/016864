Expat camel farm worker hit by MERS
-----------------------------------
A 29 year old expatriate working in a camel farm in Qatar has tested positive for MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) virus, the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said yesterday [21 May 2015].

This is the 3rd confirmed MERS case reported in 2015, taking the total infections in the country to 14. The last case was reported in March [2015], in which a 69 year old Qatari was infected.

An SCH statement said the patient reported at a primary healthcare centre on [19 May 2015] with symptoms of fever and cough for 5 days. He tested positive for MERS CoV virus the following day [20 May 2015] and transferred to hospital under infection prevention and control measures. He has no other chronic diseases (co-morbidities) nor did he travel out of the country during the incubation period (the time between exposure to the infection and the symptoms first seen), said SCH. He also didn't interact with any suspected or confirmed MERS cases. The patient's condition is stable and he is receiving treatment.

A team of experts from Health Promotion and Communicable Diseases Department at SCH and the Animal Health Department is conducting a thorough investigation of other workers and camels at the barn where the expatriate works. People who came in contact with him have been advised to take preventive measures and report to authorities if they develop any respiratory symptoms, said SCH.

The council has set up a hotline 66740948/66740951 at Health Promotion and Communicable Diseases Department to answer public queries about MERS.

[2] Qatar, 2nd new case -- media report

A 73 year old Qatari man has been diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) confirmed.

This is the 4th MERS-CoV case in Qatar this year [2015]. The 3rd case, a 29 year old expatriate employed at a camel farm in Qatar, was announced by SCH on Thursday [21 May 2015].

In the latest MERS-CoV case, the Qatari patient is also suffering from an acute respiratory infection. The MERS-CoV diagnosis was confirmed at Hamad Medical Corporation's laboratories.

The rapid response team of the Health Protection and Communicable disease Control department at the SCH has carried out an extensive search to list all individuals who have had contacts with the patient. All traced contacts will be monitored over a period of 2 weeks, and those who develop respiratory symptoms will then be screened. The screening process is being conducted in line with the standard case definition of the suspected MERS-CoV cases, based on the World Health Organization guidelines.

The joint team from SCH and Animal Resources department at the Ministry of Environment is carrying out an intensified field investigation. More information can be had from HP&CDC hotlines 66740948 or 66740951.

[According to the most recent ECDC Communicable Disease Threats report (week ending 23 May 2015), as of of 21 May 2015, there have been a total of 1152 cases of MERS-CoV reported by local health authorities worldwide including 471 deaths. In this report as of 21 May 2015 there had been a total of 12 cases reported from Qatar including 4 deaths. When the previous case was reported in March 2015 (see MERS-CoV (32): Qatar, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20150309.3216519), it was the 11th case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Qatar since the start of reporting in 2012. These 2 newly reported cases would bring the total to 13. The media report above mentions 14 cases. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate a clarification on the numbers of reported cases. (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-23-may-2015.pdf for the most recent ECDC report).

It will be interesting to see if the camels in the barn where the 29 year old expat works works are MERS-CoV infected as well and if so, if viral sequencing demonstrates the same virus in the camel(s) and the current case.
