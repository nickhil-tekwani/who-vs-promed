There have been at least 2 dozen lawsuits filed around the US demanding hospitals give ivermectin, a deworming drug, to COVID-19 patients, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuits follow much of the same format: families have gotten a prescription for the drug, but hospitals refuse to use it on the patients, many of whom are on a ventilator, close to death, the news outlet noted.

Many of the lawsuits are filed by Ralph Lorigo, an attorney in Buffalo, NY, who says doctors "are not gods because they wear white jackets," adding that he takes issue with the choice not to use ivermectin on patients, according to the AP.

He also said hospital administrators are the only ones able to make the decision. "I'm not accepting that as a rule of law for us," he told the AP.

Lorigo filed his 1st of many ivermectin cases in January [2021] after the family of an 80-year-old woman in the hospital on a ventilator came to him for help. Another lawsuit came later that month [January 2021], this time for a hospitalized 65-year-old woman. In both cases, the judges ruled to give the women ivermectin as their families wanted. Both survived their hospital visits.

While the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat tiny parasites in people, the administration, state health departments, and even the drug's leading manufacturer, Merck, have all warned against using it for COVID-19.

The FDA also warned that taking it in large doses can cause harmful side effects, such as vomiting, seizures, and even death. However, Lorigo said his clients have not asked for those types of doses.

Nevertheless, other judges have refused to order hospitals to administer the drug. Hospitals have argued their standards of care will not allow doctors to give patients a drug not yet approved for COVID-19, adding that it could potentially cause harm, the AP reported.

Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine, said he is also concerned that allowing laypeople and judges to overrule hospitals is a dangerous road.

"The way medicine works is, they are the experts, the doctors and ... the hospitals," he said, according to the AP. "When you go there, you're not going to a restaurant. You don't order your own treatments.

"You can't have a medical field that's subjected to having to practice according to patient demand backed up by court orders," he added. "That is positively horrible medicine."

[B] Flawed studies
Date: Fri 15 Oct 2021
Source: Business Insider [abridged, edited]
https://www.businessinsider.com/ivermectin-studies-for-covid-19-see-the-flawed-evidence-2021-10


The World Health Organization lists ivermectin as an essential medicine because it can treat life-threatening diseases, including hookworm infections and river blindness (onchocerciasis). "I'm used to prescribing [it] here in Brazil," Dr. Ana Carolina Antonio, who works in intensive care at a government hospital in Porto Alegre, recently told Insider.

She said ivermectin is "necessary to deworm patients," including some of those who develop COVID-19 symptoms.

Ivermectin can clear out roundworm infections, which is critical to do before people are given immunosuppressing steroids for coronavirus treatment. Left untreated, it's possible those roundworms could invade the lungs.

"In the context of COVID-19, it can worsen your respiratory failure," Antonio said. "It's a concern for low-income countries."

But lately, there's been an unusual rush on ivermectin in the US. People are scrambling for both the human and animal formulations of the drug, propelled by the belief that it can treat or prevent COVID-19, and that vaccines aren't needed.

One of the main sources of information for ivermectin fans in the US has been the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance [FLCCC], which not only provides links to reputable-looking studies of ivermectin from around the world, but also publishes many of its own analyses of the drug. The FLCCC is frequently cited by America's Frontline Doctors, a top destination among people searching the internet for ivermectin tablets, and their work is included in various internet roundups of ivermectin research that proclaim the drug is not only safe, but extremely effective against COVID-19.

At first blush, it may look like all this evidence stacks up to provide an impressive track record, demonstrating ivermectin's supreme usefulness in fighting COVID-19. But the truth is far murkier than that.

One of the earliest signs that ivermectin could be useful against COVID-19 came from a laboratory study of monkey kidney cells, published in June 2020 by researchers at Monash University in Australia. The study in question, published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research, is what researchers sometimes refer to as "hypothesis-generating" research.

"It doesn't say that this drug is effective in real-life clinical practice, but it gives you the hint that it needs to be studied further," Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious-disease physician at St. Joe's Hamilton and associate professor at McMaster University in Canada, said.

In other words, just because something works in a petri dish doesn't mean it'll do the same thing in humans.

Chagla, and many other experts, have also pointed out that the ivermectin dosage used in the study is far higher than anything that could safely be given to us.

"There's effective ways to kill viruses in a lab that don't translate into what we could safely do in people," Dr. Kevan Akrami, an infectious-disease and critical-care physician working in Salvador, Brazil, recently told Insider.

Even the study authors from Monash say their work does not "provide a definitive answer to whether or not ivermectin is a potential treatment for COVID-19." (They are committed to conducting further research on the drug to better answer that question.)

Two months after the Monash lab study came out, a study from Egypt suggested that ivermectin could be used to prevent people who had contact with a COVID-19 case from getting sick, but "the study is fake," one expert said.

In order for a study like this to truly be randomized, patients "should be divided into equally sized groups" based on their conditions and comorbidities, Professor Ben Mol of Monash University, who independently reviewed the study and complained to the journal that published it, said.

That's not what happened here. Patients were ferried into different groups in seemingly haphazard ways, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions about what effect the medicine might've had on their outcomes.

For example, there is a far greater percentage of patients in the non-ivermectin group with hypertension (12.9%, compared to 7.9% in the ivermectin group). That could be one reason why they didn't fare as well in the trial, which has nothing to do with the ivermectin.

"You have to read about research in a critical way," Susanna Priest, editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed journal Science Communication, previously told Insider. "What we have here is a conflict between our commitment to freedom of speech, and a clash with the nature of scientific truth." (The Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research, where this study was published, did not respond to Insider's questions about whether this study was being investigated and/or retracted.)

Another ivermectin study from Egypt, released in November of 2020, has been withdrawn. The study was pulled after independent researchers, and one master's degree student doing an assignment for class, raised concerns that the data was potentially fabricated, and large sections of the study were plagiarized.

"Amazingly, the study found that people treated with ivermectin were 90% less likely to die than people who got the placebo, which, if true, would make ivermectin the most incredibly effective treatment ever to be discovered in modern medicine," epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz from the University of Wollongong wrote in a blog post combing through the study's various errors.

The introduction has been plagiarized, many of the data are near-identical from patient to patient (raising questions about whether they were fabricated), and some of the participants included in the study were already dead when this research began.

Nevertheless, the data has been used to prop up congressional testimony and meta-analyses conducted by Dr. Pierre Kory, one of the leaders of the FLCCC.

A day after the study from Egypt came out, another ivermectin study of hundreds of healthcare workers in Argentina was released, suggesting the drug prevented all who took it from getting COVID-19. The study might not have happened at all, at least in some of the hospitals originally included.

According to an investigation published in Buzzfeed News in September [2021], local authorities in Buenos Aires have no record of the study ever receiving formal approval, and one of the hospitals where it supposedly took place said it had no record of the study ever happening.

Dr. Alkis Psaltis, an Australian author on the paper who was not involved in collecting the data for it (but lent his expertise to the writing and editing stage), later grew so alarmed at all the red flags that he asked to have his authorship withdrawn.

"I trusted the information provided to me," the head and neck surgeon at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital told BuzzFeed.

Medical Press, which is a pay-to-publish journal, did not respond to Insider's questions about whether it was investigating and/or retracting this study.

Pay-to-publish scientific journals don't charge readers, but instead charge the scientists who publish in them hundreds to thousands of dollars to have a single study printed. Not all pay-to-publish journals are bad, but there is often a monetary incentive for them to push out lots of studies quickly, even if the quality of that work is not up to par, and there is little incentive to retract inaccurate work. [Note that scientists must pay to publish in most peer-reviewed scientific journals, yet it is still difficult to get papers published. The journals are not pushing out papers solely to bring in money from the authors. - Mod.LK]

By February 2021, ivermectin was being widely tried out as a COVID-19 treatment. An observational study of healthcare workers in India suggested those who'd taken it reduced their odds of developing a coronavirus infection by 73%, but the authors only controlled for a few factors, making it difficult to know the true impact of the drug on the study outcome.

This is the challenge with all observational research, Meyerowitz-Katz said. "It doesn't matter how many studies there are, ultimately we still haven't answered the question," he said.

That's because the study wasn't designed to parse out what role ivermectin is playing in patient outcomes, versus all the other factors in people's lives that might affect how they fare. Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT), the gold standard for all drug research, are needed. None so far have surfaced for ivermectin that stand up to scrutiny.

"The quantity of evidence is meaningless; it's the quality of evidence that we care about," Meyerowitz-Katz added.

[2] Police officers
Date: Sat 16 Oct 2021 4:43 p.m. ET
Source: CNN [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/us/police-vaccine-covid-deaths/index.html


Det. Sgt. [SD], 52, a veteran of more than 30 years with the Norton Police Department, died on 13 Jan [2021]. He was one of at least 231 officers who died of COVID-19 this year [2021], according to the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP).

There were 245 law enforcement deaths from COVID-19 in 2020, according to ODMP.

The coronavirus has become the leading cause of death for officers despite law enforcement being among the 1st groups eligible to receive the vaccine at the end of 2020. The total stands at 476 COVID-19-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, compared to 94 from gunfire in the same period.

"If you are serious about your commitment to protect the public ... and if you are serious about your personal commitments to your family, then that should be enough," [[JD], wife of deceased officer] said in a plea for police officers to get vaccinated.

Her appeal comes as law enforcement officers and their unions across the country have resisted vaccine mandates despite the delta-variant-fueled resurgence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of the shots in preventing severe cases and death.

Reasons cited for the vaccine resistance among law enforcement officers range from disinformation to distrust in the science of the vaccines. The debate mirrors growing tension nationally between unions and employers as cities and businesses seek to enforce vaccine mandates.

"You're not drafted into this job. This is something you volunteer for," said Charles Ramsey, a former Washington, DC, police chief and CNN law enforcement analyst. "You understand when you take the job it's going to require some sacrifice on your part in a lot of different ways.

In Chicago, up to half the rank-and-file officers in the nation's 2nd-largest police department face being placed on unpaid leave as their union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot clash over a city requirement that officers disclose their vaccine status.

Lightfoot on Friday [15 Oct 2021] accused police union president John Catanzara of trying to "induce an insurrection" by telling officers to ignore a deadline to report vaccine status.

The city filed a complaint alleging the union was "encouraging a work stoppage or strike." A Cook County Circuit judge ruled Friday [15 Oct 2021] night that Catanzara should not make public statements encouraging members to not comply with the vaccination policy.

Catanzara "has never engaged in, supported, or encouraged a work stoppage," according to a union statement on Friday [15 Oct 2021].

Chicago officers had a deadline of midnight Thursday [14 Oct 2021] to disclose their vaccine status or be placed on unpaid leave, Catanzara said earlier this week.

Lightfoot said the city would take the weekend to check with officers who haven't complied. She said officers should report for duty until they're told by supervisors that they've been placed on leave.

Earlier this month [October 2021], the former president of the union from 2014-2017 died of COVID-19.

In Miami, officers are resisting a vaccine mandate. In Pittsburgh, the police chief sent out emails encouraging officers to protect themselves as the delta variant sent COVID-19 cases soaring.

In Seattle, the police department had "all non-patrol sworn personnel, detectives, training, support staff" ready to respond to emergency calls ahead of Monday's [18 Oct 2021] vaccination mandate deadline, said Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesman.

The Seattle mayor's office said nearly 140 officers were unvaccinated or hadn't sought an exemption. Huserik said about 320 officers had already left the force since the beginning of 2020.

Seattle could begin the process of separating officers from the department after the deadline, according to Mike Sloan, police union president. "If we lose what appears to be over 300 people because of this mandate, this public safety crisis we're experiencing will look like child's play," Sloan said.

Across the US, law enforcement leaders have pleaded with officers who remain hesitant to get the shot. Still, many unions and their member officers continue to push back.

"It's a right to obviously get vaccinated. It's an individual right, and I firmly still believe in that," said Dan Yancey, chief of the Owasso Police Department in Oklahoma. "But I would certainly encourage people to do that."

In Baker, Louisiana, outside of Baton Rouge, the COVID-19 death last August [2021] of Lt. [DD] prompted many colleagues to get vaccinated, according to Police Chief Carl Dunn.

"He lost his father at a very young age, and it was a village that raised him," Chief Dunn said of the officer. "And when you talk about an outstanding officer, an outstanding citizen, an outstanding person that always gave back, it struck us. It was a big void in this department to lose an outstanding officer like that."

Before the lieutenant's death on 13 Aug [2021], about 70% of the police force was unvaccinated. Now, 95% of the city's 40 officers have received the shot, according to the chief. "The point I try to get across is, this pandemic, it supersedes any kind of political, any kind of beliefs, anything that you have that makes you reluctant to get vaccinated," Chief Dunn said.

The national police union is encouraging vaccinations but opposes mandates.

Catanzara has framed the issue as a labor dispute. "We are going to keep fighting this mandate and this dictatorship," said Catanzara, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, echoing the sentiments of union leaders around the country. "You would think that there is no crime in this city to worry about. You would think that there is no murder, no robberies, no guns being fired."

Late last month [September 2021], hundreds of Washington State Patrol employees requested religious and medical vaccination exemptions one day after the agency announced the COVID-19 death of a trooper.

Washington state employees must be fully vaccinated by Monday [18 Oct 2021]. The mandate affects 60 000 state employees and 40 000 healthcare workers.

"We invest quite a bit with the vetting and training these individuals. We don't want to lose them as friends or lose them because of COVID," said Chris Loftis, Washington State Patrol spokesman.
