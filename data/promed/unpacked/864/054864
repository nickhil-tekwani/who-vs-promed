Angola: Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak - WHO update 18
-----------------------------------------------------------
As of 10 May 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 316 cases
of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Uige Province, the epicentre of the
outbreak. Of these cases, 276 were fatal. The municipality of Uige remains
the most severely affected in the province.
New cases have continued to be identified in Uige in the last few days. As
some chains of transmission are still ongoing, mobile teams are
investigating suspect cases and following contacts.
Religious leaders in Uige have joined the public information campaign to
stop the use of unsafe injections, an important component in the spread of
the Marburg virus.
