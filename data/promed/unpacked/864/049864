The deadly hog virus that has roiled the global meat industry reached a key pork region in Poland, increasing the risk of disruption in the European Union's 4th-biggest producer.

The 1st case of African swine fever [ASF] was recorded in a dead wild boar in the western province of Wielkopolskie this week, Poland's chief veterinary inspectorate said Thursday [5 Dec 2019]. That comes as more cases have recently been reported in the Lubuskie province, closer to the border with Germany, the EU's top pork supplier.

Poland has grappled with the virus since 2014, but until last month [November 2019] most cases had been detected in the country's east. While the disease hasn't been found on a pig farm in Wielkopolskie, the outbreak poses an increased threat to output. The EU has become a crucial supplier of pork to China -- where the virus has devastated herds -- and those exports could be at risk if the situation worsens.

[The above and 24 other new ASF outbreaks in western Poland (Lubuskie province) have been reported to the OIE on Fri 6 Dec 2019, in follow-up report no. 1 of the new cluster. The report is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32557. The 1st case in the Wielkopolskie voivodship (also known as Greater Poland province), no. 25 in the report, is situated in Keblowo, Wolsztyn, Wolsztynski county, in the western part of Wielkopolskie; its location can be viewed in the interactive map appended to the OIE report at the above URL. So far, this cluster, currently some 40 km [about 25 mi] distant from the German border, involves wild boars only.

An interactive map presenting all Poland's accumulating ASF outbreaks since the start of the ASF event in 2014, including the new western cluster, is available at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-Poland/ASF-Poland-Outbreaks-on-backyard-farms/. Clicking on each outbreak will provide its details.

According to a German agro-media report, dated 6 Dec 2019, Poland has erected a 120 km [about 75 mi] long protective fence, designed to restrict the freedom of movement of possibly infected wild boar from Lubuskie to Wielkopolskie; the recorded case beyond this fence is disappointing and will require a great effort to keep it remaining a single one. The report is available at https://www.topagrar.com/schwein/news/polen-stellt-120-km-asp-schutzzaun-fertig-11932053.html (in German; thanks to Sabine Zentis for its submission).

The domestic pig population in Wielkopolskie counts about 3.5 million. - Mod.AS
