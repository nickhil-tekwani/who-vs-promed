YELLOW FEVER - AFRICA (07): TANZANIA, FALSE VACCINATION CERTIFICATES

Random authorization and issuance of yellow fever certificates has come to the attention of the government, which has launched an investigation to nab perpetrators.

The document, usually issued to travellers visiting foreign countries after being administered with vaccination against yellow fever, is reportedly being issued indiscriminately at Mnazi Mmoja and at the airport in Dar es Salaam, with bribes in return for the illegal service.

The deputy minister for health and social welfare, Dr Seif Suleiman Rashid, informed legislators in Dodoma that those seeking shortcuts risked health complications, and both legal and disciplinary measures would be taken against those issuing certificates.

The deputy minister was responding to a question by Haji Khatibu Kai, (MP for Micheweni [Civic United Front]) who demanded clarification on the purpose of yellow fever vaccination for travellers and the need for the government to hire and deploy more health officers at Horohoro Border Post in Tanga Region, where some of the travellers cross the border without being examined. There are only 2 officers in the area.

"[Inappropriate] issuance of yellow fever certificates is uncalled-for and cannot be tolerated. The society should refuse to run unnecessary risks because travelling out of the country without vaccination is dangerous to the traveller, who could contract the disease and spread it to others back home," Dr Rashid explained.

[Issuance of fake yellow fever vaccination cards, or of cards to individuals who have not been vaccinated, is a cause for serious concern. The Tanzania health authorities are justified in cracking down on this practice, as did Nigerian health officials in 2012 when sale of fake cards came to light. There are 2 serious risks associated with this practice. First, individuals going into yellow fever (YF) endemic areas are not protected against this serious disease with its 30 per cent case fatality rate. Second, and perhaps more serious, is the risk of YF virus infected individuals going to places where the mosquito vector is present and starting new outbreaks in areas where the population has no immunity from immunization.

Although ProMED-mail has not reported YF cases in Tanzania, YF outbreaks have occurred in neighboring Kenya, where the virus occurs in the forest (sylvan) cycle of transmission (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110504.1377 for a summary and related references).
