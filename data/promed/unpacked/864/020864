Anthrax confirmed as cause of cattle deaths in Mongolia
-----------------------------------------------
2 heads of cattle have died of anthrax infection in Mongolia's Uvs
province, the Mongolian General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM)
said here on Saturday [2 Apr 2005].
The Uvs province authority has isolated Malchin county, where the cows died
in recent days, and is disinfecting more than 1400 head of livestock
nearby, GAEM said.
The cause of the anthrax is under investigation.
Anthrax is an infectious, usually fatal, disease of warm-blooded animals,
especially cattle and sheep. The disease can be transmitted to humans
through contact with contaminated animal substances.
Livestock-raising is the most important sector of Mongolia's economy, with
about 1/3 of the population dependent on animals for food, transport and
income.
