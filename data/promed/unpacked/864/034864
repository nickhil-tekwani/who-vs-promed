Beeville's Senior Animal Control Officer Johnny Carabajal is
encouraging pet owners to have their animals vaccinated against rabies
after the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported 3
cases of the disease last month [February 2010] in South Texas.

A report released by the DSHS showed that the deadly disease had been
confirmed in 3 free tailed bats. The closest case to Bee County was
reported in northern Nueces County near the San Patricio County border.

"One rabid bat was reported from Zapata County and a currently
vaccinated dog received a booster rabies vaccination and is being
confined at home for 45 days due to exposure to this bat," the report
said.

"The 2nd rabid bat was found on the ground behind a business complex
in Nueces County and there was no reported contact with that bat."

The 3rd bat was found in bat exclusion netting at a Webb County
school, where bat exclusion techniques were implemented after 2 rabid
bats were discovered there in January [2010]. There has been no
reported contact with any of the bats found at the school."

[According to Texas Administrative Code, Title 25, Part 1, Chapter
169, Subchapter A, Rule 169.30 of the Department of State Health
Services, Zoonosis Control, Rabies Control and Eradication, the
Disposition of Domestic Animal Exposed to Rabies states:

"Currently vaccinated animals which have been bitten by, directly
exposed by physical contact with, or directly exposed to the fresh
tissues of a rabid animal shall be:
1. humanely killed; or
2. immediately given a booster rabies vaccination and placed in
confinement for 45 days.
These provisions apply only to domestic animals for which a
USDA-licensed rabies vaccine is available."

Although the animal is vaccinated, this is a precaution to ensure the
safety of those around the animal, as well as for the protection of
the animal.

While the Mexican free-tailed bats consume a huge number of insects,
they nevertheless can be infected with rabies. The Brazilian
free-tailed bat, also called Mexican free-tailed bat, (_Tadarida
brasiliensis_) is so named because it possesses a tail free and
protruding beyond the uropatagium (hind membrane). The Brazilian
free-tailed bat has short and velvety dark brown fur on the back, and
lighter fur on the belly. Its lips are furrowed by vertical grooves,
it has 38 teeth, and the nostrils are surrounded by elevated skin. Its
narrow, pointed wings permit fast flight. The toes of the hind feet
have strong, recurved bristles, which are used to groom the fur. Size:
Adults may attain a total length 90-108 mm (3.5-4 in); tail 10-40 mm
(0.4-1.5 in); hind foot 8-11 mm (0.3-0.4 in); ear 13-19 mm (0.5-0.7
in); weight 8-14 grams (0.3-0.5 oz). This is one of North America's
smaller bats, and is often mistaken for a baby bat by amateurs. It has
a distinctive musky smell, which many people can easily detect when
they are near an active colony.

Texas only flying mammals live in caves in the southern US, Central,
and South America. Their colonies are the largest congregations of
mammals in the world. The largest colony found in (near San Antonio)
has nearly 20 million bats, which eat around 250 tons of insects per
night! Flights may travel hundreds of miles and fly to an altitude of
3000 meters (approx 10 000 ft) to feed on insects at night.

The Congress Avenue Bridge spans Town Lake in downtown Austin and is
home to the largest urban bat colony in North America. The colony is
estimated at 1.5 million Mexican free-tail bats. Each night from
mid-March to November, the bats emerge from under the bridge at dusk
to blanket the sky as they head out to forage for food. This event has
become one of the most spectacular and unusual tourist attractions in
Texas. The most spectacular bat flights are during hot, dry August
nights, when multiple columns of bats emerge. There are several points
from which to view the event, and an information kiosk is located on
the north bank of the river, just east of the bridge.
