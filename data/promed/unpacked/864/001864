Outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection associated with an open farm in
England
In the past two months three children in the south east of England have
developed infection with Escherichia coli O157 after visiting an open farm
in Hertfordshire. Two subsequently developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS). E. coli O157 was also isolated from goats in the farm. Phage typing
and further analysis by the Public Health Laboratory Service Laboratory of
Enteric Pathogens showed that all the E. coli isolates, from goats and
humans, were indistinguishable strains of phage type 21, which is the
second commonest isolated in England and Wales. The farmer has closed the
farm voluntarily following the recommendations of the incident management
committee.
Visiting farms has become popular in recent years, providing enjoyment and
education. The activity carries some risk, however. Outbreaks of various
infections - including cryptosporidiosis and E. coli O157 - have been
reported in association with farm visits
(1-3). Precautionary measures should be taken when organising visits of
children to a farms to reduce the risk of infection (1).
