Second Fatality in Polk County Hepatitis A Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Central Florida have confirmed a second death in Polk
County from hepatitis A in the worst outbreak seen here in a decade. A
36-year-old Auburndale man died from the disease earlier this month [on 5
Jun 2002]. The county's medical examiner put the cause of death as
hepatitis A complicated by chronic hepatitis C.
In the first 5 months of 2002, the Polk County Health Department had 185
confirmed cases of hepatitis A, by far more than the county had in all of
2001. In recent weeks, officials have been documenting 4 to 7 new cases a
week, although 9 new cases were reported last week. More than 15 disease
detectives are trying to track the virus, focusing on methamphetamine
users, who are highly susceptible to the disease, and people they come in
contact with.
Health officials don't know for sure how the Auburndale man contracted the
disease, although they said they had ruled out tainted restaurant food. In
April, 6 cases were linked to one restaurant, a Bartow landmark called
John's Restaurant and Lounge. Polk County health officials said the 6
people contracted the disease in January when they ate food handled by an
infected cook. One of those customers died in March. The restaurant has
been declared safe now by county officials, Although the owner still
isn't convinced that the customer who died contracted the disease from
eating at John's, Health Department Director Daniel Haight said eating at
John's was the only common denominator in the 6 cases.

[In the ACIP recommendations from the 1999 MMWR, injecting drug users are
identified as a high risk group for vaccination with hepatitis A virus
vaccine, which may explain the current focus on the use of methamphetamine
(often injected intravenously in "speed balls") as a risk factor in this
outbreak. The mortality rate of 2/187 (10.7 per 1000) cases (and another
case requiring dialysis) in this outbreak is higher than the overall
case-fatality rate of 5 per 1000 cases which is often quoted. However, it
is not out of line with populations where concurrent Hepatitis C virus
infection is prevalent or where there is other causes of a high frequency
of chronic liver disease. Until there is more information on the source of
this outbreak, this thread will be closed. - Mod.MPP]
