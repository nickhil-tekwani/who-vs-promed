I would like to inform you about a serologically confirmed case of
chikungunya virus infection in a 23-year-old traveller returning from
Viet Nam (24 Feb to 9 Mar 2009) and Malaysia (9 to 12 Mar 2009).
Onset of fever was 17 Mar 2009.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Petruschke for this 1st-hand report.
This patient was most likely infected with chikungunya virus in
Malaysia, where active transmission of this virus was going on
in February 2009 and likely is continuing. The incubation of
chikungunya virus disease is 2-12 days, which also points to Malaysia
as the more likely country in which the infection was acquired,
although Viet Nam is a possibility. Chikungunya virus is endemic in
Viet Nam also, but there have been no recent reports of cases there.
It is unlikely that ongoing transmission of the virus will occur in
Germany, as _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ are the primary
mosquito vectors, neither of which occur in Germany. This case is yet
another illustration of rapid, long-distance movement of chikungunya
virus half-way around the world via air travel. - Mod.TY]
