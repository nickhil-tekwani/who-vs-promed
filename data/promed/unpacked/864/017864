Superbug detected at Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Regional Hospital
----------------------------------------------------------
A superbug has been detected at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital.
Officials have placed restrictions on visitors at the Sydney-area hospital
in the wake of an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
So far, 5 patients have been diagnosed as coming down with the bug,
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, or VRE. A hospital spokesman says they
are taking special precautions including the isolation of patients.
There are also restrictions on visiting, with only family members allowed
and no children under the age of 12. Visitors are also being asked to wear
disposable gloves and gowns and to wash their hands following the visit.
The spokesman says medical staff are monitoring the situation closely and
working to control the outbreak.

[As previously expressed, the term superbug can be a misnomer, at least in
regard to an organism's pathogenicity. Certainly VRE represents a problem
in the nosocomial setting and may be associated with morbidity and
mortality. However, most individuals who acquire VRE in the hospital
setting are likely to be just colonized. Where the organism was isolated
from is not stated. The antimicrobial resistance profile, if treatment is
indicated, is quite limited and in this regard the term superbug has some
applicability, but drugs such as linezolid do have activity. It also
should be noted that not all isolates of VRE are resistant to penicillin
and ampicillin.
VRE would not generally be considered a risk to hospital visitors, but
infection control precautions are important, especially among health care
deliverers, to assist in keeping the organism from spreading to other
patients. In addition to barrier controls, the aggressive control of the
use of vancomycin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins is important. The
latter group of antimicrobials appear to increase the risk of overgrowth of
enterococcus sensitive or resistant in the hospital setting.
On the other hand, the recent documentation of a vancomycin-resistant
strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ (see posting: Staph. aureus, VRSA - US
(Michigan) 20020704.4665) is one in which the term superbug is
applicable. _S. aureus_ is a very significant pathogen in both community
and hospital settings, and VRSA has a very limited spectrum of
antimicrobials with activity. Additionally, most of the drugs with activity
have not had a significant track record for systemic staphylococcal
infections. -Mod.LL]
