State health director Dr Zulkifli Jantan put an end to speculations on
mysterious diseases and curses from angry spirits in the Bakun area by
confirming that 3 deaths reported in the Bakun area recently were
caused by melioidosis and leptospirosis, in a press statement
yesterday 2 Aug 2011].

A news portal claimed the people of Bakun believed that the deaths
were caused by spirits of the jungle who are angry over the
construction of the dam and the destruction of the surroundings. They
believed that their dead ancestors are also very angry that their
graves have been submerged by the dam water.

Dr Zulkifli added that the claim by the news portal that 10 people
hired by the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) to save animals from
being drowned following the impoundment of the Bakun Dam had died from
the mysterious disease was wrong. He clarified that the 10 fatalities
were actually the total number of people in the state who died from
melioidosis and leptospirosis from January to July 23 [2011].

The online report said that the latest victim of the disease was a
28-year old SFC worker who worked on the project. The father of the
deceased, was quoted to have said that his son fell gravely ill after
returning from Bakun Dam and died 2 days later.

Besides the Bakun area, 2 fatal cases from melioidosis were reported
in Kapit and one fatal case reported in Tatau. Apart from the deaths
reported in Bakun area, one fatal case was reported in Kuching, Sri
Aman, Betong and Limbang during the same period.

"To date, 2 clusters have been reported of melioidosis, namely one in
Bakun Hydroelectric project (Belaga) and the 2nd in Iron Wall Logging
Camp in Kapit," said Dr Zulkifli. There were 31 cases of positive
melioidosis detected in Sarawak since the beginning of the year to 23
Jul 2011 compared to 343 reported cases in 2010. As for leptospirosis,
there were 51 positive cases reported from the beginning of the year
[2011] to 23 Jul 2011 compared to 49 total cases last year [2010].

Dr Zulkifli disclosed that under the Preventive and Control of
Infectious Disease Act and Regulations 1988 [he] might close the
contaminated areas or sources of the diseases. "We will alert the
public regarding the possible hazards from the contaminated area.
Health hazard warning signage will be erected in specific areas that
are confirmed to be sources of infection," he said. He added that the
department was giving health education talks on the 2 diseases to the
public.

Dr Zulkifli also advised members of the public who were at risk to
seek treatment early if they had symptoms such as fever, cough, chest
pain, body ache, chronic ulcer/wound, and had a history of exposure to
outdoor water.

[Both melioidosis and leptospirosis are acquired from contact with
contaminated water. For a discussion of leptospirosis see ProMED post

melioidosis, see Melioidosis - Australia (02): (NT) 20100325.0952.

The controversial hydroelectric Bakun Dam, (see

concrete-faced rock-fill dam in the world, is under construction on
the Balui River in Sarawak, Malaysia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakun_Dam). The Bakun dam flooding
began on 13 Oct 2010.
