[A 42 percent BT clinical morbidity in goats is a surprising finding. Even sheep - the true BT-susceptible species - rarely, if ever, show a 100 percent case fatality rate, as reported in this event.

In the absence of data on necropsies and their results, the true cause or agent causing such high mortality could hypothetically be something other than BTV, with the detection of BT being an incidental finding. In November [2017], the peak of the BT season, goats in an endemic country may be found BTV positive without being clinically affected by this virus.

Nevertheless, the notification of this event is welcome. There is no doubt that BTV16 has been circulating in south-western Turkey in late 2017. However, any additional information resulting from further investigation of this event would also be of great value. - Mod.AS
