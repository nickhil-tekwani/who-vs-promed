Deputy commissioner M Maheshwar Rao has said that over 4000 people
are said to be suffering from chikungunya in the district.

Addressing health workers and administrative officers at a review
meeting [in Mangalore] on Thursday (22 May 2008) he said: "More than
2100 cases have been confirmed. The number of chikungunya cases is
estimated at more than 4000."

The district administration believed that the disease had spread to
Sullia, Puttur, Belthangady, and Bantwal taluks. No case had been
reported from Mangalore taluk. [A taluk is an administrative division
in some Indian states, and consists of a headquarters city with
authority over villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. - Mod.TY]

Mr Rao, who conducted a ground survey on Wednesday [21 May 2008],
found that areas under the Panja and Kadaba primary health centres
(PHCs) in Sullia taluk were worst affected. Of the 2100 cases
reported, 1300 are from Sullia taluk alone.

Many private hospitals have bolstered the efforts of the district
Health Department.

Mr Rao said that an early monsoon could cut the breeding cycle of
_Aedes aegypti_, a mosquito species that carries the chikungunya
virus. "Continuous and heavy rainfall will wash away the larvae and
eggs," said Mr Rao, quoting from a report presented to him by a team
of entomologists in the district.

The district administration was in the process of fixing a "dry day"
to launch a drive to encourage people to empty the water logged at
various places, starting from gram panchayat level. This was aimed at
cutting the mosquito breeding cycle, Mr Rao said. In addition, the
health workers have been instructed to undertake fogging. [Gram
panchayats are local government units at the village level. - Mod.TY]

[It appears that this chikungunya epidemic continues to accelerate at
an alarming rate. The ProMED-mail post of 20 May 2008 (archive no.
20080520.1673) indicated that there were as many as 1600 suspected
chikungunya cases. That number now has grown to over 4000 in 3 days,
more than 2100 of which have been laboratory confirmed. One hopes
that the "dry day" is successful in reducing the virus vector
mosquito-breeding sites. Heavy monsoon rains will not wash away
larvae and pupae in sheltered sites within houses and other buildings.
