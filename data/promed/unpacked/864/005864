The Excel Corp. is recalling about 190 000 pounds of fresh ground beef
and fresh ground pork because of possible contamination by the
potentially deadly _E. coli_ [presumably _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria,
the Agriculture Department said Monday [25 Jun 2001.
Excel, a Newnan, Georgia company, produced the suspect meat on 23 & 24
May 2001, packaged it in various sizes and distributed it to Kroger
stores in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the meat bears a
production date code of "01.05.23" or "01.05.24." Each product label
also bears the establishment number "86G" inside the USDA inspection
seal. The problem was discovered by officials in Georgia, who
contacted FSIS about suspected illnesses associated with the meats.
While samples tested positive for _E. coli_ contamination, a link
between the meats and the illnesses has not so far been established.

[Large-scale meat processing facilities make contamination of ground
meat much more important than was the case years ago, when processing
was done on a smaller scale. The recall last month was even larger:
471 000 pounds of ground beef. _E. coli_ O157:H7 is likely to be the
culprit here again. The infective dose of this organism by the oral
route is quite low compared with that of _Salmonella_ species, and is
on the order of the infective dose of _Shigella_ species.
Many clinical microbiology laboratories in the United States routinely
culture stool specimens for _E. coli_ O157:H7 by including
sorbitol-MacConkey agar medium in the procedure. Unfortunately, this
medium is unable to detect other strains of _E. coli_ capable of
producing an identical clinical picture. Stool screening for the
presence of Shiga toxin, which, if positive, alerts the laboratory to
the possibility of the presence of an _E. coli_ strain that is
producing this toxin, is not widely performed. - Man.Ed.DS
