The medical NGO ALIMA (Alliance for International Medical Action) began a rapid emergency response to an outbreak of Lassa fever, an acute viral hemorrhagic fever, in southern Nigeria in mid-January 2018. ALIMA is working alongside Nigeria's Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), as well as Federal and State health authorities.

"ALIMA's priority is to help Nigerian health authorities protect and train hospital staff, improve case management and facilitate actions in the community to control the transmission of the disease," said Guillaume Le Duc, ALIMA's Lassa Coordinator. "The goal is to catch cases early, and improve the chances of survival for those who become infected."

According to the NCDC [Nigeria Center for Disease Control], 449 suspected cases of Lassa fever have been reported across 17 States since [1 Jan 2018]. Among these, 132 cases have been confirmed, as of [4 Feb 2018], and 40 people, including 3 health workers, have died. The current number of suspected cases is more than double the average annual caseload recorded in previous years.

ALIMA's emergency response
--------------------------
To support the government's response, an emergency team from ALIMA, including an epidemiologist, medical doctors, logisticians, and a coordinator, are on the ground at the Owo Federal Medical Center in Ondo State and the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State. Our teams are supporting case management, active case detection, patient triage, public awareness campaigns, and reinforcing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures.

ALIMA is supporting the rehabilitation of a 38-bed treatment center in Owo to improve treatment capacity, and also expanding the bed capacity at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. ALIMA is also supporting the Nigerian government's efforts by supplying hospitals and health clinics with materials to ensure basic hygiene standards, reinforce infection prevention and control at triage points, and helping with waste management. ALIMA is providing personal protective equipment (PPE), thermoflash thermometers, and 3500 vials of ribavirin, the recommended treatment.

The need for research on Lassa fever
------------------------------------
"Lassa fever is a very neglected tropical disease and we need to look beyond this emergency to launch research initiatives," said Dr Denis Malvy, a professor at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM Unit 1219). "This is exactly why ALIMA and INSERM created a research alliance: we need to respond to immediate needs and support longer-term research efforts at the same time. Our goals would be to better understand the dynamics of this disease, assess rapid diagnostic tests, evaluate the potential of vaccine candidates and improve the therapeutic tools available to clinicians on the front lines."

Thanks to funding from the ELMA Relief Foundation and the Start Fund, ALIMA will continue to support the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control until at least 1 Mar 2018 and maintains close contact with local health authorities in order to help stop the spread of the outbreak.

ALIMA
-----
The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) is a medical humanitarian organization that works hand-in-hand with a network of local organizations to provide quality medical care to the most vulnerable populations in emergency situations and recurrent crises. Based in Dakar, Senegal, ALIMA has treated over 3 million patients in 12 countries since its creation in 2009, and launched more than a dozen research projects focused on malnutrition, malaria and Ebola. ALIMA has extensive experience responding to outbreaks, including Ebola in Guinea, Rift Valley fever in Niger, Lassa fever in Togo, and dengue fever in Burkina Faso.

In Nigeria, ALIMA has been working in the northeast in Borno State since July 2016, where our teams were the 1st to provide medical and ambulatory nutritional care to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host populations in Monguno. The program has since expanded to include the opening of a clinic near the makeshift camps for internally displaced persons in Muna Garage, on the outskirts of Maiduguri, which provides primary medical care to children under the age of 5, and treatment for cases of severe malnutrition at the Intensive Therapeutic Feeding Center at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, in Maiduguri.

In 2017, in Nigeria, our teams performed nearly 50 000 pediatric consultations, treated more than 10 000 children for severe acute malnutrition, and helped 2500 women give birth. In August 2017, ALIMA responded to an outbreak of cholera in Borno State that affected more than 5000 people.

Lassa fever
-----------
Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is usually transmitted to humans from the infected urine, [saliva] or feces of the _Mastomys_ rat. Human-to-human transmission is also possible, via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, putting health workers at an especially increased risk of infection.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sore throat and hemorrhaging. Without proper diagnosis and treatment, Lassa fever mortality rate can reach 30 percent during outbreaks. Cases are best managed in isolation units and using a medication called ribavirin.

[It is very gratifying to see that the medical NGO ALIMA is working closely with the Nigeria CDC in supporting not only the treatment of infected people, but in prevention of nosocomial infections and public education as well. Dealing with cases scattered across 17 states and attempting to prevent new ones is a significant challenge.

As noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the fatal cases of the 3 healthcare workers mentioned above. Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.

Interestingly, given the recent cases in the region, public health authorities in Ghana, a West African country within the Lassa fever virus belt, have sounded the alarm bells to advise the medical community to be prepared should cases of Lassa fever occur there. The Ghana Health Services (GHS) has cautioned all Divisional Directors, Regional Deputy Directors of the Service, and public health care facilities of the likelihood of outbreaks of Lassa fever in the country (https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/lassa-fever-ghana-health-service-issues-alert.html). It is very prudent to be prepared well ahead of the appearance of the 1st case.

In Abia state, 7 suspected victims of the dreaded Lassa fever have been identified while 2 illegal routine immunization persons have been arrested and are undergoing police investigation.

State Health Commissioner, John Ahukannah said of the 7 suspected cases, one has died, 4 tested negative, while the other 2 responded to treatment and have been discharged. He also said the sample of the dead suspect was yet to be returned from Irrua where it was sent for analysis to determine the cause of his death. He stressed that the state has been alive to its responsibility and urged the public to step up their personal hygiene and avoid rats infected places and report any incidence to their nearest health authorities.

The commissioner, who said there is available cure for Lassa fever if detected early, and drugs are also available, as the federal government has supplied the state with drugs.

On the arrested persons carrying out illegal immunization against "hepatitis B" in schools in Owerrinta in Isiala Ngwa South LGA [local government area], Ahukannah said that they have alerted the public that they did not declare or schedule such, saying that samples of what they were caught with while immunizing people at N1000 [USD 2.8] each were being analyzed indicating that thereafter, the Police will prosecute them accordingly.

[Illegal immunization poses a significant public health threat. If the vaccine is legitimate and not fake (another risk), it may not have been maintained within the cold chain and deteriorated. Frequently, the syringes and needles used in these illegal operations are not sterile or are not sterilized between uses, with the risk of transmission of other pathogens such as Lassa fever, hepatitis viruses, and HIV as well as other pathogens from one person to another. Vigorous detection and police action are important. - Mod.TY]
