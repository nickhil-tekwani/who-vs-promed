Two horses in eastern Leon County euthanized after testing positive for
encephalitis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Leon County Health Department has issued an advisory [notice] for an
increase in risk from mosquitoborne diseases. The department has confirmed
cases of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in 2 horses. The horses were
kept at locations in eastern Leon County, one off of Tung Grove Road and
the 2nd off of Louvenia Drive. Their infections were confirmed by the
Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services 19 Jun 2009 and they
were euthanized.

So far, there have been no reports of humans being confirmed statewide or
locally with the disease, health department officials say. "Anytime you
have activity like this, it's an indicator that you have to take
precautions," said Alex Mahon, environmental manager for Leon County
Department of Health. "Putting out information that advises folks about how
to avoid being bitten and reduce mosquito breeding will help."

Mahon said the threat of infection in humans right now is low. The Health
Department recommends people remove objects containing sitting water where
mosquitoes are likely to lay eggs. Other steps include avoid outdoor
activity when mosquitoes are most active and wearing clothing that covers
the skin.

Dr Mike Short, Equine Program's manager for the Department of Agriculture's
Division of Animal Industry, said that June through August is the time when
encephalitis infections among horses is greatest. "We get about 75
confirmed cases of infections in the state of Florida each year," Short
said. "We don't get all of the submitted cases."

Short said there have been 23 confirmed cases of eastern equine
encephalitis virus in Florida this year [2009] among horses. Mosquitoborne
illness advisories have also been issued in Volusia and Columbia counties.

There have been no confirmed cases of any child or adult in Leon County
being infected, said representatives of Capital Regional Medical Center and
Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.

Mahon said that eastern equine encephalitis virus typically occurs in
horses but can infect humans as well. The virus is usually asymptomatic,
meaning most people who are infected do not know they have it until
symptoms manifest. Mahon said in severe cases, the onset of high fever,
muscle pains, increased headaches, vomiting, and seizures can occur.
Children and the elderly are most susceptible to the disease.

"Encephalitis is dangerous because the symptomatology can be tricky to
figure out," said Alyssa Pickles, registered nurse and director of
Infection Control for Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. "This is a rare
disease in humans (but) people would need to report to the emergency room
or their primary doctor if they showed symptoms."

Eliminating mosquito breeding sites is one of the keys to prevention.
Follow these tips to discourage mosquito breeding near your home:
- clean out eaves, troughs and gutters;
- remove old tires or drill holes in those used in playgrounds to drain;
- turn over or remove empty plastic pots;
- pick up all beverage containers and cups;
- check tarps on boats or other equipment that may collect water;
- pump out bilges on boats;
- replace water in birdbaths and pet or other animal feeding dishes at
least once a week;
- change water in plant trays, including hanging plants, at least once a week;
- remove vegetation or obstructions in drainage ditches that prevent the
flow of water.

Previous report
---------------
There has been increased mosquitoborne disease activity in Leon County. Two
horses in Leon County have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis
virus within 2 weeks, meeting the criteria for issuing a mosquitoborne
illness advisory. The risk of transmission to humans has been increased.

Leon County Health Department reminds residents and visitors to avoid being
bitten by mosquitoes. Leon County Mosquito Control and Leon County Health
Department continue surveillance and prevention efforts and encourage
everyone to take basic precautions to help limit exposure by following the
Health Department's recommendations.

To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember to practice the "5
Ds":
- dusk and dawn -- avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are plentiful;
- dress -- wear clothing that covers most of your skin;
- DEET -- when the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes, use
repellents containing up to 30 per cent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide).
Other effective mosquito repellents include picaridin, oil of lemon
eucalyptus, and IR3535. Always read label directions carefully for the
approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not
suitable for children;
- drainage -- check around your home to rid the area of standing water
where mosquitoes lay eggs.

Clay County reports EEE in horses
---------------------------------
The Clay County Health Department and Florida Department of Health say 3
horses in the county have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE).

EEE is a mosquitoborne viral disease that occurs in the eastern half of the
United States. The department advises you to try and avoid being bitten by
mosquitoes. They continue to monitor areas, and are working towards
prevention activities. The Health Department suggests you take a few basic
steps to limit exposure to mosquitoes.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquitoborne viral disease. EEE
virus (EEEV) generally occurs in the eastern half of the United States
where it causes disease in humans, horses, and some bird species. Because
of the high mortality rate, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious
mosquitoborne diseases in the United States.

EEEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It
generally takes from 3 to 10 days to develop symptoms of EEE after being
bitten by an infected mosquito. The main EEEV transmission cycle is between
birds and mosquitoes.

Many species of mosquitoes can become infected with EEEV. The most
important mosquito species in maintaining the bird-mosquito transmission
cycle is _Culiseta melanura_, which reproduces in freshwater hardwood
swamps. _Culiseta melanura_, however, is not considered an important vector
of EEEV to horses or humans because it feeds almost exclusively on birds.
Transmission to horses or humans requires mosquito species capable of
creating a "bridge" between infected birds and uninfected mammals such as
some _Aedes_, _Coquillettidia_, and _Culex_ species.

Horses are susceptible to EEE and most cases are fatal. EEEV infections in
horses, however, are not a significant risk factor for human infection
because horses are considered "dead-end" hosts for the virus (that is, the
amount of EEEV in their bloodstreams is usually insufficient to infect
mosquitoes).
