[1] WHO update 5 Jan 2015

WHO: Ebola death toll goes past 8000
------------------------------------
The UN's health agency says the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 8000 people. Sierra Leone had the biggest increase in fatalities since last week [28 Dec 2014 to 4 Jan 2015].

More than 8000 people have died in West Africa in the Ebola outbreak there, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Mon [5 Jan 2015].

The WHO said that the 8153 deaths were among 20 656 known cases of the hemorrhagic fever in the 3 countries, representing a mortality rate of 39 percent. It said 2915 deaths had been reported from Sierra Leone, 3471 from Liberia and 1767 from Guinea. Sierra Leone had the largest rise in fatalities since the previous figures were issued on 2 Jan 2015, recording 88 deaths. [Only part of these figures have been confirmed. - Mod.JW]

Unconfirmed case in Berlin
--------------------------
Doctors in the German capital, Berlin, meanwhile said on Mon [5 Jan 2015] that a suspected Ebola infection in a patient from South Korea remains unconfirmed. The person, whose sex and age have not been named, was injured by a hypodermic needle while treating an Ebola patient in Sierra Leone and brought to Berlin for treatment on Sat [3 Jan 2015].

3 people infected with Ebola have so far been flown to Germany for treatment; 2 recovered, but a UN employee from Africa died in hospital in the eastern city of Leipzig.

UK nurse 'stable'
-----------------
Health Minister Jeremy Hunt told British parliamentarians Britain had tightened steps for dealing with possible Ebola patients after screening at London's Heathrow failed to detect the disease in the [Scottish] nurse. She contracted the disease while working at a British-built Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone.

No more US screening for Malians
--------------------------------
The United States, for its part, has decided to drop extra Ebola screening for travelers coming to the country from Mali as of Tue [6 Jan 2015].

"Travelers from Mali will no longer be required to undergo enhanced screening and monitoring when entering the United States, nor will they be required to enter the country through the 5 designated airpots that perform this screening," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] said in a statement on Mon [5 Jan 2015].

On Tue [6 Jan 2015], Mali will have gone 42 days -- or 2 full incubation cycles -- since the last Ebola patient there had contact with anyone who was not wearing protective gear, the statement said.

Visitors from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone remain subject to travel restrictions and monitoring.

[2] Sierra Leone lockdown extended

New Ebola lockdown in Sierra Leone as airport checks upped
----------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola lockdown in the northern Tonkolili district of Sierra Leone was extended on Sun [4 Jan 2015] for 2 weeks as authorities stepped up the fight to contain the epidemic. The move comes as the government imposed "additional screening measures" at Freetown International Airport after 2 workers apparently caught the disease [confirmed by laboratory testing on 2 Jan 2015].

A 5-day lockdown had been declared by the government across the badly-hit north of the country last month [December 2014]. "The lockdown is extended for another 2 weeks to intensify monitoring efforts by all sectors in the district as we need this mopping up operation until 17 Jan [2015]," he added.

[3] Sierra Leoneans abandoned over Ebola fears
Date: Mon 5 Jan 2015

http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/152254/sierra-leoneans-abandoned-over-ebola-fears


Health authorities in Sierra Leone have raised concerns about patients being abandoned by their families at hospitals, even after testing negative for the deadly Ebola virus. "A lot of people have turned up in hospital as a result of 'Operation Western Area Surge'," Isatu Kamara, matron of the Connaught Hospital, capital Freetown's main government referral hospital, told The Anadolu Agency.

In a recent address, President Ernest Bai Koroma announced plans to conduct house-to-house searches in the capital -- a hot spot for rapid virus transmission -- in hopes of identifying suspected Ebola infections. Kamara said people had been reporting to hospital in large numbers due to fears of being reprimanded by officials in the event that sick people are found in their homes. "There have been warnings of some form of punishment on radio programs, so families are turning sick patients into hospitals for fear of the consequences from government officials if these sick people are found at home during the ongoing search," she said. "When these patients are brought in, we treat them as suspected Ebola cases," said Kamara. "Those who test negative for Ebola are admitted in the outpatient ward in order to treat them for malaria or typhoid, which are the most commonly diagnosed," she explained. "The problem we're facing now is that after they start feeling better, no one shows up to take them home," Kamara lamented. ... -- more

[It is good that families are bringing sick relatives to the hospital. But it appears education of the community is lacking yet critical to the Ebola control effort as well as for appropriate treatment of and recovery from other endemic diseases. - Mod.LK]

9 counties in Liberia report no new Ebola cases for over 21 days -- UN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to [Hans] Rosling, [an official of the United Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)], Grand Gedeh, River Gee, Grand Kru, Maryland and Rivercess counties in south-eastern Liberia, Grand Bassa County in eastern Liberia, as well as Gbarpolu and Bomi counties have reported no confirmed cases of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) for more than 21 days, while Lofa County in northern Liberia has reported 0 cases in more than 40 days. Foya in Lofa County registered Liberia's 1st case of Ebola in early March 2014, with the disease subsequently spreading to other parts of the country.

At the same time, according to Rosling, 6 counties: Cape Mount, Montserrado, Bong, Nimba, Margibi and Sinoe, have reported just over 70 Ebola cases in the last 3 weeks.

The World Health Organization (WHO) will declare a country Ebola-free if it does not record any new Ebola case in 42 days.

ISIS cracks down on 5 confirmed Ebola cases among fighters: official
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Islamic State (ISIS) incinerated the corpses of 5 militants who were suspected of contracting Ebola, [Faisal Ghazi, member of the Health Committee in Iraq's council of ministries] indicated. "ISIS had proof that these militants were infected with Ebola," he added, without giving details of whether the fighters died of the disease or were killed and incinerated by the group.

The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) had been investigating cases of Ebola in Mosul, following reports that some militants with Ebola symptoms had reported to a hospital in the city. ISIS volunteers have poured into Iraq and Syria from around the world, including countries in Africa.

[It is unfortunate that there is no information on how these 5 individuals were confirmed to have Ebola so that there would be more confidence in the report. If true, there are serious implications for the region. - Mod.LK]

[It is highly unlikely that ISIS had access to a qualified Ebola diagnostic lab. Rudaw is "a Kurdish media network funded and supported by Rudaw Company. The network aims to impart news and information about Kurdistan and the Middle East in a professional manner. Those interested in Kurdistan and the Kurdish cause can follow the latest developments in the region in both Kurdish and English through Rudaw's multiple platforms." - Mod.JW]
