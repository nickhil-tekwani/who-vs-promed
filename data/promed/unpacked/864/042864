In light of recent surveillance findings in mink which suggest genetic/antigenic drift of SARS-CoV-2, following introduction from humans, the OIE has decided to publish draft guidance on reducing the risk of spillover from humans to domestic animals.

The OIE encourages countries to promote these risk reduction strategies and to monitor susceptible animal species for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Summary
-------
COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is a human disease which has emerged from an animal source and become a pandemic through widespread human to human transmission. The nature of this new zoonotic virus, its widespread distribution, and the susceptibility of some animal species to infection has led to animal infections resulting from contact between infected people and susceptible animals and raises the concern that some animal species may become reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

The results of experimental infection studies combined with reports from natural animal infections have provided a growing body of knowledge to animal species in terms of susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transmissibility of infection to other animals and humans.

This guidance aims to:
- support Veterinary Services, public health, and other partners in reducing the risk of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to susceptible farmed animal populations using a One Health approach;
- address the risks and risk pathways associated with different farming systems; and
- propose measures to follow in case of SARS-CoV-2 introduction to a farm.

Further information on current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 in animals can be found on the OIE website:

Further information on the public health aspects of COVID-19 can be found on the WHO website:

[The above exhaustive draft of OIE's "non-prescriptive high-level guidance" has been authored by a subgroup designated by OIE's "AD HOC group on COVID-19 at the animal-human interface." It is available online at OIE's COVID-19 portal (https://tinyurl.com/yxt4hlwh; go to "Expert groups and guidance"). The guidance addresses the following animal groups:
1. Animals kept for food production (poultry, pigs, cattle);
2. Animals kept for fur production (farmed minks, raccoon dogs);
3. Animals kept for food and fur production (rabbits).

Based on current evidence, the risk of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from people to animals is high in mustelids, including mink and ferrets, as well as racoon dogs; low in rabbits; and negligible in other farmed livestock species.

OIE's Terrestrial Code does not address minks as a domestic or farmed animal nor diseases of this animal species. One of the issues discussed in the Guidance is the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between countries/regions through import/export of carcasses or products from infected mink. Since mink pelts are harvested annually in November/December in the northern hemisphere, the risk of transmission through pelts and fur was considered negligible before the pandemic began, in the months preceding the 2019 harvesting period. However, there is the possibility that pelts and fur from infected mink are contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 in the 2020 harvesting period. Additionally, when harvested pelts and fur are stored in an infected farm, there is a possibility that they could be contaminated from the presence of infection at the farm. Because pelts are usually stored in a freezer, the virus may stay viable on the pelts and fur and be transported to other regions for further processing, which could also pose an occupational safety hazard. Further research is needed to better understand the risks of contaminated pelts and fur from animals on farms with SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through import/export of carcasses or products from infected animals of the susceptible species listed above is considered low to medium.

The said and other aspects of COVID-19 in farmed animals are included in the Guidance.

The COVID-19 portal includes also a table presenting the cases in animals officially notified to the OIE since the start of the pandemic. The (16) countries and (in brackets) their affected species are: Hong Kong (cat, dog); Belgium (cat): USA (tiger, lion, cat, dog, mink); Netherlands (mink); France (cat); Spain (cat, mink); Germany (cat); Russia (cat); Denmark (mink); UK (cat); Japan (dog); Italy (mink); Sweden (mink); Chile (cat); Canada (dog); Brazil (cat). All notifications are linked and can be visited; the most recent uploaded reports are: Sweden (mink, update 2, 6 Nov 2020); Denmark (mink, update 6, 5 Nov 2020). China has not submitted a report, but a Q&A dated 5 Feb 2020 is included.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an independent agency of the European Union, has made known that a Rapid Risk Assessment on the Danish mink-related situation is to be published by 12 Nov 2020 (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-assess-risk-associated-spread-sars-cov-2-mink-farms). The assessment, hopefully to discuss the epidemiological aspects of the recently identified "cluster 5 variant," is anticipated with great interest.
