More Dutch farms hit by infectious goat fever
---------------------------------------------
Dutch authorities, already battling an outbreak of the highly infectious
disease, Q fever, have discovered contamination at 5 more farms and expect
further outbreaks, the Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday [17 Dec 2009].

Q fever is caused by a bacterium that is mostly transmitted to humans from
goats and sheep, especially during delivery of young, and the number of
human cases of the disease has risen to about 2200 currently from about 170
in 2007.

A total of 60 farms in the country are now known to be affected and
authorities plan to cull an extra 5000 goats on top of the 35 000 announced
on Wednesday [16 Dec 2009], a spokesman for the agriculture ministry said.
The culling of goats is set to begin on 21 Dec 2009, and will be done by
lethal injection.

For humans, Q fever causes flu-like symptoms treatable with antibiotics,
but in rare cases it can be fatal. Six people who had other diseases or
were weakened have died this year while having Q fever.

Dutch authorities have toughened up measures to stop the disease spreading
to humans following health advice, but Dutch farmers organisation LTO has
opposed the plans, particularly the decision to kill healthy animals on
contaminated farms.

Dutch farmers resist culling of healthy goats
---------------------------------------------
The Dutch Farmers Association LTO has said it rejects the killing of
healthy goats to fight the spread of Q fever, following a cabinet proposal
to eradicate the disease by a mass slaughter of goats.

Agriculture minister Gerda Verburg and health minister Ab Klink on Thursday
[17 Dec 2009] announced an extension of the extermination scheme. Initially
just pregnant goats carrying the Q fever bacteria would be culled, because
the bacteria is mainly spread through miscarriages. Minister Verburg
changed her mind after the methods used to determine whether animals are
infected proved to be unreliable.

It is not clear whether LTO will take action against the government decision.

Mass cull starts on Monday
--------------------------
The disease has been confirmed at 55 farms, mainly in the densely populated
southern province of Noord-Brabant. An estimated 35 000 goats will be
culled, starting on Monday [21 Dec 2009].

Clear warning signs will be placed near infected farms, and maps detailing
infection locations have been published.

LTO chairman Albert Jan Maat acknowledged that Minister Verburg had wanted
to spare the lives of healthy animals, but he questions the validity and
timing of the arguments she gave to now include all goats.

Horrible
--------
LTO also says it is callous to let the goat farmers foot the bill. MPs in
The Hague support the ministers' decision, but emphasise they find it
horrible. The matter will be debated on Thursday.

Goat farming spread in the Netherlands when other cattle, such as pigs,
cows, as well as chickens, were widely affected by diseases. Goats appeared
a safer option, and the number of animals rose to 374 000. The average goat
farm has about a thousand animals. They are kept for their milk and meat,
most of which is exported.

Netherlands to slaughter more animals
-------------------------------------
The Netherlands stepped up measures on Wednesday [16 Dec 2009] against the
world's biggest Q fever epidemic that has killed 10 humans, by ordering the
slaughter of over 30 000 animals, a press release said. The ministry of
agriculture announced the "preventative slaughter" of 34 000 expectant
goats and ewes, and 1200 billy goats "will be killed too as they can
transmit the infection through their sperm."

Q fever, found in 55 Dutch farms so far, has killed 6 people in 2009 and
Dutch authorities say 10 farm workers have died in total since the fever
appeared in 2007 in the south of the country.

The slaughter had involved 15 000 - 20 000 non-vaccinated expectant goats,
but this has now been extended to vaccinated animals in an attempt to limit
the spread of bacteria when animals give birth or during forced abortions.
[Updated figures available in items 1,2].

The slaughter accounts for more than half the livestock from the 55
infected farms, mostly situated in the southern Brabant province. The
authorities warn that the slaughter will now be carried out in all farms
where the infection is found.

All reproductive activity in ovine and caprine farms is forbidden until
July 2010 and reproduction between animals in the infected farms has been
banned for life.

An obligatory animal vaccination campaign was launched at the start of 2009
in the Netherlands, but due to a lack of vaccinations, it was not able to
cover the whole country.

Questions and answers regarding Q fever
---------------------------------------
1. How many goats are there in the Netherlands?
During 2008, there were about 350 000 goats [on commercial farms. -
Mod.AS]. These animals are not kept exclusively on goat farms; many cattle
farms keep goats as well, as a side-line business. In addition, several
hundred thousand goats are kept as "hobby animals".
2. How many dairy goats are there in the Netherlands?
About 250 000
3. How many sheep are there in the Netherlands?
During 2008 there were about 1 200 000 sheep in the Netherlands. These
animals are not kept exclusively on sheep farms; many cattle farms keep
sheep as well, as a side-line business. In addition, several hundred
thousand sheep are kept as "hobby animals."
4. How many dairy sheep are there in the Netherlands?
There are few dairy sheep farms in the Netherlands, including a total of
several thousand animals. Besides, no dairy sheep farms are infected by Q
fever [it would help if this last statement were officially confirmed. -
Mod.AS].
5. How many farms are infected?
Based upon the results of the bulk milk tests, it has been established that
the Q fever bacterium is present on 55 dairy goat farms. 43 of them
vaccinated during 2009 against Q fever; 1 farm is situated outside the
vaccination area. [for updated data, see item 1 above. - Mod.AS].
6. When is a farm declared as infected?
A farm is declared infected when repeated bulk milk tests, performed by
both the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority) and CVI (Central
Veterinary Institute), are found positive.
7. How can I, as a citizen, know if a farm is infected?
Infected farms are banned for visitors. The farms themselves must make this
known. Only persons who are required to visit the farms due to their
professional obligations, are allowed to enter infected premises. The state
authorities publish the areas within which infected farms are present. Once
in 2 months, geographic maps are published on the websites of the VWA and
RIVM (Institute for Public Health and the Environment).
8. Is Q fever an occupational disease?
Q fever is a disease which appears more often in animal holders,
veterinarians and slaughterhouse personnel. But Q fever appears also in
people who have no connection to animals. Anyone can get infected by
inhaling air which includes the bacterium.

[According to a press release of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, dated
16 Dec 2009, the total number of animals in the 55 infected farms is around
64 000 dairy goats, of which over 34 000 are pregnant animals and over 1200
are bucks. The 5 farms found now infected and added to the 55 list, are
part of 16 hitherto "suspected" farms with 17 500 animals (including 10 000
pregnant animals and 350 bucks), of which results were expected this week.
It would be interesting to know if the remaining 11 "suspected" farms have
been found to be uninfected or otherwise. According to the press release,
the expectation is that during the coming few months, bulk-milk testing
will discover new infected farms.

It would be helpful to know the total number of dairy goat and dairy sheep
farms which have been already tested, at least once, by the bulk milk (PCR)
tests. If, as the Q&A item tells, dairy goats are also kept on mixed farms
(with cattle), and if the non-commercial goat sector includes a total
number of animals which seems to be of approximate size as the commercial
sector ("hundred thousand"), the Dutch veterinary authorities have a huge
task on their hands.

In a previous posting on Q fever in the Netherlands, we referred
subscribers to a Dutch SCFCAH presentation on the issue, dated May 2009. We
are grateful to a Dutch subscriber who has drawn our attention to a more
recent (Nov 2009) presentation, available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/0304112009_q_fever_nl.pdf>.

A map showing the 55 infected farms throughout the Netherlands is to be
found on page 10 of the Letter from the Minister of Agriculture to the
Dutch Parliament, dated 9 Dec 2009. Its annex (8 pages) includes the
detailed advise of the RIVM expert group, submitted to the Minister on 4
Dec 2009; see at
<http://www.novatv.nl/data/media/db_download/76_409b4b.pdf> (in Dutch). -
