With the discovery of another avian flu case in poultry last Friday [10 Nov
2006] in Luxor, Ministry of Health (MOH) officials announced a slight shift
in their strategy to combat the disease's spread. MOH spokesman Abdel
Rahman Shaheen said it's unlikely the government will impose a ban on
domestic poultry breeding as it did last year.
"A ban would lead many to conceal their birds, heightening the danger
rather than quelling it," said Shahine.
The government rounded up as many as 30 million birds last winter from
"backyard" farms around the country and placed a ban on domestic breeding
that only expired with the beginning of summer. But while the ban found
partial success in urban centers such as Cairo and Alexandria, few complied
in rural governorates since raising poultry often constitutes citizens'
lone source of income. Egypt is home to an estimated 1.5 million poultry
farmers.
At least 15 human bird flu cases have been recorded in Egypt since its
outbreak in February. Seven of the 15 have died, with the most recent death
coming 30 Oct 2006. Egypt has the highest number of bird flu-related deaths
of any non-Asian country, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Talib Ali, regional animal health and production officer for the Food and
Agriculture Organization [FAO], a United Nations organization, says the
actual number of bird flu cases in poultry may be higher. The new avian flu
cases, he says, are reported by the government's Central Poultry
Laboratory, which collected 2800 random samples from 200 villages in 9
governorates. An effective survey, he says, must be conducted on a wider
scale and be accompanied by fair compensation for poultry owners whose
chickens are rounded up and destroyed. Ali says the government allocated
just LE 50 million [USD 8.73 million] for compensation for 30 million
culled chickens as a result of the virus spreading to Egypt last winter. A
fair system needs to set aside at least LE 500 million [USD 87.34 million]
for compensation, he says.
"Any surveillance system must be accompanied with a fair and transparent
compensation scheme," says Ali. "Otherwise people will not give up their
chickens."
Another MOH spokesman Sayyid El-Abasi, told The Daily Star Egypt the
ministry has designed a specific plan of action to counter the spread of
the disease, but declined to discuss the details.
So far, the government appears to be implementing procedures similar to
last year, with the exception of banning private poultry farming. In the
Luxor case, for example, the entire area of Naj Al-Abayda, where several
chickens tested positive for the disease, was quarantined and all birds
within the area were destroyed. The government's actions are endorsed by
WHO, provided poultry owners are compensated properly. WHO has also praised
the government for its "transparency" in dealing with the disease by
reporting all detected cases.
No word was immediately available from the government or Naj Al-Abayda
residents on the amount of compensation awarded to poultry owners, if any.
Last year's outbreak of the disease raised poultry and egg prices by as
much as 200 percent. Prices have since dropped gradually but have not
reached pre-flu levels. The price of a live chicken per kg dipped under the
LE 9 mark in most Cairo neighborhoods for the first time in September since
it topped LE 12 in May. The relatively newly introduced frozen chickens
have maintained their value at LE 12 to LE 13 per kg. This month, eggs
dropped to LE 0.50 each from their LE 0.65 high maintained since May,
compared with LE 0.25 to LE 0.30 prior to the appearance of the flu last
winter. [Note the Egyptian pound is about USD 0.176, or just under 6 to the
US dollar]
WHO estimates Egyptians rely on poultry for 60 percent of their animal
protein intake.
"People need animal protein," Ali says. "People want meat; they want eggs.
So they are ready to break any law."

Through an increased focus on clinical and laboratory testing, the Romanian
poultry sector is confident it will be able to begin improving its
reputation -- which has been dented by a number of outbreaks of HN51.
Having now eradicated all outbreaks of Avian Influenza detected between
2005 and 2006, Romanian authorities quoted by Rompres News Agency believe
that after 2 years of combating the disease the country is currently in a
period of "epidemiological peace."
The announcement will be welcomed by meat processors in the country, who
have experienced a tough 2 years after being found to be the first European
nation affected by the virus.
Following the initial news that the disease had reached the country in
September 2005, the EU quickly banned all exports of living and processed
poultry goods from Romania into the bloc.
Though the disease has had no affects on humans, its constant reoccurrence
in wild birds throughout the country continued to keep Romanian poultry
from the lucrative EU market.
Recent tests however indicate that the country may have turned a corner in
preventing the spread of the disease however, with experts from the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) finding no new traces of
the disease.
Following 2 weeks of tests on while ducks and geese arriving in the Danube
Delta region, tests on 162 wild birds and 26 corpses were all found to be
free of the disease.

[Since the start of the H5N1 panzootic in 2004, the disease incidence in
avians was characterised by a seasonal pattern, peaking during the period
January - March. This justifies enhanced surveillance and precautionary
measures during the current and coming months. - Mod.AS]
