a. Influenza A(H1N1) - update 13 -- 4 May 2009
---------------
As of 06:00 GMT, 4 May 2009, 20 countries have officially reported
985 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection.

Mexico has reported 590 laboratory confirmed human cases of
infection, including 25 deaths. The higher number of cases from
Mexico reflects ongoing testing of previously collected specimens.
The United States has reported 226 laboratory confirmed human cases,
including one death.

The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with
no deaths - Austria (1), Canada (85), China, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (1), Costa Rica (1), Colombia (1), Denmark (1),
El Salvador (2), France (2), Germany (8), Ireland (1), Israel (3),
Italy (1), Netherlands (1), New Zealand (4), Republic of Korea (1),
Spain (40), Switzerland (1) and the United Kingdom (15).

There is no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of
well-cooked pork and pork products.

It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay
international travel and for people developing symptoms following
international travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance
from national authorities. Individuals are advised to wash hands
thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and should seek
medical attention if they develop any symptoms of influenza-like illness.

WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders.

United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia and El Salvador).

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 286 human cases
of influenza A (H1N1): 4 in Alabama, 17 in Arizona, 30 in California,
7 in Colorado, 2 in Connecticut, 20 in Delaware, 5 in Florida, 1 in
Idaho, 8 in Illinois, 3 in Indiana, 1 in Iowa, 2 in Kansas, 1 in
Kentucky, 14 in Louisiana, 4 in Maryland, 6 in Massachusetts, 2 in

Utah, 3 in Virginia and 3 in Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are
being investigated. One death has been registered, a child of 22
months old. The age range of the confirmed cases is from 22 months to 81 years.

From [17 Apr 2009 to 2 May 2009], Mexico has reported 727 confirmed
cases of influenza A (H1N1), including 26 deaths. The states with the

of them with recent trip history to Cancun, Mexico. All the cases
developed a mild form of influenza like illness. 2 of the cases
presented, in addition, gastrointestinal symptoms. All of them are
currently recovered and none required hospitalization.[see news brief
section below where there is a report of a severe hospitalized case
in Canada - Mod.MPP] Laboratory tests were conducted in Winnipeg,
Canada. Indigenous transmission is not discarded since not all the
confirmed cases have trip history to Mexico

(H1N1) On [3 May 2009], Colombia reported 1 confirmed case of
influenza A (H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed cases of

Dr. Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos, Federal Minister of Health:
Good morning. Happy to greet everyone. Thanks for being here.

Let me share with you the information we have so far of studies that
have been conducted and that have allowed us to proceed with the
confirmation or the discarding of the probable cases that had been
accumulating since the beginning of this event.

Until yesterday night [3 May 2009], we had 2164 samples processed, of
which 1922 were usable, [the others we have insisted be repeated and
some are in the process]. Of these 1922 adequate specimens, 727 cases
have been confirmed; as of this morning; at this moment we have 200
additional specimens that are in the process and I believe that today
we can report on the other 700. Hence, there are 727 cases positive
[for infection with influenza A(H1N1)]. Of these, 710 are alive and
26 have died.

The distribution of these positive cases, in total, including deaths,
indicate that 51.6 percent of cases were, or are (because most are
living), people from ages zero to 19 years, the majority (51.6
percent) are people in this age group.

I am also able to share with you that of the cases that have been
positively confirmed, there are cases from 26 of the states in the
Republic, although 7 of the states have only reported one confirmed
case. And, we have 6 states where no cases have been confirmed. case.

Also, in relation to a question that was posed to me a few days ago,
which referred to the R0, (ie the virus reproduction number, or
number of contacts of infected people that results in transmission of
the virus), so far, this index in Mexico is estimated at 1.4, with a
variability ranging from 1.3 to 1.8. In the case of seasonal
influenza, this rate is somewhat lower -- 1.3.

Also, I want to share that as of yesterday [3 May 2009] there have
been 68 997 preventive actions; 9675 consultations; 312 rapid tests,
with 278 negative and 34 positive. This is the report of the Health
Sector. And 60 patients have been referred [to higher levels of
attention] 20 to the Mexico General Hospital; 13 to the Juarez
Hospital 18 to Gea Gonzalez and 9 to hospitals of the Mexican
Institute of Social Security (IMSS).

The cumulative total of rapid tests that have been conducted is 5084
of which there are a total of 796 confirmed as positive [for
infection with influenza A(H1N1)].

The General characteristics of people who have died, out of 26, I can
also share with you that 17 were between 21 and 40 years of age, and
this is approximately the same as seen in general figures, that is
approaching the relation of men to women.

In the overall statistics, and almost similar, we have 49.1 percent
of cases are male and 50.9 of cases are female.

And to reiterate the downward trend of new cases we are looking at
this problem of the evolution of the epidemic.

Tonight there will be a Power Point presentation that will present a
more complete picture so you can see the graphs more clearly.

Thank you very much.

[Below are links to newswires with information on suspected cases (or
confirmed) in countries, and other events of potential interest. The
newswires are full of reports of suspected cases in many
countries. Reports have been filtered and discarded as more
information becomes available during the day. - Mod.MPP]

[To summarize the current situation, as of 4 May 2009 there have been
a total of 1085 cases and 26 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection
officially reported to WHO/PAHO coming from 21 countries, up from 898
confirmed cases and 20 deaths from 18 countries yesterday (3 May
2009). (According to the PAHO daily summary which was released later
than the WHO daily summary, there are now 1118 confirmed cases and 27
deaths attributable to A(H1N1) infection. This discrepancy is related
to the 6 hour time zone difference between WHO HQ [GMT] and PAHO HQ
[GMT -4] so that more reports from countries in the Americas region
time zone are included in the PAHO daily summary).

The USA has officially reported 279 laboratory confirmed cases and
one death coming from 36 states (compared with 226 cases from 30
states on 2 May 2009), and one death in a Mexican child visiting in
the USA. Canada has reported 140 cases from 8 provinces with no
deaths, up from 101 cases from 7 provinces on 2 May 2009. Mexico has
reported 727 confirmed cases with 26 deaths (compared with 506 cases
and 19 deaths on 3 May 2009).

Of interest, 51.6 percent of confirmed cases in Mexico are less than
20 years of age whereas 41.5 percent of the population in general is
less than 20 years of age, suggesting a higher representation of this
age group among cases (or higher age specific attack rate). The
press release from the Minister of Health of Mexico mentioned a
reproductive ratio (R0) of 1.4 with a range of 1.3 to 1.8 whereas the
observed R0 for seasonal influenza was 1.3 (the R0 refers to the
expected number of secondary infections seen in a population of
susceptibles from contact with a single individual during their
infectious period.) This slight increase in R0 suggests that the
A(H1N1) observed in Mexico is slightly more transmissible than
seasonal influenza (for an interesting discussion on R0 and
influenza, see the Global Security discussion on influenza
transmission available at
<http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3_flu-transmission.htm>.
