Girón, Sabana de Torres, Tona, Hato, Villanueva, Guaca, and Palmas del Socorro are the 7 municipalities of Santander [department] where the horse parades will not be found among the celebrations or fairs during the next weekends.

The Secretary of Agriculture of Santander, Javier Sarmiento, told Vanguardia.com that 7 new cases of equine influenza type A, detected in Piedecuesta, Lebrija, Los Santos, Suaita, and Guadalupe, require extreme sanitary measures.

The official added that the Colombian Agricultural Institute, ICA, asked the mayors and the Governor "to cancel horse concentrations because direct contact is the main means of transmitting the disease." However, the measure will not affect equine exhibitions.

Those who fail to comply with the measure, Sarmiento clarified, "will surely be sanctioned with the Police Code. [Authorities] will be on hand to avoid mobilizations."

The official noted that the ban on horse parades will continue until the end of August [2018] "and depending on how the disease progresses we will take the appropriate measures."

The presence of influenza, in addition to affecting the fair activities, generates economic losses to the owners of the affected animals "because they must treat them and the treatments are expensive."

The Secretary of Agriculture explained that the disease is only transmitted to horses, mules, and donkeys, and does not harm the health of humans.

The symptoms that animals present include, "mucus discharge, decreased physical performance, lack of appetite, and difficulty in breathing," Sarmiento added.

The Colombian Agricultural Institute, ICA, declared Quindío [department] in quarantine for 25 days, after more than 40 positive cases of equine influenza type A were registered. According to the latest report presented by the entity, the reports come from all municipalities in the department. (see also "Suspect cases of equine influenza are reported in Quindío" http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-nueve-casos-sospechosos-de-influenza-equina-en-el-quindio-nota-122513).

"The ICA has been reporting cases of equine influenza in the municipalities of Quindío; pool samples of nasal secretions and sera obtained from an animal with respiratory signs and other contacts compatible with type A influenza have been taken, with positive results," says resolution 00029979 through which quarantine is declared.

Mauricio Arango Isaza, president of the Horse Breeders and Horse Development Association of Quindío, Cabaquín, told "La Crónica" in recent days that as a preventive measure the 2 events that would take place in the coming days had already been suspended.

"Although it is not a deadly disease, it puts the animals in suboptimal conditions, requiring costly treatments for the animals to recover. It should be noted that this is not a situation that is taking place only in Quindío, but also in different departments of the country."

So far, cases of the disease are being treated in Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Antioquia, Boyacá, Caldas, Cundinamarca, Tolima, Atlántico, Quindío, and the latest reports were recorded in Santander, where 6 cases were confirmed [7, according to the report in item [1] above].

Signs
-----
Equine influenza, according to the ICA, is a viral disease that affects only equines -- horses , donkeys, and mules -- and its control is important, as it is highly contagious and generates economic losses for producers.

Measures during quarantine
--------------------------
The ICA established cleaning and disinfection measures for facilities and barns, as well as the notification of all cases with unusual respiratory signs.

The Umata [municipal agricultural technical assistance units], health service, the guilds, and clubs that promote equine production should carry out epidemiological surveillance, to detect eventual cases of influenza type A in a timely manner.

The entry and exit of equidae destined for concentrations is prohibited. "The owners and/or administrators of the farms are obliged to allow ICA officials to enter and facilitate the taking of samples required to achieve an opportune diagnosis of the disease." The violation of the measures will result in a sanction by the ICA.
