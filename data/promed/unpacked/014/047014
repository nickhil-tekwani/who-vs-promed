Teagasc (Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority) is confirming that barley yellow dwarf (BYD) is now impacting many spring barley crops across the country. Symptoms are apparent, but so far only very small percentages of plants seem to be affected.

They are confirming that weed control is well underway with advanced crops already having received 2 herbicide applications.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, triticale (wheat-rye hybrids), and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat, but oats are particularly susceptible. Grain yields may be reduced severely. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Yield reduction is most severe if infection occurs at the seedling stage. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry (-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and (English) grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means; they cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs ("green bridge"). Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors. The latter would be aided by the weed control measures mentioned above.
