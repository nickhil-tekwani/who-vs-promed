The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has linked 5 past
cases of Legionnaires' disease -- reported between March 2010 and
August 2011 -- with stays at Marriott's Frenchman's Reef and Morning
Star Beach Resort and Marriott's Frenchman's Cove [in Saint Thomas],
prompting remediation work to the resorts' water systems. The VI
[Virgin Islands] Health Department has been "working closely" with a
team of CDC specialists to monitor the remediation efforts at the
resorts, after an investigation into the 5 past cases, according to a
statement the Health Department released Monday [12 Dec 2012].

The illness was found in stateside residents who had been guests at
the resorts, said Health Department spokeswoman Eunice Bedminster.
They required hospitalization but have since recovered, she said.
There have been no reports of employees affected at either site,
according to the Health Department statement.

The statement indicates that Frenchman's Reef and Morningstar Beach
Resort has hired a consultant who led a cleaning project of the
affected areas and treated the water system. Test results show no
existence of _Legionella_ bacteria, although the Health Department
statement said the test results have not yet been evaluated
independently by the CDC.

The Health [Department] had asked the resorts to notify those who
could potentially be affected by the bacteria: guests and employees,
Bedminster said. The properties asked for an extension on a deadline
that had been set, and it was granted, but the deadlines passed last
week [week of 5 Dec 2011] without the notification to guests and
employees going out, Bedminster said. She did not know if, after the
deadline, the properties had made the requested notifications, she
said.

The hotel provided The Daily News with a written statement that did
not address guest notification: "Marriott takes hotel hygiene and
cleanliness very seriously. As soon as we were notified of the
possibility of the presence of _Legionella_ bacteria we immediately
began to work with the USVI Department of Health (DOH) to address the
situation. The Frenchman's Reef and Morning Star Beach Resorts hired a
consultant who led a cleaning project of affected areas and the
treatment of the water system. The latest test results taken after the
implementation of these measures show no existence of _Legionella_
bacteria in the samples tested. We have complied with the
recommendations provided by the DOH, and we have successfully
addressed the issue at the resort. The DOH has allowed the hotel to
remain fully open for business and welcome our guests."

The Daily News spoke with Marriott Frenchman's Reef and Morning Star
Beach Resort General Manager Jose Gonzalez Espinosa by phone and asked
for comment on the Health Department's assertion that the resort did
not make the notifications it was supposed to make by the deadline.
Gonzalez would not answer the questions unless they were in writing.
The Daily News has a policy against submitting questions in writing
because written Q and A stifles and slows follow-up and response. The
resort underwent a major renovation during the summer, closing 3 May
2011 and reopening on 6 Oct 2011.

Legionnaires' disease is a pneumonia caused by the _Legionella_
bacteria, which live in warm water supplies, said Dr Lauri Hicks, a
medical epidemiologist with the CDC. The bacteria that cause the
disease do not pass from person to person. "It really requires
exposure to water aerosol that contains _Legionella_," she said,
Exposure may occur from showering or with time spent in a whirlpool or
hot tub where the bacteria that lead to Legionnaires' disease are
present, Hicks said.

Only a fraction of people -- typically those with certain risk
factors, such as compromised immune systems -- exposed to the bacteria
become ill, she said.

According to the Health Department statement, from 2000 through 2009,
a total of 22 418 cases of legionellosis were reported to CDC from the
50 states and the District of Columbia. The CDC informed the Health
Department in October [2011] of the 5 Legionnaires' disease cases
among past guests at the resorts, and the Health Department asked for
the agency's help in investigating. From 18 to 22 Oct 2011, CDC
specialists conducted testing, and the properties were alerted about
the possible _Legionella_ contamination, Bedminster said. On 3 Nov
2011, the Health Department notified each property of the CDC's
conclusive findings and ordered them to immediately work on their
water systems, including cleansing, superheating, chlorinating, and
hiring a private consultant experienced in eliminating _Legionella_
from building water systems, according to the release. More than 6
weeks later, the Health Department notified the public with the
statement it released Monday [12 Dec 2011].

Bedminster said that there had been no delay -- and that remediation
work began immediately. "We have worked in good faith with both the
resorts during what I have said was a monitoring process. We had some
agreed-upon deadlines that had not been met, so we had to let the
public know," she said.

Bedminster said that Health Department officials had discussed the
possibility of enforcement actions with the Department of Labor and
the Department of Planning and Natural Resources to get those
deadlines met, but she did not know the outcome of the discussions.
"Safeguarding the public's health, including that of employees and
guests, from exposure and threats are of the utmost importance to the
Department of Health," acting Health Commissioner Mercedes Dullum said
in the prepared statement. "DOH will continue to monitor this
situation with assistance from the CDC. People should not be
discouraged from traveling to or within the US Virgin Islands."

[The following has been extracted from the US CDC document
Travel-Associated Legionnaires' Disease
(http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm):

"About 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is
travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and
to report because its identification implies the presence of an
environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely
to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with
travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by
individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically
disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.
Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients
with community-acquired pneumonia and _Legionella_ testing should be
performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of
symptoms.

"_Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the US,
national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of
travel-associated Legionnaires' disease. CDC relies upon state and
local health departments to conduct this surveillance. Surveillance
through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)
is still important for monitoring national trends; all cases should be
reported through NNDSS."

"Because of the public health importance of timely reporting, inform
CDC of travel-associated cases by emailing about the patient's
movements in the 2-10 days before onset."

"Environmental sampling/testing should only be conducted after careful
consideration of the epidemiologic evidence linking a case(s) to a
particular location."

The following article is linked to the CDC document: Barbaree JM, et
al: Protocol for Sampling Environmental Sites for Legionellae. Applied
Environmental Microbiol 1987; 53(7): 1454-8
(http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/files/sampling_protocol1987.pdf):
"Since legionellae not related to disease may be found in many of the
sites sampled, an epidemiologic association with the probable source
should be established before intervention methods, such as
disinfection, are undertaken."

"Random sampling without an epidemiologic evaluation and comparing
isolates from the environment and from patients could lead to false
conclusions about sources of epidemic strains."

Potential environmental sampling sites for _Legionella_ spp that the
CDC document suggests include: internal surfaces of faucets, aerators,
and shower heads; and water from incoming water main, holding tanks
and cisterns, water heater tanks, decorative fountains, irrigation
equipment, fire sprinkler system (if recently used), whirlpools, and
spas. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without
linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be
demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates
with that of any clinical isolates to assure frequently costly
corrective measures are carried out on the actual source

The Virgin Islands are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser
Antilles, which form the border between the Caribbean Sea and the
Atlantic Ocean. Politically, the eastern islands form the British
Virgin Islands and the western ones form the United States Virgin
Islands. The US Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Saint
Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas
