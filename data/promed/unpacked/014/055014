A total of 10 people were taken to hospital after inhaling chemicals released from a fish tank in an Oxfordshire village.

The "potentially toxic" fumes were emitted from coral being cleared from an aquarium at a house [on] Hanney Road, Steventon, on [Mon 26 Mar 2018] evening.

About 50 emergency services personnel attended, including a hazardous area response team and 3 ambulances.

Scientist Dr Mike Leahy said the people were probably exposed to "palytoxins" released by the coral.

Up to 6 members of a family and 4 firefighters were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and 3 family members were kept in overnight after suffering "flu-like symptoms" and eye irritation.

TV presenter Dr Leahy said he was caught inside the police cordon while visiting his mother, who lives on the same road.

He said after hearing about what happened he realised the coral was likely to have released "palytoxins" that can be "incredibly lethal".

"In the main they're absolutely harmless but sometimes if you stress certain types of coral, they can produce a toxin," he said.

He added that "if ingested it can be lethal" but inhaling fumes was far less dangerous.

A total of 2 dogs were also removed from the house and the remaining coral was dealt with by firefighters in "full body cover, gas-tight suits".

Police officers remained at the scene overnight and windows were left open to ventilate the house.

Owen Hughes said on Twitter local residents were "told to stay indoors" by police but they were "not in any danger".

[Palytoxin is a potent vasoconstrictor that acts on the cellular sodium-potassium pump, which can lead to cell death (4). It causes a range of effects in animals and humans, depending on the route of exposure (5,6). The dose at which 50 percent of exposed animals die following intravenous administration of palytoxin (LD50) has been shown to be as low as 0.033 Âµg/kg body weight (6). Higher concentrations are required to cause effects following incidental contact depending on whether the exposure occurs through dermal, inhalation, or oral routes (5). Based on reports in the medical literature (7) and online forums (3), most aquarium-related exposures occur after subjecting zoanthids to prolonged handling and appear to be related to inhalation or to skin exposures through cuts on the hands and fingers in persons who maintain these types of aquariums. Throughout the Mediterranean region, palytoxin exposure has been linked to fever, conjunctivitis, and respiratory symptoms in persons exposed to marine aerosols during proliferations of palytoxin and palytoxin-like compound-producing marine algae (i.e., algal blooms) (5), but detailed inhalation studies in animal models are lacking. No antidote is available for palytoxin; treatment is supportive.

Zoanthids (Class Anthozoa, Subclass Hexacorallia, Order Zoanthidia [colonial anemones]) are common in home aquariums. They are considered relatively easy to keep and are often recommended to new aquarium owners. Some types of colonial anemones form large aggregations encrusting a hard substrate. In an aquarium, these aggregations often require thinning or removal. Because of the way these organisms attach to surfaces, aggressive methods are sometimes required for their removal, including cutting, scraping, applying chemicals, or scalding with hot water, which lead to an increased potential for palytoxin exposure, often through the presumed production of aerosols (7). Other potential exposure routes include direct contact with eyes, through skin lesions, and incidental ingestion. Although not all zoanthids contain palytoxin, some zoanthids commonly found in home aquariums contain high concentrations of this toxin (2). Some coral enthusiasts appear to be able to maintain them without ill effects, likely through proper handling, aquarium management, and decontamination practices. Palytoxin can be neutralized by soaking the coral for 30 minutes in a 0.1 percent or higher household bleach solution (1 part 5-6 percent sodium hypochlorite [household bleach] to 10 parts water, prepared fresh) (8). Contaminated items should be soaked in diluted bleach before disposal (3).

Palytoxin is known to some coral hobbyists (3), and some aquarium shops display signs warning that some coral might be very toxic. However, no U.S. regulations govern the testing or labeling of coral that might contain toxins, including palytoxin. Regulations for the importation of corals currently enforced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pertain to endangered species and reflect ecological concerns (9). General recommendations on coral handling and decontamination practices would be helpful for hobbyists, commercial coral growers, and the public health and clinical provider communities.

Currently, no official evidence-based recommendations exist for proper personal protective equipment use for coral hobbyists and aquarium shop staff, and development of such recommendations might be helpful. Activities that could potentially produce aerosols (e.g., scrubbing or using hot water to remove zoanthids) should be undertaken with caution. Until data from controlled inhalation experiments in an animal model are available, this apparent link between palytoxin and inhalation toxicity will remain associative and evidence-based recommendations on appropriate respiratory protection or handling best practices will not be possible.
