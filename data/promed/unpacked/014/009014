The Fresno County Department of Public Health (FCDPH) confirmed Friday [23 Sep 2022] the 1st positive case and death of the year [2022] from St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) in Fresno County.

The virus is a mosquito-borne disease that can produce inflammation of the brain.

SLE is contracted by humans from infected mosquitoes and originates from an avian illness, which is then spread after a mosquito bites an infected bird.

The virus has been found in California in the past, however, since the introduction of West Nile Virus to California in 2003, the SLE virus has been less commonly detected.

"This positive case and unfortunate death is a strong reminder that everyone should take preventative measures to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites in order to prevent vector-borne diseases," said Fresno County Interim Health Officer Dr. Rais Vohra in a news release Friday.

Symptoms of SLE appear abruptly and include fever, headache, dizziness, nausea and weakness. Symptoms tend to worsen over the period of up to a week.

Most patients recover with mild or no symptoms, however, some patients develop signs of central nervous system infections.

Symptoms of an advanced case of SLE include stiff neck, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, tremors and general unsteadiness. Cases of SLE may also result in a coma.

Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent SLE.

The FCDPH recommends residents prevent the possibility of mosquitoes by limiting standing water sources -- a common breeding ground for mosquitoes -- and utilizing mosquito and insect repellent to prevent potential exposure.

[This is the 3rd human case of St Louis encephalitis virus infection that ProMED has posted in 2022, all in California. The 1st posted case was in Stanislaus County and was confirmed on 13 Jul 2022 (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) 20220715.8704435). The 2nd case was in Tulare County. St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus is sporadically active in California. There were 5 human cases in 2020 in the state (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) human, mosquito, 2020 20210105.8071912).

The US Centers for Disease Control reports that most people infected with the SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults. Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
