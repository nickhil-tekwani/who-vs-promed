I have some comments regarding the item cited below, Poliomyelitis,
vaccine associated - Taiwan: susp 20060808.2226.
Comments:
1. What is the diagnosis? Vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis
(VAPP) is anterior horn cell disease. Neurones are
lysed/phagocytosed, identical to wild virus poliomyelitis in
pathology. This child had another pathologic process from the data
provided. Where was the lesion? In peripheral nerves? Was it
polyradiculopathy, in which case we would have expected CSF protein
content to rise. Was it polyneuritis? Can vaccine virus cause polyneuritis?
2. Can oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses cause Guillain Barre syndrome
(GBS)? According to the US Institute of Medicine report (JAMA 1994;
271: 1602-1605. Stratton KR et al) for OPV: "evidence establishes
causal relation" for poliomyelitis (VAPP) and death due to it.
"Evidence favors acceptance of a causal relation" for GBS. So, OPV
can cause GBS, in all probability. In the past, GBS due to wild
polioviruses might have been missed. I have investigated such cases,
but tended to discard wild virus as the cause; GBS was not being well
investigated those days. This was in the 1960s and 1970s.
3. Sabin viruses may do strange things in the central nervous system.
In a monkey model, we found Mahony (parent of vaccine type 1 virus,
highly neurovirulent) to cause typical poliomyelitis after ulnar
nerve inoculation (References: Vaccine 1992; 10: 529-532. John TJ et
al. J Gen Virol 1998; 79: 2393-2403. Ponnuraj EM et al.). Sabin type
1 virus, surprisingly, passed from neurone to neurone in the spinal
cord without lysis (non-productive infection) and without
inflammation or neuronophagia, and no paralysis. (Ref. J Gen Virol
2001; 82: 1329-1338. Ponnuraj EM et al). [The latter paper can be
accessed at
<http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/6/1329>. - Mod.MPP]
4. While provocation polio is well known (from the 1950s, when
children given DTP in the UK had some 30 times higher incidence of
polio within the next 30 days), what is less well known is another
form of provocation called "aggravation" polio (Ref. Wyatt HV, I do
not have ready reference but can find it if needed by someone.
Perhaps Wyatt HV Current Science 1997; 73: 402-403). Here, a child
gets polio due to wild virus within 48 hours of intramuscular
injection. Always starting in the injected limb, it may or may not
progress to other limbs and is very well recognized in India prior to
prevention by immunization. The explanation is different from the
slow process of provocation polio. Here, the virus may already be in
the spinal cord, but a non-paralytic disease is perhaps converted to
a paralytic disease?
5. What has surgery got to do with this? Similar tissue
irritation/damage/inflammation as in provocation/aggravation? Here,
the aggravation picture fits. Could Sabin virus type 2 have been
present in a non-productive manner in the central nervous system
(CNS)? Could the surgery have aggravated the lesion in nerve cells?
(This is quite different from tonsillectomy and bulbar polio, wherein
direct invasion by the virus via nerve endings in the pharynx to
bulbar region of CNS is invoked as the mechanism).
In conclusion, we must conclude polio eradication and stop using OPV
everywhere as soon as possible, the sooner the better for children everywhere.

[ProMED-mail would like to apologize for the delay in posting Dr. T.
Jacob John's commentaries. Dr. John raises many of the questions that
have been around for years related to key issues in poliomyelitis
pathology and prevention and have posed challenges for the polio
eradication effort. Below are some selected references that deal with
the issue of "provocation poliomyelitis" for those readers who may
wish to learn more.
Dr. John's last sentence deserves highlighting; the sooner
eradication of polio can be accomplished, the sooner these issues
become a mute point.
