The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Germany recently informed EPPO of the 1st detection of _Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (CBCVd - EPPO A2 List) in Germany. The viroid was found in 2 hop (_Humulus lupulus_) fields in Bavaria in July 2019 after a report by a grower.

Infected plants (150 in the 2 fields) showed reduced growth. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. A survey is being performed to determine the extent of the outbreak, and official phytosanitary measures will be applied to eradicate the outbreak.

[_Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (genus _Cocadviroid_, CBCVd; previously _Citrus viroid IV_) is one of at least 7 viroids of family Pospiviroidae known to occur in citrus hosts. In 2015, hop was reported for the 1st time as a new host in Slovenia (ProMED-mail post 20150708.3494568) when CBCVd was found to cause a new disease of the crop that spread extremely rapidly. Symptoms included yellowing and distortion of leaves, reduced cone production, severe stunting, and death of affected plants. Phytosanitary measures applied in Slovenia had failed to stop the spread of the disease; stricter measures were adopted recently (see link below).

While _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd; genus _Hostuviroid_) was also present in some symptomatic plants in Slovenia, it was not identified as the cause of the new disease. However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of its presence at low levels. Multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement of disease). Synergistic coinfections of CBCVd with a number of other viroids have been shown to lead to high plant mortality in hops (see links below). Vegetative propagation, which is used, for example, for hops and citrus, increases the risk of a buildup of these pathogens in a crop.

Most viroids, including CBCVd, can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants or cuttings. Disease management of viroids may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.
