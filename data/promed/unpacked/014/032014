A non-commercial 118-bird flock in Port Angeles [Clallam County], Washington, infected with highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza, was euthanized [Sun 18 Jan 2015], according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture [WSDA].

WSDA spokesman Hector Castro said the flock's owner contacted the agency last week [week of 12 Jan 2015] after a Sebastopol goose, a domestic species, died. Other birds, which included chickens, showed signs of sickness, Castro said.

WSDA and US Department of Agriculture [USDA] officials confirmed Friday the flock was infected with bird flu. The USDA will compensate the owner.

Castro said the flock's owner recently sold birds that were introduced to a flock in Neah Bay, also in Clallam County on the Olympic Peninsula. Birds in that flock tested negative for bird flu, he said.

The flock was the 3rd in Washington to fall victim to highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu. The 2 other flocks, which are about 9 miles [14.5 km] apart in Benton County, remain under quarantine.

Guinea fowl and chickens in a backyard flock in Winston in Douglas County, Oregon, were euthanized in mid-December [2014] after highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu broke out. H5N8 and H5N2 viruses are closely related. Until last month [December 2014], highly pathogenic bird flu had never been documented in Washington or Oregon.

A wild duck in Whatcom County, Washington, and one in Butte County, California, were confirmed as having been infected with highly pathogenic bird flu. A captive falcon in Whatcom County fed [on] a hunter-shot duck died of bird flu.

The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service posted a short notice on its website that highly pathogenic bird flu had been found in a backyard flock in Idaho. Further details were not immediately available Mon [19 Jan 2015]. Many government offices were closed for Martin Luther King Jr Day [19 Jan 2015].

Officials suspect migratory waterfowl are spreading the disease. The virus has not been detected in US commercial flocks, but its appearance in backyard flocks has brought restrictions on US poultry exports.

The 28-country European Union on [Mon 19 Jan 2015] banned poultry products from Washington, Douglas County in Oregon, and Idaho. Japan and Belarus added Idaho to previous bans on poultry from Washington and Oregon.

China on [Fri 16 Jan 2015] announced that US poultry shipped to that country after [9 Jan 2015] will be rejected and destroyed.

Castro said WSDA plans to establish a quarantine zone around the premises where the Port Angeles flock lived.

He said WSDA and USDA officials have tested birds from 66 premises close to the infected flocks in Benton County. No new cases of bird flu have been found, he said.

Officials are urging bird owners to prevent contact between their flocks and wild birds.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza strikes Idaho for the 1st time, in backyard chickens, captive falcons, and wild ducks in western and southern Idaho, State Veterinarian Bill Barton said [Tue 20 Jan 2015].

Several wild ducks infected with H5N8 avian influenza were found in Gooding County, while the falcons and chickens in a small non-commercial flock were infected with H5N2 in Canyon County.

Barton said the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game found the diseased wild ducks after stepping up surveillance of wild waterfowl because of bird flu cases in Washington, Oregon, and California.

Officials suspect migratory waterfowl are introducing the closely related H5N2 and H5N8 viruses to North America, Europe, and Asia.

"Most of Idaho is certainly part of the Pacific Flyway," Barton said. "It wouldn't be surprising to find more wild birds infected."

The 3 falcons confirmed to have had the virus were fed wild duck, Barton said. The owner has other falcons, which are under quarantine and are being tested, Barton said.

The chicken flock was about 20 miles [32 km] away, he said. The owner had not been moving birds off the property, Barton said.

The premises were immediately put under quarantine, and the birds were euthanized.

Since mid-December [2014], 3 non-commercial flocks in Washington and 1 in Oregon have been infected with highly pathogenic bird flu. Wild birds with the disease have been found in Washington, California, and Utah.

Bird flu has not struck any US commercial flock, but 245 600 birds at 11 infected British Columbia, Canada, poultry farms were culled from 1 to 17 Dec 2014.

Barton said he knew of no other case of highly pathogenic bird flu ever in Idaho. A less contagious strain of low pathogenic avian flu was found in a southwestern Idaho game bird farm in 2008.

Barton urged domestic bird owners to keep their flocks away from wild waterfowl.

Avian influenza symptoms include coughing, sneezing, respiratory distress, decreased egg production, swelling of the head, comb, and wattles, and sudden death.

Barton urged Idaho producers who observe bird flu signs to call the Idaho State Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian's office at 208-332-8540 or the USDA at 1-866-536-7593.

Sick or dead wild birds should be reported to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game at 208-454-7638.

[The migratory pathways of birds are extensive and cover hundreds of thousands of miles in some cases. These pathways are likely responsible for similar or exact strains of the flu being found in parts of Asia as well as in the Pacific Northwest.

Preventing contact of domestic birds with migratory wild birds is important to reduce and eliminate this flu. It should be remembered that some strains of flu can be transmitted by human carriers as well.
