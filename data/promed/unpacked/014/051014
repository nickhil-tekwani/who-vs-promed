Citrus canker found in Tampa rea
Agriculture officials are considering a quarantine after confirming an
outbreak of canker, a deadly citrus disease with no cure, in the Ruskin
area.
The site is a row of fruit trees near a senior citizens condominium in Sun
City Center. State crews have surveyed a 25-square mile area around the
site and found no indication that the disease has spread. "The question now
is whether we should quarantine an area up there," Leo Hebb, chief of pest
eradication and control for the state Division of Plant Industry, said
Monday.
"We're going to keep surveying that area as far north as Apollo Beach, and
if we detect more disease we're going to have to quarantine," he said.
Canker spreads easily and is impossible to cure. To prevent its spread
infected trees are burned or buried.
Canker produces ugly lesions on leaves, stems and fruit and causes fruit to
fall from trees. The lesions make it just about impossible to sell the
fruit. Officials aren't certain whether the outbreak is related to a South
American strain that began spreading from Miami in 1995 or a recurrence of
an Asian strain that spread from Palmetto between 1986 and 1994.

[According to information published by plant pathologists at the University
of Florida, Gainsesville, citrus canker, caused by the bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar citri, has been in Florida for many
years. The disease was first detected in 1910, but went unrecognized as
such for several years. A quarantine to prevent importation of all citrus
was initiated in 1915. The disease was officially eradicated in Florida in
1933 and from the United States in 1947. In 1986, the Asian strain of
bacterial citrus canker was detected in residential citrus plantings in
Hillsborough, Pinellas, Sarasota, and Manatee Counties, and in commercial
plantings in Manatee and Highland Counties. Eradication was completed in
1992 and Florida was officially declared free of the disease in 1994. A
third outbreak occurred near the Miami International Airport in 1995,
followed by another in Manatee County in 1997 which was attributed to
undetected infected trees remaining from the earlier outbreak. Subsequent
outbreaks occurred near Immokalee in southwest Florida in 1998. followed by
the current outbreak near Ruskin. Eradication of infected and exposed
trees remains the only practical means of managing the disease. - Mod.DH
