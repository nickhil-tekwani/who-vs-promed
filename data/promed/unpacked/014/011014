Uruguay: 3 Cases in Department of Rocha
------------------------------------------
On 16 Aug 2004, the Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay reported 3 cases
of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), all from the Department of Rocha in
the area bordering on Brazil.

The 1st case came from a consultation made on 12 Aug 2004 involving a
38-year-old man, [whose condition progressed to] a severe respiratory
profile followed by death. Serological tests were positive for hantavirus.
The patient had been camping outdoors to go fishing and hunt nutrias
(_Myocastor coipus_) in the area around Banados de Arroyo San Miguel (near
Chui and the Brazilian Border), Rocha Department, Uruguay.

The other 2 cases involve the man's 2 children (ages 6 and 12), who on 12
Aug 2004 were brought in for medical attention, one for acute respiratory
syndrome requiring hospitalization and the other with a flu-like profile.
The results of serological tests on both were positive for
hantavirus. Both children are recovering.

The Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay has initiated public-awareness
activities for the general public on prevention and control measures for
hantavirus.
