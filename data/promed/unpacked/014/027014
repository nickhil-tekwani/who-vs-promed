Effects of Measles-Control Activities; African Region, 1999-2005
----------------------------------------------------
In 1999, of approximately 871 000 deaths from
measles worldwide, 61 percent occurred in
sub-Saharan Africa (1). In 2001, countries in the
World Health Organization (WHO) African Region
began an accelerated measles-control program to
reduce by half by 2005 the number of deaths that
were caused by measles in 1999 (2). The African
Region accelerated measles-control program was
based on 4 strategies: improving routine
vaccinations; providing a 2nd opportunity for
measles vaccination through a routine, 2-dose
vaccination schedule or through supplementary
immunization activities (SIAs); improving measles
case management; and establishing case-based
surveillance with laboratory confirmation for all suspected measles cases.
Seven countries in the region had already
completed catch-up SIAs by 2000, before the
regional program began; in 2001, additional
countries in the region began implementing
catch-up, and later, follow-up SIAs, and steps
were taken to improve routine vaccination
coverage with measles vaccine and other vaccines
in the Expanded Programme on Immunization
schedule. This report summarizes the nationwide
SIAs and other measles-control activities
conducted in the WHO African Region during the
period 1999 to 2004, analyzes the trends in
reported measles cases since 1990, and compares
the annual number of measles cases reported in
2005 with those reported in 1999.
Immunization Activities
-----------------------
WHO and UNICEF publish annual country-specific
estimates of routine measles vaccination
coverage; these estimates are based on reviews of
vaccination coverage surveys, national reports,
administrative coverage data, and consultation
with regional and local experts (3).
According to these estimates, coverage with 1
dose of measles vaccine in the African Region
among children aged 12-23 months increased from
52 percent in 1999 to 67 percent in 2004. In
2004, 37 of the region's 46 countries were
estimated to have coverage rates >60 percent, and
17 countries were estimated to have coverage rates >80 percent (4).
By 2000, 7 countries in the African Region had
completed national catch-up SIAs, and during the
period December 2001 to December 2004, 25
additional countries completed national catch-up
SIAs. Ten of these 32 completed national
follow-up SIAs. Measles vaccination coverage
rates during these SIAs were >90 percent, except
for the catch-up SIAs in Republic of the Congo
(78 percent), Eritrea (82 percent), Ethiopia (87
percent), and Gabon (80 percent) and the
follow-up SIAs in Lesotho (75 percent), Swaziland
(81 percent), and Zimbabwe (85 percent). By
December 2004, a total of 207.9 million children
in 32 countries had been targeted by catch-up
SIAs, which is 69 percent of the population of
children aged <15 years in the African Region.
During the same period, 16.1 million children
aged 9 to 59 months in 10 countries were targeted
by follow-up SIAs, which represents 14 percent of
the population of children aged <5 years in the African Region.
Measles Surveillance
--------------------
Since the 1980s, the annual number of
country-specific measles cases has been reported
by the country's ministry of health each year to
WHO's Regional Office for Africa. Before
implementing catch-up SIAs, all countries
reported measles cases to WHO through routine
infectious disease information systems that
provided aggregated data. The cases reported
through this surveillance system were not
laboratory confirmed; they were reported on the basis of clinical suspicion.
After conducting their catch-up SIAs, countries
began implementing a case-based surveillance
system with laboratory confirmation of suspected
measles cases. In this system, each case is
reported using an individual case-report form,
and a blood specimen is obtained for measles
immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing at a national
laboratory. When a cluster of 3 or more cases
from a health-facility catchment area has been
confirmed, subsequent cases from that area are
considered confirmed by epidemiologic linkage,
and blood samples are not collected. The quality
indicators used for the case-based surveillance
system include the proportion of reported cases
with a blood specimen (goal: 80 percent of cases
not confirmed by epidemiologic linkage) and the
proportion of districts reporting at least one
suspected case with a blood specimen per year
(goal: 80 percent). For Niger and Tanzania, the
total number of cases with a blood specimen was
<80 percent of the aggregate case total, so
aggregate case totals were used for analysis. For
all other countries, blood specimens were
obtained for >90 percent of reported cases.
Analysis of Surveillance Data
-----------------------------
Countries were grouped according to the year in
which they conducted their catch-up SIAs; number
of reported cases by country group and year
during the period 1990 to 2005 were calculated
(These data are presented as a figure which
cannot be reproduced here and should be consulted
in the original document. Of the Group A
countries [Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia,
South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe], 6
completed catch-up SIAs by December 1999, and the
7th completed its catch-up activities by the end
of 2000; these countries had a
measles-elimination goal rather than a
mortality-reduction goal (5). Group B consisted
of 25 countries [Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon,
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia,
Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Republic of
the Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo,
Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia] that completed
nationwide catch-up SIAs during the period
December 2001 to December 2004. Group C consisted
of 8 countries [Central African Republic, Chad,
Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and
Nigeria] that did not begin catch-up SIAs before
March 2005 (except for SIAs in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo conducted in 2002 and 2004,
which collectively targeted approximately half of
the country's population aged <15 years).
The number of reported measles cases in Group A
and Group B countries, which have all completed
their SIAs, began decreasing steadily as SIAs
were conducted (illustrated in the figure in the
original document). No decline was evident in the
Group C countries; not all areas have been
covered by SIAs, and yearly fluctuations in the
number of measles cases have been observed.
In countries that completed SIAs, the total
number of suspected measles cases decreased 93
percent, from 202 972 in 1999 to 14 284; 1999 was
chosen as the year for comparison because it is
the baseline year for the measles
mortality-reduction goal, and the initial
catch-up SIAs in all countries other than the
Group A countries were conducted after 1999. The
number of cases in 1999 was obtained from
aggregated reports of cases that were diagnosed
on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms; few
of these cases have laboratory confirmation, and
they include other diseases consistent with the
clinical case definition of measles (e.g.,
rubella). In 2005, after establishment of
case-based surveillance, cases were confirmed by
a laboratory or through epidemiologic linkage;
confirmed case totals were available for all
countries except Gabon, Liberia, Mauritania, and
Sierra Leone. In 2005, aggregate data also were
used for Niger because case-based surveillance was not fully operational!
in the country. Tanzania reported 713 possible
cases through the case-based system, but because
blood samples were obtained from <80 percent of
cases, aggregate data were used in the
calculations. Countries with no report for 1999
(Gabon) or 2005 (Madagascar) were excluded from the calculations.
To maintain consistency in the case definition,
clinically suspected measles cases reported in
2005 (i.e., which include cases not counted later
after they had negative IgM serology results)
were used in the calculations. The 93 percent
decrease during the period 1999 to 2005 in
suspected cases demonstrated substantial progress
in countries that have implemented accelerated measles-control activities.
To minimize the effect of using a single year as
a baseline for a disease with cyclic epidemics,
reports of suspected cases in 2005 also were
compared with the average number of cases that
occurred during 3 years (1998-2000). When the
3-year average was used as a baseline (N = 200
683 cases), reported cases also decreased 93 percent.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The results of this report indicate a consistent
and marked decrease in the number of measles
cases reported from the WHO African Region
country groups that completed nationwide measles
catch-up SIAs during the period 1996 to 2004.
These countries have experienced a >90 percent
reduction in clinical measles cases in 2005
compared with 1999. In contrast, the number of
reported cases continued to vary widely by year
in the group of countries that had not completed
nationwide catch-up SIAs. Although countries do
not report measles deaths to WHO, an analysis of
country-level data from 13 countries in the
African Region that completed nationwide catch-up
SIAs during late 2001 to early 2002 documented
that the percentage reduction in reported deaths
from measles was similar to that for reported cases of measles (6).
The use and analysis of surveillance data in this
report suggest that case-based measles
surveillance with laboratory confirmation in the
African Region is providing useful information for monitoring program effects.
The increase from 2988 cases in 1999 to 3626
cases in 2005 from countries in Group A is
largely a result of the increase in cases
reported from South Africa. For example, in 2000,
South Africa reported 117 confirmed measles cases
(5), compared with 609 in 2005. During the period
2003 to 2005, South Africa experienced a large,
nationwide measles outbreak involving 1676
confirmed cases, the result of measles
importation from Mozambique and failure to
vaccinate enough of the population to prevent endemic measles transmission.
The data in this report are subject to at least 2
limitations. First, data from a single year were
used to estimate changes in a disease that has
cyclic epidemics. However, when the average
number of reported cases that occurred during the
period 1998 to 2000 (compared with 2005) was used
instead of data from 1999 only (compared with
2005), the percentage reduction was similar.
Second, the system used for reporting cases
changed in most countries; in 1999, the countries
used aggregated reporting of clinically diagnosed
cases, but in 2005, most reported
laboratory-confirmed cases. Therefore, numbers of
suspected cases reported in 2005 were used to
estimate the decrease in cases during 1999-2005,
which might have led to an even greater decrease.
In addition, although the case definition for
suspected measles remained the same, the change
from the aggregate (in 1999) to the case-based
system (in 2005) of reporting might have resulted
in underreporting (because of the additional t!
asks of individual case reports and blood
samples) or overreporting (because of increased
awareness of measles surveillance after SIAs).
By December 2005, approximately 87 percent of the
population aged <15 years (267.2 million
children) in the countries in the African Region
had been targeted by catch-up SIAs. In 2006,
nationwide catch-up SIAs are focusing on the
areas that have not yet been covered, including
29 million children in southern Nigeria and 7
million children in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. Successful control of measles in the
African Region will depend on conducting
high-quality campaigns (i.e., campaigns that
achieve >95 percent coverage) in these areas. At
the same time, countries should continue to
improve their routine immunization services,
maintain high coverage with follow-up SIAs every
3-5 years, improve measles case management, and
monitor their success by using case-based
surveillance with laboratory confirmation to
control measles and reach the global goal of reducing measles mortality.
