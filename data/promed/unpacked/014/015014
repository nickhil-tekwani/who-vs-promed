Adopted by APS in 1994

Whereas, The American Phytopathological Society (APS) is a professional
organization whose origin was based on the role of plant diseases in famine
and poverty,
Whereas, The APS recognizes that the continuing increase in the world's
human population and the continuing need to increase food production and
availability represent major problems confronting the world,
Whereas, The APS recognizes that the Earth has a finite carrying capacity
for the human species, that agricultural technology has a finite capacity
for meeting the needs of the growing human population, and that resource
consumption represents a basic cause of human suffering and degradation of
the environment, and
Whereas, The APS recognizes that rapid human population growth is itself
exacerbated by poverty and inequity,
Be it resolved that The American Phytopathological Society accepts the
following statements:
1. The APS acknowledges that increasing food production is a necessary, but
by no means sufficient, condition to reduce world hunger.
2. The APS and its members reaffirm their commitments to encourage research
and education to develop and produce healthy plants, to control diseases of
plants, and to accomplish these tasks with a maintenance of the Earth's
environment and natural resources.
3. The APS will facilitate efforts to educate its members concerning
relationships among poverty, hunger, and human population growth.
4. The APS will play an active role in reminding governments and the public
of the extreme challenges posed by the current, rapid rate of human
population growth and the causal factors that determine human population
growth.
5. The APS strongly supports efforts by government and private agencies to
take action toward the challenges posed by the current, rapid rate of human
population growth.
6. The APS strongly supports international development policies and
programs that address the needs of the poorer sectors of society, that
contribute to improved economic and social equity (including women's
rights), and that promote the development of sustainable societies.
7. All nations of the world, developed and developing, make contributions
to global problems. None has the right to dictate solutions to others, and
none alone has the ability to identify the most effective solutions. Thus,
the APS pledges technical guidance and rapid transfer of information to the
international community and will join with colleagues of different nations
and of different scientific disciplines to seek world solutions to global
problems such as hunger, poverty, human population growth, and
environmental degradation.
