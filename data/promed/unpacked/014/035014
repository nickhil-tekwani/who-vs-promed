ANTHRAX, IMPALA - TANZANIA (SERENGETI)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Mon, 9 Mar 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>

While visiting the Serengeti National Park last week, I was given permission
by Dr. Titue Mlengeya to report an outbreak of anthrax in impala which
occurred during the latter part of February, killing between 1,000 and 1,200
animals. The outbreak was controlled by burying the carcasses and burning
the land over the fill.
