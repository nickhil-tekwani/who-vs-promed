El Salvador: Outbreak of Rotavirus-associated Diarrheic Disease
---------------------------------------------------
According to our review of the information available on acute diarrheic
syndrome in El Salvador, the incidence of diarrhea is less than it was in
2002 and 2003. On the other hand, taking into account that the number of
samples analyzed by the Central Laboratory has not varied significantly
with respect to 2003, we can observe an increase in the percentage of
positive results for rotavirus.
Up to Epidemiological Week (EW) 7 (21 Feb 2004), the Central Laboratory
studied 233 samples and obtained positive results for rotavirus in 48.4
percent of them. During EW 7 alone, 133 samples were analyzed, resulting in
53 percent of those positive for rotavirus.
A total of 108 confirmed cases have been reported of rotavirus-associated
diarrhea, of which 86 percent have occurred in children under 2 years of
age. The Departments most affected have been Santa Ana (with 58.3 percent
of the cases) and San Salvador (with 20.4 percent). To date, no deaths have
been reported.
To deal with this situation, epidemiological surveillance had been
strengthened through the daily monitoring of hospital admissions and deaths
from acute diarrhea. Efforts are underway to provide reagents for the
diagnosis and identification of the strain currently in circulation.
The primary mode of transmission for rotavirus is fecal-oral. The virus is
stable in the environment and can remain viable for an extended period,
which favors transmission from contact with contaminated surfaces, water,
or food. Any prevention and control measures taken should take these
aspects into account.
No specific treatment exists for diarrhea. At present, 2 vaccines are being
investigated (testing currently in Phase III), with preliminary results
promising in terms of effectiveness and safety. The main strategy in the
event of outbreaks is based on reducing mortality from diarrhea, which is
generally caused by the accompanying dehydration. Approximately one out of
every 40 children with rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis will require
hospitalization for administration of intravenous fluids. Compliance with
norms for oral rehydration, as contained in the tried-and-tested IMCI
(Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) recommendations, is extremely
important. For more information, see the PAHO directories on IMCI and
Diarrheal/Enteric Diseases.

A Variant Norovirus linked to Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Europe in 2002
-------------------------------------------------
A new variant of norovirus is the likely culprit for the severe outbreaks
of gastroenteritis in 2002, including those on U.S. cruise ships, states a
study reported in this week's issue of The Lancet [see below for details].
Ben Lopman from the U.K. Health Protection Agency and his European
colleagues analyzed data about viral gastroenteritis in 10 European
countries. They found that an increase in norovirus outbreaks in
England/Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2002 coincided with the
detection and emergence of a new norovirus variant, which [carried a novel
mutation] in the polymerase [protein gene].
"Our combined data from 10 European countries shows that the striking
increase and unusual seasonal pattern of norovirus gastroenteritis in 2002
arose concurrently with the emergence of a new virus variant," Lopman
stated in a prepared statement. "Had these observations been made in one
country, they could be dismissed as aberrations in surveillance, the result
of changes in ecological circumstances, or because of the local circulation
of a new variant. However, the data collected within our network lend
support to anecdotal reports of an increase of an important infection and
have allowed us to present a feasible virological explanation for the
effect on public health," Lopman stated.

[The following is the abstract of the paper referred to in the above report
published in The Lancet, 363: 682-88, 2004 entitled "Increase in viral
gastroenteritis outbreaks in Europe and epidemic spread of new norovirus
variant" by Ben LLopman and 25 others from 13 institutions in 10 European
countries
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol363/iss9410/abs/llan.363.9410.original_research.28848.1>
The Abstract:
"Highly publicised outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis in hospitals in
the UK and Ireland and cruise ships in the USA sparked speculation about
whether this reported activity was unusual.
We analysed data collected through a collaborative research and
surveillance network of viral gastroenteritis in 10 European countries
(England and Wales were analysed as one region). We compiled data on total
number of outbreaks by month, and compared genetic sequences from the
isolated viruses. Data were compared with historic data from a systematic
retrospective review of surveillance systems and with a central database of
viral sequences.
3 regions (England and Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands) had sustained
epidemiological and viral characterisation data from 1995 to 2002. In all
3, we noted a striking increase in norovirus outbreaks in 2002 that
coincided with the detection and emergence of a new predominant norovirus
variant of genogroup II4, which had a consistent mutation in the polymerase
gene. 8 of 9 regions had an annual peak in 2002 and the new genogroup II4
variant was detected in 9 countries. Also, the detection of the new variant
preceded an atypical spring and summer peak of outbreaks in 3 countries.
Our data from 10 European countries show a striking increase and unusual
seasonal pattern of norovirus gastroenteritis in 2002 that occurred
concurrently with the emergence of a novel genetic variant. In addition to
showing the added value of an international network for viral
gastroenteritis outbreaks, these observations raise questions about the
biological properties of the variant and the mechanisms for its rapid
dissemination."
The investigators postulate that this new variant might be more virulent or
environmentally stable than previous viruses and suggest further work
should focus on whether the disease caused by the new variant causes more
severe symptoms in patients or higher attack rates. In a Commentary, Carl
Kirkwood suggests that key public-health issues in controlling norovirus
infection are that few particles are required to cause infection and
norovirus can be excreted for some time after resolution of symptoms. - Mod.CP]
