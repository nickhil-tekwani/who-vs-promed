Measles outbreak in Germany: over 1000 cases now
reported in Nordrhein Westfalen
-----------------------------------------------
The reported number of measles cases linked to
the current outbreak in the federal state (Land)
of Nordrhein Westfalen, in the west of Germany,
has now risen to over 1000 [1]. Between 1 Jan and
3 May 2006, 1018 cases were notified to the
health authorities, and this number is believed
to be an underestimate, as some cases are not
notified or are not diagnosed.
In recent weeks, the number of notified measles
cases has been stable at around 120-140 cases per
week. No significant decrease has yet been
observed during the school holidays. Particularly
efficient transmission has been noted in the
Nordrhein region, where 56 cases of measles per
100 000 inhabitants have been reported in the
city of Duisburg, 33 per 100 000 inhabitants in
the district of Wesel and 53 per 100 000
inhabitants in the district of Monchengladbach.
Age distribution
----------------
School-age children are still the main group
affected, representing over 60 percent of all
reported cases. There have been 252 cases
reported in children aged 10-14 years, 198 cases
reported in children aged 15-19, and 186 cases
reported in children aged 5-9. 64 cases in
children under one year old have also been
reported (data presented as a histogram in the
original text).
Vaccination status
------------------
The majority of patients have not been vaccinated
against measles. According to current data, only
25 patients (2.5 percent) had received a full
course of vaccination against measles (2 doses of
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine).
Complications
-------------
About 15 percent of the patients required
hospital admission. 2 cases with serious
complications (measles encephalitis) have been
reported. Other reported complications include 20
cases of lung infection and 17 middle-ear
infections.
Laboratory diagnostics
----------------------
About 1/3rd of cases have been laboratory
confirmed by detection of virus-specific
antibodies or by PCR. As has already been
reported, the outbreak in Nordrhein Westfalen is
caused by the D6 measles virus, which is the same
strain that is currently causing a large outbreak
in the Ukraine [2]. It is not yet known whether
there is any link between cases in the 2
countries. The D4 strain of the virus has been
found in samples from 2 patients, suggesting that
there are at least 2 parallel infection chains in
Nordrhein Westfalen.
Current control measures
------------------------
The Nordrhein Westfalen state public health
authority is keeping all local health authorities
informed of the situation and are urging actions
to increase vaccination coverage in areas where
it is low. All local authorities have been
supplied with information for distribution to
schools, nurseries, parents and doctors.
Questionnaires for use when notifying cases have
also been supplied. It has been recommended that
patients or their parents/guardians be
interviewed to establish the patients' likely
infection source.
Further recommendations
-----------------------
Implementation of vaccination campaigns: The
checking of the vaccination status of all members
of the public and the offering of vaccination to
those found to be unprotected are recommended.
Healthcare workers within local communities are
being encouraged to offer prophylactic
vaccination to all patient contacts. Local
authorities should contact all schools and
nurseries within the affected areas and
distribute information to all teachers, parents,
nurseries and pupils. Also recommended are 14-day
isolation of susceptible members of a household
of a measles patient from community settings,
with re-introduction after post-exposure
vaccination, avoidance of contact with patients
with confirmed measles outside the household, the
informing of local media of an outbreak situation
and the submitting of samples from measles
testing to the health authorities for testing.
At the invitation of the Nordrhein Westfalen
authorities, the Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin
has assisted with interviewing 1200 people and
determining the vaccination status at a school in
Duisburg, where there were 37 patients. Current
studies aim to determine the contribution of
areas of low coverage to the outbreak, and
vaccination records are being studied. All
patients whose records show that they are not
protected will receive an information leaflet
provided by the Deutsches Grunes Kreuz e.V. (DGK,
<http://www.dgk.de>).
The Nordrhein Westfalen state health authorities
are also carrying out a telephone survey of all
known patients in Duisburg. This survey will
provide data needed to compile comprehensive
information on the extent of the outbreak,
illness length, possible infection sources and
transmission routes.

[2] Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis - Germany

Children Affected with Fatal Measles Complication
-----------------------------------------------
[The cases of SSPE described in this article have
no relationship with the current measles outbreak
in Nordrhine-Westfalia described in the preceding
report (part 1). - Mod.CP]
Two children have become ill with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) independently
from the current outbreak of measles in
Nordrhine-Westfalia (see part 1 above). The
course of this later measles stage markedly
resembles Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, states Sean
Monks from the Federal Association of
Pediatrician and Adolescent Physicians. SSPE is
always fatal. Children who had measles in their
early years are stricken. Many years later, they
come down with the disease. The children have
vestibular dysfunction and speech difficulties.
They have difficulty with memory and mobility.
Six children with SSPE are now known in
Nordrhine-Westfalia:
- A 2-year-old in Datteln came down with measles
in 2005 during a trip to Turkey. The course of
the disease is unusual, since SSPE usually
develops 7-10 years after the initial infection;
- A 10-year-old from Bochum came ill with SSPE,
whose initial measles infection was at the age of
2 in 1998;
- Others known to be stricken with SSPE were from
Bielfeld (2) and one each in Cologne and Siegburg.
As for the current measles epidemic, a 7-year-old
in Leverkusen was stricken with measles
encephalitis. The number of newly ill with
measles during the past week was 66.
Further measles outbreaks have been reported in
England, Spain, Greece, Romania, the Ukraine,
Denmark, and Sweden. The pediatric association
urgently recommends that children receive their
vaccination in the 1st 2 years.
A lot of criticism has arisen from the measles
outbreak in Nordrhine-Westfalia. Professor
Heinz-Josef Schmitt from the University of Mainz
and the chairman of the standing committee on
vaccination criticizes the German vaccination
program for the lack of goals and success
measurements. The German Physicians Meeting in
Magdeburg recommended a mandated measles
vaccination. A majority of the 250 delegates
voted for a motion in which it was stated that
Germany is among the countries of Europe with the
highest measles morbidity. It was further
recommended that only children with complete
vaccination status be permitted to enter
state-financed nurseries, kindergartens, and
schools. The physician councils should take steps
to professionally restrict those colleagues who
continue to speak out against recommended
vaccinations.

[Complications of acute measles virus infection
are relatively rare, and the majority result from
opportunistic secondary infection of necrotic
surfaces. The most severe complications of
measles virus infection are giant cell pneumonia
and measles inclusion body encephalitis, both of
which occur in the immune compromised, and
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in
which no underlying susceptibility factor has
been identified. Male children are more likely to
develop SSPE, but the overall incidence is low
(usually estimated as about 2 to 7 cases per 100
000 cases of acute measles). - Mod.CP]
