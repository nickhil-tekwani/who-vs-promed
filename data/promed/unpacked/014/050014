Guardians, other caregivers and health care providers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of enterovirus EV-D68, which has now been confirmed in 39 children in New York State. The Department's Wadsworth Laboratory is the only laboratory in the state that can confirm EV-D68. Results are being shared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist in monitoring the circulation of the virus nationally.

EV-D68 infection most commonly results in mild symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, cough, body aches and muscle aches. Severe symptoms, while less common, may include wheezing and difficulty breathing. In some rare instances, the virus can cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a serious condition that causes weakness in the arms or legs. However, there are other causes of AFM besides EV-D68, and severe respiratory illness is a greater concern with this virus. NYSDOH reports suspect cases of AFM due to EV-D68 to CDC for further investigation, and no cases have been confirmed in New York State in 2018 thus far.

In general, infants, children and teenagers are most likely to get infected with EV-D68 and become ill because they do not yet have immunity from previous exposures to enteroviruses. Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms.

"All parents must take simple steps to protect their children, especially those who are immune-compromised or have respiratory problems, to avoid becoming infected," said New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. "We will continue to work with our partners at the CDC and local health departments to make sure that all New York families have the information they need to prevent their children and others from getting the virus."

Small numbers of EV-D68 have been reported regularly in the U.S. since 1987. Individuals are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. Because a mix of enteroviruses circulates every year, different types of enteroviruses can be common in different years.

In summer and fall 2014, New York and other states witnessed an outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory illness. From mid-August 2014 to 15 Jan 2015, the CDC or state public health laboratories confirmed a total of 1153 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Almost all of the confirmed cases were among children, many of whom had asthma or a history of wheezing. Additionally, there were likely many thousands of mild EV-D68 infections for which people did not seek medical treatment and/or get tested. This was the 1st documented nationwide outbreak of EV-D68.

Recent cases in NYS have been confirmed among individuals who reside in Western and Central New York, the Capital Region and Long Island, and specimens have been received from other regions for specialized testing at Wadsworth.

Enteroviruses are transmitted through close contact with an infected person, or by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. There is no specific treatment for EV-D68 infections other than management of symptoms, and no specific anti-viral medications are currently available for this purpose. It is important to take steps to protect yourself and others from all respiratory infections, including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick.
Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick.
Use the same precautions you would use to prevent the spread of influenza.

These prevention steps are especially important for individuals or persons with family members who are infants, or who have chronic health conditions or compromised immune systems.

["Enterovirus (EV) D68 was 1st isolated in 1962 in Berkeley, California, the United States.[1] Four children had severe respiratory tract infection and pneumonia associated with EV D68. In 2014, there was an outbreak of EV D68 infection occurred in the United States.[2] Another outbreak of EV D68, B3 lineage, occurred in Sweden in 2016.[3] Most of them suffered from respiratory tract symptoms, whereas some patients had severe respiratory infection that required endotracheal intubation and intensive unit care. Among them, a few polio-like acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases presenting as acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have also been reported in the literature.[1-3] Mortality due to AFM caused by EV D68 is very low[3]; however, the prognosis was guarded. Many patients continued to experience sequelae of flaccid paralysis, or even bowel or bladder dysfunction.

[Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses.] Enteroviruses are small single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family. EV D68 is a unique genotype that differs slightly from most EVs because it shares several physiochemical properties with human rhinoviruses.[1] EV D68 differs from other EVs in its temperature sensitivity. It grows in cell cultures at 33 C instead of 37 C. Therefore, it has mainly been isolated from respiratory samples and has very rarely been reported in stools.

EV D68 infection in children causes a wide range of respiratory disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, severe pneumonia, or even respiratory failure.[1,4-7] Healthy adults usually experience a milder range of respiratory symptoms. Cough and fever are common symptoms of EV D68 infection. The risk factors for severe respiratory disease, both in children and adults, are an immunocompromised state, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma.[1,4,5,7] The neurological features of EV D68 infection, including AFP due to AFM, present in both children and adults.

Early general clinical management of children with AFM should be the basic standards of care for children with severe neurological disease, and physical and occupational therapy should be attempted as soon as the child is stable in physical condition to optimize functional outcomes. Treatment with IVIG and/or pulse steroid therapy may be considered earlier to improve the corresponding prognosis."

Health Advisory: Enterovirus D68
Excerpted from New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Bureaus of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) and Healthcare Associated Infections (BHAI):

"EV-D68 can be detected in respiratory specimens, (such as nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs) and testing should be considered in patients with severe respiratory illness, particularly those with a positive enterovirus or enterovirus/rhinovirus detection, as well as in patients with neurologic disease and a positive enterovirus detection. Infection with enteroviruses can be identified by direct immunofluorescent staining on primary specimens or cultured viral isolates, or by molecular assays. Many molecular assays available at hospital, clinical, and commercial laboratories can detect enteroviruses, such as the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel or GenMark ePlex Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel, but they cannot distinguish the enterovirus type.

The Department's Wadsworth Center Laboratories can perform typing for EV-D68 by conventional RT-PCR and dideoxysequencing.

Healthcare professionals in healthcare settings should be vigilant about preventing the spread of EV-D68. Infection control precautions should include Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions. Although non-enveloped viruses such as EV-D68 may be less susceptible to alcohol than enveloped viruses or vegetative bacteria, alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) offers benefits in skin tolerance, compliance, and, especially when combined with glove use, overall effectiveness for a wide variety of healthcare pathogens. Therefore, upon removal and before donning personal protective equipment, perform hand hygiene using either ABHR or soap and water.

There is no specific treatment, including antivirals, currently available for people with illness caused by EV-D68. Patients who are hospitalized with severe respiratory illness may need to receive intensive supportive therapy." - Mod.LK
