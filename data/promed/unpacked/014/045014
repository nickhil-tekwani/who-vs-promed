Between 28 Mar 2005 and 12 Feb 2006, 1722 [officially documented] cases of
chikungunya have been notified by physicians from a sentinel network in
Reunion Island, including 326 [equal to approx. one-fifth of officially
documented] cases reported during the week 6 to 12 Feb 2006.
Estimations from a mathematical model indicate that 110 000 people [64-fold
more] may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 in Reunion,
including 22 000 persons [68-fold more] during the week 6-12 Feb 2006.
During the 1st week of February [2006], other countries in the southwest
Indian Ocean have reported cases: Mauritius (206 cases) and the Seychelles
(1255 cases).
Because of the extensive outbreaks in the region, WHO is planning to send a
team from the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and headquarters [Geneva] to
assess the control measures under way. These include anti-vector [anti-
mosquito] activities; an extensive public health education campaign using
mass media to sensitize the population about protective measures; and
reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance and vector surveillance. The
team will discuss a sub-regional strategy for surveillance and control of
chikungunya and other arboviruses with national authorities. They will visit
Reunion, Madagascar, Mauritius and coordinate with the AFRO vector control
mission to the Seychelles.
Chikungunya, a viral disease, is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes,
typically _Aedes aegypti_, although there may be other competent mosquito
vectors. The name chikungunya comes from the Swahili for stooped walk,
reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease. The disease
has been described in Africa, Southeast Asia, southern India and Pakistan. It
occurs principally during the rainy season [when the mosquito vectors are most
active].
Chikungunya is rarely fatal. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the
patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito. A high fever and headache
occur, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists) and can persist
for several weeks. The main preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of
mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds.

[The numbers officially notified to WHO are much much lower than those of
local health authorities as reported by the media and WHO's own estimation.
This is because Reunion's sentinel physician network is made up of a subset
of collaborating physicians rather than being a statutory island-wide system.
Statutory systems often have only a variable amount of compliance; sentinel
networks usually have better reporting frequency and participation, when they
are made up of physicians interested in reporting and prepared to devote their
precious time to it. - Mods.RY/JW]

The toll in the Indian Ocean island of Reunion from a mosquito-borne virus
that causes crippling pain in the joints is likely to reach 100 000 by week's
end, the minister for France's overseas territories, Francois Baroin, said.
"We will probably reach the figure of 100 000 cases of chikungunya in Reunion
by the end of the week," he said.
Baroin added that the tally of cases in the island of Mayotte, a French
overseas territory in the Comoros Indian Ocean archipelago, was expected to
rise to more than 500.
"The state has devoted very substantial resources" to combatting the outbreak,
Baroin said.

[A chikungunya outbreak has started to emerge in Comoros although not as
severe as in Reunion. A bit of geographic information may help readers have a
general idea of Comoros. Comoros, except Mayotte, gained independence from
France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their
independence from Comoros. In short, Comoros is formed by 3 of the 4 main
islands in the Comoros Archipelago; the 4th is the French territory of
Mayotte. The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, between northern
Madagascar and northern Mozambique. For more details see also:

[If there is CHIK in Mayotte, the outbreak must still be ongoing in the
Comoros Islands also, where it began in April 2005 -- see ref. below. We await
an update. - Mod.JW.]

[3] Reunion, deaths

Nearly 100 000 people have been infected this year by a mosquito-borne virus
that has killed at least 4 on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion,
France's health minister said Friday [17 Feb 2006].
So far this year [2006], 4 people have died from chikungunya virus [infection]
and another 48 people have died from causes linked to the virus, the Health
Ministry said in a statement.
It was the first time officials have confirmed deaths
related to this outbreak of the virus, which is usually
not life-threatening but can cause muscle and joint pain,
rash and fever. No vaccine [is available].
The numbers released Friday mean the disease has affected
14 percent of the 700 000 people living on the island, a
popular resort destination for tourists from the French
mainland.
Health Minister Xavier Bertrand said 110 000 cases of chikungunya had been
reported since monitoring began after an outbreak last March [2005], but that
just 12 400 were recorded in all of 2005. "That means we have nearly 100 000
cases only since the beginning of 2006," he said on France-Info radio. [No,
it doesn't. The 100 000 figure is an extrapolation from the 12 400, reported
by WHO -- see [1] above. - Mod.JW]
A virus expert at France's Pasteur Institute, Herve
Zeller, called the outbreak "not normal," blaming the
rapid spread on high numbers of mosquitoes and a
particularly virulent strain of the virus.
He said that while most people recover from the highly
contagious virus in a week or so, some continue to suffer
severe joint pain for several months.
Some 2400 soldiers, emergency workers and others are
fighting the virus by spraying the island's mosquito
population, the ministry said. The French government has
sent 17 doctors, 30 nurses and 65 hospital beds to the
island, but critics say that is inadequate to fight the
fast-spreading virus.
The virus has disrupted life on the small tropical island,
east of Madagascar. Officials have delayed the return to
school after the summer holidays, planned for this month,
and blood banks have stopped taking donations on Reunion.

[Chikungunya is normally not life-threatening. But the unusually wide
spread of the mosquito-borne viral infection and the 4 confirmed
resultant deaths reported in Reunion Island has got virologists, such as Herve
Zeller from Pasteur Institute, wondering if a virulent virus variant
is to be blamed. The sad fact is that it is not unusual, when an outbreak of a
normally non-fatal disease affects thousands, to get a small number of related
deaths, usually involving people with depressed immune systems. The thousands
of cases can be explained by the fact that the virus has entered a virgin
population, and the mosquito vector population is exploding because of the
rains. There is no need to postulate increased virulence. - Mods.RY,JW]
