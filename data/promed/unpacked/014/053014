Re: Yellow fever - Paraguay: (San Pedro)
----------------------------------------
This development [occurrence of yellow fever in central Paraguay] is
naturally of major concern to Paraguay and the health authorities
there are obviously taking the situation very seriously.

From the perspective of travel health advice to visitors to the
region, unlike the recent human yellow fever cases in Goias, Mato
Grosso do Sul and the Distrito Federal in Brazil (ProMED-mail
20080205.0461) and confirmed or suspected cases in monkeys in far
north-western Sao Paulo, Brazil (ProMED-mail 20080205.0461) and
Misiones in Argentina (ProMED-mail 20080205.0459), the confirmed
human case from near San Estanislao [San Pedro department] in
Paraguay, which is apparently northeast, not north of Asuncion (see
map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/paraguay.pdf>) is
in an area not included in the yellow fever endemic zone of the
Americas as depicted in the valuable resource provided by the CDC [US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for traveler's health
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-YellowFever.aspx>) nor
does the WHO [World Health Organization] recommend yellow fever
vaccination for travelers to this region of Paraguay
(<http://www.who.int/ith/countries/pry/en/>).

No doubt these authorities will update their guidelines in light of
these developments, particularly if more human yellow fever cases
occur despite the efforts of the local authorities. Details on the
location and recent travel history of the several confirmed and
suspected cases in Paraguay are clearly very important facts.

As commented by the moderator, the increase in yellow fever activity
in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay is serious indeed. Travelers to
the affected areas should be advised of the higher than usual risk of
infection, and the apparent extension into previously non-endemic
areas. Recommendations for yellow fever vaccination (and against
travel for patients who cannot safely receive the vaccine for
whatever reason) must take these recent events into consideration.

[Dr Cowie makes an important point. Yellow fever (YF) virus is being
transmitted in central Paraguay as well as areas mentioned in Brazil
and Argentina. Hence, it is prudent for travelers to these areas be
vaccinated against yellow fever. The risk of serious YF virus
infection is outweighed by the risk of adverse reaction to the
vaccine itself in healthy, immunocompetent individuals. The CDC
Yellow Book YF risk maps are currently under review due to these
recent YF cases. - Mod.TY]
