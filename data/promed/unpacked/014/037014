Emergence of a new GII.17 norovirus variant in patients with acute gastroenteritis in Jiangsu, China
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[By Fu J, Ai J, Jin M, Jiang C, Zhang J, Shi C, Lin Q, Yuan Z, Qi X, Bao C, Tang F, Zhu Y]

Summary
-------
From September 2014 to March 2015, 23 outbreaks of norovirus (NoV) acute gastroenteritis occurred in Jiangsu [province], China. Partial sequencing of the NoV capsid gene suggested that 16 of the 23 outbreaks were related to a new GII.17 variant. This variant was 1st detected in sporadic specimens in October 2014, and became predominant in February 2015. Analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and complete capsid including the protruding domain P2 sequences confirmed this GII.17 variant as distinct from previously identified GII variants.

Background
----------
It is estimated that each year NoV cause 64 000 episodes of diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation and 900 000 clinic visits among children in industrialised countries, and up to 200 000 deaths of children under 5 years of age in developing countries.

NoVs are classified into 6 genogroups, GI-GVI, of which genogroup I, II, and IV are responsible for disease in humans. Genogroups are subdivided further into genotypes. To date, based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capid gene sequences, 31 and 22 genotypes of GII NoVs have been respectively determined. Of these, GII.4 caused at least 6 epidemics of gastroenteritis worldwide over the past 20 years (1995-1996, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2012) with the emergence and rapid global spread of viral variants. In contrast, GII.17 NoV has rarely been reported as a major genotype causing diarrhoea.

In late 2014, the Emergent Public Health Event Information Management System (EPHEIM) in Jiangsu province observed an increase of NoV outbreaks compared with previous seasons. Data from these outbreaks indicated that this increase was associated with the emergence of a new variant of GII.17, which was rarely reported in China before 2014. Surveillance of NoV in both outbreak and sporadic cases was conducted from September 2014 to March 2015 to study the molecular epidemiology characteristics of GII.17-associated diarrhoea in Jiangsu province, China.

Results
-------
Phylogenetic Analysis
The Region A and complete VP1 region of 8 GII.17 variants (3 specimens from 3 respective outbreaks and 5 sporadic specimens) were further compared with other GII.17 strains by phylogenetic analysis.

In the tree based on Region A, the GII.17 strain characterised in 1978 grouped with a GII.4 Rpdp, forming Cluster I. This cluster appeared to be ancestral to GII.17 sequences reported after 2003. The GII.17 variants identified in the period from 2004 to 2011 formed Cluster II and the variants originating from 2013 to 2015 formed Cluster III. Sequences from Cluster II and Cluster III shared a high nucleotide identity with GII.3 reference strains, especially those in Cluster III (Figure 3a).

In the tree based on the VP1 gene, the GII.17 variants from 1978 to 2002 formed Cluster I, those from 2005 to 2009 formed Cluster II and those from 2013 to 2015 formed Cluster III.

All of the 8 GII.17 variants reported here from Jiangsu province were in Cluster III and grouped with GII.17 strains from Taiwan (KJ156329, 2013) and Japan (AB983218, 2014) in both the polymerase- and VP1 region-based trees.

Twelve GII.17 capsid protein VP1 sequences from 1978 to 2014 were aligned, including 9 GII.17 sequences released previously in the GenBank database and 3 sequences from representative strains obtained in our study. Sequence data showed that amino acid (aa) differences occurred mostly in the protruding P2 domain (Figure 4), particularly at aa 295-297, 376, 398-400 and 414 which form the predicted antibody binding regions in variant GII.4; epitope A (aa 295-297, 376), epitope D (aa 398-400) and epitope E (aa 414) [14]. In addition, some of the GII.17 strains, including the new GII.17 strains reported here, had a K289R mutation in the alert RGD/K-like motif, located at positions 287-289 [15]. In the 3 histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding sites, a single aa change (H353Q) at site I and a single aa (D380) insertion peripheral to site II occurred in the outbreak representative strains [16].

Discussion
----------
Through the web-based surveillance system EPHEIM, increased levels of NoV activity were detected in late 2014 compared with previous season in Jiangsu province, China. Our findings suggest that this coincided with the emergence of a novel GII.17 variant, which caused most (16/23) of the NoV outbreaks reported between September 2014 and March 2015 in the province. Due to unavailability of laboratory data from 4 outbreaks in March, the number of GII.17-associated outbreaks could have been underestimated.

The novel variant was 1st noted in October of 2014, and spread rapidly throughout the province, causing an increasing number of outbreaks. During the course of the winter and early spring it became the predominant cause of NoV outbreaks replacing the GII.4 Sydney variant starting from December 2014. Newly identified emerging variant that become predominant have been previously reported, in particular GII.4 variants, and these can also be associated with atypical increases in the incidence of acute gastroenteritis. In Jiangsu province for example, an earlier dominant variant, GII.4-2006b, had been replaced by GII.4 Sydney in 2012/13.

Based on the surveillance of NoV sporadic cases in this study, while the number of NoV GII.4 Sydney cases decreased in January 2015, sharp increases in the number of GII.17 cases were observed in February and March. In these 2 months the detection rate of NoV-positive specimens among specimens of sporadic cases of gastroenteritis also increased.

Phylogenetic analysis of GII variants, including GII.17 strains obtained in this and other studies, suggests that RNA recombination, a significant driving force in viral evolution led to some characteristics of the novel GII.17 variant reported here. In the RdRp phylogenetic tree obtained in this study, the GII.17 strains formed 3 Clusters. Cluster I comprised the only GII.17 strain reported before the year 2000 as well as a GII.4 variant. Cluster II and Cluster III contained RdRp sequences of GII.17 strains, all found after 2003, and which additionally shared a high nucleotide identity with GII.3 reference strains characterised in the 1990s, especially those in Cluster III, leading to hypothesise that the new GII.17 variant may be a recombinant strains with a GII.3-like RdRp gene and a GII.17 capsid gene. Interestingly, most GII.3 strains detected in the 2000s were recombinant strains, possessing a non-GII.3 RdRp genotype.

The VP1 protein P2 domain is the most exposed region of the viral particle and is well positioned to interact with potential neutralising antibodies and HBGA ligands. Mutations in this domain may have a significant effect on virus receptor binding and the host immune response to viral infection and mutations in the P2 domain were observed in the new GII.17 variant. We speculate that, through the accumulation of mutations at several sites in the P2 domain, a new antigenic variant of the GII.17 lineage which gains the potential to escape herd host immunity could occur eventually.

The limitation of our study was that our results were not from nationwide surveillance but from Jiangsu province, accounting for only 5.4 percent of the total China population. However, a similar situation to the one reported here was observed in 2012/13 with the emergence of the GII.4 Sydney variant, which was 1st detected in a NoV outbreak in late 2012, and soon afterwards led to large increases in NoV activity nationwide.

Conclusion
----------
The new GII.17 variant which emerged in October 2014 appears to have subsequently increasingly caused NoV outbreaks in Jiangsu province, China. This study reveals that the variant presents a number of mutations in the P2 domain of VP1. Simultaneous dominance by GII.17 in outbreaks and sporadic infections indicates that this genotype might be established in Jiangsu Province. Nationwide surveillance for NoV outbreaks will be needed to understand epidemiological or outbreak trends related to the emergence of relatively rare GII.17 variants.

[Norovirus infection in China, and the Far East in general, is encountered mostly as severe gastroenteritis in children rather than as a 'vomiting disease' affecting the general population in winter. Partial sequencing of the norovirus capsid has indicated that 16 of 23 recent outbreaks were related to a new GII.17 virus. The new GII.17 variant, which emerged in October 2014, appears to have subsequently increasingly caused NoV outbreaks in Jiangsu province, China. Analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and complete capsid including the protruding domain P2 sequences confirmed this GII.17 variant as distinct from previously identified GII variants. - Mod.CP
