Escherichia coli O157. J. Med. Microbiol. 35, 107-110.
"Inclusion of ... cefixime ... improves the selectivity for the isolation
of VT+ E. coli O157."
2. Proulx et al. (1992). Randomized, controlled trial of antibiotic therapy
for Escherichia coli O157:H7 enteritis. J. Pediatrics 121, 299-303.
Tested trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in children. "no significant effect of
treatment on progression of symptoms, fecal pathogen excretion, or
incidence of HUS"

antibiotics on extracellular Shiga-like toxin I. Infection 20, 25-29.
"Patients with diarrhea due to strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia
colie (EHEC) (e.g. O157:H7) might be at a higher risk of developing
hemolytic uremic syndrome when treated with antimicrobial agents. It has
been suggested that this might be due to an increase of release or
production of vero or shiga-like toxin from such organisms, possibly as a
stress response to antimicrobial agents."
and "There were significant differences between the five EHEC strains in
the amount of toxin detected after exposure to antimicrobial agents (P <
0.001). Equally important was the type of antibiotic (P < 0.001), with
ciprofloxacin inducing the largest increase ranging from 169 to 436%,
followed by co-trimoxazole, cefixime and tetracycline. In addition the
increases in free toxin correlated with the concentration of the
antibiotics (P < 0.001)."

coli O157:H7 in Washington Sate, 1984-1991. J. Infect. Dis. 170, 1606-1609.
Resistants to some 15 common antibiotics were tested. "All 56 isolates
collected between 1984 and 1987 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested;
13 (7.4%) of 176 strains isolated between 1989 and 1991 were resistant to
streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. ... The emerging resistance
of E. coli O157:H7 to antibiotics could portend an increased prevalence of
this pathogen in food animals that receive antibiotics."
5. Su, C. and Brandt, L.J. (1995). Escherchia coli O157:H7 infection in
humans. Annals Internal Med. 123, 698-714.
"Antibiotic therapy has not proved beneficial."
6. LeClerc et al. (1996). High mutation frequencies among Escherichia coli
and Salmonella pathogens. Science 274, 1208-1211.
"Here it is reported that the incidence of mutators among isolates of
pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica is high (over 1 percent)."
and
"Because these mutant alleles increase the mutation rate and enhance
recombination among diverse species, these studies may help explain both
the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance and the penetrance of
virulence genes within the prokaryotic community."
CONJECTURE:
Taken in whole, the body of research evidence seems to point to the
emergence of virulent, antibiotic-resistant strains of common,
genetically-plastic organisms. Why should antibiotic-resistant be selected
for? Because it is a constant factor in the environment (i.e., "growth
promoters"). Why increased virulence? Because the toxin allows the organism
to defend against the antibiotics by adhering to and tunneling into the
intestinal walls of the host animal. Why increased mutability? Because 1)
many antibiotics cause genetic damages (e.g., tetracycline) and 2) the
rapid kill-off in the presence of antibiotics selects for the adaptable
strains.
The deciding question is: Would O157:H7 be a favored strain if antibiotics
were NOT present? If so, why have similar strains not appeared eons ago and
dominated the gut flora?

Robert A. LaBudde asked: "How do you immunize against E. coli O157:H7 or S.
typhimurium? When only 25-100 organisms can overload an immature or weakened
immune system?", and Karl Bettelheim said: "It is not just E. coli O157, it
is all the other toxigenic E.coli carried that matter." Perhaps even more
pertinent questions, to those who contemplate developing a vaccine, is:
"Whom do we vaccinate?", and: "Who will pay for the vaccination?"

Which antibiotics is the organism resistant to?? It makes a difference!
Some antibiotics stop the release of endotoxin, while others promote it, so
it makes a big difference which active agent is used. On the basis of
treating humans with ecoli infections, I do not necessarily agree that all
antibiotics should worsen this problem. Usually, it is better to kill the
bacteria, especially with an antibiotic that does not release more
endotoxin...
