An emergency report has been received by the Office International des
Epizooties in Paris from Dr J.M. Arnoldi, Deputy Administrator, Veterinary
Services, United States Department of Agriculture, regarding the detection
of contagious equine metritis on 24 Dec 1997 in Sacramento Country,
California.
Estimated date of first infection: 24 November 1997.
Description of affected population: 11-year-old donkey jack.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
21 1 0 0 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratory, Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: culture from the urethra; fluorescent antibody
test.
C. Causal agent: further characterisation of the isolate of _Taylorella
equigenitalis_ will be performed to compare it to organisms that have
caused clinical disease.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown at this time. Suspect
contaminated artificial insemination sleeve or infected prior to becoming a
semen donor. Epidemiology being performed. Animals identified in
trace-outs and trace-backs will be tested for contagious equine metritis.
B. Other epidemiological details: the donkey was born and raised in the
United States and has never been out of the country. It has been with the
current owner since it was a yearling. This was the first test for
contagious equine metritis this animal has ever had. Four other animals in
the same export quarantine area were tested for contagious equine metritis
and found to be negative.
The donkey has not been used for natural breeding for three years. There is
no clinical disease in the donkey or any other animal on the farm nor any
reports of clinical diseases of mares this donkey has serviced (naturally
or artificially).
Control measures during reporting period: the donkey and the premises where
the donkey resides have been under quarantine by the State of California
since 12 December 1997. The donkey will be treated in accordance with
standard treatment procedure for contagious equine metritis.
