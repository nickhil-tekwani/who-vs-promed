A recent report has described a case of wound infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia thailandensis_ in a woman in Arkansas. Jay E. Gee, PhD, from the CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, and colleagues published the report in the November 2018 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the monthly peer-reviewed public health journal of the CDC.

_Burkholderia thailandensis_ is closely related to the bacterium _B. pseudomallei_, which causes melioidosis. Both organisms are commonly found in the environment, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. Although usually considered nonpathogenic, rare cases of infection with _B. thailandensis_ have been reported in humans. These infections often result from injuries that expose a wound to soil. In the USA, the 1st reported case occurred in Louisiana in 1997, in a 76-year-old man with a pleural wound; and the 2nd occurred in Texas in 2003, in a previously healthy 2-year-old boy who aspirated water from a ditch after a car accident.

Dr. Gee and colleagues describe a recent case in a 29-year-old woman in Arkansas who suffered an open forearm fracture after crashing while driving an all-terrain vehicle. She underwent surgery and a metal plate was used to stabilize the fracture. The patient returned to the hospital 3 months later because of swelling of her forearm, and received antimicrobial treatment consisting of piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefazolin.

Doctors also collected tissue from deep in the forearm at the surgical site, and submitted this sample for microbial culture. Because of the similarities between _B. thailandensis_ and _B. pseudomallei_, they can be difficult to differentiate. Indeed, in this case, the laboratory initially reported growth of _B. pseudomallei_ and a diagnosis of melioidosis was made. However, the Arkansas Department of Health then ruled out the presence of _B. pseudomallei_ in the tissue specimen by using biochemical and PCR testing, and instead identified it as _B. thailandensis_. They then forwarded the isolate to CDC for confirmation. The woman was discharged and treated with ceftazidime intravenously for 6 weeks, and was reported to be completely healed as of December 2017.

"_B. thailandensis_ can be misidentified as its close relative _B. pseudomallei_, a tier 1 select agent which causes the potentially fatal disease melioidosis," Dr. Gee, told Contagion. "But, unlike _B. pseudomallei_, our work suggests that _B. thailandensis_ may be endemic in the continental USA, so the ability to correctly and quickly identify and differentiate these bacteria is vital for appropriate patient treatment and public health responses," he emphasized.

The authors conclude that further study of _B. thailandensis_ is needed to improve understanding of its geographic range and ability to cause infections.

[As discussed in the papers below, _B. thailandensis_ has been considered a non-virulent relative of _B. pseudomallei_ but this report suggests that the organism can become more virulent leading to human mortality. As has been the case with _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ which caused an outbreak over the winter of 2015-2016 primarily in southeast Wisconsin in the USA which is quite difficult to distinguish from _E. meningoseptica_, _B. thailandensis_ is readily misidentified as _B. pseudomallei_ so the number of cases, especially in areas where melioidosis is classically endemic, may be undercounted.

Abstract
--------
"_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, a causative agent of melioidosis, is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that is closely related to its avirulent counterpart, _Burkholderia thailandensis_. However, pathogenic mechanisms and virulence factors of _B. pseudomallei_ remain elusive. In the present study, we compared the invasiveness, adherence, and replication of _B. pseudomallei_ and _B. thailandensis_ in human respiratory epithelial cells A549. Invasion was determined after 4h of coculturing using antibiotic protection assay. Adherence was demonstrated by coculturing the cells with fluorescein-labeled bacteria for 1h and the number of positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results obtained with this in vitro study demonstrated that compared with its avirulent counterpart, _B. pseudomallei_ is significantly more efficient (P less than 0.01) in invasion, adherence and inducing cellular damage, as represented by plaque formation."

Abstract
--------
"_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is the causative agent of melioidosis, and its infection usually affects patients' lungs. The organism is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacillus commonly found in soil and water in endemic tropical regions. Another closely related _Burkholderia_ species found in soil and water is _B. thailandensis_. This bacterium is a non-pathogenic environmental saprophyte. _B. pseudomallei_ is considerably more efficient than _B. thailandensis_ in host cell invasion and adherence. A previous study by our group demonstrated that after successfully invading cells, there was no difference in the ability to survive and to replicate between both _Burkholderia_ species in cultured A549 human lung epithelial cells. In this study, Human Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify the difference in gene expression profiles of A549 cells after a 2-h exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ and _B. thailandensis_. A total of 280 of 22 283 genes were expressed at higher levels in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells than in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells, while 280 genes were expressed at lower levels in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells. Approximately 9 percent of these genes were involved in immune response and apoptosis. Those genes were further selected for gene expression analysis using reverse transcription PCR and/or real-time RT-PCR. The results of RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR are in accordance with data from the microarray data in that bcl2 gene expression in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells was 2-fold higher than the level in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells even though no apoptosis was seen in the infected cells. The levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1, IL-11, IRF-1, IL-6, IL-1beta and LIF genes expression in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells were 1.5-5 times lower than in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells. However, both species stimulated the same level of IL-8 production from the tested epithelial cell line, and no difference in the ratio of adherent polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to infected A549 cells of both species was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that _B. pseudomallei_ manipulates host response in favor of its survival in the host cell, which may explain the more virulent characteristics of _B. pseudomallei_ when compared with _B. thailandensis_."
