Tetramine, a rat poison, led to the hospitalization of 39 people last Mon [15 Jun 2015] in Shaanxi province (northwest), [China].

These 39 people, including 11 school children, showed symptoms of food poisoning after eating cold noodles in a Foping District restaurant. According to the district government, tests have confirmed that the symptoms were due to tetramine [poisoning]. It is still unclear whether this is a deliberate poisoning. Police are still investigating the case. All patients are now in stable condition. The 3 students receiving emergency treatment at the intensive care unit were transferred to the pediatric ward.

[Tetramine is tetramethylenedisulfotetramine and is a rodenticide available in China or purchased from China.

It is grouped with such toxins as picrotoxin, since they have the same intercalating cyclical molecular structure and cause seizures through non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (gABA) antagonism. In humans, the 50 percent oral lethal dose (LD50) is estimated to be 100 micrograms/kilogram.* Seizure activity is prominent and possible severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction due to prolonged seizure activity may occur following exposure to tetramine.

[For comparison, the human oral (LD50) of ricin seeds has been estimated to be about 1 microgram/kilogram. - Mod.JW
