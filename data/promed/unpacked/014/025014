A "viral" disease has attacked date palms in Khairpur [district] for
the 3rd consecutive year [see ProMED-mail posts 20090806.2776 and
20080730.2323]. The disease affected the orchards of date palms in
several municipalities. Growers said the attack dried the fruit which
started dropping and later the stem also dried up.

A date palm grower said that some 200 acres [81 ha] of orchards had
been damaged due to the attack of an unidentified "viral" disease. In
the current month [April 2010], the disease had damaged 50 percent of
[his] date palms. He said that there was no research institute to
help growers. There are about 44 310 acres [approx 18 000 ha] of date
palms in the district.

An agricultural officer (AO) said that an entomologist had been
called from Sindh Agricultural University. He visited the affected
areas and took samples of the soil, droppings, and the fallen stems
of date palms. He said the entomologist would again visit the area
after a test report of the samples and give suggestions.

Another AO said that manure and other fertilisers were less in use.
He also said that shortage of irrigation water could be a possible
reason for this problem. The secretary of agriculture was asked to
send experts and resolve the problem.

[The date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is cultivated in many hot, dry
regions as a staple food source. Trees can live for more than 100
years. A large number of fungi and a number of other pathogens, as
well as several diseases of unknown aetiology have been reported for
this crop, but so far no viral pathogens have been identified. It is
likely that the term "viral" is used above for an unspecified
disease, rather than for a particular pathogen.

Date palm production is facing serious problems worldwide, including
lack of research, pests, and spread of diseases. Over the last
decade, productivity of the crop has declined globally, and as much
as 30 percent of yield may potentially be lost due to diseases and
pests. A Global Date Palm Network was established by the Food and
Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to promote
research and exchange of information.

In Pakistan, undiagnosed diseases were reported to affect date palm
yields in 2008 and 2009, and a tissue culture programme for crop
improvement that could be used to produce disease-free replanting
material was established (see ProMED-mail posts 20080730.2323 and
20090806.2776). Above, the palms are also reported to be affected by
environmental stress factors, which may predispose them to pathogen
attacks. However, reliable diagnosis of pathogens involved in the
problems is urgently needed to design effective disease management
strategies, but still appears unavailable.
