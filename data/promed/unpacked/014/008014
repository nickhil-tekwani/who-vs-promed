15 cases of scrub typhus infection, a communicable disease commonly found in southeast Asia and Japan, have been reported from various parts of the Kozhikode district.

Initially reported from Malabar region [northern districts] in the Kerala State in 2006, medical officials say that it is very difficult to know its symptoms mainly because in the initial stage it appears like a common fever. The disease, which spreads through mite bite, can be diagnosed only through blood test.

"Scrub typhus has been reported in Kozhikode, Kannur, Malappuram, Wayanad, and Palakkad," said MK Appunny, additional district medical officer. "If detected at an early stage then it can be cured by administering the drug doxycycline, [which is also] used to treat leptospirosis. But if the patient approaches a doctor at a late stage then the chances of organ failure and death are high," he said.

The health department had organized a regional-level workshop for doctors from the 6 districts of Malabar [Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Wayanad] at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital recently. The workshop imparted awareness classes for the medical fraternity including district medical officers and health staff to ensure early diagnosis of diseases. The Kozhikode wing of the Indian Medical Association, which started its campaign 'no more fever deaths', has started conducting awareness classes about the disease with the help of residential associations in the district.

[Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness characterized by a typical eschar, generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, and vague non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, and cough. It is characterized by focal or disseminated vasculitis and perivasculitis, which may involve the lung, heart, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious complication of scrub typhus; encephalitis, interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and pericarditis, acute renal failure, acute hepatic failure, and acute hearing loss can also occur in patients with scrub typhus. In a review of 297 cases of the disease (Lee CS, Hwang JH, Lee HB, Kwon KS: Risk factors leading to fatal outcome in scrub typhus patients. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2009; 81(3): 484-8; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/81/3/484.long), a case-fatality rate of 6.7 percent was reported.

Weil and Felix described the classical assay for rickettsial antibody detection in 1916. The methodology took advantage of heterophilic (cross-reacting) antigens of members of the genus _Rickettsia_ and several species of the Gram negative bacillus _Proteus_. In the Weil-Felix test, bacteria of _Proteus vulgaris_ OX-19 agglutinate with sera of those infected with typhus group organisms as well as from the Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_. Cells of _P. vulgaris_ OX-2, on the other hand, agglutinate with sera from individuals with spotted fever infection, except RMSF. The OX-19 agglutination is seen in epidemic typhus, but usually not in Brill-Zinsser recrudescent disease. _P. mirabilis_ OX-K can be similarly used in the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including one for complement fixation antibodies. - Mod.LL]
