H7N9 avian influenza patient in Urumqi [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] is discharged after severe illness
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An H7N9 avian influenza patient, who once stood at the "Gates of Hell", has at last been discharged from hospital and returned home. In August [2014], the patient had been diagnosed with H7N9 avian influenza. He spent 20 days in 2 different hospitals for treatment, and on 5 Sep 2014 was discharged, returned home, and has been recuperating for 10 days.

By 15 Sep 2014 the discharged patient confided to a work-mate: "I'm now recovering okay and can eat 3 normal meals a day," he laughed. He recalled that before getting ill, he had gone to the market to buy rat traps. "The chickens that we raise at home had been bitten and killed by rats or other small rodents so I went to the market to buy rat traps. After searching I found some in a mobile stand selling rat poisons. That night after coming back from the market I started sneezing. The next day I developed a fever." Treatment with a local remedy had no effect. He developed a fever which sometimes ran to 38 deg C [100.4 deg F] and sometimes 40 deg C [104 deg F]. Later, when he really felt unwell, he sought treatment at a local hospital, but after admission his fever didn't recede and went as high as 42 deg C [107.6 deg F]. He was treated at that hospital for serious flu for 7 or 8 days, with no improvement. By the middle of August [2014] a hospital doctor considered that he might not recover. Subsequently tests at the Urumqi Disease Control Center established that the patient had contracted H7N9 avian influenza and the patient was immediately moved to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region No. 6 People's Hospital. About this time the patient lapsed into unconsciousness. A specialist resuscitation team then became involved in his treatment.

Ten different diagnoses can be seen on the discharge certificate from No. 6 People's Hospital, including human H7N9 highly pathogenic avian influenza, unexplained pulmonary fibrosis, severe pneumonia, ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome], type I respiratory failure, electrolyte disturbance, multiple organ damage, hypoalbuminemia, post-tracheostomy [sp?], and simple skin ulceration. These show that the patient's condition was extremely critical at that time.

Only later did we learn that an entire rescue team of about 20 physicians and nurses was involved." The rescue team at No. 6 People's Hospital made an all-out effort for 3 days, finally pulling the patient back from the "Gates of Hell".

The patient stated that he didn't know he was suffering from avian influenza at the time. The patient recalls that the hardest part of his treatment was the suction. "When the doctor gave me my tracheostomy, I wanted to pull it out so the nurses had to work hard to keep it in." After 3 days of intense treatment, the patient at last was downgraded from critical condition, but still stayed in the ICU. His family could only talk with him by video link. During that time, the doctors and nurses communicated with him on paper.

[CIDRAP News have reported 2 new human cases of H7N9 in China. One new case of H7N9 avian influenza is in a 53-year-old male welder, according to yesterday's [15 Sep 2014] weekly avian flu update from the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The man, who lives in Urumqi city in the Xingiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, fell ill on 3 Aug 2014 and tested positive for H7N9 on 16 Aug 2014, the report says. It does not list his condition or say whether he was hospitalized, but an H7N9 case list maintained by FluTrackers, an infectious disease message board, says he was hospitalized on 8 Aug 2014. This may be the case described in the preceding report. About 3 months ago, a member of the man's household bought about 20 chickens to raise, the FAO report says.

The last report of an H7N9 case in China surfaced on 7 Jul 2014. The new case raises the count of H7N9 illnesses in China to 453, according to the FluTrackers case list.

The medical report reproduced above suggests that avian H7N9 in humans can result in very severe disease, and also that rodents may play a role in transmission of the infection. - Mod.CP
