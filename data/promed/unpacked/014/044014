Influenza update no. 355 (based on data up to 10 Nov 2019)
----------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at interseasonal levels in most countries. However, influenza activity continued to increase across the countries in western Asia.
- In the Caribbean and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall, except for Cuba. In Central American countries, influenza activity decreased in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained elevated in some countries of Western Africa.
- In southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries but continued to increase in Iran (Islamic Republic of).
- In south east Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to interseasonal levels in most countries and decreased to low levels in Chile.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A accounted for the majority of detections, with equal proportions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses.

National influenza centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 112 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 28 Oct 2019 to 10 Nov 2019 (data as of 22 Nov 2019 05:24:24 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 85 126 specimens during that time period. A total of 6187 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 4608 (74.5%) were typed as influenza A and 1579 (25.5%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1473 (47%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1664 (53%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 43 (6.2 %) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 650 (93.8%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 23-26 Sep 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.

Recent updated numbers show flu activity is on the rise across the Peach State [Georgia] and across Alabama. The latest numbers show moderate flu activity across Georgia. The new data is from the week of 3 Nov [2019]. The new numbers show more activity compared to the low activity reported the week before.

One new outbreak was reported to the Georgia Department of Public Health. The percentage of outpatient visits for flu-like symptoms was above the regional baseline at just over 4%. In Alabama, there are 5 new outbreaks reported across the state.

At least 16 people have died so far this year [2019] as health authorities embark on a "robust nationwide influenza vaccination drive" to protect the population against the flu virus. The Ministry of Health said that as of last Friday [22 Nov 2019], the number of suspected cases for this flu season had reached 2738 and that there had been 16 confirmed deaths. The ministry said that the cumulative number of vaccines administered to the public so far was 16 301.

"The influenza virus is serious and is generally more severe than the common cold. The flu vaccine is available, at no cost, at all health centres," the Ministry of Health said, adding that children and people with chronic medical conditions should be among those getting the vaccine. It said that the flu season runs until May next year [2020] and that individuals in the healthcare and essential-services sectors should also ensure that they receive the vaccine.

[4a] Drug-resistant influenza A
Date: Tue 26 Nov 2019

Research from a research team at the University of Tokyo revealed that resistant viruses that are difficult to work with the anti-influenza drug "Zofluza" are as infectious and symptomatic as the effective drugs. [The team] published a paper in the science journal "Nature Microbiology" dated 25 Nov [2019]. Until now, resistant viruses have been considered to be weakly infectious. Experts say it is necessary to use it carefully in children who are prone to develop resistant viruses, as non-drug viruses can spread.

Yoshihiro Kawaoka and professors at the Tokyo University of Medical Sciences and Laboratories separated the virus of 4 patients whose resistant virus was detected after taking Zofluza last winter and the virus with no resistance collected before treatment. Each was infected with hamsters, mice, and ferrets, and the infectivity and symptoms were compared.

Resistant virus caused weight loss in infected mice and hamsters in much the same way as non-resistant viruses. It also increased in the lungs and trachea just like normal viruses. It was also confirmed that an uninfected ferret was placed in the cage next to the infected ferret.

In experiments with resistant viruses made artificially, it was reported that the infectivity was weaker than normal viruses.

Abstract
--------
Here we report the isolation of the influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic (A/H1N1pdm) and A/H3N2 viruses carrying an I38T mutation in the polymerase acidic protein -- a mutation that confers reduced susceptibility to baloxavir marboxil -- from patients before and after treatment with baloxavir marboxil in Japan. These variants showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity that is similar to those of wild-type isolates in hamsters; they also transmitted efficiently between ferrets by respiratory droplets.
