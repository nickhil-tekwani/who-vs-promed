Yellow fever puts the [São José do] Rio Preto region on alert
-------------------------------------------------------------
People who need to go to the São José do Rio Preto region, in the north of São Paulo state, must be vaccinated against yellow fever. The alert, by the Epidemiological Surveillance Group (GVE) of the state Secretariat of Health, is issued on account of a series of deaths of monkeys after contracting the disease in municipalities of the region.

According to the Rio Preto GVE Deputy Director, Monica Regina Bocchi, of the 4 dead monkey cases, 2 now have been definitely confirmed as yellow fever and the other 2 have been positive in the initial tests, are awaiting results of [further] tests. "The problem is that we have not been able to test them in many cases. What is worrisome is that we have nearly 40 suspected [yellow fever] deaths [in monkeys] in the region." In all these instances, there has been action to block [human cases] with vaccination of the surrounding population as well as vector control, especially of forest mosquitoes.

[2] Yellow fever in Pindorama and Ibirá
Data: Thu 27 Oct 2016

Yellow fever confirmed in monkey deaths in Pindorama and Ibirá
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the northeastern region of São Paulo [SP] state, 2 more monkeys died of yellow fever, one in Pindorama (SP) and the other in Ibirá (SP). The cause of death [due to yellow fever] was confirmed by the Secretariats of Health in the 2 municipalities this Thursday (27 [Oct 2016]).

With these cases, the number of monkeys dead from yellow fever this year [2016] in the São José do Rio Preto (SP) region increases to 4. The other cases were in Rio Preto and Potirendaba (SP). These deaths are the reason why the local authorities issued a state of alert.

Since December [2015], monkeys suspected to be dead [from yellow fever] were also encountered in Urupês (SP), Cedral (SP), Mendonça (SP) and Jaci (SP). It was not possible to collect materials to test in these municipalities due to the state of decomposition of these animals' bodies.

The Rio Preto State Surveillance technician, Mônica Bocchi, said that despite their concern, there is no reason for the population to panic [panic, no, but worry on the part of health agencies, yes -- very worried - Mod.RNA]. This is because up to now, the virus is circulating in the forest environment without cases in urban areas. "We have found cases in monkeys and it is important that the populace notifies the municipal health services about monkey bones, dead or sick monkeys, so that the people can detect circulation of the virus in this region. Transmission of the disease [virus] from monkeys to humans depends on mosquito vectors in forested areas when people go there to fish or to the forest, who have not been vaccinated. In urban areas [human] infection is via _Aedes aegypti_, but this [at least for now - Mod.RNA] has not occurred in our region," she said.

Tests have confirmed that one monkey died from yellow fever this month [October 2016] in Potirendaba (SP). In a forest in the municipality, 8 howler monkeys were found dead. Due to the state of decomposition of their bodies, it was possible to take sample from just one animal for testing.

So the Instituto Adolfo Lutz confirmed that the dead monkey was the same one with yellow fever. The Potirendaba municipal Secretariat of Health indicated barrier action against the disease. The main measure was to vaccinate the residents of the neighborhoods located next to the areas where the monkeys live.

Given this same positive case registered in Potirendaba, the municipality now has been placed on alert. This is because in the neighboring municipality of Bady Bassit, a 38-year-old man died of the disease [the report does not indicate when the man was infected and died - Mod.TY].

In São José do Rio Preto (SP) a howler monkey was found in the forest in an area south of the city. Tests for yellow fever were positive and the Secretariat of Health mounted emergency action in neighborhoods near the forest. Residents receive visits by health agents and the houses are fogged against _Aedes aegypti_.

[The comments of Mod.RNA in 2 previous reports of this sylvan outbreak of yellow fever are instructive and are repeated here [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY].

[It is worrisome -- new epizootics (confirmed and suspected) in other municipalities, apparently with circulation of virus -- in addition to being shown to be more intense, are occurring in diverse foci, or could suggest a tendency for expansion of the areas of active transmission.

Despite being regions with circulation and transmission known in the distant and recent past, the evidence this year [2016] points to a circulation possibly more intense and, eventually, with a wider distribution. ProMED-PORT has been alerting and reporting in successive posts about the implications of this wider virus circulation and its close proximity to urban areas.

It is difficult to point out, however, what the determinants are that are causing this greater virus circulation. It is worth bringing up a comment of the wise ProMED-PORT moderator Professor Luis Jacintho (Mod.LJS) in a 2009 post: "As I have already commented earlier, and will repeat again, yellow fever does not "spread", it is always present in the south, only, for reasons still not well known, its transmission intensifies from time to time. - Mod.LJS".

Two points, one positive and the other negative, must be brought up:
- Surveillance of epizootics apparently is sensitive and structured in São Paulo state, making possible the early detection of yellow fever virus circulation, but...
- The length of time to get (or give) the confirmed result, in this case nearly 3 months after suspected yellow fever in a non-human primate, can derail the adoption of necessary measures in a timely manner.

Action to immunize susceptible [people] must be (in fact, they should have or could have been) intensified. [However,] in this scenario, one should remember not only the need for awareness by the surveillance system (suspicion, reporting, investigation...) suspected cases of yellow fever, but also (possible) occurrence of serious vaccine adverse events (especially neurotropic and viscerotropic disease) among (likely) many people (including those with contraindication to the vaccine) which will (necessarily or unnecessarily) result from vaccination. - Mod.RNA]

Despite the delay in reporting laboratory results, the proactive barrier vaccination strategy has been a wise one for prevention of sylvan (forest) cycles of transmission spilling over into villages and towns and becoming urban cycles of human-mosquito-human transmission as happened in Paraguay in 2008. Urban outbreaks can become explosive in areas where the people are not immunized, as happened recently in Angola.
