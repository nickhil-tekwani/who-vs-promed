Rabies at Gilboa Kibbutz
------------------------
Health Ministry laboratory tests [sic; the national rabies laboratory
is in the Ministry of Agriculture's Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI)]
show that a cow that died on Wednesday [15 Dec 2010] in the barn at
Kibbutz Merav, in the Gilboa area, was infected with rabies. The
ministry is asking that anyone who was in contact with the cow or had
animals that may have been in contact with stray dogs in the area to
contact the Afula health office or the nearest health office urgently.
After hours, one should contact a hospital emergency room.

The ministry reminds people who are bitten or scratched by animals to
wash the wounded area with soap and water, apply disinfectant and go
to a health office or medical facility to determine if there is a need
for rabies treatment.

[This lab-confirmed case is the 48th in Israel since the beginning of
2010, compared to 55 lab-confirmed cases in animals during the same
period in 2009 and (only) 12 in 2008. All cases were reported from the
north-east, adjacent to the Syrian and Jordanian borders; this is the
same region affected also in 2009. See the rabies maps for 2010
(updated 16 Dec 2010), 2009 and 2008 respectively, at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2010.html>,
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html>, and
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2008.html>.

The cases reported during 2010 involved 21 dogs, 11 jackals, 8 cattle,
2 sheep, 2 goats, 2 cats, 1 wolf and 1 fox. The epidemiology of rabies
has undergone a striking change since 2009, namely a significant
increase in dog-mediated rabies in north-east Israel.

The implementation of a fox-targeted oral vaccination programme (ORV),
starting during the late 1990's, has almost eliminated fox-mediated
rabies, which had been predominant for decades. The recent
deterioration, affecting NE Israel where stray dogs and jackals have
become the predominant rabies vectors, can be explained by the results
of investigations carried out by the KVI during 2004-2007. Rabies
virus isolates from foxes and dogs were found to differ in their
molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate lineages
(see reference below).

The transition from fox-mediated to dog-mediated rabies, combined with
the high prevalence of canine rabies (also called "urban rabies") in
Syria and Jordan and with lamentably interrupted control of the stray
dog population in Israel, is of great concern to public health because
of the close contact between dogs and the human population. Jackals,
unlike foxes, seem to be susceptible to the same virus lineage as dogs.

Syria, Jordan and other countries in the Middle East, are long known
to be infected by dog-mediated rabies, and do not apply oral
vaccination.

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region
lacking efficient control systems is liable to difficulties. This was
predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating the vital need for
coordinated regional effort.

Israel applies, since the 1950's, compulsory dog registration and
vaccination. A computerised national dog registry system ("Dog
Center") has been operational for several years, as well as a
compulsory electronic dog identification system; see
<http://www.vtr.moag.gov.il/vtr/DogCenter/> (in Hebrew, but Google
translation can be applied).
