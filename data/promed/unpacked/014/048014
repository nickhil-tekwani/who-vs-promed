An excellent recent article shows the relative roles of hepatitis B and C
in liver cancer world-wide. This article shows that the present role of
hepatitis C in liver cancer is Great Britain is as small as it is in the
U.S. However, the rapid spread of the virus in IV drug abusers is a
considerable cause for alarm in both the UK and the US. See Kiyosawa et
al. Hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. Curr. Stud. Hematol.
