Screening reveals more piroplasmosis cases in US
------------------------------------------------
The enhanced screening program of racehorses in New Mexico continues
to pick up cases of equine piroplasmosis.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA), in its latest report to the
World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), on 25 Jan 2010, said the
screening program had so far tested more than 3000 horses for the
blood-borne parasitic disease. 13 horses had returned positive tests.

The department, in its report a month earlier, on 24 Dec 2009, said
1300 horses had been tested, with 3 positive as of 15 Dec 2009.

The New Mexico Livestock Board euthanized 5 of the horses. The
remaining positive horses are under isolated quarantine.

"Preliminary results of the investigation indicate that the
transmission of the organism may have resulted from management
practices -- use of shared needles or substances between horses)
rather than by a tick vector," said Dr John Clifford, deputy
administrator for the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Dr Clifford said a comprehensive investigation into all cases was continuing.

The New Mexico cases are unrelated to the outbreak that was first
identified in a ranch in Kleberg County, Texas.

As of 20 Jan 2010, equine piroplasmosis has been found in 364 horses
directly linked to that Texas property.

The positive horses either currently live, or previously lived, on
the ranch, or lived on premises immediately next door, or were
dangerous contacts (positive foal born to an infected mare, or
temporarily boarded on index premises).

The positive horses are currently located in 12 states, with 289 of
them still on the index ranch in Texas. The remaining horses are on
premises in Texas, Alabama, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana,
Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin.

Georgia is now free of equine piroplasmosis positive horses.

"Over 1600 horses have been tested for equine piroplasmosis as part
of the epidemiological investigation," Dr Clifford says.

[It is interesting to note that epidemiologically the New Mexico
situation is not linked to the Texas situation. However, the
causative agent had to have come from somewhere. In order of the
disease to be passed by needles it still had to originate from
somewhere. Has the index case for the New Mexico been located? Was
the index case related to the Texas situation and returned to Texas? - Mod.TG]
