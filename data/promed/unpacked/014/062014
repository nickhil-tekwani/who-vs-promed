SALMONELLOSIS, SALAMI - USA (04): SEROTYPE MONTEVIDEO

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the State of
Rhode Island to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype Montevideo infections. Investigators are using
DNA analysis of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to
identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 pm EST on 4 Feb 2010, a total of 213 individuals infected
with a matching strain of _S._ Montevideo have been reported from 42
states and District of Columbia since 1 Jul 2009. The number of ill
persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK
(1), AL (2), AZ (5), CA (30), CO (4), CT (4), DC (1), DE (2), FL (3),
GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (13), IN (3), KS (3), LA (1), MA (12), MD
(1), ME (1), MI (4), MN (5), MO (1), NC (9), ND (1), NE (1), NH (1),
NJ (8), NM (2), NY (18), OH (9), OK (1), OR (9), PA (6), RI (2), SC
(1), SD (3), TN (5), TX (7), UT (9), VA (1), WA (15), WV (1), and WY
(2). Because this is a commonly occurring strain, public health
investigators may determine that some of the illnesses are not part
of this outbreak.

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 4 Jul 2009 and 21 Jan 2010. Infected individuals range in age
from less than 1 year old to 93 years old and the median age is 37
years. 53 percent of patients are male. Among the 159 patients with
available information, 42 (26 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Recent test results provided by the Rhode Island Department of Health
revealed that an opened container of black pepper used in the
manufacturing of at least some of the recalled products was positive
for _S._ Montevideo and that the DNA fingerprint matched the outbreak
strain: <http://www.ri.gov/press/view/10647>.

The FDA is investigating the supply chain of the black pepper used in
the manufacturing of the recalled meat products. The Agency has
collected and is currently analyzing black pepper samples. To date,
all the samples collected and analyzed by the FDA have tested
negative, however, sample collection and analysis continues.

CDC and its public health partners are continuing the epidemiologic
investigation to verify that the outbreak is controlled. CDC,
USDA-FSIS, and FDA continue to work closely to identify the specific
products or ingredients that became contaminated and how the
contamination occurred and to identify any other food vehicles that
may be involved.

[The epidemiologic curve and a map of the USA showing the affected
states can be found at the original URL as well as additional details
on the investigation (previously posted by ProMED-mail). The number
of cases slowly grows and will likely do so further because of the
long shelf life of these products. To date, the pepper is implicated
in the outbreak genetically but unopened pepper has yet to be found
to contain the specific pathogen. - Mod.LL]
