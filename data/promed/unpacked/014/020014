In Taganrog [Rostov region], an investigation is being conducted in connection with the mass thallium poisoning of employees of an aircraft factory.

According to the media, the employees of the company, under unexplained circumstances, were poisoned by toxic metal thallium. In total, 25 people were injured. 17 of them are in the hospitals of Taganrog, Rostov, and Moscow. It is noted all the poisoned employees were of the legal and economic departments, and the most affected is the leading design engineer.

It was his wife who posted a petition on the Web, in which she said in November 2017 [her husband] had acute pains in the abdominal cavity and signs of poisoning. Also, she said, the man started to lose his hair. However, only in January 2018 the doctors suspected the engineer of heavy metal poisoning. The woman also claims the physicians found the presence of thallium in her husband's body, with levels exceeding 150 times.

The press services of the airline plant, according to TASS, confirmed several employees are being treated for thallium poisoning, which is not used in the production process at the plant. The exact number of victims was not specified. Also the company could not establish the source of infection.

The investigation is being carried out by authorized bodies (agencies). A pre-investigation check is conducted. The company has taken all security measures. The premises in which the victims worked were checked by Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare]. Threats to the life and health of employees of the aircraft were not found.

Thallium is a highly toxic, often deadly poison. In acute cases, the affected show signs of damage to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. After 2 or 3 weeks, hair loss begins, there are signs resembling beriberi [vitamin B-1 deficiency]. In severe cases, polyneuritis, mental disorders, and visual impairment may develop.

[This article leaves me with several questions. It is staff of the legal and economic departments of this facility that are affected. Yet thallium use in the plant production process is denied. While thallium may not be used in the manufacture of these aircraft parts, the question remains how did these people get thallium poisoning, if thallium is not on the property? Why are only legal and economic department people affected, and not any manufacturing staff?

Thallium is a heavy metal used in the manufacture of electronic components, optical lenses, semiconductor materials, alloys, gamma radiation detection equipment, imitation jewelry, artist's paints, low temperature thermometers, and green fireworks. Trace amounts of thallium are used as a contrast agent in the visualization of cardiac function and tumors. Thallium exposure may occur at smelters in the maintenance and cleaning of ducts and flues and through contamination of cocaine, heroin, and herbal products. Criminal and unintentional thallium poisonings are still reported, some leading to death.

Acute thallium poisoning is primarily characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and dermatological symptoms, while neurologic findings predominate with chronic exposure and tend to progress, even despite decreasing blood thallium levels
(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821465-overview).

Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting and diarrhea or constipation are most noticeable early on and especially in the first 3-4 hours. It is important to remember that, unlike most other metal salts exposures, gastrointestinal findings in thallium toxicity may be mild or nonexistent, especially in chronic poisoning. (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821465-clinical).

Symptoms may appear rapidly, but more commonly the acute toxicity subsides to be replaced by a gradual development of mild gastrointestinal disturbances, polyneuritis, encephalopathy, tachycardia, skin eruptions, stomatitis, atrophic changes of the skin, nail changes (Mee's lines), and skin hyperesthesia (mainly in the soles of the feet and the tibia). Degenerative changes of the heart, liver and kidney, subarchanoid hemorrhage, bone marrow depression, and increased radiopacity of the liver may also occur. Development of psychotic behavior with hallucinations and dementia has also been reported (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6338655).

In humans the most characteristic sign of thallium toxicity is alopecia which usually appears in cases when death is delayed for 15-20 days. Other signs and symptoms may develop at any stage of toxicity.

The current therapy for thallium poisoning is the use of Prussian blue and potassium chloride. Potassium therapy is probably the single most effective agent in the treatment of thallium poisoning. Further research, however, is needed to find an optimal antidote for thallium (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6338655).
