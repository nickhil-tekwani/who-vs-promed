Update on SARS - 6 Apr 2003
As of 6 April 2003, 72 SARS patients have been discharged. 28 SARS patients
remain hospitalised.
There were 3 additional SARS cases reported today. 2 are hospital staff; an
SGH doctor from Ward 57/58 and a TTSH nurse. We are still investigating the
source of infection for the TTSH case. The remaining new case is a man who
had visited his mother when she was admitted to TTSH from mid January 2003
till the end of March 2003. It is believed that he had come into contact
with a SARS patient, who had not yet been recognised as a SARS patient then.
Update of cluster of 23 hospital staff from SGH
--------------------------------------
A total of 23 hospital staff from SGH Wards 57 and 58 have been admitted to
TTSH. Some of the suspect cases have been downgraded to observation status.
Of the 23 staff, 1 is a probable case, 6 are admitted for observation and
16 are suspect cases. They are all stable.
As an assurance, visitors who went to Wards 57 and 58 at SGH from 20 Mar
2003 to 5 Apr 2003 may call SGH hotline at 6321-3591 between 8.00 AM and
10.00 PM for free health checks to ensure their well-being. Investigations
are on-going to determine the source of infection for these hospital staff.
Cautionary Measures at SGH
-----------------------
To ring-fence the source of infection and to ensure continuity of care to
their patients, SGH is transferring all patients from Wards 57 and 58 to
TTSH. All patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period
from 20 March 2003 till 5 April 2003 and who are currently still in SGH
will also be transferred to TTSH. Nurses, doctors, therapists and other
staff working in these 2 wards will also be transferred to TTSH to care for
their patients. The transfer, involving 80 patients and 91 staff will be
completed tomorrow. SGH is also contacting discharged patients who were
formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period from 20 March 2003 till 5
April 2003, as well as visitors to these wards during this period, to
ensure their well being.
KKH
----
The midwife from KKH who had SARS has recovered and been discharged. All
doctors and nurses in KKH who had contact with the midwife are also well.
KKH will be reopening it's Clinic A on 7 Apr 2003 as more than 10 days
would have passed since the midwife last worked there on 27 Mar 2003.
Summary of SARS cases
---------------------
To date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 106. Among these
are 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 28 patients still
hospitalised, 13 are in intensive care. This includes the 20-year-old Ngee
Ann Polytechnic student and the mother of the SARS patient who was
transferred from NUH yesterday. Since yesterday, one patient was discharged
from ICU.
Apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have not
given rise to any SARS cases.
The number of suspect cases admitted is 61, including 3 children (below 18
years old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 164.

Advisory
Update 22 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 6 Apr 2003 4:00 PM
Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS
---------------------------
As of 6 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is
based on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 87 probable and 92 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.

These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM. EDST, 6 Apr 2003.
[This represents a total of 90 probable cases and 127 suspected cases
reported from Canada. - Mod.MPP]
Health Canada Support for Ontario
----------------------------
At the request of Ontario, Health Canada shipped 10 000 masks to Toronto as
a stop-gap measure until the province receives additional masks from its
supplier. These masks are part of Health Canda's national emergency
stockpile (National Emergency Stockpile System). Health Canada is also
assisting in identifying sources for masks in Canada and off-shore.
Health Canada has deployed an additional 8 personnel to Ontario to work
with the Ontario team. This is in addition to the 6 staff Health Canada has
deployed to assist Toronto's public health unit and the Ontario Ministry of
Health with the investigation of the SARS cases. The department has also
provided guidelines for infection control and recommendations on actions
for public health settings.

China says SARS deaths at 51, infections at 1247 as of 5 Apr 2003, health
officials said on Sunday. The number of confirmed infections in Beijing had
also risen to 19 from 12, Guo Jiyong said. A Finnish man died in Beijing
from the virus on Sunday, taking the number of deaths in China's capital to
4, deputy director general of the Beijing Health Bureau Guo Jiyong told a
news conference. The Finn, a 53 year old male, arrived in Beijing from
Thailand on 23 Mar 2003 to attend an international labor conference. He came
down with a fever 5 days later and was admitted to hospital on 2 Apr 2003
with coughing, breathing problems and diarrhea.

[The worldwide update from WHO was not available for today as of the time
of preparation of this posting. In addition, an update on the number of
suspected and probable cases from the USA was not available for today or
yesterday as of the time of this posting. As stated in previous postings,
our rationale for not posting suspected cases based on rumors, either
personal or from the lay press, is that influenza-like illness (fever and
respiratory symptoms) is a rather common clinical syndrome, and pneumonia
from other etiologies, bronchitis and other acute pulmonary diseases are
also far more common than SARS. Given the present situation, in many
instances, anyone with a respiratory illness is jumped upon as suspected
SARS, especially if they are in East Asia or have travelled there.
Yes, ministries and departments of health do need to investigate all
suspected cases so that cases of SARS will not be missed, and health care
professionals should be using infection control procedures when evaluating
respiratory illnesses to prevent further transmission of SARS, should that
be the final diagnosis on a patient presenting with compatible symptoms. But
if ProMED were to post all of these rumors and suspected cases we would be
in the situation of posting errata on a daily basis (when these were
discounted), and further contributing to the hype and panic that is already
rampant. There is an interesting article in today's New York Times
discussing the international public panic surrounding SARS.
<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/06/international/06PANI>
According to the Hong Kong Department of Health there were 42 new cases of
SARS admitted to hospitals in the past 24 hours. In these reports, the
majority of new cases are in health care workers and residents of Amoy
Gardens; but there are additional cases that are referred to as "new
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia". We do not know
if all of the newly reported cases can be traced to contact with other
cases, or if there are indications of further community transmission. In
Singapore there were 3 new cases, all of whom were traceable to contact
with other known cases of SARS. In Canada, all cases reported thusfar have
a history of contact with known cases of SARS, or a history of travel to
areas with identified local transmission of SARS.
The newswire report from China suggests that there have been an additional
27 cases in the past 24 hours since the last report to WHO, and in addition,
that there may now be identified transmission in Beijing. - Mod.MPP]
