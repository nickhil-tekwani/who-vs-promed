Tanzania: Cholera outbreak leaves 79 in hospital, new cases continue
---------------------------------------------------------------------
New cases of cholera continue to be reported in Tanzania's commercial
capital, Dar es Salaam, where until Fri 10 Mar 2006, 79 patients were
admitted to various health centers in the city, a spokesman said on
Mon 13 Mar 2006.
"We are getting new cases almost every day despite the ongoing mass
education campaigns on how to contain the disease," Gaston Makwembe,
an information officer for the Dar es Salaam City Council, said. He
blamed the shortage of water in the city for the disease's
persistence, which has seen periodic outbreaks there and in other
parts of the country because of public consumption of unsafe drinking
water from wells and other sources.
He said 582 cholera patients were reported at various health centers
in the city since 2 Dec 2005, 6 of whom died.

Malawi records worst cholera outbreak in 4 years
-------------------------------------------------
Malawi has in 2006 recorded the country's worst cholera outbreak
since 2002, as 46 people have died from the recorded 3852 cases, a
senior government official told Xinhua on 10 Mar 2006.
"Although we have cholera outbreaks every year during the rainy
season, this year [2006] has been the worst compared to the past 4
years," said Habib Somanje, director of Preventive Health Services.
He said Malawi's commercial capital, Blantyre has been the worst hit,
with 1035 reported cases and 12 deaths.
Somanje, however, said this year's [2006] cholera affected only 5
districts of the country's total 28 districts. He attributed this
year's increased number of cholera cases to Malawi's hunger crisis,
which [has] severely affected close to 5 million people.

Chongwe records 25 cholera cases
----------------------------------
Chongwe District has recorded 25 cases of cholera, District Health
Management Team (DHMT) Director Dr. Charles Msiska has disclosed.
In an interview, Dr. Msiska announced that Ngwerere was the most
affected due to its poor sanitation and that the DHMT has embarked on
a campaign to freely distribute chlorine to the people in
cholera-affected areas in the district. However, Dr. Msiska said no
deaths had been recorded due to the quick response from the health
workers who treat the patients on site as opposed to transporting
them to health centers for treatment.

Sudan cholera outbreak reaches 3rd major town
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of cholera in Sudan's south has spread to a 3rd major
town and has claimed at least 132 lives in the war-torn area with
little clean water or sanitation, aid agencies said on Wed 8 Mar 2006.
Medecins Sans Frontieres said 12 people had tested positive for
cholera in the town of Malakal, [400] miles north of the origin
of the outbreak. Almost 6000 cases have been recorded in the southern
capital Juba and the nearby town of Yei, WHO said, adding the
outbreak had also spread to surrounding towns.
"There were 12 cases confirmed for cholera in Malakal," MSF medical
coordinator Kees Keus told Reuters.
2/3rds of south Sudan's population drinks unsafe water. After a 2005
peace deal, which ended Africa's longest civil war in Sudan's south,
hundreds of thousands of people have been returning home. "It's
difficult to prevent the spread when there are such large population
movements," Keus said.
