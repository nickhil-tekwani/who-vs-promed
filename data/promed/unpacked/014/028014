Equine flu threatens Randwick
---------------------------------
In a major escalation of the equine influenza situation, today's [24
Aug 2007] Randwick meeting is almost certain to be cancelled after
pleasure horses using nearby Centennial Park returned positive tests
to the highly contagious disease.
Before the test results were known, Racing NSW chief executive Peter
V'Landys had called a crisis meeting with head veterinarian Craig
Suann and chief steward Ray Murrihy to discuss whether the Randwick
races should go ahead. They were discussing various alternatives,
including not allowing Randwick-trained horses to compete today.
After the positive tests were revealed early today, it was expected
that the Randwick meeting would be cancelled when officials met at 6 am.
"We will have to send security guards into Randwick to ensure none of
the 600-odd horses stabled there are moved," V'Landys said.
In Melbourne last night [23 Aug 2007], Racing Victoria Ltd's chief
steward Des Gleeson contacted 3 Randwick trainers Bart Cummings,
Anthony Cummings and Tim Martin with runners at Moonee Valley today
and was assured that all those horses had been in Melbourne for at
least 3 weeks.
Bart Cummings has Caulfield Guineas winner Wonderful World resuming
in the McEwen Stakes, his son Anthony has Maslins Beach and Gawne in
the Sheahan Plate and Martin had Langborghini in the Tattersall's Handicap.
It is believed a person or persons who might have been looking after
horses at the Eastern Creek quarantine station outside Sydney also
could have been involved with one or more of the many ponies and
riding horses stabled at Centennial Park and also could have attended
horses stabled at Randwick.
The equine influenza virus cannot be contracted by humans but can be
easily spread via hands and clothing. The alarm was raised after
veterinary professor David Hutchins alerted NSW Minister for Primary
Industries Ian Macdonald, who sent a team headed by the Government's
chief vet Bruce Christie to take samples from the horses using Centennial Park.
Although there have been no reports of Randwick-trained horses
showing any signs of the virus, up to 10 of the horses stabled at
Centennial Park were showing signs of elevated temperatures and
respiratory infection consistent with the virus. The samples taken
from the horses were sent to laboratories at Menangle in NSW and
Geelong for testing and results were released early today.
It was revealed yesterday [23 Aug 2007] by the Australian Racing
Board that between 17 Aug and 20 Aug 2007, 2 horses coming from
Ireland and one from the US that were stabled close to a horse that
had traveled from Japan had the signs and another 3 horses
subsequently had developed nasal discharge and minor temperature
elevations. Further testing revealed that 1 of the initial 3 horses
tested had recent exposure to equine influenza.
The ARB said 13 horses arrived from Japan on 8 Aug with 4 going to
Eastern Creek and 9 to Spotswood quarantine station in Melbourne. As
of yesterday, none of the horses at Spotswood were showing signs of
the equine flu virus but further tests have been taken from all
horses at both facilities. Racing Victoria Ltd authorities last night
were monitoring the NSW situation but there is no suggestion that
Victorian racing will be affected at this stage.
The Deputy Premier and Racing Minister, Rob Hulls, yesterday [23 Aug
2007] said plans were in place to "effectively manage" any potential
outbreak of equine influenza in Victoria. Hulls said that in 2002,
the State Government and the racing industry developed an operational
plan, known as Horse Alert Victoria, to deal with such an emergency.
The Federal Minister for Agriculture, Peter McGauran, said yesterday
equine influenza potentially was the biggest risk faced by the
multibillion-dollar Australian thoroughbred and horse industry.
On 15 Aug 2007, equine influenza was detected at the Miho training
centre in Japan, a week after the shipment of 13 horses from Japan
arrived in Australia. By 22 Aug, a total of 447 horses at the Miho
and Ritto training centres were found to have the virus and the Japan
Racing Association immediately closed all its meetings, although
racing will resume in Japan at the weekend.

[Equine influenza is a viral disease caused by viruses closely
related to those that cause flu in people. There are 2 subtypes of
influenza A virus known to cause influenza in horses; these are the
subtypes: H7N7 (formerly known as A/equine 1) and H3N8 (formerly
known as A/equine 2). Partially extracted from:
<http://195.224.162.216/equiflunet/equiflunet_faq.html>
It would be nice to know which type of influenza this particular
outbreak is dealing with. If there is someone with authoritative
knowledge we would be grateful for the information.
Although the virus designations are similar subtypes, this particular
virus does not affect humans. However, there is recent research that
it may be related to a strain of influenza found in canines.
The disease can spread rapidly through a herd or grouping of horses.
The primary signs are those of a cold, with coughing, hacking and a
mild nasal discharge. This easily aerosolizes the virus, potentially
infecting other animals.
Antibiotics may be used, but are only there to combat any
opportunistic bacteria that are secondary invaders, as antibiotics do
not have an effect on viruses. Sick horses may recover with adequate
nursing care and plenty of rest.
There are vaccines to prevent this disease.
