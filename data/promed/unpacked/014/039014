An experimental drug for Hendra virus has been offered to a mother
and daughter on Queensland's Sunshine Coast who have been exposed to
the deadly disease. Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette
Young says the drug from the US has successfully prevented Hendra
virus in ferrets and monkeys.

The treatment has only been used once as a "last ditch" attempt to
save the life of Rockhampton vet Alister Rodgers before he died from
Hendra virus in hospital last year [2009]. It has been offered to
mother and her 12-year-old daughter, whose horse was infected with
Hendra virus at a Tewantin property on the Sunshine Coast 10 days
ago. The horse was put down.

Mother and daughter have yet to decide whether they will go ahead
with the treatment. Dr Young says time is of the essence, as the drug
must be given before symptoms start to appear. She says the family is
thinking it through. "We'll be using it today [27 May 2010] if they
choose to have it," she said. "It's a very, very difficult decision
for the 2 of them to make, in that there haven't been human trials.
But we do understand the science behind the development of monoclonal
antibodies, so we know how they work, so there shouldn't be problems.
The drug prevents the infection from developing; it binds so you've
got an antibody that's specifically designed against the Hendra
virus, so it prevents the person then going on to get a full-blown
infection."

Queensland Health says the other 9 people tested for the virus did
not have enough exposure to warrant being offered the drug. The
department says all 11 people who came into contact with the infected
horse face another 2 rounds of tests.

Earlier this week, 10 of the 11 people exposed to the virus were not
showing signs of the virus in the 1st round of testing. Yesterday [26
May 2010], Queensland Health confirmed the 11th person, who is
interstate, had also returned a negative initial result.

[None of the 11 people in Tewantin considered to be at risk of Hendra
virus infection have exhibited signs of infection in the 1st round of
testing. Of these 11, only 2, a mother and her daughter, are
considered to be at greater risk and have been offered treatment with
an experimental monoclonal neutralising antibody. This is a difficult
decision for this family, since the monoclonal antibody preparation,
although effective in experimental animals, has so far not been
tested in human volunteers.

Treatment with humanised monoclonal antibody has been used
successfully in some limited situations, notably the anti-F protein
Palivizumab used in treatment of respiratory syncytial virus
infection in severely affected infants. Potent neutralization of
Hendra and Nipah viruses by anti-F and anti-G protein humanised
monoclonal antibodies has been documented by Zhu Z, et al. J Infect
Dis. 2008 Mar 15;197(6):846-53. In principle, such antibodies, and
similar preparations which may now be available, could be used in
treatment of Hendra virus infection. Whether this is justified in the
case of the mother and daughter in Tewantin is questionable.
