Johnson & Johnson's [J&J] single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in documents published on Wednesday [24 Feb 2021], paving the way for the vaccine's approval for emergency use later this week. The regulator's panel of independent experts meets on Friday [26 Feb 2021] to decide whether to approve the shot. While it is not bound to follow the advice of its experts, the FDA usually does and has authorised vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.

J&J said in documents submitted to the FDA that its data suggested its vaccine was effective at preventing asymptomatic infections. It said that in a preliminary analysis of its trial, it found 16 cases of asymptomatic cases in the placebo group versus 2 in the vaccine group, or an 88 percent efficacy rate. While asymptomatic infection was not the primary goal of the trial, which studied the vaccine's ability to stop moderate to severe COVID-19, the reduction of asymptomatic cases implies the shot can also cut transmission of the disease.

J&J's vaccine was 66 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 against multiple variants in a global trial involving nearly 44 000 people, the company said last month [January 2021]. Its effectiveness varied from 72 percent in the US to 66 percent in Latin America and 57 percent in South Africa, where a new variant has spread, though the vaccine was 85 percent effective overall in stopping severe cases of the disease. The vaccine was effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and preventing PCR-test confirmed COVID-19 at least 14 days after vaccination, the FDA said in its briefing documents. 14 days after injection, only 2 vaccine recipients developed COVID-19 severe enough to need medical intervention, compared with 14 in the placebo group. After 28 days, no vaccine recipients developed COVID severe enough to require medical intervention whereas 7 in the placebo group did.

Three vaccine recipients had severe side effects in the trial that were likely related to the vaccine, but the FDA said its analysis did not raise any specific safety concerns that would preclude issuance of an emergency use authorisation. The FDA said the most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site pain at 48.6 percent, headache at 39 percent, fatigue at 38.2 percent, and myalgia (muscle pain) at 33.2 percent. Other side effects included fever in 9 percent of participants and high fever in 0.2 percent of those who received the vaccine.

The regulator said one case of pericarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue) may have been caused by the vaccine. It said cases of a rare neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, were unlikely to be related to the shot though data was insufficient to determine whether or not the vaccine had caused these side effects.

Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, the FDA says, paving way for approval. The agency says the single-dose vaccine is 66.1% effective in preventing moderate to severe virus disease, and showed signs of slowing the virus's spread.

J&J's shot would be the 3rd cleared for use in the US, as health authorities pick up the pace of vaccinations and try to lock in gains reducing daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths while staying ahead of any new variants that threaten to evade treatment.

Health authorities have been looking forward to adding a new COVID-19 vaccine to their arsenal. J&J's shot wasn't quite as effective in its late-stage trial as the pair already in use, but it worked safely by a number of measures, the FDA said, after reviewing a 44 000-subject study.

Aside from effectiveness, the J&J vaccine comes with advantages over the available shots that could help it accelerate and broaden mass vaccination efforts. Unlike the 2 vaccines in use, J&J's shot requires just a single dose.

Intriguingly, J&J released new information, in an analysis that the FDA posted along with its own, suggesting the vaccine might also help reduce the asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus. The vaccine reduced infections that didn't cause symptoms in study subjects, J&J said. Public-health officials say that a vaccine that can block such infections will be critical to limit the spread of the coronavirus and ease the pandemic. One of the reasons the virus has spread so widely is because of asymptomatic transmission.

A committee of outside medical specialists convenes Friday [26 Feb 2021] to evaluate analyses of the vaccine's pivotal-study results by both the FDA and the company, as the panel did for the 1st 2 COVID-19 vaccines to be cleared for use. The advisory committee is expected to recommend the FDA authorize the J&J vaccine, and the agency is expected to make its decision soon after. FDA authorization could come as early as this weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter. The regulatory green light would bolster vaccination efforts just as health authorities pick up the pace to get people back to schools, offices, and other establishments ahead of new strains that threaten to evade medicines.

Health authorities expect the initial supply of the J&J vaccine will help ease, though not eliminate, the frustration felt by people unable to sign up for shots because there aren't enough doses available. J&J has said it would deliver about 20 million doses for US use by the end of March [2021], which may be enough to boost the countrywide capacity for completed vaccinations by about 20%.

[2] Variants: USA (New York City, California)

As the [US] races to vaccinate as many Americans as possible against COVID-19, both New York and California are reporting new virus variants that might be more contagious than the original strain.

NY variant may create vaccine issues
------------------------------------
In New York, a new variant that carries a mutation that may weaken the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines has been identified as the B.1.526 variant. It was first discovered in November [2020] and now accounts for about one in 4 viral sequences in a database shared by scientists, according to the New York Times. In a paper published today from Columbia University [see reference below], the authors noted a steady increase in the detection rate of B.1.526 cases from late December [2020] to mid-February [2021], with a rise of 12.3% in the past 2 weeks. Cases have been detected across New York City, researchers said, and threaten to once again make the city a hot spot of viral infection. They say the strain's "unique set of spike mutations may also pose an antigenic challenge for current interventions," such as vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies.

California variant dominant strain in 44 counties
-------------------------------------------------
In California, variant B.1.427/B.1.429 now makes up more than 50% of cases in 44 counties, according to the Washington Post. Researchers believe that strain is more transmissible because of a mutation that enables the virus to more easily bind to human receptor cells.

None of the studies on emerging US variants are peer reviewed, so the authors caution that more investigation is needed, and more genetic sequencing must be done throughout the country to identify any novel variants.

Despite the new variants, infections continue to decrease throughout much of the country. The United States reported 69 828 new COVID-19 infections yesterday [24 Feb 2021] and 2284 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, US officials have recorded 28 396 896 cases and 507 803 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins map. [This may be changing... see section [6] below. - Mod.MPP]

Pfizer, Moderna explore variant protection
------------------------------------------
Both Pfizer and Moderna announced yesterday [24 Feb 2021] they are testing their mRNA vaccines against current variants, and in Moderna's case, it has shipped a new vaccine targeting the B.1.315 ([first identified in] South Africa) variant to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Pfizer and BioNTech say they are testing if a 3rd dose of their COVID-19 vaccine will trigger an enhanced immune response against new variants, according to CNBC. They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a new vaccine modified to target the B.1.351 variant.

Moderna yesterday [24 Feb 2021] announced it has shipped a vaccine against the B.1.351 variant to the NIH. "Leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are moving quickly to test updates to the vaccines that address emerging variants of the virus in the clinic," Stephane Bancel, MBA, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a press release yesterday [24 Feb 2021]. "Moderna is committed to making as many updates to our vaccine as necessary until the pandemic is under control. We hope to demonstrate that booster doses, if necessary, can be done at lower dose levels, which will allow us to provide many more doses to the global community in late 2021 and 2022 if necessary."

CDC launches vaccine website
----------------------------
Since the B.1.1.7 variant was identified in the United Kingdom, experts have warned that vaccination is a race that must be won before more transmissible, and possibly deadly, COVID-19 variants escape current vaccine protection.

Today [25 Feb 2021] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations] shows 88 669 035 COVID-19 vaccines doses have been delivered in the country, and 66 464 947 have been administered, with 20 607 262 Americans receiving 2 doses.

To facilitate that all Americans more easily understand when they can get a vaccine, the CDC is launching a new website, VaccineFinder [https://vaccinefinder.org/, that allows Americans to search for COVID-19 vaccine providers with a stock of vaccines near where they live. The website allows users to search for vaccines by entering their zip code. According to National Public Radio, unlike volunteer-run websites, the new finder relies on healthcare providers to enter their inventory every 24 hours into a database.

Though every state has different criteria for who is prioritized to get a vaccine, the American Association for Cancer Research yesterday [24 Feb 2021] sent a letter to President Biden, urging him to prioritize COVID-19 vaccines for cancer patients.

Abstract
--------
Recent months have seen surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the globe along with considerable viral evolution. Extensive mutations in the spike protein of variants B.1.1.7, B1.351, and P.1 have raised concerns that the efficacy of current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies could be threatened. In vitro studies have shown that one mutation, E484K, plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of some monoclonal antibodies as well as most convalescent and vaccinee sera against variant B.1.351. In fact, 2 vaccine trials have recently reported lower protective efficacy in South Africa, where B.1.351 is dominant. To survey for these novel variants in our patient population in New York City, PCR assays were designed to identify viruses with 2 signature mutations, E484K and N501Y. We observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late December [2020] to mid-February [2021], with an alarming rise to 12.3% in the past 2 weeks. Whole genome sequencing further demonstrated that most of our E484K isolates (n=49/65) fell within a single lineage: NextStrain clade 20C or Pangolin lineage B.1.526. Patients with this novel variant came from diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, and they were on average older and more frequently hospitalized. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences in the database further reveal that this B.1.526 variant is scattered in the Northeast US, and its unique set of spike mutations may also pose an antigenic challenge for current interventions.

[3] Commentary on reporting
Date: Fri 26 Feb 2021 12:13 PM

While the US has focused on SARS-CoV-2 variants arriving from across the globe, homegrown strains reported to be cropping up in California and New York show again how the virus is adapting in order to survive. Reports of US-generated mutations in states and cities hard-hit by the virus have spurred a scientific slugfest. Do they represent a significant threat? Are they worse than other variants? And should they have been reported at all -- gaining widespread media attention and bold headlines -- before being published in a scientific journal and vetted by peer review?

1. What's been reported about the New York variant?
A study of the New York variant was posted by California Institute of Technology researchers on bioRxiv, an online site based at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York that publishes so-called pre-print versions of studies before they're peer reviewed. They said the variant, known as B.1.526, appeared in samples obtained from various New York City neighborhoods starting in November [2020]. It includes 2 key mutations, they reported. One mutation, like the South Africa and Brazil variants, allows the virus to evade one class of antibodies in the immune response. Another affects how tightly the virus binds to cells. Anthony West, a senior research specialist at CalTech and a lead author, raised the possibility that some portion of vaccine-induced immune response against the coronavirus "might be less effective because of the mutations" in the New York variant.

2. How about the California variant?
That one, labeled B.1.427/B.1.429, has been verified as being widespread in California. It, too, shows genetic evidence of key mutations in the spike protein, according to researchers at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine. The California variant will at some point take over the state, said Stacia Wyman, a co-author of the study and senior genomic scientist at Innovative Genomics Institute. Though it's more transmissible than the dominant strain, it is still less transmissible than the UK variant, she said, and the vaccines still mount a defense against it. While the mutations in the variant have impact, he said, further significance remains unproven.

3. What's the controversy?
The CalTech study and a Columbia University study on the New York variant were both reported in the New York Times before the Columbia University pre-print was released to the public. Jay Varma, a scientific adviser to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, called on academics to review potentially high-impact studies with government health departments before presenting them to the media, tweeting that "pathogen porn isn't helping public health." Other prominent experts, including Eric Topol at the Scripps Research Institute in California, also raised concerns about media reports running before studies can be fully vetted. He referred to the coverage of the B.1.526 variant in New York as a "scariant" on Twitter. While the mutations in the variant have impact, he said, further significance remains unproven.

4. So should the reports be ignored?
It depends. These particular reports come from top-flight institutions and scientists, suggesting the variants identified are worth tracking on a deeper level. Pre-prints make new knowledge freely available to the public -- and importantly, other scientists -- before the often drawn-out process of publication in a major journal and peer review takes place. In the push for medical answers, pre-print materials have increased during the pandemic and, in some cases, have been discredited, or seen merely as ways to pump up stock prices. But they can also serve as an early warning system for developing issues. Many scientists describe and flag variants so that they can be monitored, especially for how the variant might evade currently available vaccines.

5. Will more variants emerge?
Very likely, if not definitely, both in the US and elsewhere. The more SARS-CoV-2 circulates, the more opportunities it has to mutate and spawn new variants; another study posted Monday [22 Feb 2021] to bioRxiv by researchers from the University of Washington found that a mutation in the variant known as L452R gives the virus an advantage in binding to receptors in human cells. So far, there's no evidence that the mutated versions of the virus considered most significant are more virulent or life-threatening than the original wild-type strain associated with COVID-19, or should cause panic. (A consensus is emerging that the 3 main variants are more transmissible and may evade infection- and vaccine-induced immunity, however.)

[The outburst of reports on variants is becoming overwhelming. Which are important? While pre-peer reviewed publications share data quickly and for that reason are valuable, news reports are even faster, yet neither has been vetted by peer reviewers. This commentary takes a balanced approach to the problem of getting information out there for other scientists and the public at the same time as recognizing the value in peer review. - Mod.LK]

[4] Comment re masks and aerosolized particles
Date: Thu 25 Feb 2021
From: Alex I Donaldson <alex.donaldson3@virginmedia.com> [edited]


Recently, several European countries have urged their public to wear higher-grade masks in areas where there is a risk of aerosols of SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as within buildings and on public transport. In the UK higher-grade masks have been requested by doctors' leaders for nurses in medical wards where COVID-19 patients are being treated.

Research performed around 50 years ago to investigate the performance of different masks is, I believe, relevant. The investigations (ref. 1) were carried out at the Animal Virus Research Institute (now The Pirbright Institute, Surrey, UK). For the studies, volunteers, either wearing or not wearing different types of masks, entered an isolation room containing pigs with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). (Pigs with FMD virus excrete the virus in their breath in association with a wide range of particle sizes). After 15 minutes of exposure the volunteers withdrew and samples were taken from their nostrils and tested for FMD virus.

The results showed (ref 1, Table 8, page 569) that when volunteers wore either a surgical or an industrial mask the amount of virus recovered from their nostrils was reduced by 0.9 or 0.8 log units compared to those who did not wear a mask. In other words, a surgical or industrial mask retained around 90% of the infectivity.

The nostrils are where large particles (larger than 6 microns diam.) that is, droplets, are trapped (ref. 2) and so it was concluded (ref. 1, page 572) that a respirator would be required to provide effective protection against both large and small particles (<6 microns diam.).

I believe that the results demonstrate that a "mask" (more correctly called a respirator) of US standard N95/99 or EU standard FFP2/3 is required to protect against the inhalation of aerosols of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

A global total of 10 580 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 24 Feb 2021 to late 25 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (19 871), India (16 606), Czech Republic (13 816), Poland (12 143), Russia (11 198), and Germany (10 782). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.4% increase in daily reported cases and a 15.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments, the global daily reported cases totaled almost 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 113.53 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.51 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. And 7-day average daily newly confirmed cases are now showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again. - Mod.MPP]
