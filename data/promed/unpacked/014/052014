The incidence of botulism in the Volgograd region has risen.
Authorities in the region is concerned about the increasing cases of
botulism.

During the 1st 9 months of 2011 in the Volgograd region the disease
affected more than 60 people, 7 of whom died. This exceeds last year's
[2010] total by more than 3 times: in 2010 only 4 people died and
there were only 18 cases. Physicians reported that all cases of
botulism were caused by the ingestion of low-quality products, namely
homemade canned vegetables and mushrooms or dried, smoked, or canned
fish.

[It is unclear what factors are behind the prominent upswing in cases
of botulism in this oblast. It would be interesting to know how many
outbreaks contributed to the total and if the outbreak number is
similar to 2010. If this is the case, the increase could be explained
on each vehicle being more distributed, not that more botulinum
toxin-containing foods are being produced. - Mod.LL]
