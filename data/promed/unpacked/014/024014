Tests conducted by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Service Laboratory have confirmed the presence the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDv] at one hog farm in Beaver County. The farm in question is Utah's largest hog farm and one of the largest in the country.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea is a virus that causes significant sickness in young swine, affecting their growth and health, and causes high mortality in piglets.

- PEDv is a pig farming virus only affecting pigs. It poses no risk to other animals, humans or food safety. Pork remains safe to eat.
- Currently there is a conditional license for a PEDv vaccine available to pork producers.
- PEDv is not a new virus; it's been found in countries worldwide.

The disease is common in parts of Asia and Europe, and the USDA first reported it in the US 16 months ago. Since then, more than 5500 cases have been reported in as many as 30 states, including Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona.

Dr Warren Hess, acting state veterinarian, is advising Utah hog and pig producers to, "Remain vigilant regarding their animal biosecurity practices on their farms.

"Increased animal health security measures can not only help defend against PEDv, but can also prevent the spread of many other livestock diseases," he added.

In May [2014], the [Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, UDAF] issued an emergency order [http://ag.utah.gov/home/news/454-emergency-order-issued-to-protect-utah-swine.html] intended to protect the state's USD 200 million swine industry by placing restrictions on livestock shows involving hogs and pigs. The order required any fair or show to be a "terminal" show, which means swine would go directly to slaughter following the show, and, therefore, reduce the threat of spreading any disease. The order also pertains to the upcoming state fair running Thursday [4 Sep 2014] through 14 Sep 2014 in Salt Lake City.

The USDA has agreed to work with veterinarians to fund testing on the farm that has been diagnosed with PEDv and to assure that stringent animal biosecurity practices are in place. The joint agreement also calls for expanded disease mitigation education efforts for Utah's pork industry.

[Research is making a difference. A vaccine has been conditionally licensed. This should start to make a dent in this disease and make it a preventable disease.
