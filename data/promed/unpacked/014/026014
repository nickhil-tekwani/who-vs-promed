Since June 2012, 133 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases have been identified in 9 countries. Two time periods in 2013 were compared to identify changes in the epidemiology. The case-fatality risk (CFR) is 45 percent and is decreasing. Men have a higher CFR (52 percent) and are over-represented among cases. 13 out of 14 known primary cases died. The sex-ratio is more balanced in the latter period. Nosocomial transmission was implied in 26 percent of the cases.

Since the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in June 2012, 133 cases have been identified so far. All primary cases were connected to the Arabian Peninsula, and nearly half of the cases died. Even though over a year has passed since the emergence of the 1st case, many questions on the origin and transmission patterns of the disease remain. The imminent start of the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, in early October [2013] is reason to review the epidemiological characteristics of the 1st 133 cases of MERS reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of [25 Sep 2013].

Background
The index case of the newly described MERS-CoV was detected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SA) in June 2012 [1]. Hereafter, cases and clusters of nosocomial or familial transmission were detected in 9 countries in the Middle East [2-4], 4 in Europe [5-12] and one in Africa [13]. The virus was isolated from several cases, and full sequence data are available through GenBank [14].

The reservoir and hosts of the MERS-CoV are still unknown, although virus RNA was possibly detected from bat faeces collected in the vicinity of the index case [15]. The virus belongs to the lineage C of the genus of beta coronaviruses, which are genetically similar to various coronaviruses detected in bats in Africa and Europe [16,17]. Two studies suggest dromedary camels in Oman, the Canary Islands and Egypt may have been infected with the virus or a MERS-CoV-like virus in the past. However, human cases have not been detected in these areas [18,19].

Epidemiological findings as of [25 Sep 2013]
Data collection
This paper reviews the epidemiological characteristics of the 1st 133 cases of MERS, reported applying the WHO case definition, as available on the Ministry of Health (MoH) of affected countries and WHO websites [20-24], and is based on [25 - reference 25 is: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Rapid Risk Assessment. Severe respiratory disease associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Seventh update, 24 September 2013. Stockholm: ECDC. Available from: http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/RRA_MERS-CoV_7th_update.pdf]. Basic demographic data (age, sex and comorbidities) on disease severity in terms of treatment level (outpatient, hospitalised, admitted to intensive care) and information on outcomes are usually available through MoH websites and WHO Disease Outbreak News. Further details were collected from peer-reviewed publications and through direct communication with the SA Ministry of Health.

All data were collected contemporaneously into a line listing on MS Excel 2010 and subsequently cross-checked with existing peer-reviewed publications on cases or clusters.

For female to male ratio, case-fatality risk (CFR) and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), we compared 2 time periods of transmission in 2013: March to May versus June to September 2013, thus excluding the rather sporadic cases in 2012 and early 2013.

Cases retrieved
Between [30 Mar 2012 and 25 Sep 2013], 133 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported by 9 countries. [Figure 1, MERS coronavirus cases by reporting country, as of [25 Sep 2013] (n=133) can be found at the source URL]. All cases have an epidemiological link to Jordan, KSA, United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Qatar. Cases detected in Europe [5-9] are linked to patients medically evacuated or seeking care in Europe.

The temporal distribution of cases suggests ongoing transmission [Figure 2, Distribution of confirmed MERS coronavirus cases by month of symptom onset(a), March 2012-[25 Sep 2013] (n=133), can be found at source URL].

Since June 2013, 18 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been reported. All were without any symptom or very mild with one episode of fever with or without myalgia and chills. In SA, 16 asymptomatic cases were detected during screening of all contacts of diagnosed cases and were included if positive for 2 specific gene targets (upE and ORF1a) on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The remaining 2 asymptomatic cases were detected in UAE.

The majority of reported cases are adult men and very few children or adolescents have been diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection [Table 3, Distribution of confirmed MERS coronavirus cases and fatalities by age and sex, March 2012-[25 Sep 2013 (n=128 (a))]. The female to male ratio of cases is 0.67 overall. However, it increased in 2013 from 0.33 in March to May, to 1.08 in June to September 2013.

We identified 14 clusters of 2-34 cases, where the primary cases were identified or suspected. However, data quality on the clusters is weak. All of the known 14 primary cases in clusters were adult men (24-83 years old) who were most likely exposed on the Arabian Peninsula. Of 129 cases with available information on transmission, 33 (26 percent) were possible nosocomial transmissions, 15 of these cases were healthcare workers (HCW). 17 of the 23 cases reported as HCW were female.

Of all reported 133 cases, 60 (45 percent) cases were admitted to intensive care (ICU). In comparison, between March and May 2013, 25 of 40 cases (63 percent) were admitted to ICU, while from June to September 2013, 25 of 77 cases (33 percent) were admitted to intensive care.

The overall CFR among the 133 cases is 45 percent on [25 Sep 2013]. Among symptomatic cases the CFR decreased from 23 of 40 cases (58 percent) in March to May to 21 of 77 (27 percent) in June to September 2013.

Men have a higher CFR compared with females (52 versus 24 percent) [Table 3]. Among the known primary cases in clusters with available information on outcomes, the CFR is 93 percent (13/14).

73 percent of the 55 fatalities had at least one comorbidity reported compared to 41 percent of 73 surviving cases. All deaths have been reported among adults except one in a 2-year-old child.

Discussion
MERS-CoV cases exposed in the Arabian Peninsula were identified in the European Union and in Tunisia mainly while seeking medical care. This has resulted in secondary transmission. The majority of travels from the Arabian Peninsula however, are destined to Asian countries which suggests that the risk of introductions exists also in Asia [26]. No cases have been reported there to date, despite enhanced surveillance in some countries. It is noteworthy that no infected cases have been detected outside the Arabian Peninsula since May 2013. The striking overrepresentation of men among cases in the 1st months balanced over time. This can be partly explained by the higher proportion of female HCW among recently reported nosocomial transmissions. In a similar fashion, the median age of cases has decreased.

Our assessment of the severity of the disease and outcomes is based on available data at the time of the reporting from the country and may result in under ascertainment of severe outcomes. At the same time, the proportion of cases admitted to intensive care and the CFR has decreased over time, which may be a reflection of enhanced surveillance activities.

"Superspreading" events or cases were interpreted as a key cause for the progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [27]. The large nosocomial cluster of MERS in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia involving up to 23 cases has some similarities with such events. It could have been caused by multiple zoonotic or human introductions in the community or inconsistencies in applying appropriate infection prevention measures in health facilities. It raises concerns about the 'superspreaders' as a source of extended transmission chains. The pandemic potential of MERS-CoV remains low. The basic reproduction number (R0) is estimated at 0.69, lower than the R0 for pre-pandemic SARS (0.80) and well below the epidemic threshold of 1 [28].

The significant proportion of caregivers likely infected in hospitals or at home played a role in transmission of MERS-CoV and is of concern. No secondary transmission has been associated with long-haul medical evacuation, suggesting that appropriate infection measures were applied and effective.

The fact that all but one of the primary cases in the known clusters are adult men originating from the Arabian Peninsula, suggests behavioural risk factors may play a role exposing them directly or indirectly to the reservoir of MERS-CoV. The severity of the diseases and fatal outcomes of the majority of the primary cases hinders effective exploration to identify risk factors.

Despite multiple efforts, no animal vectors or reservoirs have been identified as of yet with certainty. Exposure to camels has been reported for a few of the primary cases only.

The temporal distribution of cases suggests ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV on the Arabian Peninsula and the frequent appearance of nosocomial or familial clusters remains concerning. The number of new cases seems to have plateaued since April 2013.

Our data point towards a changing pattern of cases compared with the previously published case series [2-13] and with the review of the 1st 47 cases detected in SA [29]. More women and cases without comorbidities are being reported. The increased proportion of asymptomatic cases and the decreased CFR may reflect enhanced surveillance catching cases having remained unnoticed at the early stages of the epidemic.

Collaborative international efforts in the spirit of 'One health' are needed to identify the source of MERS-CoV and to describe the transmission paths into human populations on the Arabian Peninsula. With the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, taking place in October this year [2013] and attracting 1.8 million foreign and 1.4 million domestic visitors, international public health efforts to mitigate and possibly contain this outbreak need to be reinforced. Continued vigilance in healthcare systems receiving severely ill patients with respiratory symptoms from the Arabian Peninsula is warranted.

Updated Information on the Epidemiology of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection and Guidance for the Public, Clinicians, and Public Health Authorities, 2012-2013
---------------------------
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was 1st reported to cause human infection in September 2012 (1). In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee determined that MERS-CoV did not meet criteria for a "public health emergency of international concern," but was nevertheless of "serious and great concern" (2). This report summarizes epidemiologic information and provides updates to CDC guidance about patient evaluation, case definitions, travel, and infection control as of [20 Sep 2013].

As of [20 Sep 2013], a total of 130 cases from 8 countries have been reported to WHO; 58 (45 percent) of these cases have been fatal [Figure 1, Number of cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (58 fatal and 72 nonfatal) reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of 20 Sep 2013, by month of illness onset, worldwide, 2012-2013 can be found at the source URL]. All cases have been directly or indirectly linked through travel to or residence in 4 countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) [Figure 2, Confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (N = 130) reported to the World Health Organization as of [20 Sep 2013], and history of travel from in or near the Arabian Peninsula* within 14 days of illness onset -- worldwide, 2012-2013]. The median age of persons with confirmed MERS-CoV infection is 50 years (range: 2-94 years). The male-to-female ratio is 1.6 to 1.0. 23 (18 percent) of the cases occurred in persons who were identified as health-care workers. Although most reported cases involved severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, at least 27 (21 percent) involved mild or no symptoms. Despite evidence of person-to-person transmission, the number of contacts infected by persons with confirmed infections appears to be limited. No cases have been reported in the United States, although 82 persons from 29 states have been tested for MERS-CoV infection.

Potential animal reservoirs and mechanism(s) of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans remain unclear. A zoonotic origin for MERS-CoV was initially suggested by high genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses (3), and some recent reports have described serologic data from camels and the identification of related viruses in bats (4-6). However, more epidemiologic data linking cases to infected animals are needed to determine if a particular species is a host, a source of human infection, or both.

To date, the largest, most complete clinical case series published included 47 patients; most had fever (98 percent), cough (83 percent), and shortness of breath (72 percent). Many also had gastrointestinal symptoms (26 percent had diarrhea, and 21 percent had vomiting). All but 2 patients (96 percent) had one or more chronic medical conditions, including diabetes (68 percent), hypertension (34 percent), heart disease (28 percent), and kidney disease (49 percent). 34 (72 percent) had more than one chronic condition (7). Nearly half the patients in this series were part of a health-care-associated outbreak in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia (i.e., a population that would be expected to have high rates of underlying conditions) (8). Also, the prevalence of diabetes in persons aged greater than or equal to 50 years in Saudi Arabia has been reported to be nearly 63 percent (9). It remains unclear whether persons with specific conditions are disproportionately infected with MERS-CoV or have more severe disease.

CDC Guidance
Evaluating patients. CDC has changed its guidance to indicate that testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory pathogens* can be conducted simultaneously and that positive results for another respiratory pathogen should not necessarily preclude testing for MERS-CoV. Health-care providers in the United States should continue to evaluate patients for MERS-CoV infection if they develop fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula.** Providers also should evaluate patients for MERS-CoV infection if they have ARDS or fever and pneumonia, and have had close contact*** with a recent traveler from this area who has fever and acute respiratory illness.

CDC continues to recommend that clusters**** of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) be evaluated for common respiratory pathogens and reported to local and state public health departments. If the illnesses remain unexplained, particularly if the cluster includes health-care providers, testing for MERS-CoV should be considered, in consultation with state and local health departments. In this situation, testing should be considered even for patients without travel-related exposure. Additional information about CDC's interim guidance regarding who should be evaluated for MERS-CoV infection is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html.

Case definitions. Although CDC has not changed the case definition of a confirmed case, confirmatory laboratory testing now requires a positive polymerase chain reaction of at least 2, instead of one, specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a 2nd. CDC's definition of a probable case has been changed so that identification of another etiology does not exclude a person with an illness meeting this definition from being classified as having a probable case. Additional information about CDC's case definitions is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html.

Travel guidance. The peak travel season to Saudi Arabia is July through November [2013], coinciding with the religious pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah. CDC encourages pilgrims to consider recommendations from the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health regarding persons who should postpone their pilgrimages this year [2013], including persons aged greater than or equal to 65 years, children, pregnant women, and persons with chronic diseases, weakened immune systems, or cancer (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/coronanew/news/pages/news-2013-7-14-001.aspx External Web Site Icon). WHO advises that persons with preexisting medical conditions consult a health-care provider before deciding whether to make a pilgrimage (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20130725/en External Web Site Icon).

CDC continues to recommend that U.S. travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including MERS-CoV, by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. If travelers to the region have onset of fever with cough or shortness of breath during their trip or within 14 days of returning to the United States, they should seek medical care. They should tell their health-care provider about their recent travel. More detailed travel recommendations related to MERS-CoV are available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/coronavirus-arabian-peninsula.

Infection control. With multiple health-care-associated clusters identified (8,10), infection control remains a primary means of preventing and controlling MERS-CoV transmission. CDC has recently made checklists available that highlight key actions that health-care providers and facilities can take to prepare for MERS-CoV patients (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/preparedness/index.html). CDC's infection control guidance has not changed. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected MERS-CoV infection.

CDC has determined that federal isolation and quarantine are authorized for MERS-CoV under Executive Order 13295 (http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html).***** At this time, CDC is not restricting the movement of travelers with respiratory illness (that is not confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infection) arriving from the Arabian Peninsula. However, persons with illness meeting CDC's definition of a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection should remain in isolation until they are no longer considered to be contagious according to current guidance. Those who do not adhere to isolation requirements, or who intend to travel, may be subject to additional public health measures. CDC does not recommend quarantine of asymptomatic persons who were exposed to confirmed or probable cases. CDC generally recommends that persons with febrile respiratory illness delay travel until their symptoms resolve.

CDC has issued new guidance for care and management of MERS-CoV patients in the home and guidance for close contacts of these patients (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/hcp/home-care.html). Persons who are confirmed, or being evaluated for MERS-CoV infection, and do not require hospitalization for medical reasons should be isolated in their homes as long as the home is deemed suitable for isolation. CDC currently recommends MERS-CoV patients should be isolated at home until public health authorities or a health-care provider determine that they are no longer contagious. Persons who might have been exposed****** to MERS-CoV should be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms for 14 days after the most recent exposure. Asymptomatic exposed persons do not need to limit their activities outside the home. If persons exposed to MERS-CoV have onset of symptoms, they should contact a health-care provider as soon as possible and follow the precautions for limiting possible exposure of other persons to MERS-CoV.

More detailed MERS-CoV-related interim guidance about patient evaluation, case definitions, travel, and infection control is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html. This guidance might change as CDC learns more about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV. CDC will continue to post the most current information and guidance on its MERS-CoV website. State and local health departments with questions should contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100.

* Examples of respiratory pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia include influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Legionella pneumophila_.

** Countries considered in or near the Arabian Peninsula include Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestinian Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, UAE, and Yemen.

*** Close contact is defined as 1) any person who provided care for the patient, including a health-care worker or family member, or had similarly close physical contact; or 2) any person who stayed at the same place (e.g., lived with or visited) as the patient while the patient was ill.

**** In accordance with WHO guidance for MERS-CoV, a cluster is defined as "2 or more persons with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks, or recreational camp." Information available at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimRevisedSurveillanceRecommendations_nCoVinfection_27Jun13.pdf Adobe PDF file External Web Site Icon.

***** Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was added to Executive Order 13295 (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2003-04-07/pdf/WCPD-2003-04-07-Pg408.pdf Adobe PDF file External Web Site Icon) in response to the 2003 outbreak. SARS is defined under the executive order as a disease associated with fevers and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, transmitted from person-to-person predominantly by the aerosolized or droplet route, and, if spread in the population, would have severe public health consequences. MERS-CoV infection meets these syndromic criteria and therefore meets the criteria for a quarantinable communicable disease. SARS and MERS-CoV infections are caused by different but related coronaviruses.

****** Persons who might have been exposed to MERS-CoV include persons who care for or have close contact with someone who has MERS-CoV infection, persons who recently traveled to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, and persons who were identified as a result of a public health investigation of MERS-CoV infection cases.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, [20 Sep 2013]
------------------------------
Two patients earlier reported as laboratory-confirmed with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Italy in the Disease Outbreak News on [2 Jun 2013 available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_02_ncov/en/index.html and discussed in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (16): Italy ex Jordan, contact cases, WHO 20130602.1750425] are being reclassified as probable cases.

The reclassification follows further analysis of the laboratory tests performed in May 2013, which has shown that the 2 cases do not fulfill the current WHO case definition for a "confirmed case" for MERS-CoV. The 2 cases are the 2-year-old girl and a 42-year-old woman who were identified as close contacts of the index case who travelled from Jordan.

A "probable" designation by WHO criteria refers to patients who are considered to have a high likelihood of having been infected with MERS-CoV, but from whom adequate samples could not be obtained for complete testing according to the current criteria established for laboratory confirmation.

WHO recently updated the MERS-CoV interim laboratory testing recommendations [available at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_Lab_recos_16_Sept_2013.pdf].

Globally, from September 2012 to date [20 Sep 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 130 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 58 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[The above articles are good reviews of the epidemiology of the MERS-CoV known as of 20 and 25 Sep 2013. Excellent maps showing the geographic distribution of cases and, for those imported cases, the linkage to countries of epidemiologic association can be found at both the Eurosurveillance and MMWR review source URLs (Figures 1 and 2 respectively).

The Eurosurveillance article presents a changing epidemiology of the disease if one compares 2 time periods in 2013, March to May, and June to 25 Sep 2013 to demonstrate the epidemiologic changes. In attempting to explain the differences seen, this moderator was reminded of her favorite adage: "Seek, and ye shall find." One suspects that with the heightened awareness of the disease not unrelated to the nosocomial cluster in the Eastern Province, there was an increase in testing for the virus, including enhanced testing of contacts of known cases, resulting in the identification of cases with milder clinical illnesses.

Of note is that there have been no new cases of MERS-CoV confirmed since 18 Sep 2013.

The changing status of the contact cases reported in June 2013 from confirmed to probable cases reflects an adherence to a strict definition of laboratory confirmation of cases but does not discard these cases from a global count of confirmed and probable cases. - Mod.MPP
