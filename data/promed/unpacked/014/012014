3 anthrax cases registered in southern Kyrgyzstan (Batken)
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors in the Batken district of southern Kyrgyzstan have discovered 3
cases of anthrax.
The Kyrgyz Health Ministry's press service told Interfax that the 3 people
were infected while butchering a cow. "A study of the meat showed that the
animal was infected with anthrax. It had been bought from neighboring
Uzbekistan," the press service said. The 3 patients have the skin form of
the disease that poses no threat to their lives. All have been hospitalized.
Special disinfection and quarantine efforts have been launched in all
marketplaces in the district, and meat sales have been temporarily banned.
Individuals who had contact with the patients are now being screened.
"Last summer, 8 people contracted anthrax in southern Kyrgyzstan," the
press service noted [see ref. below].

[I think it must be a 1st for us to report a disease in a 2nd country based
on travelling livestock, although one knows of many instances in which it
has occurred, e.g., in Thailand with animals from Myanmar, and, migratory
birds. The background to this event is being sought from Bishtek and
Tashkent. Both countries report this disease at a low, but regular, level,
most often in cattle and sheep, and with human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
