The Los Lagos Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat], Sofia Torres, confirmed a new case of a hantavirus infection in the region, which brings to 6 the number of infected individuals, one of whom died.

This 6th case is a 13-year-old boy who presented with symptoms over the past weekend in the Puerto Montt Hospital, where he was then sent to the Roberto del Rio Hospital in Santiago.

The boy was in stable condition in that hospital in the capital and is being constantly monitored because of the possibility of requiring extra-corporial oxygenation.

The boy lives in the Lagunitas sector of the Puerto Montt community, but according to an interview with his family members, the possible place where he acquired his infection would be the Estaquilla sector of the Los Muermos community.

SEREMI Torres stated that, currently, there is an epidemiological team carrying out an environmental investigation.

So far in 2018, there are 6 confirmed cases (one of whom died) in the Los Lagos region in the Los Muermos (1 case), Puerto Montt (2), Osorno (1), and Cochamó (2).

[The conditions under which the boy acquired his hantavirus infection are not stated. Perhaps the current epidemiological investigations will provide that information when completed. The boy likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person, and when it is, it is only through very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
