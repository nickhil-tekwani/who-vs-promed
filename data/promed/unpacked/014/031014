Hand-foot-mouth disease is spreading in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC],
local authorities said. Some 3000 children in Viet Nam caught the
disease last year [2008] and at least 10 died.

Children's Hospital No. 1, for example, reported on Friday [11 Sep
2009] that 60 patients were under treatment for the disease, which is
caused by the enterovirus 71, with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers, and rashes.

Dr Truong Huu Khanh from the hospital said nearly 90 percent of the
children, mainly from other provinces, were admitted to the hospital
in already serious condition.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses
that belong to the enterovirus genus. This group of viruses includes
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.
Enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71, have also been associated
with HFMD and with outbreaks of the disease. Enterovirus 71 may be
associated with fatalities due to viral meningitis or encephalitis
(see <https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/index.html>).

During 2009, HFMD outbreak in Viet Nam started in April 2009, with
increasing numbers of patients reported in hospitals from Ho Chi Minh
City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh and An Giang
provinces (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth disease -
Viet Nam: RFI 20090411.1387).

Peaks of HFMD were usually during the dry seasons from March to May
and September to December. As of 22 May 2009, there were 50 children
infected with HFMD and 3 of them were in a serious condition (see
prior PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02)
20090524.1942). As of 12 May 2008, 2300 cases of HFMD had been
reported in Viet Nam with 10 fatalities during 2008 and most of the
reported cases were from the southern regions (see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20080516.1634).

Since the beginning of 2009 to 11 Sep 2009, there had been 60
patients under treatment for HFMD. Approximately 54 out of 60
children (90 percent) were in serious condition. The disease is
caused by enterovirus 71. There is no specific vaccine for the disease.
