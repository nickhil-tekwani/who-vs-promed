A primary outbreak of bird flu has been identified by the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BSAF) in the village of Trilistnik in Plovdiv. The disease was established in an industrial breeding establishment for laying hens and was confirmed by a laboratory test report, the agency said.

For the control and eradication of the disease, NVS [National Veterinary Service] has implemented all measures in accordance with current legislation. Humane killing and destruction of all birds kept on the affected holding is undertaken, followed by cleansing and disinfection. A 3-kilometer [2 mi] protection zone and a 10-kilometer [6 mi] surveillance zone around the outbreak of the disease are identified.

The movement of birds and their products into and out of the protection and surveillance zones is prohibited. In both areas, the marketing and movement of domestic, wild and other breeding birds and eggs, as well as the displacement of birds for the renewal of the wild game stock, are prohibited. Daily clinical examinations of birds kept in other settlements in the protection zone are performed.

Enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures in poultry farms as well as in water basins where the wild bird population is heavily concentrated.

NVS reminds that feed as well as feedstocks should be kept indoors, thus avoiding the possibility of wild feathered animals infecting the feed and hence the animals being infected with the virus.

At this stage there are no people affected and there is no danger to consumers. Influenza virus can cause mild respiratory disease. Possible contamination can occur when inhalation of dust from farms or in direct contact with people with infected birds.
