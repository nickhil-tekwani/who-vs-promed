INFECTION CONTROL - WASHINGTON, USA
===================================
Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 10:19:57 -0400
From: ROBARNES@aol.com

I am the Hospital Epidemiologist in the Fourth Corner of Washington State,
in the river valley near Vancouver BC [Canada]. Although we are on the
interstate corridor, we have not had much in the way of resistant nosocomial
bacteria, even though patients commute to Seattle in some instances of acute
medical illness.
We do have plenty of MRSA (methicillin-resistant _Staph. aureus_: 7% of
isolates) here, only 1/3 of which is nosocomial. The remainder appears most
commonly in the elderly from congregate care facilities.
We do have human granulocytic erlichiosis and a few other interesting
emerging pathogens up here, but not a lot in the way of multidrug-resistant
bacteria. Yet. Today.
This morning...
