Medecins San Frontieres (MSF)-France has vaccinated over 400 children against measles in the Peace Island Community, outside Monrovia. Peace Island is a slum and congested community located in district no. 10, Montserrado County. The initiative by the health charity group came in the wake of confirmed reports of the outbreak of measles in that area.

In an interview with this paper at the weekend [21-22 Mar 2015], a Physician Assistant in charge of the vaccination center, Mr Allen Cooper, disclosed that a 2-day vaccination campaign was launched in the community following an assessment carried out by both MSF-France and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. He stated that few cases of measles were identified and therefore MSF-France intervened to help save the children in the community. He said children from 6 months old to 5 years benefited from free immunization against measles.

"We came here along with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare recently and we identified few cases of measles after testing the specimens of the patients. During the screening process at the vaccine center, we basically noticed that 2 children had measles, and so, we immediately isolated them at the isolation unit," he stated.

At the same time, a nurse assigned at the center, Ihuoma Bondo, has urged parents, whose children have taken the vaccines, to seek medical attention at a hospital or clinic if their child/children experience negative reactions within the period of 2 weeks.

She said vaccines as usual may cause hotness in one's body temperature, and therefore, she suggested that parents or guardians should bathe their children showing this kind of sign with cold water. She encouraged parents or guardians to observe their children for "rashes or itching from now to [2 Apr 2015]," and also avoid "pressing the vaccine's hand with hot water."

"Vaccine can make the children skin hot and so, if you go home and observe it don't worry; just bathe the child with cold water and give the child paracetamol. Some people can react to vaccine or medicine too if the medicine does not agree with them; like for example, small itches or rashes will come on their skin.

"Don't rub vase on the place the vaccine was given to your children," Madam Bondo urged.

Mayak Malok, the head of health services for Maban County in South Sudan's Upper Nile state, said there is a measles outbreak among local citizens in the area. Mayak told Radio Tamazuj that cases of measles disease have been recorded at Banishowa and other neighbouring areas in Maban.

He said 2 children were killed by the disease and that about 4 others were admitted in Bunj Hospital for treatment. Mayak added about 430 children were vaccinated against 6 childhood diseases in IDPs [internally displaced persons] camps.

The health official previously attributed the spread of measles to movement of families without receiving good treatment.

Health authorities in Vancouver [British Columbia] have gone to great lengths drawing up a list of all individuals who may have come into contact with 2 high school students who were diagnosed with measles after flying home from Beijing [China]. But only about half that roster has been tracked down, meaning all British Columbians should ensure their immunizations are up to date, said Medical Health Officer Dr Reka Gustafson. "Every effort is being made to identify individuals. But it is important for people to know that is incomplete," said Gustafson, with Vancouver Coastal Health, on [Tue 24 Mar 2015]. "This is more than anything else a really important reminder that if you are out and about and breathing, you should have 2 doses of measles vaccine to be protected."

One boy and one girl, who attend high school in BC's Lower Mainland, were diagnosed with the highly contagious disease shortly after returning from a school trip over spring break. The pair arrived in Vancouver just before noon Saturday directly from China's capital city aboard Air China Flight CA991. Neither teenager was completely immunized from measles, and within a few days of each other they developed symptoms, said Gustafson.

She said the 1st teen became sick while in China and visited a doctor, but measles was not diagnosed. The person immediately visited a family physician upon arriving home, samples were taken and the health authority was contacted. Once home, the 2nd teen also noticed symptoms that might indicate measles. With knowledge that a travel companion had already been positively diagnosed, doctors concluded tests were warranted and a second diagnosis was confirmed.

Gustafson would not provide specific identifying details about the 2 students for privacy reasons. Both teens are now recovering. "It's very likely that they were both exposed at the same time. To some extent, this is a single event of importation, there just happened to be 2 cases."

The health authority contacted the airline and Public Health Agency of Canada, obtaining as much information as possible about the passengers seated in the nearest rows to the sick students. But much of the contact information was limited, tracing back to a travel agency as one example. In addition, some passengers would have flown on to other parts of Canada, Gustafson said.

She said their inability to contact potentially affected individuals, within the time most crucial for intervention, is what prompted the authority to issue a public notification. The airport would have been bustling when the students arrived, which means an untold number of people might be at risk, she said. Measles can be airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area, and does not require direct face-to-face contact for transmission.

But those facts should not be cause for undue concern, Gustafson said. "People do need to be aware that we live in a very international city, people come and go," she said. "We probably have many importations of communicable diseases that we don't know about." The authority has connected with everyone they could so far and will continue to reach out, she said. Those who have been contacted were informed they can get a shot of preventative vaccine within three days if never immunized or within six days if partially immunized.

Hundreds of measles cases broke out in BC's Fraser Valley in 2014, while only 17 cases were confirmed in the province in 2013. Doctors across Canada have been urging the public to get vaccinated after outbreaks in Quebec and Ontario over the past several months.

As of [23 Mar 2015], Toronto Public Health declared the measles outbreak over in Toronto. There were 10 lab-confirmed cases of measles in the city during the outbreak. Ensure you are protected against measles by reviewing your immunization record or talking to your health provider. In Ontario province, 19 measles cases were reported total in the outbreak with cases also reported in York, Niagara, Halton Regions, and most recently in Hamilton.

In neighboring Quebec, the measles outbreak case count has risen to 150, as of today [24 Mar 2015]. The cases are all linked and are all unvaccinated people, public health officials note.

Signs and symptoms suggestive of measles include: fever, cough, coryza (runny nose), conjunctivitis, Koplik spots (white spots on the inside of the mouth), followed by a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and then progresses down to the trunk and extremities which lasts about 6 days. Measles is highly contagious and is spread by droplets and direct contact with the nasal or throat secretions of an infected person. Measles can also be spread through the airborne route. A person with measles is infectious from four days before to four days after the onset of the rash. The incubation period is typically 10 days (range 7 to 21 days).

The measles outbreak, which started from Disneyland theme park, has reached to Solano County. Thus far, measles has infected nearly 123 people in 11 different counties of [California]. Some of these counties are San Bernardino, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Riverside.

The government health authorities have confirmed measles cases in 7 other states such as Utah, Washington, Michigan, Oregon, Colorado, Nebraska, Mexico, Arizona, and Nebraska as well.

California health authorities have reported 9 infant measles patients. However, the rest of the 60 percent cases of California were observed in people older than 20 years. In contrast, the disease has attacked nearly 34 people in Orange County. The rate of cases is relatively higher as compared to San Diego County and Los Angeles County. The health professionals tried really hard to find out the roots of the outbreak. Additionally, they kept a close eye on people who are at higher risk of the deadly disease in order to control the epidemic. Therefore, they warned parents not to take infants to public areas such as theme parks, airports, shopping malls and restaurants.

On the other hand, federal government has also issued age limit for measles vaccination. According to that list, 1st dose of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] should be given at 12 to 15 months of age. However, the 2nd dose is recommended between ages of 4 and 6.

The Florida Department of Health has confirmed measles in an adult international traveler who attended a conference in Kissimmee [Holiday Resort], Florida, at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center 16-17 Mar 2015. The traveler spent time in several central and south Florida counties. Most of the traveler's time was spent in Osceola County; however, the traveler also spent time in Miami-Dade, Orange, and Sarasota during the infectious period of 14-20 Mar 2015. The traveler did not visit any theme parks during his visit. The traveler was hospitalized between 20-24 Mar 2015 in Miami and after recovery left Florida by plane on 25 Mar 2015.

The department continues to work closely with health care professionals and organizations in an effort to maintain its current level of readiness to identify cases and respond to any diagnosed cases of measles in Florida. The department is also working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the organizer of the international conference to notify all conference attendees as well as all other establishments the traveler visited while infectious to identify potentially exposed individuals. In addition, Florida Department of Health monitors emergency room and urgent care center visits in order to rapidly identify and respond to any possible cases of measles in the state.

The symptoms of measles generally begin approximately 7 to 14 days after a person is exposed to someone with measles.

According to the Oklahoma State Department of Health [OSDH], a patient in Stillwater [Payne County] was recently diagnosed with the virus -- the 1st confirmed case in Oklahoma since 1997. The patient, who has traveled internationally, is the spouse of an Oklahoma State University student who lives off campus.

OSDH is working with the Payne County Health Department, OSU and local medical facilities to investigate possible exposure risks. According to OSDH, persons who visited the following Stillwater locations may have been exposed to the virus:

- Aldi (1188 N Perkins Rd) [13 Mar 2015]
- Crepe Myrtle Market (613 S Lewis) [13 Mar 2015]
- Food Pyramid (421 N Maine St) [13 Mar 2015]
- Boba Fusion Cafe (211 N Perkins Rd) [13 Mar 2015]
- China Wok (917 N Perkins Rd) [14 Mar 2015]
- Jimmy's Egg (811 W 6th Ave) [16 Mar 2015]
- University Health Services [17 or 19 Mar 2015]
- Will Rogers Airport [12 Mar 2015, from 9:30 pm - 1:30 am. A spokesperson for the City of Oklahoma City says the patient was a passenger on a United Airlines Flight from Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport [Thu 12 Mar 2015]. The flight arrive at the Will Rogers World Airport at 9:30 pm.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease, which can be spread up to 4 days before the onset of a rash until 4 days after the rash begins. The measles vaccine (MMR vaccine) is recommended for all children 12 to 15 months of age and again between 4 to 6 years of age. Boosters may be given at any age thereafter. 2 vaccine doses normally provide lifelong immunity.

Measles can cause pneumonia and other complications, especially in young children and adults older than 20. Pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems can experience serious problems from measles.

[Since Disney-related cases were first confirmed in December 2014, that outbreak has involved 146 cases, 130 of which involved people in California. The Montreal area has had at least 188 Disney-linked measles cases, according to local reports.

In addition to the Disney-linked outbreak, the United States has had unrelated outbreaks in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington state. The 4 outbreaks represent 89 percent of total cases this year (2015), according to the CDC. - Mod.CP

According to the reports above, the total as of 27 Mar 2015, is 183 cases from 19 states (new cases have been reported from California, Oklahoma, and Florida since the CDC update of 20 Mar 2015).

[9] WHO Western Pacific Region update

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-cambodia-and-brunei-eliminate-measles-31620/


One year after Australia, Macao (China), Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea were declared measles-free, the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region added Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Japan to the list of countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region that have successfully eliminated measles.

The Region has made substantial progress, with measles deaths dropping to 1500 in 2013 from 10 400 in 2000. Measles cases also dropped dramatically to 31 706 cases in 2013 from 177 052 cases in 2000.

"Measles elimination is achievable in the Western Pacific Region. Increased commitment, funding, and advocacy are all urgently required to immunize all children against measles, especially the most vulnerable in the hardest to reach communities," said Dr Shin Young-soo, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for the Western Pacific. "Recent progress is impressive, but we must do more to ensure that immunization programmes reach everyone and measles elimination continues to be a priority."

Measles elimination in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Japan was made possible because each of the 3 countries was able to achieve high coverage with 2 doses of measles vaccine either through routine immunization or immunization campaigns.

Worldwide, measles kills 400 people a day -- or about 16 deaths every hour, most of whom are children under the age of 5. "Measles is the most highly infectious disease known, and it is easily prevented with just 2 doses of measles vaccine," said Dr Sergey Diorditsa, Coordinator, Expanded Programme on Immunization for the WHO Western Pacific Region.
