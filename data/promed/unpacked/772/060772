Hepatitis A outbreak in Veracruz
--------------------------------
A hepatitis A outbreak in communities in Veracruz has just been
reported. Nearly 100 children have been infected because of lack of
preventive measures and appropriate public health services. Poor
sanitary conditions, together with deficient or non-existent municipal
public services and lack of preventive measures [vaccination?] are the
causes of these outbreaks of hepatitis A in Chumatlan communities, in
the central area of the state (Veracruz). The outbreak is affecting
more than 100 children, particularly students from 3 schools in the
Lazaro Cardenas and Santa Ana communities.

During the last few weeks, cases from Emiliano Zapata kindergarten and
elementary school have been reported, specifically 40 children and
also some additional cases were reported form Jaime Sabines high
school.

The Health Department has established a sanitary cordon and undertaken
a census involving every household, in order to detect any infected
persons. Dr. Pablo Anaya-Rivera, Health Secretary, said that proper
sanitary measures had already been taken and epidemic emergency units
had already been deployed in the affected areas. He also admitted that
as well as seasonal factors there had been deficiencies in public
services and poor waste disposal facilities, both or which were
contributing to the spread of the disease. Dr. Anaya-Rivera declined
to give exact figures for the number of infected persons 'in order not
to generate alarm', but residents of Santa Ana and Lazaro Cardenas
declared that there may be one hundred infected persons.

The residents in these communities complained that municipal
authorities gave some families small amounts of lime powder for use in
their septic tanks, but less than half of families where hepatitis A
cases had been reported had received this disinfectant. Dr.
Anaya-Rivera stated that his office is complying with its
responsibilities, and indicated that public services, such as supply
of potable water, adequate sewage systems and other facilities are the
responsibility of the local communities.

In addition the Education Secretary has confirmed that 41 students
have been reported to be infected with hepatitis A virus in Coxquihui
and Chumatlan municipalities.

[Currently hepatitis A virus infection is prevalent in many small
communities throughout Mexico due to seasonal factors, inadequate
sanitation and lack of clean water. Travelers intending to spend time
in Mexico should ensure that they have been vaccinated prior to
travel.
