Yemen's Health Ministry has warned of a measles epidemic in Saada
province, voicing fears of [possible deaths] due to measles
complications.

A report on the current situation in the province issued by the
Ministry said that [the number] of confirmed cases have reached 157
since the beginning of 2010, including 27 cases discovered among IDPs
(Internally Displaced Persons) in both Amran and Hajjah provinces and
113 cases in Sa'ada [province]. Other cases have been discovered in
other provinces.

The independent website Newsyemen said on Saturday [1 May 2010] that
all vaccination activities have been suspended due to the war in the
province, including vaccination of children who are at risk of
infectious diseases such as measles. The Health Ministry plans to
[improve the situation] by giving measles vaccine to IDPs under 15
years of age in collaboration with local authorities in the
neighboring provinces.

In 2008, the number of measles cases had declined to 8 cases, and
[no] deaths have been recorded since 2007, the report showed.

Measles [had been] the 4th cause of death among young children in
Yemen. The country was [preparing] to announce [eradication] of the
disease in 2010, but the campaign has been interrupted because of the
war.
