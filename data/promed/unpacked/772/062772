Kiwifruit bacterial canker pathogen survives on other species
-------------------------------------------------------------
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (PSA) can cause serious economic losses on _Actinidia_ spp. [and] has been, unfortunately, known internationally for several years now. Little is known about the ability of this bacterium to colonize other plant species and their implications on its spread.

The teams of Prof. Balestra, University of Tuscia, Italy, and of Prof. Zhu, Anhui Agricultural University, China, are conducting a large survey in China. [So far], 11 bacterial isolates [were identified from] 3 wild plant species (_Setaria viridis_, _Alternanthera philoxeroides_, _Paulownia tomentosa_) found close to _Actinidia_ plants affected by PSA. [The wild species showed] necrotic spots, similar to those caused by PSA on kiwifruit plants. All isolates were identified as PSA [and] all were positive by pathogenicity tests, both, on the species from which they were isolated and on cultivated _Actinidia_.

_S. viridis_ is an annual herb of the family Poaceae [grasses]; _A. philoxeroides_, known as "Alligator weed" for its preference for aquatic habitats, is of South American origin but widely distributed worldwide; _P. tomentosa_ is a deciduous tree native to China, now grown as an ornamental throughout the world.

This is the first evidence of PSA on wild plants. [It] raises new questions about the strategies [of PSA] to spread both locally and internationally. [It is also relevant for] the measures to be adopted to control spread of kiwifruit bacterial canker [such as] the destruction of weeds like _S. viridis_ [which is] very common in orchards and widely distributed in most kiwifruit producing countries.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities) and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected. Spread with infected fruit cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available. Identification of alternative hosts, as reported above, is an important finding since these species can be expected to serve as pathogen reservoirs; additional potential hosts would need to be investigated as well.

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation (including both crop and weed plants) to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen) and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a new streptomycin resistant strain is currently emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

An outbreak of Psa in Italy in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa-V. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa-V. Strains from China and New Zealand appear to be more similar to each other than to strains from Italy. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206).
