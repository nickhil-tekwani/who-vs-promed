The mysterious viral illness affecting children could be [an outbreak]
of hand, foot and mouth disease. Fiji College of General Practitioners
President Dr Ram Raju said this was a disease caused by a
coxsackievirus [among other possible enteroviruses - Mod.CP] which
infected the human intestines (and stool). However, he said this was
yet to be [confirmed] by the virus lab.

"All of the advice and notes that were published are correct, and
people should take heed of the warnings on strict health and hygiene
aspects," Dr Raju said. "They should be seen by doctors for
confirmation and treated accordingly."

Ministry of Health spokesman Peni Namotu said the Central/Eastern
Divisions recorded the highest number of cases of the mystery illness,
whose symptoms included high fever, rashes or blisters on the palm of
the hands, soles of the feet and around the mouth, and with seizures
in severe cases. He said given the hot season we were experiencing,
they expected more children to be affected. Mr Namotu said more
information on the virus would be made public this week.

"There have been about 20-30 cases per month for October and November
[2010] seen in the children's hospital and health centres, with a
handful requiring admissions because of associated seizure (fits),
high fever and other complications," he said in an earlier statement.

[Readers are referred to the moderator's comment in the preceding
ProMED-mail report for a detailed description of the symptoms and
characteristics of hand, foot and mouth disease. The occurrence of
seizures (fits) in a minority of affected children suggests that the
agent responsible for this outbreak may be enterovirus 71, which has
been prevalent in Southeast Asia in recent years (and infrequent in
North America) and responsible for meningitis and encephalitis in a
few children. The outcome of the diagnostic tests are awaited.
