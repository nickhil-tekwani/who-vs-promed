LEGIONELLOSIS - GREECE: REQUEST FOR INFO
========================================
Source: Communicable Disease Report p.86 Vol 7 No 10, 7 Mar 1997
Legionella: three patients had pneumonia (M 50y, M 67y, and F 60y), one (M
24y) had non-pneumonic infection. Two cases became ill in 1996 and two in
1997. Two cases were associated with travel abroad: Spain 1, Greece 1.
[We reported the 1996 & 1997 outbreaks in Spain on ProMED-mail, but this is
the first we've heard of an infection acquired in Greece. It is not clear
from this report whether that case was contracted in 1996 or 1997. Can
anyone give us more information? Is anyone from EWGLI (European Working
Group on Legionella Infection) reading this? - Mod.JW.]
