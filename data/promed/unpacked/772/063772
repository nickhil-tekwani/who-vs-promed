The Health Ministry will adopt Cuba's preventive measures in containing
dengue following a successful pilot project at Pekan Nanas. The town,
located between Johor Baru and Pontian [in the state of Johor recorded
only two dengue cases last year, a 67 per cent drop as compared with
1997. This despite the fact that the number of cases in the country
increased by 40percent last year.
Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the Cuban method would be
gradually carried out in high-risk areas nationwide. "The Cuban method
involves a total community effort to contain the disease under a
structural organisation, which is the setting up of a dengue control
operation room. It also emphasizes strong co-operation among the
ministry, Health Department and the local authorities, as well as
greater enforcement and penalty," he said.
Chua said the ministry's decision to look at Cuba's experience was
because it was the only country which had succeeded in combating the
disease.

[If the report is correct, [and Pekan Nanas only had 6 dengue cases
(?lab-confirmed) in 1997 when the pilot project was conducted there,
it was obviously the wrong place for a pilot project.
The so-called Cuban method aims at eradication of _Aedes aegypti_. After
the dengue outbreak in 1981, Cuba started the eradication campaign which
combined the reduction of larval habitats and modification of
drinking-water storage tanks with a variety of other interventions,
including legislative measures to encourage householder compliance,
health education, biological control and chemical control. It is
interesting to note the hugh manpower and equipment involved in the
campaign: 15 provincial directors, 60 entomologists, 27 general
supervisors, 729 team leaders, 3801 inspectors, 1947 controllers and
1200 trucks. Cuba spent US$43 million for this campaign.
Following the campaign, which did not totally eradicate the mosquito,
dengue transmission was not detected in Cuba between 1981 and the end of
1996. Dengue reemerged in Cuba in 1997 after 15 years of absence because
of increasing migration by people from disease-endemic regions, a high
level of vector infestation, and the breakdown of eradication measures.
Community participation in dengue control has been tried in several
countries in the past. The approach usually failed because it was not
sustainable - Mod.CYC
