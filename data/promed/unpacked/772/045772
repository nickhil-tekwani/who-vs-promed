Several high school students in North Vancouver [British Columbia] have become ill after eating pot-infused edibles resulting in one Grade 10 student being sent to hospital, according to police.

North Vancouver RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) spokesperson Cpl. Richard De Jong said police will be working with the North Vancouver School District to educate students and parents to ensure school properties are drug free. "Making these edibles widely available and normalized can be very tempting to children," De Jong said. "The allure of these marijuana edibles, which taste and look like simple sweets, makes them especially risky."

Photos released to media show 2 different marijuana-infused snacks including a Rice Krispy Square and brownies that were confiscated by police.

Children who ingest marijuana can become ill, RCMP said, with how sick they get depending on the child's age, weight, the potency of the drug, and how much is eaten.

"To a young person the risk of ingesting edible marijuana is that the danger is camouflaged by the product looking safe and familiar," De Jong said.

[Marijuana is becoming more commonplace as more places toy with the idea of legalizing it. There are dangers with this drug. It is likely that incidents such as this will become more common.

Foods such as the brownie or crunchy rice treats mentioned above often go by such names as magic brownies or space crispy treats. Feeling the effects of marijuana takes longer when it is eaten than when it is smoked. People, especially teenagers may tend to eat more of the attractive sweet treat and can have a longer lasting "high" that does not wear off as fast but can cause serious illness.
