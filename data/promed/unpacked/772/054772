A Western Australia (WA) Department of Health media release on 22 Apr 2022 provides the information on the meningococcal serogroups of the other cases (https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2022/April/Adult-with-meningococcal-disease).

"To date in 2022, 5 meningococcal cases have been reported in WA; 3 were serogroup B, and 2 were serogroup Y."

The Department of Health today [22 Apr 2022] reported that an elderly person has been diagnosed with meningococcal serogroup Y disease and is currently in hospital.

Meningococcal disease is an uncommon, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood and/or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain, and occasionally of other sites, such as the throat, lungs, or large joints.

To date in 2022, 5 meningococcal cases have been reported in WA; 3 were serogroup B, and 2 were serogroup Y. In 2021, a total of 10 meningococcal cases were reported, and there were no deaths.

There are 2 types of meningococcal vaccines available: one protects against 4 serogroups of the meningococcal disease (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) and the other protects against serogroup B.

The MenACWY vaccine is offered free to all children at 12 months of age. In addition, the MenACWY vaccine is offered to all Year 10 students, with a free catch-up program for 15-19-year-olds.

Due to a higher rate of meningococcal disease in Aboriginal children in WA, the MenACWY vaccine is offered free to Aboriginal children from age 6 weeks to 12 months of age. The menB vaccine is free for all Aboriginal children aged up to 2 years of age. Both vaccines are also free for people of all ages with certain medical risk conditions.

Meningococcal bacteria are not easily spread from person to person. The bacterium is present in droplets discharged from the nose and throat when coughing or sneezing but is not spread by saliva and does not survive more than a few seconds in the environment. [This statement is not true. Please see my comments in the prior ProMED post, Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (WA) RFI 20220423.8702784. - Mod.ML]

Meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly in the back of the nose and throat by about 10-20% of the population at any one time. Very rarely, the bacteria invade the bloodstream or tissues and cause serious infections.

Sometimes -- but not always -- symptoms may be accompanied by the appearance of a spotty red-purple rash that looks like small bleeding points beneath the skin or bruises.

Symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease may include high fever, chills, headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and severe muscle and joint pains. Young children may not complain of symptoms, so fever, pale or blotchy complexion, vomiting, lethargy (inactivity), poor feeding, and rash are important signs.

Although treatable with antibiotics, meningococcal infection can progress very rapidly, so it is important that anyone with these symptoms seeks medical attention urgently.

With appropriate treatment, most people with the disease recover, although around 5-10% will die, and around 15% may experience long-term complications such as hearing loss, limb amputations, or brain damage.

[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for submitting the official report on this cluster of 5 meningococcal meningitis cases in Western Australia in 2022 (see item 2 above).

We are told that of the 5 cases of meningococcal meningitis occurring so far this year [2022] in Western Australia, 2 were serogroup Y and 3 were serogroup B. We are not told if there are any epidemiological links among the cases with the same serogroup. More information on this cluster of cases in Western Australia from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Western Australia, covering the entire western 1/3 of Australia, is mostly arid, with its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia). - Mod.ML
