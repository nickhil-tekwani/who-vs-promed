Correction to part 5 of Avian influenza, human - Eurasia (45): multicountry

"When we get a positive, we're sure," Alan Hay at the NIMR told New
Scientist. "But when we get a negative, we aren't." One problem is
getting a sample with virus in it. The amount of virus present during
the course of bird flu in humans varies more than with human flu. And
test samples are usually mucus from the nose or throat. But because
H5N1 is a bird virus, it prefers the higher temperatures -- and the
more bird-like cell-surface molecules -- of the lower lungs.
But sometimes in other labs, Hay says, positive diagnoses have later
been found to be false. The London lab has re-tested samples from 21
people that Turkey's central laboratory had declared positive for
bird flu. Only 12 were confirmed, including all 4 known fatalities.
The now-negative samples might have degraded between tests. "We have
to look carefully at the victims' symptoms and circumstances before
we decide," says Hay. But if it turns out there were only 12 cases in
Turkey, that makes the death rate -- one in 3 -- very similar to the
most recent wave of cases in Vietnam, suggesting the virus has not
yet become better adapted to humans.
But leaving the diagnostic tests to the world's scattered experts
takes time, for local approval, transportation and then testing. "In
the early days of an epidemic, when it is not clear whether the virus
is in a country or not, it is important that tests be completely
reliable," says leading flu expert Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus
University in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. "Better a little delay
than a result you aren't sure of."
