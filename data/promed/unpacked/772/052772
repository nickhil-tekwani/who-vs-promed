A 16-year-old boy has been confirmed as the country's 12th human
avian influenza case. Health ministry official Hariadi Wibisono was
quoted by Agence France Presse as saying that the condition of the
boy, who was admitted to the state hospital in West Java's provincial
capital Bandung on 15 Nov 2005, was good but he was infected.
"Tests (on blood) taken from the 16-year-old boy, both locally and by
the World Health Organization (WHO), show that he is a bird flu
patient, he said. "We have received news that his condition is quite
good and it is hoped that he can survive," he added.
7 fatalities from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza have been
confirmed in Indonesia by the WHO, but more than a dozen suspected
bird flu deaths have been reported. Health officials are waiting for
WHO confirmation of local tests which showed that a 35-year-old man
who died on 19 Nov 2005 was the country's 8th fatality. 4 other
Indonesians have been confirmed as carrying the virus but have either
recovered or are still receiving treatment.
Meanwhile, health minister Siti Fadilah Supari said on Saturday that
the mass production of Tamiflu in the country would start in 3-5
months. The minister said the government would appoint state-owned
pharmaceutical companies to make Tamiflu under the generic name
oseltamivir phosphate. "It could be Kimia Farma or Indofarma," she
said. Siti said Indonesia had obtained permission from the
distributor of Tamiflu, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche AG, which
holds the patent for production, to produce the drug only for the
domestic market. The government will produce about 20 million Tamiflu
tablets, she added. "The drug will only be produced according to our
needs or a minimum of 10 percent of the country's population (of
around 220 million people). At present, we have 800 000 tablets
provided by donor countries such as Australia, Japan and Singapore,"
Siti said. Siti said her office had discussed with India, China and
South Korea the possible provision of raw materials for Tamiflu
production here. "We'll get confirmation from them within 2 days,"
she added. Kimia Farma president director Gunawan Pranoto said his
company was ready to produce Tamiflu, should it be appointed by the government.

Avian Influenza Situation in Indonesia & China - WHO Update 44
--------------------------------------------------
Indonesia
---------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed a further case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a
16-year-old boy from West Java Province. He developed symptoms of
fever and cough on 6 Nov 2005, followed by breathing difficulties a
few days later. He was hospitalized on 16 Nov and remains in stable condition.
A field investigation of this case determined that 2 siblings had
died 5 days before his hospitalization. His 2 brothers, aged 7 and 20
years, had onset of illness on 3 Nov 2005 and died on 11 Nov,
following symptoms of fever and breathing difficulty. The presumptive
diagnosis was typhoid fever. No samples were taken before burial,
which precludes definitive diagnosis. WHO reports
laboratory-confirmed cases only. No other cases of influenza-like
illness were detected in the 80 households of the village.
The field investigation found that chickens in the family household
had died during the 2 weeks preceding onset of illness in the
deceased brothers. Samples from animals have been collected for
testing and the investigation continues. The newly confirmed case
brings the total number in Indonesia to 12. Of these cases, 7 were fatal.
China
-----
At the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO is
participating in a joint mission to Anhui Province to investigate
circumstances surrounding the recent detection of 2 human cases of
H5N1 infection in that province. Both cases, which were confirmed by
laboratory tests earlier this month, occurred in female farmers aged
24 and 35 years. Both cases were fatal. The team will be gathering
information about the sources of exposure in these 2 cases and will
also assess the effectiveness of public health measures introduced in
the areas. The 2 cases lived some distance apart; no link between the
2 cases is thought to exist.
China has recently experienced a recurrence of outbreaks of highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry. Beginning in mid-October
2005, officials have reported 25 fresh outbreaks in poultry in 9
provinces. To date, the country has reported 3 laboratory-confirmed
cases of human infection, of which 2 were fatal.

East Asia: Many H5N1 Cases Clustered in families
------------------------------------------------
More than 1/3 of the human cases of H5N1 avian influenza that
occurred over a 19-month period were clustered within families,
suggesting the possibility that some family members caught the virus
from others, according to a recent report.
41 of 109 cases (38 percent) identified between January 2004 and July
2005 occurred in 15 families, with between 2 and 5 cases per family,
according to the report by Sonja J. Olsen and colleagues, published
as a letter in the November issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases
[Olsen SJ, Ungchusak K, Sovann L, et al. Family clustering of avian
influenza A (H5N1). Emerg Infect Dis 2005;11(11):1799-1801
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no11/05-0646.htm>].
Olsen works in Thailand for the International Emerging Infections
Program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Most human cases of avian flu are believed to have stemmed from
exposure to sick poultry. The virus has not yet shown an ability to
spread easily between people, which is seen as the key missing
prerequisite for an H5N1 pandemic.
Researchers previously identified one cluster, involving a young Thai
girl and her mother and aunt in September 2004, as the probable
result of person-to-person transmission. Too little information is
available to conclude whether the virus spread from person to person
in any of the other families, the new report says.
Family clusters don't necessarily mean the virus is spreading from
person to person, the report notes. They may simply mean that
relatives were exposed to H5N1-infected poultry at the same time.
However, in 3 family clusters, all in Viet Nam, the 1st and 2nd
patients fell ill more than a week apart, which suggests that they
probably didn't acquire the virus from the same source at the same
time, the report says.
The authors also found that family clusters were slightly more common
in the period from December 2004 through July 2005 than they were in
the preceding year: 9 clusters in 243 days, or 3.7 per 100 days,
versus 6 clusters in 365 days, or 1.6 per 100 days (relative risk,
2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 6.3). The difference was
similar when the researchers compared the period from December 2004
through July 2005 with the same 8-month period a year earlier.
Although this increase was not significant, the authors write, "We
believe any cluster of cases is of great concern and should be
promptly and thoroughly investigated because it might be the first
indication of viral mutations resulting in more efficient
person-to-person transmission."
The researchers defined a family cluster as 2 or more family members
with laboratory-confirmed H5N1 avian flu or 2 or more family members
with severe pneumonia or respiratory death, when at least one member
had confirmed H5N1.
Of the 41 patients in the 15 family clusters, 25 (61 percent) died,
the report says. Another 4 patients recovered, while 3 were never
sick even though they tested positive for the virus. The outcomes for
the other 9 patients were unknown.
The article says that family clusters are still occurring, but they
"do not appear to be increasing as a proportion of total cases."
In line with previous reports, the authors also note a decline in the
overall death rate for human cases: 32 of 44 cases (73 percent) from
December 2003 through November 2004, versus 23 of 65 cases (35
percent) from December 2004 through July 2005.

[Family clusters can be and probably were the result of common
exposures. If the exposure was environmental (contact with poultry
excrement or diseased poultry in the household compound), then the
timing of each exposure may have varied. The majority of these
family clusters had dates of onset consistent with common exposures
rather than successive generations of cases. The paucity of cases in
health care workers seems to mitigate against person-to-person
transmission as a main explanation for these clusters. One suspects
there is the added artifact that there is now a higher index of
suspicion leading to this epidemiologist's favorite maxim -- "seek
and ye shall find". - Mod.MPP]
