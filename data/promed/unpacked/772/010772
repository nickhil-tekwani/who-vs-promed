[These 2 newly reported laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are the 1st reports of new cases in Saudi Arabia in the past 5 days. With these newly reported cases, the total number of MERS-CoV confirmed infections in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 835, including 358 deaths (case fatality rate of 42.9 percent).

The 3 newly announced recoveries involve a 91-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, who was reported as a confirmed case on 9 Jan 2015, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition and to have a history of animal exposure during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The 2nd recovered case, the 71-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, was most likely the individual who was reported as a newly confirmed case on 3 Dec 2014, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition and had no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of illness. The 3rd recovered case, the 80-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, may be the individual reported on 8 Jan 2015, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition, with no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of illness.
