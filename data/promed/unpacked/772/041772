["The global situation of African swine fever (ASF) is of concern to many regions around the globe due to the current epizootic situation causing substantial losses and sanitary barriers for trade of animals and their products. Since no vaccine exists against ASF and none is expected in the near future, risk management should focus on prevention of the disease through reducing the risk of virus introduction and exposure to potential sources as well as by the adequate implementation of biosecurity procedures" http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/state-of-play-of-the-global-animal-health-situation/.
