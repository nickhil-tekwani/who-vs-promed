Wild Poliovirus Type 1 and Type 3 Importations --
15 Countries, Africa, 2008-2009
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative began in
1988; by 2006, indigenous transmission of wild
poliovirus (WPV) type 2 infection had been
interrupted globally, and indigenous transmission
of type 1 and 3 (WPV1 and WPV3) infection had
been interrupted in all but 4 countries worldwide
(Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan) (1).
Despite this success in controlling indigenous
transmission, during 2002-2006, 20 previously
polio-free countries* in Africa and Asia had
importations of WPV1 originating from Nigeria
(2--4), and 3 polio-free countries in Africa had
WPV1 importations originating from India (1). By
the end of 2007, control efforts in all countries
except Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), Niger, and Sudan had stopped
transmission of WPV1 caused by these
importations. However, during 2008-2009, multiple
importations of WPV from countries with ongoing
transmission resumed in Africa. This report
describes 32 WPV importations into 15 African
countries, resulting in 96 polio cases during
January 2008 - March 2009 and persistent WPV
transmission in 5 previously polio-free African
countries (5). As with the 2002-2006 resurgence,
all of the importations originated from Nigeria
or India, but more rapid WPV identification and
response resulted in substantially fewer polio
cases than reported during 2002-2006. Sensitive
surveillance and continued rapid response
supplemental immunization activities (SIAs)** are
key to limiting further WPV spread, interrupting
the outbreaks, and allowing the polio prevention
focus in Africa to return to eradicating polio in
countries with persistent WPV transmission.

WPV Importations, 2008-2009
---------------------------
Comprehensive genomic sequencing provided by the
global polio laboratory network (6) allows
tracing of the origins of virus importations and
estimation of the duration of circulation in a
chain of transmission.*** An importation event is
defined as detection of one or more polio cases
in a country resulting from WPV transmission that
genetic analysis shows to have 1st circulated in
another country. An outbreak associated with an
importation event is defined as 2 or more polio
cases caused by WPV genetically related to the
identified imported WPV case with earliest onset.

During January 2008 - March 2009, 32 importations
of WPV1 and WPV3 resulted in 96 polio cases in 15
African countries (Figure, Table 1). Of these, 29
WPV importations originated from Nigeria, with
WPVs either imported directly or after
transmission through another country, resulting
in 68 polio cases. 3 WPV importations originated
from India, either imported directly or after
transmission through another country, resulting
in 28 cases. As of [24 Mar 2009], multiple
outbreaks resulting from importations were
ongoing. 3 regions of Africa were affected by
importations during 2008-2009: West Central
Africa, the Horn of Africa, and South Central Africa.

West Central Africa. During 2008-2009, increased
circulation of WPV1 in Nigeria resulted in WPV1
importations into 8 countries. WPV1 was imported
directly from Nigeria or indirectly through
neighboring countries into Benin, Burkina Faso,
Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo
(Figure, Table 1). The number of reported polio
cases to date resulting from a single importation
event in West Central Africa during 2008-2009
ranged from one to 7 (Table 1). Niger reported 5
WPV1 and 5 WPV3 importation events originating
from Nigeria; of these, subsequent spread within
Niger was identified for 3 events. One WPV1
importation into Chad from Nigeria occurred in
2008. In addition, persistent circulation of WPV
imported into Chad and Niger from Nigeria before
2008 was detected during 2008-2009 (Table 2).

The Horn of Africa. During 2008, 2 WPV3
importations into western Sudan occurred. The
WPV3 in both cases originated from Nigeria and
transmitted through Chad, and resulted in 2
isolated polio cases with no evidence of further
spread (Table 1). Other cases occurred in the
Horn of Africa during 2008 that were traceable to
previous importations. In 2003, a WPV1
importation event originating in Nigeria caused
an outbreak of 51 polio cases in Chad.
Transmission was then imported to Sudan in
mid-2004, resulting in 147 polio cases in that
country during 2004-2005.**** Subsequent related
transmission occurred in 7 other countries
(Eritrea, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, and Yemen) (2-4). The Sudan
outbreak subsided, and no additional related WPV1
polio cases attributable to the 2004 importation
into Sudan were detected until April 2008, after
which 53 additional cases were detected: 3 cases
in Ethiopia, 2 in northern Kenya, 5 in Uganda
(Table 1), and 43 in Sudan itself (Table 2).
Since 2004, a total of 190 polio cases in Sudan
have resulted from the 2004 importation (Table 2), despite multiple SIAs.

South Central Africa. 2 WPV1 importation events
and one WPV3 event in Angola, all originating
from India, resulted in WPV transmission during
2008-2009. An outbreak in Angola that followed
WPV1 importation in 2005 ended in 2007 with 19
confirmed cases but led to 58 cases in DRC during
2006-2008***** and 3 cases in the Central African
Republic in 2008 (Table 1). A 2nd WPV1
importation into Angola originating from northern
India was associated with 15 polio cases in
Angola during April 2007 - February 2009 (Table
2). A WPV3 importation, also originating from
northern India, resulted in 24 polio cases in
Angola and one case in DRC in 2008 (Figure, Table 1).

Vaccination Coverage
--------------------
Vaccination histories of children aged 6-59
months with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) for
which specimen testing has not indicated WPV
infection (i.e., nonpolio AFP [NPAFP]) have been
used as a surrogate estimate of oral polio
vaccine (OPV) coverage with greater than or equal
to 3 total OPV doses of the overall target
population. The median percentage of coverage for
children aged 6-59 months with NPAFP in countries
affected by importations was 74 percent in 2008
(range: 54 percent - 90 percent) (Table 1) (2).

Timeliness of Detection and Response
------------------------------------
In the 15 countries with 32 importation events
during 2008-2009, the median interval from onset
of paralysis in the 1st identified case to
laboratory confirmation of polio was 31.5 days
(range: 10-61 days) (Table 1), substantially
lower than the median of 51 days reported during
2002-2005 polio resurgence (2). Similarly, the
median interval from laboratory confirmation to
1st large-scale vaccination response was 27.5
days (range: 1-91), lower than the median of 37
days reported during 2002-2005 (2). Response SIAs
in Africa in 2008 were synchronized among 12
countries. After detection in 2009 of new polio
cases in Kenya and Uganda, synchronized SIAs for
these and neighboring countries were conducted in
March and are planned again for April and May.

Persistent Transmission After Importation
-----------------------------------------
A total of 5 previously polio-free countries
(Angola, Chad, DRC, Niger, and Sudan) had WPV
importation events before 2008 that resulted in
persistent transmission for greater than or equal
to 12 months, extending into the period 2008-2009
(Table 2). As an indicator of weaker routine and
SIA vaccination in these 5 countries, the median
proportion of children aged 6-59 months with
NPAFP and a vaccination history of greater than
or equal to 3 total OPV doses during 2008 was 64
percent, compared with 75 percent for all other
countries with cases following importation during
2008-2009. Among these 5 countries, Angola, Chad,
and Sudan have been the source of multiple WPV
importations to neighboring countries and also
have reported polio cases in their own countries
since November 2008. Deficiencies in AFP
surveillance****** and SIA implementation in
certain subnational areas noted in technical
reviews have not been corrected in the three
countries. Efforts are under way to strengthen
AFP surveillance and to enhance SIA
implementation in these countries through
examination of operations by technical advisory
committees, improved oversight by international
consultants, and strengthened planning and
supervision of SIA and routine vaccination delivery.

Editorial Note:
---------------
During January 2008 to March 2009, 4 countries in
Africa (Angola, Chad, Nigeria, and Sudan) were
the source of repeated WPV importation into other
countries on the continent. In Angola, Chad, and
Sudan, indigenous WPV circulation appeared
interrupted before 2002, but ongoing transmission
was reestablished during 2004-2008 after WPV
importation (2). In Angola, Chad, Nigeria, and
Sudan, health infrastructure is weak, routine
vaccination coverage in certain areas is low, and
multiple SIAs have failed to reach a substantial
proportion of children in critical locales
because of inadequate planning and
implementation. Angola, Chad, and Sudan all have
experienced civil war in recent years; Chad and
Sudan continued to have civil unrest during 2008-2009.

Nigeria has been the major reservoir of both WPV1
and WPV3 circulation for further spread in Africa
during 2008-2009 and of WPV1 during 2002-2006
(2-4). Indigenous WPV transmission has never been
interrupted in Nigeria. Chronically weak routine
vaccination and SIA implementation were
compounded during 2003-2004 by a decrease in
vaccine acceptance and an increase in WPV
transmission; during that period, misconceptions
about the safety of OPV led to loss of public
confidence and suspension of SIAs in some
northern states (8). The continuing polio
prevention challenge in Nigeria is being
addressed through a reinvigorated federal
government effort to engage local community
leadership and enhanced state and local
government oversight of SIA implementation (8).

During 2005-2008, Angola received WPV
importations on 3 occasions from India and was
the source of polio cases in the DRC during
2006-2008, the Central African Republic in 2008,
and Namibia in 2006 (1,9). The exact modes of WPV
transmission from India to Angola have not yet
been identified, but studies are under way to
determine what travel factors might be
associated. Although WPV3 is less commonly
associated with importation events than WPV1
(which is more likely to cause paralytic disease
and have a wide geographic spread), both
long-distance importation of WPV3 and
transmission across country borders occurred in Africa during 2008-2009.

The outbreaks associated with WPV importations
during 2008-2009 have tended to be smaller than
those observed during 2002-2005, when 47
importation events originating from Nigeria
affected 16 countries in Africa and resulted in
1335 polio cases (2). The fewer number of polio
cases resulting from the more recent importations
likely can be attributed to more timely
laboratory confirmation (2), more rapid
initiation of SIAs, and improved coverage with
OPV in the targeted population. A surrogate
indicator of OPV coverage is the percentage of
children aged 6-59 months with NPAFP who have
received greater than or equal to 3 total doses
of OPV; in the 15 countries affected by WPV
importation during 2008-2009, the median was 74
percent, (range: 54 percent - 90 percent) in 2008
compared with 55 percent (range: 31 percent - 83
percent) for these same countries in 2004.
Critical to early recognition of WPV importation
and timely response is a sensitive AFP
surveillance system that meets WHO performance
criteria at the lowest subnational level.

Early recognition and response to WPV
transmission limit the size of affected areas
within a country, and enable more rapid control
of an outbreak (10). SIAs are planned to continue
in these affected countries and neighboring areas
in 2009. WPV importations from reservoir
countries into polio-free areas will continue to
occur until transmission is interrupted globally.
The risk for importation is greatest for
countries adjacent to those countries where WPV
transmission continues; however, globalized
transportation and international migration pose a
risk for WPV reintroduction for all countries.
Recent findings of WPV in sewage samples in
Switzerland and Egypt, where no polio cases have
been detected since 1984 and 2004, respectively,
confirm that long-distance importations can occur
and that high levels of vaccination coverage
limit local transmission (5,6). All polio-free
countries are advised to maintain sensitive,
efficient AFP surveillance systems in all areas
to detect importations rapidly and to maintain
sufficient levels of immunity against
polioviruses through routine vaccination programs
or, where necessary, SIAs. National authorities
should prepare and update plans for timely,
large-scale, high-quality response SIAs should importations occur (10).

* Countries with no evidence of indigenous WPV
transmission for greater than or equal to 1 year
and subsequent cases determined to be of external
origin by genomic sequencing analysis.

** Mass campaigns conducted for a brief period
(days to weeks), during which 1 dose of oral
poliovirus vaccine is administered to all
children aged less than 5 years, regardless of vaccination history.

*** The sequence of the complete VP1 coding
region is determined by using automated
cycle-sequencing procedures described previously
(7) and by comparing the resulting sequences with
those in a database of all recent poliovirus
isolates. The origins of virus importation are
then derived via phylogenetic analysis.

**** In Sudan during 2004-2005, transmission of
another chain of WPV1 accounted for 5 additional
polio cases, and a previously undetected lineage
of WPV3 accounted for 3 other polio cases.

***** Eighteen polio cases resulted from 3
separate WPV1 importations into DRC from Angola
during 2006-2007. A fourth importation of WPV1
into DRC resulted in 40 cases during December 2006-August 2008 (Table 2).

****** AFP surveillance quality is monitored by
performance indicators that suggest the ease by
which any WPV transmission will be detected. The
current World Health Organization (WHO) targets
are a NPAFP detection rate of greater than 2
cases per 100 000 population aged less than 15
years and adequate stool specimen collection from
greater than 80 percent of AFP cases, in which 2
specimens are collected greater than 24 hours
apart, both within 14 days of paralysis onset,
and shipped on ice or frozen ice packs to a
WHO-accredited laboratory, arriving in good
condition. National data might mask surveillance
system weaknesses at subnational levels.

[The MMWR report on the importations of wild
poliovirus (WPV) into the 15 African countries
that had previously interrupted transmission of
WPV is very sobering and serves as a reminder of
the continued risk of WPV transmission. While
there have clearly been signs of improvements in
programmatic activities surrounding polio
eradication (decreased mean time for laboratory
confirmation of suspected cases, and decreased
mean time from diagnosis of case to
implementation of vaccination activities), the
fact remains that there is continued circulation
of the WPV, and many of the countries, once
transmission of the WPV has been interrupted, do
not have the resources to sustain vaccination
coverages at the recommended 80 percent or greater.

From the most recent case count by country, one
sees that there have been 7 confirmed cases in
Uganda resulting from the importation from the
Sudan after 12 years without WPV transmission;
and there have been 5 confirmed cases in Kenya,
resulting from the importation from the Sudan,
following 20 years without WPV transmission in
the country (there were 2 imported cases from
Somalia in 2006) -- both incidents serving as a
reminder that there were pockets of susceptibles in each of the countries.
