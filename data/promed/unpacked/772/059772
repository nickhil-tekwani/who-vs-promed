Active Surveillance Begun: No WNV-positive Reports
--------------------------------------------------
As or 6 Jun 2001, in spite of active surveillance, West Nile (WN)
virus has not been detected in Canada.
It is difficult to predict if or when the virus will move into
northern ecologies in Canada where appropriate mosquitoes are
well-established. The main purpose of surveillance is to identify WN
virus in dead birds, mosquitoes, and domestic and wild animals as
early as possible so that steps can be taken to reduce the risk of
disease in people. For this reason, Health Canada's National
Microbiology Laboratory in collaboration with the Canadian Cooperative
Wildlife Health Centre, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency,
provincial veterinary laboratories, and local/provincial public health
authorities are conducting surveillance for WN virus in birds,
domestic animals, mosquitoes and humans.

As of Wed 20 Jun 2001, there have been no new confirmations of West
Nile virus anywhere in the State of Connecticut. During the first 6

are still in process, testing has been completed on 90 birds, with 89
negative and 1 positive (reported on May 23, 2001 in Milford). There
are no cases of West Nile virus reported for humans, mosquitoes, or
domestic animals and poultry.

Two More Crows Test Positive for West Nile Virus
------------------------------------------------
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
Two crows collected on 1 Jun 2001 in Ocean Township, Monmouth County,
and on 9 Jun 2001 in Parsippany-Troy Hills, Morris County, have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). As of Wed 20 Jun 2001, 209 crows
and 1 hawk have been tested by the Department of Health and Senior
Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory. Of those tested,
14 crows found in Bergen (1), Middlesex (10), Monmouth (2) and Morris
(1) Counties have been confirmed positive for the presence of the WNV.
Mosquito Testing
To date, 2 mosquito pools collected in Middlesex County has tested
positive for the presence of WNV. In total, 389 mosquito pools have
been tested.
Human Testing
In total, 6 residents have been approved for WNV testing and 5 have
accepted. Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from these individuals
have been or are in the process of being tested for the presence of
WNV. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the
established WNV testing criteria, or exhibited most of the symptoms
and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the
virus have been discovered. To date, testing has shown that 2
individuals were not infected with WNV and results are pending for the
3 others.
Horse Testing
A total of 8 horses have been tested for WNV this season and all are
negative.

West Nile Virus Update - 1 Jan 2001 to 21 Jun 2001
--------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 21 Jun 2001, no new results have been reported. The total
number of West Nile virus-positive specimens for New York for the year
remains at 2 dead birds; Rockland (1), Westchester (1).
The Dead Crow Density Report for the period 10 to 16 Jun 2001 records
Dead Crow Sightings per square mile as "low" in 59 Counties and
"moderate" in 3 (Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island). Dead crow
sightings are a possible early warning of, but not definitive
confirmation of, West Nile virus activity. Crows die of many causes
and reporting levels may vary among counties. A Dead Crow Density Map
