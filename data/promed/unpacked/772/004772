Bacterium affecting pears and apples
------------------------------------
A dangerous disease that affects fruit trees such as pear and apple,
affecting the northern parts of the country, is causing panic among
the farmers after they received reports that the bacteria would be a
danger to human health [false claim, see comments below - Mod.DHA].
According to information received, this bacterium affects apple and
pear trees in the Mitidja plains and the coastal areas causing concern
among growers in this [2011] season.

According to the president of the Algerian General Union of Farmers,
Mohamed Alioui, many fruit trees in the north would be affected by
this bacterium, caused by the recent rains in these regions.

Farmers are required to contact specialised institutes for possible
testing and treatment. Moreover, according to the communications
officer at the Ministry of Agriculture, Djamel Berbiche, the
Department should record this disease which, according to him, poses
no danger to consumers.

[The disease referred to above is most likely fireblight, which is
rife in parts of southern Europe, including Spain and Italy opposite
Algeria. It is also present in other countries around the
Mediterranean Sea, for example Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Israel.
Fireblight was reported for the 1st time from neighbouring Morocco in
2006 (ProMED-mail post 20070321.0990) and it is likely that it has now
spread to Algeria. The claim that the causal bacterium is harmful to
humans is totally false, but fear may have been caused by the recent
outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) spread with
vegetable crops in the European Union (see ProMED-mail post 20110622.1902 and older items in the archives).

Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide.
Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although
the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of
the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_
(synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble
varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40
genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs
for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend
forming black hooks, some fruit may show lesions, cankers appear on
branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insect activity, wind, water (such as
rain mentioned in the report above), mechanical means, and with plant
material (including budwood). They enter the host plant through
wounds. Since they overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs
infected during the previous season, the amount of inoculum and thus
the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high
fireblight levels.

Disease management may include monitoring, cultural measures (such as
removal of pathogen reservoirs), and bacteriocidal sprays. Currently
the most effective control is application of streptomycin during
flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject
to strict regulations. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may
provide some protection.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence
of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern in Europe,
the Middle East, and northern America. Importation of plant material,
including fruit, from areas with endemic fireblight poses a
considerable quarantine risk, and the pathogen has been placed on the
A2 quarantine alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation
(EPPO).
