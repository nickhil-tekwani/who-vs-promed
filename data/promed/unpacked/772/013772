The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Guinea has notified WHO of a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in forested areas of south eastern Guinea. The cases have been reported in Guekedou, Macenta, and Kissidougou districts. As of 25 Mar 2014, a total of 86 suspected cases including 60 deaths (case fatality ratio: 69.7 percent) had been reported; 4 health care workers are among the victims. Reports of suspected cases in border areas of Liberia and Sierra Leone are being investigated.

13 of the cases have tested positive for Ebola virus by PCR (6 at the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI) in Lyon, France, and 7 at the Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal), confirming the 1st Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreak in Guinea. Results from sequencing done by CIRI Lyon showed strongest homology of 98 per cent with Zaire Ebolavirus last reported in 2009 in Kasai-Occidental Province of DR Congo. This Ebolavirus species has been associated with high mortality rates during previous outbreaks.

The MOH together with WHO and other partners are implementing measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. The MoH has activated the national, provincial and district emergency management committees to coordinate response. The MoH has also advised the public to take measures to avert the spread of the disease and to report any suspected cases.

Multidisciplinary teams have been deployed to the field to strengthen surveillance, sensitize and educate the public, manage cases and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and communities affected. The MOH and MSF have established isolation facilities in Gueckedou district, and plans are underway to establish an additional isolation ward in Macenta district.

The Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN) is working with the Guinean VHF Laboratory in Donka, the Institut Pasteur in Lyon, the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, and the Kenema Lassa fever laboratory in Sierra Leone to make available appropriate Filovirus diagnostic capacity in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Additional laboratory capacity is being established with the deployment of mobile laboratories supported by international partners.

WHO and other partners are deploying additional experts to provide support to the ministry. The necessary supplies and logistics required for supportive management of patients and all aspects of outbreak control are also being mobilized. The MOH is also preparing a request to the African Public Health Emergency Fund (APHEF) as well as to other potential donors to support outbreak response. APHEF supports timely deployment of rapid response teams during outbreaks and emergencies, and procurement and prepositioning of epidemic and emergency response supplies.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea in respect to this event.

The Ministry of Health of Guinea is currently reporting a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

The WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea in relation to this outbreak.

The risk is low for most travellers, although the risk may increase for those who are working in a health care setting. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends travellers in Guinea avoid direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of a person or corpse infected with the Ebola virus. Also, avoid contact with or handling an animal suspected of having Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD), is a highly contagious infection caused by one of 5 virus species belonging to the Filoviridae family believed to be carried by fruit bats. Serological evidence suggests the presence of Ebola virus in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

Prevention: Travellers going to affected areas should refrain from visiting households or healthcare settings that have been affected by an Ebola outbreak. Those who care for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola cases should wear protective gowns, gloves, masks, as well as a face shield. Avoid eating meat from primates and monkeys as well as contact with dead animals. Practice good personal hygiene, and wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.

There is currently no commercially available vaccine or preventive medication against Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

On 23 Mar 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of confirmed cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever by the Ministry of Health in Guinea. The diagnosis of Ebola was laboratory confirmed.

Advice for travellers:
Guinea is not a common destination for UK travellers (with around 2600 visits by UK residents a year on average, mostly business travellers) [3]. The risk to most travellers is very low. There have been no known imported cases of Ebola in the United Kingdom to date [4].

Transmission of Ebola can only occur when there is direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person, animal, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with blood or body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with animals and with infected patients.

Ebola in Guinea - Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions
-----------------------------------------------
What is the current situation?
According to the Ministry of Health of Guinea, as of 24 Mar 2014, 6 cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Guekedou prefecture. Suspected cases of Ebola, including some deaths, have been reported but not yet confirmed in Guekedou, Kissidougou, Macenta, and Nzerekore prefectures. Suspected cases in border areas of Liberia and Sierra Leone are being investigated.

CDC recommends that travelers to these areas avoid contact with blood and body fluids of infected people to protect themselves.

Who is at risk?
Cases of Ebola are seen sporadically throughout Africa. The risk to most travelers is low, but travelers could be infected if they come into contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids. Health care workers and family and friends of an infected person are at highest risk.
