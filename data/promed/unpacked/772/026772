No more [federal] investigations, quarantines, testing or compensation for disposal. Any Canadian farmers who lose livestock to anthrax infections this summer [2013] can now expect much less federal intervention or support when they report their losses. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] announced in August last year [2012] that it will no longer investigate or quarantine anthrax-infected premises, collect or submit samples for testing, or even perform anthrax testing, as of Monday (1 Apr 2013).

Anthrax remains a reportable disease in Canada and farmers, veterinarians, and labs are still required to report cases to CFIA. However, the agency's response will no longer include an initial dose of anthrax vaccine for affected herds. Nor will CFIA provide oversight for carcass disposal, cleaning and disinfection, nor pay compensation to help producers cover the cost of disposing of affected carcasses.

The agency said Friday [5 Apr 2013] it "will continue to comply with its international reporting obligations to trading partners and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)." CFIA said in August [2012] that the changes in its anthrax response are "part of a broader effort to modernize (its) approach to managing certain federally reportable animal diseases that are established in Canada." By adjusting its approach to anthrax, CFIA "will be able to focus more resources on emerging disease and foreign animal diseases," where federal involvement is considered to be more critical. A reduced response in anthrax cases is "aligned with current science and reflect(s) the reality that anthrax is endemic in the Canadian Prairies," the agency said at the time.

The naturally occurring spores that cause anthrax infections in animals are known to exist in the soil across the Prairies and generally surface during the summer, at points when hot, dry temperatures follow periods of heavy rains and/or flooding. Humans are susceptible to anthrax, but human cases are generally "rare and mild," CFIA said. However, it added, infections can have "devastating" effects on cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and bison.

Vaccination is an effective way to protect livestock from anthrax, and the vaccine is available to veterinarians through regular distribution channels, the agency said. Producers should consult their own veterinarians about the risks involved with anthrax and the decision to have their animals vaccinated, especially if a herd lives or grazes in an area where anthrax has been detected before. In those cases, producers should also avoid giving hay that was cut close to the soil, or feed that had contact with soil, to non-vaccinated animals, CFIA said. They should also thoroughly clean and disinfect equipment and footwear that may have had contact with contaminated soil, the agency added, and wash clothes worn when tending to sick animals separately from other household laundry.

Provincial labs will continue to deliver diagnostic services for anthrax, CFIA said, and the carcass-side research test kits now in use are expected to continue to be available for use by private vets. [These are the US Navy Field Test kits. - Mod.MHJ]

CFIA in 2012 confirmed 3 cases of infections in livestock herds, all in north-central Saskatchewan, including one in cattle in the RM [rural municipality] of Kinistino in July and 2 in bison in the RM of Three Lakes in August and September respectively. Cases in 2011 included 2 cattle herds -- one in the RM of Frenchman Butte in northwestern Saskatchewan, the other in the RM of Whitehead in southwestern Manitoba, both reported in late September that year.

[The CFIA circulated the following instructions and advisories on 5 Apr 2013:

Notice to Industry -- Anthrax Program Changes:
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is reminding livestock producers and other stakeholders that the anthrax program changed on 1 Apr 2013:

Cleaning and Disinfection of Anthrax-Contaminated Sites and Materials:

The Canadian government initiated subsidy payments of some CAD 500 [USD 490] each in the early 1960s to farmers reporting outbreaks of livestock anthrax. And they also provided some 3 years of herd vaccinations. This proactive activity resulted in the immediate public appreciation of anthrax across the prairies where it had been lurking in plain sight since the 1920s. It has been very successful and one of the benefits has been the emergence of a uniform response. But latterly CFIA found that the ranchers were not bothering to vaccinate their herds annually but instead were waiting until there was an outbreak and then use the federal funding. This did little to reduce the incidence.

I hold the Canadian federal and provincial veterinary services in high regard but I must admit to holding my breath to see how the coming anthrax seasons will turn out. Frankly there is an enzootic risk across the prairies, especially in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and outbreaks are best prevented by aggressively advising the ranchers to vaccinate their stock each spring, especially on ranches which have had recent outbreaks or whose neighbours were affected. Charlie Stoltenow has ably demonstrated the benefits of this by his hard extension work in North Dakota in the last few years. Outbreaks there are now few and limited to the non-vaccinators. - Mod.MHJ]
