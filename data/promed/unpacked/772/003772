Dr Leonard Carbonell, [Dagupan City, Pangasinan province, Philippines] city health officer, said 24 leptospirosis cases were recorded at the peak of the disease in the 3rd week of August [2012]. 7 of them have died. The number of leptospirosis deaths here in a month may be unusually high, but a health official sees no need to declare an outbreak. According to the World Health Organization, an outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what is normally expected in a defined community, geographical area, or season.

Carbonell said he expected a high number of leptospirosis cases in this coastal city due to prolonged flooding in several villages early this month because of monsoon rains.

Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria found in the urine of animals, especially rats. It usually takes 10 days for the disease to manifest in a person. "Those who died sought medical attention when the disease had already affected their internal organs. It was too late," he said. "They actually died within 24 hours upon admission [to the hospital]." As of Sunday [2 Sep 2012], no new case had been reported.

"We are now on fever watch, looking for residents with fever and encouraging them to see a doctor immediately. But we are doing mass prevention [by distributing the antibiotic] doxycycline in areas that were flooded," Carbonell said. On Friday [31 Aug 2012], Pangasinan Rep. Ma. Georgina de Venecia distributed some 70 000 doxycycline capsules to health workers in the flood-prone villages for distribution to the residents. The health workers will instruct them on the proper use of the drug, Carbonell said.

Leptospirosis was first recorded [in Pangasinan province] in 2009, in the aftermath of massive flooding due to heavy rains dumped by Typhoon "Pepeng" and excess water released by San Roque Dam in San Manuel town. At that time, 39 cases were reported, with 2 deaths, Carbonell said. In 2010, only 6 cases and 3 deaths were reported and last year [2011], 29 cases and 2 deaths.

[Leptospirosis characteristically follows flooding from heavy rain. The wet season in the city of Dagupan, Philippines occurs from June to September; August is the rainiest month and flooding occurs in the low-lying coastal delta areas during the rainy season almost every year (http://www.asian-cities-adapt.org/dagupan/). Flooding from silted rivers also occurs during high tide. This is said to occur because of rising sea level and subsidence of portions of the city as a consequence of draining water from the aquifer (http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/227501/dagupan-under-water-in-15-years-says-mayor). For a video of the flooding, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPT1IcLrXPk.
