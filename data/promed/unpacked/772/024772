Information received on 6 Feb 2003 from Dr Peter Fernandez, associate
administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC: report date: 5 Feb
2003.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, postmortem, and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 4 Feb 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: 13 Jan 2003.
Outbreaks:
Location: La Paz County, State of Arizona; No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: Newcastle disease has been confirmed in
a backyard flock consisting of 50 birds. No commercial poultry is affected.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
avi / about 250 / .. / about 10 / about 50 / 0
Diagnosis:
Diagnosis was made at National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Ames,
Iowa, using virus isolation. Causal agent: the avian paramyxovirus-1
isolate has a fusion cleavage site sequence consistent with that of exotic
Newcastle disease virus. The sequence is RRQKR/FVGAII.
Epidemiology:
Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown. An evaluation of bird,
people and fomite movement is ongoing. The nucleotide sequence of the
Arizona isolate has 100 per cent homology through 185 bases at the fusion
cleavage site with the California Newcastle disease virus (OIE Disease
Information 2002; 15(40): 194, 4 Oct et seq), which would indicate that the
Arizona and California isolates are identical.
Mode of spread: direct contact, fomites.
Control measures:
- Quarantine of affected backyard premises. APHIS is currently developing a
federal quarantine for the affected area in Arizona.
- There is one contact premises that is under quarantine and is scheduled
to be depopulated.
- Depopulation of affected/exposed game fowl.
- Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of
spread. APHIS and the State of Arizona have increased active surveillance
of the backyard bird population and have established a Task Force in Arizona.
Note from the OIE Central Bureau: Since this is the first occurrence --
within the context of this epizootic -- of Newcastle disease in Arizona,
the OIE Central Bureau has decided to publish the above emergency report
despite our previous note (Disease Information 2003; 16(4): 24, 24 Jan ) to
the effect that no further cases of Newcastle disease in the United States
of America reported to the OIE within the context of this epizootic would
be notified in Disease Information.
