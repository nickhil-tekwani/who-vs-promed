The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [Tue 1 May 2018] reported this year's [2018] 1st confirmed case of serious complications caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection.

A 3-year-old boy in southern Taiwan was hospitalized on [9 Apr 2018] after developing a fever with mild abdominal pain, weakness, and convulsions, alongside vomiting and a loss of appetite, the CDC said. A few days later, he started showing possible signs of developing serious complications, so the hospital moved him to an intensive care unit, collected specimens for testing, and reported the case to the CDC, it said. The boy recovered and was discharged on [19 Apr 2018], it said, adding that test results last week [week of 23 Apr 2018] confirmed that the complications were caused by EV71.

The boy was usually at home or at preschool, had been on a domestic trip during the incubation period, and his father reported having a fever and sore throat in late March [2018], CDC physician Tsou Tsung-pei said.

However, people who came into direct contact with the boy showed no similar symptoms, so he could have been infected by family members or people who showed no clear symptoms, Tsou said.

Children under 5 are particularly susceptible to severe complications caused by EV71, and the disease can progress rapidly, she said.

High fever lasting 3 days, and ulcers or blisters in the mouth, hands and feet are early signs of EV71 infection [hand, foot, and mouth disease], Tsou added.

Early signs of serious complications include drowsiness, change in consciousness, weakness, vomiting, seizures, shortness of breath, and rapid heartbeat, she said.

The syndrome can lead to brain stem encephalitis, heart failure, and pulmonary edema, Tsou said.

There were 5032 reported cases of enterovirus infection last week [week of 23 Apr 2018], up about 20 percent from the previous week, but the cases have not yet reached the epidemic threshold, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Director Liu Ting-ping said.

There were 5 reported cases of serious complications caused by enterovirus infection this year, she said.

An EV71 epidemic occurs in Taiwan every 3-4 years, and the last one occurred in 2016, so the CDC is monitoring outbreaks, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

The number of enterovirus infections reported by emergency rooms last week was the lowest for the same week over the past 5 years, he said, but added that the peak period for infection usually begins in late May or early June, and urged parents to pay attention to children's hygiene, as well as that of other family members.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been associated with hand-foot-mouth disease, as well as herpangina, aseptic meningitis, and poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis. More recently EV71 has been associated with unusual cases of fulminant encephalitis, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, and heart failure. Severe and extensive encephalomyelitis of the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord has been described (from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/enterovirus-71)

[ProMED thanks Dr Dhenin for submitting this information on the enterovirus 71 vaccine in use in China.

For further information on the vaccine, see:
- Zhu F, Xu W, Xia J, et al. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an enterovirus 71 vaccine in China. N Engl J Med. 2014; 370(9): 818-28. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1304923; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1304923.
- Li R, Liu L, Mo Z, et al. An inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children, N Engl J Med. 2014; 370(9): 829-37. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1303224; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1303224

Two vero cell-based EV71 inactivated whole virus vaccines with aluminum hydroxide were consistently shown to induce immune responses to EV71 in infants and young children, 6-35 months (Fengcai Zhu et al.) or 6-71 months (Rongcheng Li et al.) of age, following 2 intramuscular doses, for at least 1 year. A neutralizing antibody titer of 1:16 was associated with protection against EV71.

While these vaccines appear effective against the C4 strain of EV 71 (that is, the one that's caused most epidemics in South East Asia), they do not provide cross-protection against other circulating lineages or against coxsackievirus A16 infection, which also triggers the same syndromes. - Mod.LK]
