An outbreak of salmonella infection at St Joseph's Catholic Church has sickened a number of people, according to the City of Amarillo Public Health Department (APHD) and the City of Amarillo Environmental Health Department. The notice did not specify how many people are allegedly sickened in this outbreak. There is also no word on any hospitalizations, illness onset dates, or the patient age range.

The outbreak is associated with an enchilada meal that was served at the church on Sun 27 Mar 2022. Anyone who has food items left over from that event should discard them immediately. Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms of a salmonella infection should see their doctor. And if you are sick, do not return to work, school, or daycare until you have been symptom free for 24 hours. The notice did not state if any specific food items are suspected, or if any food has been collected by the health department for testing. Providers who are treating patients who reported eating at that event and anyone who is sick are asked to contact APHD at 806-378-6300 option 6.

Symptoms of almonella infection usually begin 6 hours to 6 days after eating food that is contaminated by the bacteria. Symptoms include a fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach and abdominal cramps, and diarrhea that may be bloody. This infection is usually self-limiting, and most people who contract it do not see a doctor. However, some patients can become seriously ill with dehydration or sepsis and require hospitalization.
