The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, in conjunction with the
Jefferson County Department of Health and Environment (JCDHE) and the
Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE), announced that
the current illness outbreak at the Jefferson County jail is a
foodborne illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_
(_E. coli_) (STEC) bacteria [also called verotoxin-producing _E.
coli_, VTEC - Mod.LL]. Lab results from collected specimens confirmed
evidence of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. According to Dr. Mark
Johnson, JCDHE Executive Director, County Health officials are
awaiting further test results to determine the exact strain of the bacteria.
STEC is a collective term used for bacteria that produce Shiga toxins
including _E. coli_ O157:H7, and more than 100 other non-O157
strains. The outbreak investigation began on 6 Jul 2007, after
several inmates became ill. Thus far, approximately 70 inmates have
reported symptoms; 37 are currently ill and one person is still hospitalized.
Dr. Gayle Miller, epidemiologist for the Jefferson County Health
Department, is leading the investigation with a team in collaboration
with state health officials. She emphasized Wednesday [11 Jul 2007],
that identifying the bacteria gets [them] one step closer to finding
the source of the illness outbreak, but that it is not always
possible to identify the exact source. However, the extensive
investigation will continue to try to determine what food was
contaminated and how it became contaminated. "We will be conducting a
wide range of concurrent activities including testing samples of food
eaten by the ill inmates, testing specimens collected, review of food
handling procedures, and interviewing the inmates about foods
ingested," said Dr. Miller.
Jefferson County Sheriff, Ted Mink, said, "The health and safety of
our inmate population is of utmost concern and the Sheriff's Office
is working diligently with public health officials and our medical
staff to prevent further illnesses and provide treatment to those who
are sick."
The Sheriff's Office and Health Department are working together on
prevention and control measures. Some of these include: identifying
and isolating ill inmates; testing specimens; collecting data to
identify possible sources; review of procedures including laundry
washing; and providing food safety and hygiene education to ensure
sanitary conditions in kitchen, eating, and cell block areas.
