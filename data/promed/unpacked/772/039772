2 more women have been found to have contracted hepatitis C from a healthcare worker at a Gwent hospital who had the disease without realising it. The newly identified cases bring to 4 the number of women to whom the worker unknowingly passed the blood-borne virus, which, if untreated, can cause inflammation of the liver, liver disease, and liver cancer.

They were identified during a major testing programme launched by the AneurinBevan Health Board in September [2013], to find out if anyone else treated by the healthcare worker at Caerphilly District Miners' Hospital from May 1984 to -July 2003, had been infected by them. The programme was launched after initial investigations confirmed 2 cases linked to the healthcare worker, who does not know when or how they contracted hepatitis C, and who was only diagnosed after retirement. More than 5500 women were identified as having had, or potentially had, treatment from the healthcare worker, in obstetrics and gynaecology. Around 5000 were from the Aneurin Bevan Health Board area. The others were from others parts of Wales and the UK, where the healthcare worker had worked prior to coming to Gwent. The women were traced following an exhaustive trawl through patients' and hospital records that lasted several months. All were invited, by letter, to have a blood test to determine whether they had hepatitis C, and if they did, if it was passed on by the healthcare worker. More than 4500 calls were made to a special helpline, and in Gwent 3100 women had a blood test, out of 3311 UK-wide.

"The 4 women now known to have had hepatitis C transmission from the former healthcare worker are being offered care and support by our specialist services," said Dr Gill Richardson, the health board's director of public health. "We understand that this is a very difficult and distressing time for them and we would ask that everyone respects their need for compassion and confidentiality. We are thankful that we have been able to reassure other women tested and are grateful to all the patients who came forward to take the test." Women who received a letter but have not yet come forward to have a blood test are still able to do so.

[This account does not explain how the infection was transmitted from the healthcare worker to a relatively small number of patients. So far, transmission of infection appears to haven been limited to a single hospital in Wales, and not at other sites where the healthcare worker had worked previously. Is there evidence to implicate procedures in this particular hospital favouring transmission of infection? More information would be appreciated in this regard, and the method of isolate identification.

Gwent is a preserved county and a former local government county in south-east Wales and was named after the ancient Kingdom of Gwent. The authority was a successor to both the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport. - Mod.CP
