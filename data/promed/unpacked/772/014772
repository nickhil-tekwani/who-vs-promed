[This report indicates an increase in cases in dogs, but recent
reports cited below indicate that both animal and human cases have
been on the rise. The government is responding with a vaccination
campaign.

For a discussion of the merits of vaccination versus the culling of
stray dogs, see Mod.TY's comments on the recent Bolivia posting on
ProMED-mail. In this regard, we thank Dr. Samshudeen Fagbo, who sent
in a recent release from the Global Alliance for Rabies Control,
indicating that the worldwide estimate of human deaths from rabies has
been raised from 55 000 human deaths globally to 70 000 human deaths
globally per year. See "Rabies - worldwide (03) 20110930.2953."
