Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever reported in North West
------------------------------------------------------
MAFEKING: A man was admitted to Ferncrest Hospital at Zeerust in the North
West [province of South Africa at the weekend with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever, the provincial health department announced on Tue 28 Aug
2001. The department said the man, in his early 40s, was sickly but fully
conscious.
"A departmental representative has already visited the patient in hospital
to obtain more details with regards to the possible source of infection,"
the department said. The man worked at a salon in a guest house and the
department suspected that he might have contracted the disease from one of
the clients. He had no history of tick-bite, farm visits, or animal
skinning in at least the past month, and none of his family contacts were
currently sick. The department was investigating the conditions of his work
colleagues to determine the source of the infection.
"The department will embark on a massive health education campaign with
emphasis on close monitoring of the signs and symptoms of the disease and
the need to seek prompt medical attention." Members of the community are
also urged to guard against symptoms such as headache, nausea, bleeding and
general body pain. A farmer died of the highly contagious disease in the
province last year.
