Despite repeated medical tests and reassurances from the relevant
health authorities, people suffering HIV/AIDS-like symptoms insist
they are ill and have been infected with an undetected virus. Since
2009, there have been thousands of cases in 6 provinces and
municipalities, according to media reports. Victims have complained of
HIV/AIDS symptoms despite repeatedly testing negative for the virus.

A leading expert at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai also backed
their claims. It was unlikely "psychological factors" caused the
symptoms, Mo Xiaowei told the Beijing News. Her institute had
conducted blood tests for 5 sufferers in 2009 and detected "the same
unknown virus," Mo said. Mo's Institute, under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, was "unqualified" to conduct such research, the Ministry of
Health said.

"I don't agree my symptoms were caused by an AIDS phobia," one man
told the Global Times on Thursday [7 Apr 2011]. "I was tested
negative, but I still have the symptoms. I don't know what I have."

Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes and bleeding under the skin. The
sufferers are fine and most of their symptoms were "exaggerated," Zeng
Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention in Beijing, reiterated in a press conference on Wednesday
[6 Apr 2011]. His center has done 2 epidemiological studies and sent
blood samples to the US for further testing. All were found to be HIV
negative, and their CD4 cell ratio in the blood -- an indicator of the
immune system [function] -- was found to be normal.

HIV phobia most likely caused the HIV suspicions, said Ministry of
Health spokesman Deng Haihua. The sufferers remained unconvinced. "I
didn't start seeking out doctors until after I discovered the physical
symptoms," one sufferer told the Beijing News.

[This report further excludes human immunodeficiency virus as the
etiologic agent of this undiagnosed illness, and immune system
dysfunction does not appear to be involved in at least some cases of
this illness. It is still unclear whether the illness can be
considered a discrete clinical entity.

The report from the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai that a (so far
uncharacterised) virus has been isolated from patients displaying the
symptoms of this illness cannot be evaluated at this stage. A verdict
from the US CDC is awaited. - Mod.CP]
