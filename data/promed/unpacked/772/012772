8 deer killed in South Dakota in late 2002 have tested positive for chronic
wasting disease (CWD), a relative of mad cow disease, state wildlife
officials said.
"We have 8 positive deer that we tested from the 2002 season," said John
Kanta, a biologist with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and
Parks. All 8 were taken from the south west section of the state, where the
disease was confirmed in the wild last year.
The state has received test results on all but 28 of the 1940 deer tissue
samples collected in late 2002 as part of a effort to monitor the disease,
Kanta said. Most were donated by hunters.
CWD was first observed in mule deer in Colorado in the late 1960s. It has
since spread to wild or captive deer and elk herds in 11 US states and in
parts of Canada.
Five of the diseased South Dakota deer were killed last fall by hunters who
voluntarily submitted the animals' heads for CWD testing. Two were killed
by state employees after [the deer exhibited] signs of illness, and one was
struck by a vehicle in Rapid City.
CWD was first confirmed in South Dakota in 1996 in a captive elk herd, and
the disease was later found in 4 other captive herds. Animals in all 5
herds were destroyed, Kanta said. The state's first case in the wild was
confirmed from a deer shot in 2001 by a hunter near the town of Oral.
