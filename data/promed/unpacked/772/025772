The tally of sick, dying or dead skunks found mostly in west Redding
is now up to 42, as of Tuesday [25 Mar 2008] afternoon.

What's causing all the sick or dead skunks is still a mystery, and
the state Department of Fish and Game is still waiting on tests by a
graduate student at the University of California at Davis. Two dead
skunks tested by Shasta County Public Health on 14 Mar 2008 were
negative for rabies, and the animals were then sent to Davis.

Capt. Lee Anne Smith of Redding Animal Regulation said the skunks
could be suffering from distemper, but only tests will confirm that.

The graduate student is on spring break this week, said Janet Foley,
the professor of infectious diseases who oversees his laboratory. "I
don't know where that stands right now," she said.

Animal regulation officers also have found 2 raccoons and 2 foxes
since the 2nd week of February 2008 that appeared to be suffering
from some sort of disease, said Dori Mullings, animal regulation's
office supervisor.

Mullings has been keeping track of the count on a map behind her
desk, with clusters appearing around Placer Street near downtown and
Highway 273 near South Bonnyview Road.

"They've mostly been all over on the west side," she said.

[Skunks are in the family _Mustelidae_, along with ferrets, minks,
badgers and others. Animals in this family can be affected by both
the canine distemper virus (a paramyxovirus) and the feline distemper
virus (a parvovirus). These diseases are caused by 2 different
viruses and are known by their common name (canine distemper and
feline distemper) related to the family of animals that are most
often affected by each particular virus.

Without testing, it is impossible to tell which virus is causing problems.

Wild animals sick with distemper may indeed be initially mistaken as
rabies cases and should be tested 1st for rabies. The sick animals
may have gastrointestinal problems as well as respiratory problems.
They don't feel good and certainly do not act normally.

The virus is spread in respiratory droplets, available for inhalation
and ingestion if the droplets are on a food source. Urine and feces
also contain the virus.

Infected animals are often seen with nasal discharge and purulent
conjunctivitis that may cause the eyelids to stick together. These
animals often have neurological disturbances and may be disoriented,
listless, have convulsions, and even demonstrate aggressiveness.

Anyone encountering sick animals should report them to the DFG
(Department of Fish and Game). Pet owners should be sure their
animals are vaccinated against rabies and distemper. - Mod.TG]
