The culling of thousands of pigs is expected to start in Dutywa in the
Eastern Cape today, following an outbreak of swine fever at farms in
Centane and Queenstown.
Tests have confirmed the existence of the disease in the communal farming
area between the Mbhashe and Kei Rivers.
3 private farms -- in Queenstown, Aliwal North and Cookhouse -- have also
been hit by the viral infection. Control-points have been put up at
strategic routes to prevent the disease from spreading further.
More than 1000 pigs in the Western Cape died from the disease following an
outbreak last month. An additional 1591 pigs were destroyed and buried.
An embargo on restocking farms in the Hex River Valley and Worcester area
remains in force until the end of September 2005.
