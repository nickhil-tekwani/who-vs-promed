The latest case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was reported last week. This hantavirus patient was interned in the Prison Unit No. 3 in in Oran, who possibly acquired the infection at the prison farm, [the Chief of the local hospital], Dr. Julio Cortes] presumes.

The young man of approximately 30 years of age was hospitalized for some days due the clinical picture of respiratory problems that were later confirmed as [a] hantavirus [infection] but was released [ from hospital] because his situation was under control.

Dr. Cortez added that [the possibility of] another prisoner who also might have had the disease is not discarded.

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012) and are beginning to be recognized again this year (2013). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case. This case may have been caused by Oran virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at:

The office of the Director of Health of Berisso municipality, a unit under the Secretariat of Social Promotion, informed the community that, based on the confirmation of [a] case [of] hantavirus [infection], measures to prevent vector-transmitted diseases must be intensified, specially after a flood such as the one that the city suffered this past 2 Apr [2013].

Hantavirus is transmitted from rodents through their excrement, urine and saliva. Transmission is affected when these [substances] are inhaled or by contact with the mouth and eyes. Because of this, the municipal health agency strongly advises [appropriate] cleaning measures in houses and empty lots.

"In [and around] houses, it is fundamental to maintain the yards clean, in order to avoid any focus for rodent breeding.

Concerning this case of [a] hantavirus [infection], the Director of Health, Graciela Matkovic, explained that," the 36 year old person began with a febrile syndrome that lasted several days. Later, the person was seen at a health unit, where they requested laboratory tests and then later went to Rossi Hospital, where it was decided to admit the person with a diagnosis of serious acute pneumonia."

"When the presumptive diagnosis was made [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome -- HPS], the 1st visit to her home was made, where pertinent preventive measures were taken, among them trash removal in the patient's whole block area, and in front areas of the 4 adjoining blocks," said the local Health Director.

In this sense, it is worth mentioning that the Zoonoses area of the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires province collaborated in carrying out the analysis and complementary studies of the infected person's co-workers to detect febrile individuals and also the person's family, to find out if there were [infected individuals] with milder symptoms.

As for the patient's current situation, the health official explained that, "When we speak of hantavirus [infections, HPS}, supportive care is given. Up until yesterday [16 Apr 2013], the patient had mechanical respiratory assistance and the
respiratory parameters indicate favorable improvement."

{Again, there is no indication of which hantavirus was responsible for this case, but it may have been due to a Lechiguana virus infection. - Mod. TY]

[Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this case is Choclo virus, as mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935. Of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
