From: Frank Cobelens <f.g.cobelens@amc.uva.nl>

Regarding possible flood-associated cases of yellow fever in Benin, the
moderator stated that this was an unlikely diagnosis because of the biology
of _Aedes_ mosquitoes, and that these are perhaps cases of water-borne
hepatitis A. This would not seem very likely either: apart from the
jaundice, hepatitis A does not resemble yellow fever much clinically, and
(more importantly) West African adults and older children would be expected
to have natural immunity, whereas most hepatitis A infections in young
children are non-symptomatic. Leptospirosis might be a more likely
diagnosis here.
