Rabies outbreak hits Siberian region
Novosibirsk, 4th March: Medics imposed a quarantine in a southern Siberian
village on Thursday (4 Mar 1999) as an epidemic of rabies spread to 26
districts in Novosibirsk Region, the Regional sanitary and epidemiological
service reported.
In the Zdvinskiy District village of (?Maladino), cattle had been attacked
and bitten by infected foxes. Tests revealed 16 cows that have so far
contacted the virus. No residents have been affected, but the authorities
ordered the local firm to suspend the processing and sales of meat. The
epidemiological service said there has been an increasing incidence of
rabies among wolves, foxes and hares over the past 18 months. During this
period, hunters shot and killed 4,000 infected foxes. Some 220,000 domestic
animals and more than 250,000 cattle have been vaccinated since the start
of the epidemic.

[Hares are susceptible to rabies, however, most hares that are bitten by a
rabid animal usually die as a result, i.e. lunch. However, there have been
cases, although few, of hares and rabbits developing rabies. With regard to
cattle, if the animal is slaughtered within 7 days of being bitten, its
tissues, with proper cooking may be eaten without risk of infection
provided liberal portions of the exposed area are discarded. Furthermore,
between day 7 and 8 months, the suspect animal should not be consumed by
human beings. However, after 8 months, if the animal is healthy, it may be
slaughtered for human consumption. Neither tissues nor milk from a rabid
animal should be used for human or animal consumption. However, since
pasteurization temperatures will inactivate rabies virus, drinking
pasteurized milk or eating COOKED meat does NOT constitute rabies exposure.
