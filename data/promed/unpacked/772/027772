Public concern has been expressed as a consequence of rumors of a
meeting between Syrian, Saudi, and Jordanian representatives that
will reconsider resuming export of native Syrian sheep (Awasi and
Naeemi) to Saudi Arabia through Jordan. This concern is attributed to
past experience of re-emergence of FMD resulting from such exporting
operations, leading to substantial economical losses in the Syrian
livestock market.

The exact directions of the animal movements mentioned in the above
summary are rather blurred. From further reading in the full text of
the Asharq Al Awsat article, it appears that the consignment in
question included sheep of 2 breeds, Awassi and Naimi. It seems (but
supplementary information will help!) that the discussion involved
the need to transport the sheep by land back to Syria from Saudi
Arabia over Jordanian territory, following Saudia's decision to
refuse their entry. This, allegedly, was related to the suspected
presence of FMD in Jordan.

According to further news, the Syrian exporters are permitted to
transport the sheep to Saudia by sea (with consequent increased
expenses). Reportedly, 270 000 sheep have been exported from Syria to
Saudi Arabia by sea since the beginning of 2008. The current
discussions on transboundary animal (mainly small ruminants)
movements in the Middle East may be directly related to the Ramadan
season, when large numbers of animals for slaughter are in demand. - Mod.AS]

Al-Mofaraq public authority of agriculture, Jordan has vaccinated 280
000 animals against FMD, PPR, IBR, brucellosis, and rinderpest.

[Al Mafraq governorate, northern Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is on
the Syrian border; see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mafraq_nahias.png>.

Data on the FMD serotypes included in the vaccine and the animal
species vaccinated against this disease will be appreciated. The
inclusion of rinderpest among the mentioned vaccinations is puzzling;
clarification will help.

Interestingly, 18 of 21 wild boars sampled on Israel's borders with
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan in early 2007 were found FMD-positive by
ELISA NSP tests. These tests demonstrate the presence of antibodies
against nonstructural 3ABC protein, regarded to be indicative that
FMD virus multiplication has taken place. The results indicate the
presence of FMD virus within the wild boar population in the
FMD-affected regions; in at least one case (Mevo Hamma,
Syrian/Jordanian/Israeli border junction), the virus activity in
boars seems to have taken place some time before outbreaks in Israeli
domestic livestock were recorded (see 20070517.1571).

According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright, 7 isolates of FMDV serotype O (topotype ME-SA, strain Pan
Asia 2) have been sequenced there since March 2008; see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm>.
Other strains are still under study. In Jordan, FMDV serotypes O and
A were recorded during 2006; no additional samples have been received
since then. Syria's last report of FMD dates back to 2002, when
serotypes O and A were recorded.

Updated information regarding the current FMD situation in the 3
countries will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
