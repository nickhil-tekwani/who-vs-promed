[Avian influenza] is beginning to infiltrate Quebec farms, reported at 4 separate sites in less than a week.

On Sunday [17 Apr 2022], Canada's food inspection agency (CFIA) confirmed the detection of the H5N1 strain at a poultry flock in Les Sources, a municipality in Quebec's Estrie region.

Bird flu was also detected in the Brome-Missisquoi, Hait-Saint-Francois, and Val-Saint-Francois regions last week.

"The infected sites have been placed under quarantine," reads the CFIA website. "The CFIA has established movement control measures and is recommending other farms in the area increase biosecurity."

Until [12 Apr 2022] the highly infectious strain had only been identified among wild geese in Quebec but has evidently made its way into domesticated populations.

H5N1 can do serious damage to poultry farms, leading to high mortality rates.

Its risks are far less severe for humans, although experts advise anyone infected to seek immediate medical care. "There are things you can do to help, including the early use of antiviral medication and support in an intensive care unit," explains McGill infectious diseases expert Dr Raymond Tellier.

Quebec's wildlife ministry has urged the public not to handle live or dead wild birds to prevent the spread.

The virus has been circulating in Europe since 2020 and in Canada since December 2021.

Two cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been confirmed in Saskatchewan poultry flocks.

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), HPAI has recently been confirmed in a Saskatchewan backyard flock and a commercial poultry flock.

The affected small flock was found on Thursday [14 Apr 2022] in the rural municipality of Moose Mountain no. 63, while the affected poultry flock was found on Saturday [16 Apr 2022] in the rural municipality of Loreburn, according to the agency.

Each of the infected premises has been placed under quarantine. The CFIA says they have begun an investigation and will be establishing movement control measures on other farms within that area.

The Saskatchewan government says they will continue to work with the poultry industry and the CFIA to lead the disease response against bird flu.

"This virus has been circulating through Canada now over the past month in various provinces," said Dr Stephanie Smith, Saskatchewan's Chief Veterinary Officer. "We're fortunate so far to only have 2 detections... but we are on high alert to watch for any subsequent concerns."

On 14 Apr 2022 Smith put in place an animal health control area order until [14 May 2022] to limit the co-mingling of poultry. The order prohibits the movement to and participation of birds in shows, auctions, and agricultural fairs, as well as any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations.

Smith says the government will be monitoring the situation to determine whether the order needs to be extended.

"We're going to be looking at information from disease surveillance, looking at cases across the province to determine whether we still have a high risk for the virus or whether we can cancel the order," Smith said. "We'll be assessing as we go into the coming months here to see whether we need to expand."

The province says biosecurity is the best tool for poultry producers and small flock owners to protect their birds from bird flu. Biosecurity protocols include keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water, limiting visitors, monitoring bird health, and using barn specific clothing and footwear when entering barns. Small flock owners are also encouraged to keep their birds indoors during wild bird migration if possible.

The government says there is no risk to food safety and that the risk of transmission of avian influenza to humans is low. However, they say people working with poultry who may be suspected of being infected with avian influenza should use protective clothing.

The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been seen in different cases across Canada.

Producers are advised by the province to contact their veterinarian immediately if there are any concerns about the health status of flocks. If avian influence is suspected, producers are advised to also contact their local CFIA office.

The public is being advised to contact the Ministry of Environment or the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative if they notice birds that are sick or dead.

Saskatchewan producers and farm families are reminded the provincial Farm Stress Line can be contacted 24-hours-a-day at 1-800-667-4442.

[3] Pennsylvania (Lancaster County): commercial chickens

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture confirmed the state's 1st positive case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry, in a flock of commercial layer chickens on a Lancaster County poultry farm. A state and federal interagency task force is prepared and initiating a response plan.

While there is no risk to the public, and poultry and eggs are safe to eat if cooked properly, HPAI is highly infectious and can be fatal to domestic birds (chickens, ducks, geese, quail, pheasants, guinea fowl, and turkeys).

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

The positive samples were taken from a flock in East Donegal Township, Lancaster County, and tested at the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory. The finding was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. The department has quarantined the farm and all commercial poultry facilities within a 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] radius of the infected flock.

"Protecting Pennsylvania's USD 7.1 billion poultry industry is a year-round top priority," said PA Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. "We have strict biosecurity protocols in place both for Pennsylvania farms and for poultry products shipped in and out of the state. We have had USD 2 million budgeted and set aside since 2016 to respond to avian influenza, in addition to equipment, supplies, laboratories, and highly trained experts who have been on high alert and are supporting our poultry farmers.

"There is no immediate public health concern for Pennsylvanians, and we are prepared to respond to this agricultural issue. However, wild birds carry the virus and do not respect property or state lines," he added. "Anyone visiting a farm should be aware your vehicles and shoes may carry the virus from other places you have walked. Clean them thoroughly and stay away from poultry barns unless you have to be there. Please be vigilant and do your part to protect our farms."

An interagency HPAI task force works regularly to address the threat of disease to Pennsylvania's wild and domestic bird populations. The task force includes the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, the departments of Agriculture, Health, General Services and Environmental Protection, the State Police, the Game Commission, the Air National Guard, and the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS) Veterinary Services and Wildlife Services.

The task force will carry out the response plan, which includes education and public outreach, and minimizing risk factors through strict biosecurity measures and continued surveillance, testing, and management.

This is the 1st confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Pennsylvania in commercial poultry since an outbreak in 1983-84. As of [15 Apr 2022] infected birds in commercial and backyard poultry flocks had been confirmed in 27 states including most states surrounding Pennsylvania.

USDA's website includes a complete listing of confirmed domestic poultry as well as those in wild birds [https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai]. Genetic analysis of samples taken in other U.S. states has shown the virus is being spread by infected wild birds. Wild birds in Pennsylvania were confirmed to be infected in March [2022], including a bald eagle in Chester County and 4 ducks in Venango County.

Pennsylvania's 3 animal health laboratories analyzed nearly 200 000 samples for avian influenza last year [2022]. The laboratories, which make up the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, have the capacity to test many more samples, if necessary.

The department has reviewed procedures, inventoried supplies, and protective equipment in preparation for HPAI, and has held monthly meetings with poultry producers, veterinarians, USDA officials, and other stakeholders monthly, escalating to bi-monthly in February as infections were detected among migrating wild birds.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is mainly spread through direct contact between healthy birds and bodily waste from infected birds. The disease can cause sudden death without clinical signs; lack of energy and appetite; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks; purple discoloration of the wattles, combs, and legs; nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, lack of coordination, and diarrhea.

If you suspect your poultry is infected with avian influenza, please report your concerns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services.

Sick or dead wild birds should be reported to the Pennsylvania Game Commission by telephone or <pgc-wildlifehealth@pa.gov>.

[4] Michigan (Washtenaw County): domestic parrots
Date: Mon 18 Apr 2022

Several domestic parrots in Washtenaw County have succumbed to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed.

Samples were sent to the lab following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) after cases were confirmed in wild birds in the area.

MDARD is currently working with the owners of the parrots to come up with a flock plan to curb the spread of the disease.

It is rare for pet birds to contract HPAI since they are unlikely to come into contact with wild birds. For those birds housed inside a residence, the only way they could catch the disease is by coming into contact with contaminated materials like an owner's clothing that's been exposed, cage furniture, or food.

According to officials, residents with pet birds should store food and water bowls away from where wild birds roost or fly. Additionally, bird owners should change or disinfect any shoes and clothing that have been worn off the premises.

"It's important to recognize it's very difficult for pet birds to catch avian influenza if the proper precautions are taken to stop the virus," state veterinarian Nora Wineland said in a release. "For example, put in safeguards to not introduce any material, food, or clothing that wild birds may have contaminated.

"No matter what bird species or how many birds one owns--now is the time to protect them. Bird owners need to take every strategy to protect their flocks and reduce the spread of HPAI within our state. MDARD continues to act swiftly to reduce the spread and respond to the ongoing presence of HPAI in Michigan."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said no cases of the [highly pathogenic] avian influenza viruses have been detected in humans [in the USA] and do not present a public health concern at this time. ...

According to a release, state officials recommend taking the following precautions to protect domestic birds:
- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfecting boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Using well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

Additionally, domestic bird owners should be on the lookout for a drop in egg production, unusual deaths, an increase in sick birds, or a significant decrease in water consumption.

Those who suspect avian influenza should contact MDARD immediately.

[Biosecurity, bird protection, and extreme caution are all important in today's era of HPAI H5N1. While originally flying around in immune wild birds our domesticated fowl are in harm's way without extra precautions, strict biosecurity, and extreme protection of the flocks. Guard your birds from wild birds, and use extra caution, changing clothes, boots, and gloves before entering where your birds are.

This disease has already been devastating to the birds and their owners, and hard on the people euthanizing the birds and on the taxpayers' pocketbooks. Please take seriously the threat of this disease. - Mod.TG]
