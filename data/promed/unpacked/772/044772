Deadly for birds, Usutu virus has now been demonstrated in a dead blackbird in Siegen, North Rhine-Westphalia. This was announced by the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI) in Hamburg on Friday [13 Jul 2012]. The infection could spread to other states, said BNI virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit. Last summer [2011], in Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and Baden-Wurttemberg, hundreds of thousands of blackbirds became ill and died [see ProMED refs. below].

The finding in North Rhine-Westphalia shows that the Usutu virus is spreading in urban areas, said Norbert Becker of the municipal association working to combat mosquitoes in the Palatinate Forest Lake. This week, its employees were sent about 20 dead blackbirds to study. In the Palatinate in Landau, a total of 95 dead birds has been reported so far this year [2012], said Becker. In the spring, German researchers had predicted possible outbreaks of African Usutu virus in blackbirds.

Usutu virus was found in Germany as early as 2010; the disease is carried by mosquitoes (_Culex pipiens_) and can be transmitted to humans. In 2009, 2 immunocompromised patients in Italy were infected by it [both survived, but one had severe sequelae -- see ProMED 2009 ref. below. - Mod.JW].

This past June [2012], there were reports of dead birds being found, especially in the Baden-Wurttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate areas. Reportedly, 223 birds from 19 species were examined. Of these, 86 were infected with the virus, including 72 blackbirds. Outside of Africa, the virus was 1st reported in 2001 when it occurred in and around Vienna.

[Usutu virus (USUV) is a member of the mosquito-borne cluster within the Flavivirus genus, closely related to important human pathogens that cause viral encephalitis. It was 1st isolated in South Africa in 1959 and named after a river. USUV primarily infects birds and only very sporadically has been found infecting mammals (including humans). Until 2001, it had never been detected outside Africa. By the end of the summer of 2001, USUV caused a die-off of Eurasian Blackbirds (_Turdus merula_; see picture at
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Solsort.jpg?uselang=es) around Vienna, Austria.

The next year [2002], the virus was still circulating in the mosquito population in Austria. The virus was 1st detected in Germany, presumably spreading from Austria, in 2010 (see ProMED post 20110913.2792). In April of this year [2012], German scientists warned that outbreaks in blackbirds were expected this summer, after isolating the virus in overwintering mosquitoes (see ProMED post 20120425.1114006).
