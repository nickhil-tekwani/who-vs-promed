N.J. wants to test imported deer for chronic wasting disease
-------------------------------------------
State wildlife officials are seeking a court order to test deer at a New
Jersey hunting preserve for a fatal disease affecting wildlife in the western
United States. The 20 white-tailed deer were shipped to New Jersey from
Wisconsin, where chronic wasting disease (CWD) is prevalent.
The state [NJ] Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has already
quarantined 2 preserves -- Big Spring Whitetail Preserves in Sussex County,
where the deer were shipped, and Mountain Trail Whitetails Bowhunting
Preserve in Warren County, which later bought 9 of the deer.
Superior Court Judge Theodore Bozonelis on 16 Sep 2003 will hear the DEP's
request for free access to more than 100 deer and elk kept at Big Spring.
The only way to test for the disease is by examining an animal's brain stem,
so the DEP, in essence, is seeking to [slaughter] some of the animals at Big
Spring.
There is no evidence the deer are infected with the disease, but state
officials said they are trying to be proactive in preventing the deadly
wildlife disease from gaining a foothold on the East Coast via New Jersey.
"Our primary concern is the potential introduction of CWD into New
Jersey's cervid population -- our deer and related species," DEP
Commissioner Bradley Campbell told The Star-Ledger of Newark. "This
is a disease that has reached epidemic proportions among deer and elk
in the West and Midwest."
The DEP claims the January 2002 shipment was illegal and beyond the
scope of a permit under which the preserve owner operates.
Wisconsin is one of 12 states hit hard by the highly contagious
disease, which is similar to mad cow disease and attacks the animal's
central nervous system.
Deputy Attorney General Ronald Heksch argues that because the
imported deer have already roamed freely with deer and elk already on
the property, the DEP needs to test members of the herd. The DEP
also wants to force the owner to erect a secondary fence around the
already gated property to keep Big Spring animals from interacting
with animals in the wild.
"We need to act within reason and not panic," said Evan Nappen, a
lawyer for the owner. "There is nothing indicating these deer were
infected at the Wisconsin preserve where they came from."
The judge said he will decide the fencing issue this week.
The DEP accidentally discovered the deer shipment while talking with
Wisconsin wildlife officials in July 2003. Wisconsin discovered it
had infected animals in the state in February 2002, a month after the
shipment to New Jersey. Months later, New Jersey imposed a ban on
imported deer and elk.
The DEP claims that if Big Spring went through proper channels to
import deer, it would have taken at least 90 days to process the
permits, and that would have been long enough for the state to find
out that chronic wasting disease had been detected in Wisconsin.
