Moncton is a city of some 85 000 people in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada. In a CBC [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) report today [12 Nov 2019], it is reported that a 3rd Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) case this year [2019] -- all 3 cases had cataract surgery at the Moncton Hospital.

In April [2019], Moncton Hospital reported the identification 2 separate cases where a patient with probable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) had cataract surgery in the facility.

Dr Gordon Dow, division head of infectious diseases at the Moncton Hospital, said even he was shocked when another case of CJD was discovered.

"I think even though there's the overwhelming weight of evidence suggesting that we've had a cluster of sporadic cases, there is no need for public alarm," Dow said.

"This is not an indication that there's been an outbreak of CJD."

Prion diseases are rare, fatal, degenerative brain disorders that are thought to occur worldwide in both humans and animals. They belong to the general category of brain diseases called proteinopathies, which also includes Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although there are several forms of human prion disease, the most common is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

Since January 1998, Canada has reported 1037 definitive and probable CJD cases and New Brunswick has seen 31 cases during this period.

[DP] first showed signs of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] in April [2019]. Since her diagnosis in June [2019], her husband has become her full-time caregiver. Speaking with his wife's permission, he said she now suffers symptoms of dementia, which came on quickly.

"It's like all of a sudden you walked into a nursing home and you don't know the person you're with," he said.

When the couple went to Toronto to see a baseball game in April [2019], it was the 1st time he noticed something was off.

[DP] became agitated and couldn't sit still, and they ended up leaving part way through the game, despite [her] love of the Blue Jays.

Thirteen falls, a 6-week hospital stay, and numerous tests later, the couple received the diagnosis. [Her husband] can't pronounce Creutzfeldt-Jakob, but he knows its prognosis well. "It's downhill and you're never going back up," he said.

In the 7 months since she first started showing symptoms, [DP] has lost her short-term memory and can no longer walk unassisted. "I do everything for her that I can, get her mad, make her laugh, do all the laundry, cook all our meals, whatever," [her husband] said. "That's what husbands and wives are about."

While CJD is said to occur at a rate of only one in a million people, [DP] is the 3rd person to be diagnosed with the deadly degenerative brain disease at the Moncton Hospital in less than a year.

Like [DP], both cases underwent cataract surgery at the Moncton Hospital before their diagnoses. She had her surgery in December 2016. The other 2 patients had their surgeries in December 2018 and January 2019.

But unlike [DP], both were already showing signs of the disease at the time of surgery.

Dr Gordon Dow, division head of infectious diseases at the Moncton Hospital, said even he was shocked when another case of CJD was discovered. "I was flabbergasted initially when I saw that we had 3 cases of this rare disease in a small city the size of Moncton," Dow said.

He immediately contacted the Public Health Agency of Canada, which runs a national surveillance system for the disease. He said the agency scrutinized each case, and he believes there is no need for people to panic.

"I think even though there's the overwhelming weight of evidence suggesting that we've had a cluster of sporadic cases, there is no need for public alarm," Dow said.

"This is not an indication that there's been an outbreak of CJD."

Dow said he found several factors that could explain why Moncton is seeing an increase in CJD diagnoses.

"Up until now, the only definitive diagnosis was [done through an] autopsy or brain biopsy," said Dow. He said within the last 2 years a new method of testing for CJD has been making it much easier to diagnose living patients.

"It has literally revolutionized our ability to diagnose this disease, which is probably more common than we realized," said Dow.

He points to national numbers that show an increase in CJD cases in the last 21 years in Canada, with the mortality rate rising steadily from 0.79 in 1998 to 2.09 in 2018.

As well, Dow said, the city has the largest cohort of neurologists in the province at its 2 hospitals. With neurologists and geriatricians best equipped to diagnose the disease, a diagnosis that might be missed elsewhere would get picked up in Moncton, he said.

With all 3 CJD patients having had cataract surgery at Moncton Hospital, Dow said the 1st concern he had was whether there was any chance that could have caused CJD. He turned to Public Health for information and looked at studies done around the world. He found there is no evidence of a link.

"There's no scientific evidence that cataract surgery can cause CJD," he said.

CJD is most often found in older people, and the elderly receive most cataract surgeries, Dow said. A symptom of CJD is blurred vision and blindness, issues that lead to people receiving cataract surgery.
Types of CJD

According to Dow there are 4 kinds of CJD:
- iatrogenic (through hospital or medical procedures) [iCJD];
- familial (through hereditary link) [fCJD];
- sporadic (spontaneously occurring for no apparent reason) [sCJD];
- variant CJD (BSE or "mad cow" disease [vCJD]).

He said the 2 earlier cases of CJD were determined to be sporadic, and for confidentiality reasons, he would not discuss [DP's] results.

Dow said he doesn't see a reason for the public to be concerned but, "if we keep seeing further rates of CJD rising in the Moncton area we're going to treat every case as a unique and important case," he said.

"There's going to be a lot of scrutiny."

[Any further information on the cases reported from New Brunswick, Canada would be highly appreciated.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder. It affects about one person in every one million per year worldwide; in the United States, there are about 350 cases per year. CJD usually appears in later life and runs a rapid course. Typical onset of symptoms occurs at about age 60, and about 70 percent of individuals die within one year. In the early stages of the disease, people may have failing memory, behavioral changes, lack of coordination, and visual disturbances. As the illness progresses, mental deterioration becomes pronounced and involuntary movements, blindness, weakness of extremities, and coma may occur.

There are 3 major categories of CJD:
- In sporadic CJD, the disease appears even though the person has no known risk factors for the disease. This is by far the most common type of CJD and accounts for at least 85 percent of cases.
- In hereditary CJD, the person may have a family history of the disease and test positive for a genetic mutation associated with CJD. About 10 to 15 percent of cases of CJD in the United States are hereditary.
- In acquired or iatrogenic CJD, the disease is transmitted by exposure to brain or nervous system tissue, usually through certain medical procedures or surgical treatment. Up to the year 2000 there have been 267 cases reported worldwide: 3 cases secondary to human corneal grafting (one confirmed, one probable, and one possible case); 114 related to human dura mater grafts; 139 related to human growth hormone treatment; 4 related to human pituitary gonadotrophin therapy; and 7 linked to neurosurgical procedures or stereotactic EEG electrodes. (1)

A case-control study from Australia (Collins et al) reported that previous cataract/eye surgery was associated with a more than 6-fold increase in the risk of sCJD (2). However other studies do not show evidence supporting this hypothesis (1).

There is no evidence that CJD is contagious through casual contact with someone who has CJD.

Most cases of iatrogenic CJD have occurred through the use of human growth hormone to treat children with restricted growth. Between 1958 and 1985, thousands of children were treated with the hormone, which at the time was extracted from the pituitary glands (a gland at the base of the skull) of human corpses (3).

- A type of CJD called variant CJD (or vCJD) can be acquired by eating meat from cattle affected by a disease similar to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or, commonly, "mad cow" disease (4).

It's also possible for vCJD to be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this is very rare and measures have been put in place to reduce the risk of it happening (3).
