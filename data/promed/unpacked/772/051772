[Jutland, where the outbreak occurred, was also the location for BTV-8
outbreaks in 2007. A map of restricted zones is posted on the Danish
Veterinary and Food Administration website at
<http://www.uk.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/AnimalHealth/Bluetongue/BT_Restricted_Zones.htm>.

The website indicates that 2 cattle had clinical signs but only one has
tested positive at the present time. The tests on the 2nd animals are
currently being run.

[2] UK (England): imported cases
Date: 27 Aug 2008

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has said 2
cases of bluetongue have been detected in imported rams.

The rams were imported from the same premises in the bluetongue-restricted
zone in France. The cases were found on premises near Lewes, East Sussex,
and Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

DEFRA said there was no evidence the disease was being circulated by midges
in the areas where cases were found. The cases were detected as a result of
post-import testing on all animals coming from the Continent, which are
susceptible to the disease, according to DEFRA.

Bluetongue, which can be fatal to animals, is transmitted between animals
such as cows and sheep by midges. The 1st outbreak of the disease in the UK
hit the country in summer 2007. A mass vaccination campaign against the
disease began in April [2008]. Some 21.5 million doses of vaccine have been
made available to farmers.

Deputy chief vet Alick Simmons said the disease "has recently been
confirmed as circulating this year [2008] in the Netherlands and large
areas of France, despite vaccination programmes being undertaken." "Similar
re-emergence of the disease in the UK would also not be unexpected in the
coming weeks," he said.

The bluetongue protection zone, which has kept in place to allow for
vaccination, covers most of England. It is legally permissible to import
animals from France's protection zone. Mr Simmons said the latest cases
emphasised the need for farmers to be aware of the risks of importing
animals from within restricted zones and the importance of vaccination.
"Farmers throughout the protection zone should vaccinate as soon as vaccine
is available to them," he said.
