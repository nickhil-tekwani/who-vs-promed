[While 2008's BTV-8 season is expected to probably commence in Europe
within the coming 2-3 months, the following review on the 2007 season
and the 1st quarter of 2008, prepared by the French Food Standards
Agency (AFSSA), seems to be timely and useful.

Breakdown by country (June 2007 - April 2008)
---------------------------------------------
France
------
In 2007, the 1st outbreak of BTV-8 was notified
on 27 July. A centrifugal extension of the
disease from the border between Belgium and
Luxembourg has, subsequently, been observed. As
of 31 Dec 2007, 15 251 foci [infected farms] were
reported in 58 metropolitan departments.

[During the current year, until] 4 Apr 2008,
4071 foci have been identified, including
departments in which no outbreak had been
identified in 2007 (e.g., Loire-Atlantique,
Correze, Dordogne). The French BTV-8 restriction
zones have been extended during the winter of
2007-2008.

[Most if not all of the winter's
"foci" in France may, in fact, represent animals
which underwent infection and seroconverted
during the 2007 BTV-8 season. - Mod.AS]

Germany
-------
In 2007, the 1st outbreak of BTV-8 was reported
on 6 July. A centrifugal extension of the
disease from the area affected in 2006 was
observed. The epizootic peaked in September 2007.
The foci were mainly concentrated in the western half of the territory.

As of 31 Dec 2007, 20 479 foci were reported
(making Germany the most heavily BTV-8 affected
European country). It should be noted that cases
have been reported in wildlife: 11 cases in
mouflons (wild sheep), 24 in fallow-deer, 4 among (red) deer.

[During the current year, until] 28 Mar 2008, the
German authorities have reported 2964 foci. These
foci may correspond to old contamination.

Belgium
-------
In 2007, the 1st outbreak of BTV-8 was reported
on 7 July. A centrifugal extension of the
disease from the area affected in 2006 was
observed. The epizootic peaked in September 2007.
The whole national territory has been involved,
with the western 3rd of the territory most heavily affected.

A total of 6870 foci were reported in 2007. Notably, 3 cases concerned
buffalo, one deer and one llama. No outbreaks have been officially
reported in 2008.

Netherlands
-----------
In 2007, the 1st outbreak of BTV-8 was reported
on 25 July. A centrifugal extension of the
disease from the area affected in 2006 was
observed. The epizootic peak was reached in
September 2007. The northern territory has been relatively less affected.

As of 4 January 2008, 6442 foci have been
reported; no later update is available. Notably,
an infection of a deer was reported.

Luxembourg
----------
In 2007, the 1st outbreak of BTV-8 was reported
on 17 August. The epizootic peaked in September 2007.

As of 20 Dec 2007, 1315 foci have been reported.
No later update is available. The whole national
territory has been affected during 2007.

UK
--
The 1st outbreak was reported on 22 Sep 2007. Defra [Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has been able to establish that
the virus had been brought into the territory by passive windborne
transport of infected Culicoides in August 2007.

As of 31 Dec 2007, 67 foci have been reported.

[During the current year, until] 4 April 2008, 58 "additional" foci
have been notified. According to Defra, they correspond to old
infections. All 125 foci are concentrated in the south-east parts of
[England]. Further cases have been identified in Northern Ireland:

-- In February 2008, the BTV-8 was isolated from
a heifer imported from the Netherlands to Ulster
a few days earlier (she had obtained negative
test results prior to the exportation from the Netherlands);
-- 3 cases have been identified in Ulster, in
February 2008, in calves probably vertically
infected from their respective dams which had
been imported from the Netherlands. The calves,
aged one week, had positive PCR results; BTV-8
virus was isolated from one of them.

Denmark
-------
One single case was notified on 13 Oct 2007 in a
sheep farm, on an island (Lolland). No
additional case has been reported since.

Switzerland
-----------
5 foci were reported between 28 Oct and 30 Nov
2007. Later, 2 foci were reported in 2 other
cantons, namely on 31 Jan and 08 Feb 2008.

Czech Republic
--------------
The 1st case was reported on 26 Nov 2007 in a bovine in the province
of Karlovarsky. Since early December 2007, daily temperatures were
below 10 deg.C [50 deg.F] according to the Czech authorities. A 2nd
case was reported on 19 Mar 2008 in a cattle, in the same province
(near the 1st outbreak); this could correspond to the 1st infection.

Spain
-----
A 1st focus of BTV-8 was reported in northern
Spain, on 8 Jan 2008; 11 other foci have been
reported as well (to the north).

Italy
-----
3 foci have been identified in the north of
Italy, in Verona, in March 2008 (respectively 14,
17 and 25 Mar 2008). They involved indigenous
cattle. The virus has been introduced into the
territory via animals from affected areas.
