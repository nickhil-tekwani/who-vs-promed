HEPATITIS A - ESTONIA (03): (VILJANDI), COMMENT

This is virtually certainly an outbreak of hepatitis A spread through
personal contact [case-to-case]. A contaminated foodstuff acting as a
continuing source is far less likely. Dates of onset and geographical
location of case should confirm this.

What is happening is that there are many subclinical cases which do
still spread the infection. This is why there are rarely obvious
connections between cases, which tend to pop-up apparently randomly,
though usually within one confined area [which may be large].

Moreover, this outbreak is almost certainly affecting a poorer part of
a community or county.

These outbreaks are difficult to control. Good personal hygiene is the
answer but never really works. If an area with affected cases can be
identified, mass vaccination is probably the only option.
