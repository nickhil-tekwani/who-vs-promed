Week 44/2014
------------
In the 5th week of the surveillance season, all 41 countries submitting data reported low intensity influenza activity, but 8 countries reported sporadic cases and 2 countries increasing trends.
For week 44/2014, of 459 sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) specimens tested across 27 countries, 11 (2 per cent) from 5 countries tested positive for influenza.
No hospitalised laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported.

Primary care data
All 41 countries submitting data for week 44/2014 reported low intensity of influenza activity, with 8 countries reporting sporadic influenza detections. Two countries (Azerbaijan and Bulgaria) reported increasing trends, while the remainder reported stable or decreasing trends.

According to EuroMOMO, all-cause mortality has been within the normal range in all reporting countries over recent weeks.

Season
As is typical for this time of year, influenza activity in the WHO European Region is low, and there is no indication that the influenza season has started in the region.
No indications of increased mortality due to influenza have been reported through the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action project (EuroMOMO, http://www.euromomo.eu).

Hospital data
For week 44/2014, no severe influenza cases were reported.

Since week 40/2014, a total of 11 laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized influenza cases have been reported by 3 countries (Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom). All 7 cases reported by the United Kingdom were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), were aged 19-64 years, and tested positive for influenza A virus, with 3 viruses being subtyped as A(H3N2).

Virus characteristics
For week 44/2014, 459 sentinel specimens were tested in 27 countries, with 11 detections (2 per cent) reported by 5 countries. Three were influenza A(H3N2), 2 influenza A(H1N1), 3 influenza A unsubtyped, one B Yamagata and 2 B Victoria. In addition, 64 specimens from non-sentinel sources tested positive for influenza virus; 35 were type A and 29 type B. Eight type A influenza viruses were subtyped: 7 as A(H3N2) and one as A(H1N1)pdm09.

Over the last 5 weeks, influenza viruses have been detected in 25 specimens tested in the sentinel system. 18 were positive for type A influenza virus; 13 were A(H3N2); 2 were A(H1N1), and 3 were not subtyped. Seven were positive for type B influenza virus.

Some countries in the region also detected respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from ILI/ARI cases. This week, 6 countries reported 138 specimens positive for RSV, an increase of 45 in the previous week.

[In the absence of seasonal influenza outbreaks, the importance of respiratory syncytial virus as a cause of influenza virus-like illness becomes apparent. It is remarkable that there were cases of influenza virus infection serious enough to require hospitalisation anywhere in Europe. - Mod.CP
