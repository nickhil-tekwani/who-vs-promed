[1] WHO situation report 9 Dec 2015
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2015 [as of 6 Dec 2015]

Summary
-------
No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 6 Dec [2015].

Liberia
-------
Investigations into the origin of infection of the cluster of 3 confirmed cases of EVD reported from Liberia in the week to 22 Nov [2015] are continuing, with a working assumption that the cluster arose as a result of a rare re-emergence of persistent virus from a survivor. The 1st-reported case in that cluster was a 15-year-old boy who tested positive for EVD after admission to a health facility in the Greater Monrovia area on 19 Nov [2015]. He was then transferred to an Ebola treatment centre along with the 5 other members of his family. 2 other members of the family -- the boy's 8-year old brother and his 40-year-old father -- subsequently tested positive for EVD whilst in isolation. Both tested negative twice for Ebola virus on 3 Dec [2015]. The 15-year-old boy died on 23 Nov [2015]. In addition to the family of the 1st-reported case, 165 contacts have been identified, including 15 high-risk contacts. Contacts are now in the 3rd week of their 21-day follow-up period.

Sierra Leone
------------
On 7 Nov [2015] WHO declared that Sierra Leone had achieved objective 1 of the phase 3 framework, and the country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb 2016.

Guinea
------
As of 6 Dec [2015], it had been 20 days since the last EVD patient in Guinea received a 2nd consecutive EVD-negative blood test. The last case in Guinea was reported on 29 Oct 2015.

The recent cases in Liberia underscore the importance of robust surveillance measures to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. In order to achieve objective 2 of the phase 3 response framework -- to manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put surveillance systems in place to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD to the relevant authorities. In the week to 6 Dec [2015], 19 864 such alerts were reported in Guinea, with alerts reported from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Equivalent data are not currently available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1420 alerts were reported from all 14 districts in the week ending 15 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available).

As part of each country's EVD surveillance strategy, blood samples or oral swabs should be collected from any live or deceased individuals who have or had clinical symptoms compatible with EVD. In the week to 6 Dec [2015] 8 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 582 new and repeat samples from 12 of the country's 34 prefectures; 84 percent of all samples tested in Guinea were swabs collected from dead bodies. By contrast, 82 percent of the 1020 new and repeat samples tested in Liberia over the same period were blood samples collected from live patients. In addition, all 15 counties in Liberia submitted samples for testing by the country's 5 operational laboratories; 1363 new samples were collected from all 14 districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 8 operational laboratories; 95 percent of samples in Sierra Leone were swabs collected from dead bodies.

A total of 964 deaths in the community were reported from Guinea in the week to 6 Dec [2015] through the country's alert system. This represents approximately 43 percent of the 2248 community deaths expected based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1000 people per year. Equivalent data are not yet available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1282 reports of community deaths were received through the alert system during the week ending 15 November (the most recent week for which data are available), representing approximately 62 percent of the 2075 deaths expected each week based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 17 deaths per 1000 people per year.

[2] Liberia: Ebola transmission tracked to one source (in Sierra Leone)
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2015
Source: Medical News Today (MNT) [edited]
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/303832.php


According to Cell Host & Microbe [journal], it is likely most cases in the latest reemergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia originated from just one source.

Contact tracing has shown at least 3 potential introductions of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) to Liberia from Sierra Leone around the start of the 2nd reemergence of Liberian cases. Although EVD spread to Liberia several times from neighboring countries early during the outbreak, it now appears that most Liberian cases came from a single introduction of the virus, in late May or early June 2014, around the start of the 2nd wave of Liberian cases. EVD then spread rapidly through the country, refueling the ongoing outbreak in Guinea.

According to Jason Ladner of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), "The widespread movement of the Ebola virus [EBOV] within Liberia, due to a high rate of migration in the country, is likely to have played an important role in the magnitude and longevity of the Liberian portion of the Ebola outbreak. Regular migration of infected individuals complicates surveillance and isolation efforts, which are critical for controlling Ebola outbreaks."

The study also reported that 140 EBOV genomes from Liberian patients were sequenced and analyzed with 782 other sequences, that reintroductions from Liberia helped sustain the Guinea and Mali outbreaks, and that there was limited evidence of incremental Ebola virus adaptation to the human host.

[3] Sexual transmission of Ebola -- Part 2 of 2
Date: Tue 8 Dec 2015

http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/2015/12/08/the-sexual-transmission-of-ebola-scicomm-as-a-matter-of-life-and-death-pt-2-of-2/


[7 weeks after Liberia was declared free from Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission, the reemergence of EVD in Liberia in late June 2015 and November 2015 brought to center stage how the disease is transmitted, and brought the problem of sexual transmission to the forefront. The shift away from coping with a national health emergency to dealing with what may now be a "new normal" requires different public health messages for Liberians.

9 Dec 2015 New Zealand: NZ Ebola screening to be scaled back
http://www.nzherald.co.nz/health/news/article.cfm?c_id=204&objectid=11558499
[With Sierra Leone recently declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission, New Zealand`s efforts at border screening are being scaled back.]

7 Dec 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola -- Sierra Lone cleared to host matches
http://thenationonlineng.net/ebola-sierra-lone-cleared-to-host-matches/
[In August 2014, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) banned Sierra Leone from hosting matches following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, in a letter dated 6 Dec 2015, CAF informed Sierra Leone the ban has been lifted following the end of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission the country.

7 Dec 2015 WHO: Disease specialists identify post-Ebola threats
http://www.nature.com/news/disease-specialists-identify-post-ebola-threats-1.18952
Scientists and doctors are meeting today (8 Dec 2015) and tomorrow (9 Dec 2015) in Geneva, Switzerland to discuss which infectious disease may start the next pandemic.

The top candidates so far are:
- other Ebola virus disease (EVD) species or Marburg virus disease (MARV);
- Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and related viruses;
- Influenza;
- Nipah (NiV) virus disease and Hendra (HeV) virus disease;
- the unknown.

6 Dec 2015 West Africa: Curbing Ebola -- Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea must invest in sensitization
http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/op-ed/editorial/6897-curbing-ebola-liberia-sierra-leone-guinea-must-invest-in-sensitization
[Many survivors lack counselling and more importantly, are facing various health problems, signaling that if nothing is done to address this, this batch of survivors could essentially be the reservoir that sparks the next major outbreak. It is important now, more than ever before that governments in these 3 countries understand how the disease continues to affect the survivors if they are serious about eradicating the virus for good. Failure to take precautions now and invest in sensitization and communications programs that will aid the full recovery of survivors (could have serious consequences).]

Technology
----------
7 Dec 2015: Ultraviolet LEDs could be used to fight disease
http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ultraviolet-leds-could-be-used-fight-disease-1532134
["The ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV LED) could serve as great help in medical field as it has potential to eradicate infectious diseases such as Ebola." Marketing hype -- check the product on its website. This is very expensive and completely impractical. It is a pulsed UV xenon lamp on top of a waist-high wheeled trolley, all furniture must be removed, the operator must exit the room while it is operating, wall fixtures like handbasins will cast shadows into which the UV cannot reach. A reduction of 3 logs in virus titer means only a 1000-fold reduction, which is insignificant because a drop of dried blood on a surface could contains millions of infectious virus particles.

Funding
-------
7 Dec 2015 West Africa: Ebola investment boosts neglected-disease research
http://www.nature.com/news/ebola-investment-boosts-neglected-disease-research-1.18975
[Funding for work on neglected diseases increased by USD 150 million in 2014, to USD 3.37 billion. However, investments made to address the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic -- which started in West Africa in 2014 -- were entirely responsible for the increase. While money from industry for Ebola research rose, money from public funding decreased.]

7 Dec 2015 Gambia: Ebola Poses Significant Threat to Economic Growth -- WAMZ DG http://allafrica.com/stories/201512072030.html
[According to the Director General of the West Africa Monetary Zone (WAMZ), Abawaku Englama, while speaking at the 7th Edition of WAMZ Trade Ministers forum in Gambia, the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) presents a significant threat to agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, tourism, and transportation. It has also negatively impacted some of the major developments of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) activities in 2014 in the member countries.
