The [Jamaica] Ministry of Agriculture is reporting the emergence of a disease affecting the cocoa crop known as frosty pod rot. This is the 1st time that the highly contagious disease has been confirmed in the Caribbean.

Agriculture Minister Karl Samuda said the presence of the disease was confirmed following tests by the Plant Quarantine Unit. It is concentrated in Clarendon [Jamaica]. A cocoa farmer in the parish reported the fungal disease in late August [2016].

The minister described the situation as grave since the disease has the potential to cause significant damage.

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease which was originally identified in Ecuador in 1917 and spread rapidly to other countries in Latin America during the 1970s. It can cause complete loss of production and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production in the region. FPR reached the northern boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. The report above appears to be the 1st time FPR has been detected outside of Latin America.

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies (shrivelled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores giving affected pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as reservoirs. Conventional control measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in parts of Brazil and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both pathogens pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.
