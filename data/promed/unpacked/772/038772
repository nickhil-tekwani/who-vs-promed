Cholera - Mozambique
--------------------
On [Fri 27 Oct 2017], the Ministry of Health in Mozambique notified WHO of an outbreak of cholera. From [Mon 14 Aug 2017 through Sun 11 Feb 2018], 1799 cases and one death (case fatality rate equal to 0.06 percent) of cholera were reported from the 2 provinces; Nampula (1580 cases) and Cabo Delgado (219 cases). Underreporting of the number of cases and deaths is likely. This outbreak has been confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests and culture. The outbreak started in Memba district in the northeastern province Nampula and spread to Erati district by [Sun 15 Oct 2017]. By [Sun 19 Nov 2017], the outbreak had spread to 2 further districts in the same province (Nacaroa and Nampula city).

Case incidence peaked in mid-November 2017 with 252 cases reported in one week; this peak was followed by a rapid decrease in reported cases (figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). A slow increase in the number of cases reported has been observed since late December 2017. On [Fri 5 Jan 2018], the 1st cases were reported from Pemba City in Cabo Delgado Province which is north of Nampula. In 2018 so far, the weekly number of cases have fluctuated between 30 and 60 cases.

Cholera outbreaks have occurred in Mozambique every year for the past 5 years. The most recent outbreak prior to the current outbreak started in January 2017 and ended in April 2017, and resulted in a total of 2129 cases and 4 deaths (case fatality rate equal to 0.2 percent). 3 provinces and 6 districts were affected in the 2017 outbreak (Tete, Nampula, and Maputo province).

Public health response
----------------------
WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing:
- The Ministry of Health is leading a weekly coordination meeting at the national level to discuss the ongoing response. Partners including WHO, UNICEF, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and the Red Cross attend and support the meeting.
- Multi-sectoral coordination particularly at the district level; coordinating response actions between the different sectors and it is led by district officials.
- WHO has conducted a rapid assessment of the situation in Nampula province and has shared the findings at the national coordination meeting.
WHO has supported training on case management and surveillance in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces to improve case management, case detection, and reporting.
- With support from UNICEF, national and local health authorities have provided logistical support to set up and supply cholera treatment centers with consumable, medication, and infection prevention and control supplies. Cholera treatment centers have been set up in each of the affected districts.
- There are efforts to improve water quality, sanitation conditions, and hygiene practices in the affected districts are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities and water supply sector with the support of partners.
- Social mobilization and risk communication activities are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities with the support of partners.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next 3 months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak.

It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the 2 affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels.

The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case management should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to rapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas. The provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak should also be considered.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique based on the information available. The use of safe drinking water and the implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

An outbreak of cholera in central Tanzania's Dodoma region of has left 18 dead in 4 months, a health official said on [Tue 20 Feb 2018].

Since last October 2017, 470 cholera cases have been recorded in the region, Dodoma Regional Medical Officer James Kiologwe said. In December [2017] and January [2018], cholera cases were low, but the number went up this month, February 2018, he said.

According to Kiologwe, Mpwapwa and Chamwino are the districts hit harder with cholera, an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea and leads to dehydration and even death if untreated. "Until [Mon 19 Feb 2018], this week, there were about 26 new cases in Mpwapwa and Chamwino districts," he said, noting that 22 of the 26 have been discharged after treatment.

Efforts are underway to contain the disease, particularly in the harder hit areas, including educating people to observe general hygiene. "A team of health practitioners has been dispatched in those areas to educate people on the effective use of latrines or other sanitation systems, like chemical toilets, and encourage them to ensure that they wash hands with soap and safe water after toilets," the official said.

According to the World Health Organization, from 15 August 2015 to [Sun 7 Jan 2018], 33 421 cholera cases, including 542 deaths, have been reported across all 26 regions of Tanzania. Children under 5-years-old accounted for 11.4 percent of the cases.

A cholera outbreak in Malawi described as "very difficult to contain" has claimed 9 lives and affected a total of 541 people nationwide, health officials said on [Tue 20 Feb 2018]. The outbreak began in November 2017 near the landlocked southern African nation's northern border with Tanzania and has since spread to other regions of the country.

UNICEF's representative to Malawi Johannes Wedenig told local media that "as long as people in Malawi don't change the behaviour of using unsafe water, it'll be very difficult to contain". He urged Malawians to follow strict sanitation rules and stressed the importance of hand-washing before eating or preparing food.

The country has also received 216 000 oral cholera treatment packs from the WHO which are being distributed in the badly-affected northern region, health ministry spokesman Joshua Malango told AFP. Another 450 000 doses are expected to arrive soon for distribution in the rest of the country, added Malango, confirming the current toll. Health officials have begun a media blitz to educate people about the risk of cholera and what steps they can take to avoid contracting it.

A total of 8 people have died and more than 320 others are hospitalized in Hoima district following a suspected cholera outbreak. The latest outbreak has been reported in Rwenyawawa village in Kyangwali sub-county and Sebigoro landing site in Kabwoya sub-county.

The 2 areas are home to hundreds of Congolese refugees fleeing tribal clashes between the Lendu and Bagegere in Ituri province in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The violence is believed to have pushed an estimated 43 000 Congolese refugees into Uganda.

Dr Fred Kugonza, the Hoima district disease surveillance officer, says the deceased suspected cholera victims were children below 5 years. According to Dr Kugonza, the children showed symptoms and signs of high fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

He explains that as part of their intervention, they have set up isolation centers in Rwenyawawa village in Kyangwali sub-county and another one at Sebigoro landing site in Kabwoya sub-counties along Lake Albert. Dr Kugonza says samples from some of the patients have been dispatched to the central government analytical laboratory for testing. Hoima resident district commissioner (RDC), John Steven Ekoom advises residents to observe personal hygiene and embrace the use of pit latrines.

He blames the crisis on poor sanitary conditions in the refugee settlement camps, saying the situation is likely to worsen when rain sets in.

The government has confirmed that 2 people and not 4, died after a cholera outbreak in Tana River County. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, in a press release sent to newsrooms also refuted claims that 84 people had been confirmed to have contracted the deadly disease saying the number was much lower. "It is 3 of the 201 cases recorded that are laboratory confirmed and not 84 as reported in a section of the media," read the statement.

The government said the other 2 people reported to have died of cholera could not be conclusively verified as having been caused by the disease. Several media outlets reported that 8 people had died while 129 others were hospitalized following the outbreak in the area.

Palawan provincial health officials are putting the death toll due to a diarrhea outbreak in Balabac to 10, according to a Palawan News report.

The number of people affected in this current outbreak is about 300. This outbreak follows one just a couple of months ago that sickened some 200.

Tainted drinking water has been blamed for the outbreak, which has tested positive for _E. coli_ from human or animal waste. Last fall 2017, Palawan officials declared a "state of emergency" in the municipality of Quezon where hundreds were sickened.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
