[1] 4th ASF outbreak in China - Zhejiang province

China, home to the world's largest pig herd, reported its 4th outbreak of the deadly African swine fever [ASF] on Thursday [23 Aug 2018], with more than 400 pigs infected as the disease entered a 4th province, fanning worries about its rapid spread.

The infection killed 340 hogs on 3 farms in the coastal city of Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement. Zhejiang is the 4th region to discover the infection and the furthest from the original outbreak in Shenyang, the capital of northeastern Liaoning province.

Authorities have already culled more than 20 000 animals in an attempt to halt the spread of the highly contagious disease, which was 1st reported in China just 3 weeks ago. But the vast distance between new cases and the original outbreak will escalate worries about how to control the disease across China's massive hog herd.

To reach Wenzhou from Shenyang, it's a 2150 km (1335 mile) drive south through the pig-producing provinces of Hebei and Shandong as well as Jiangsu, another infected region.

The 3rd infection, detected at the weekend, was just 890 km (553 miles) to the north in another coastal city, Lianyungang. The other was in land in central Henan province. That may stoke concerns that the disease is being transmitted along busy trade routes that take pigs from market and farm in the northeast to slaughter and processing in the south. Some farmers have called a nationwide ban on transporting live pigs.

The rapid expansion of pig farms in recent years in China's northeastern corn belt has increased the number of pigs being moved across country. Local authorities in Wenzhou have banned the movement of live hogs, related products, and animals that are easily infected both into and outside the affected area, the ministry said.

[2] ASF in China reviewed
Date: Tue 21 Aug 2018

A nightmare is unfolding for animal-health experts: African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious, often fatal disease of domestic pigs and wild boars, has appeared in China, the world's largest pork producer. As of today [Tue 21 Aug 2018], ASF has been reported at sites in 4 provinces in China's northeast, thousands of kilometers apart. [As of Thu 23 Aug 2018, the number of infected provinces has become 5; see item 1 above. - Mod.AS]. Containing the disease in a population of more than 430 million hogs, many raised in smallholder farmyards with minimal biosecurity, could be a monumental challenge.

"The entry of ASF into China is really a very serious issue," says Yang Hanchun, a swine viral disease scientist at China Agricultural University in Beijing. Given the scale of China's pork sector, the economic impact could be devastating, Yang says, and the outbreak puts a crucial protein source at risk. From China, the virus could also spread elsewhere; if it becomes endemic, "it will represent a major threat for the rest of the world, including the American continent," says Francois Roger, an animal epidemiologist at the Agricultural Research Center for International Development in Montpellier, France.

The virus that causes ASF does not harm humans, but it spreads rapidly among domestic pigs and wild boars through direct contact or exposure to farmworkers' contaminated shoes, clothing, and equipment. It can survive heat and cold and persists for weeks in carcasses, feces, and fresh and semicured pork products, such as sausages. Ticks can also spread it. Infection causes a high fever, internal bleeding, and, often, death. There is no ASF vaccine and no treatment for infected animals.

Endemic in most African countries, ASF jumped to the nation of Georgia in 2007 and later spread through Russia; it has also been reported in Poland and the Czech Republic, and scientists worry about a jump to major pork producers such as Germany and Denmark.

East Asia's 1st confirmed outbreak occurred on Wed 1 Aug 2018 in Shenyang, a city in Liaoning province, China's Ministry of Agriculture says. Investigators have traced the disease back through sales of pigs and concluded the virus has been circulating in the area since at least March [2018], says Wantanee Kalpravidh, a veterinarian at the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO's) Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Disease in Bangkok.

A genetic analysis suggests the virus is closely related to the strain circulating in Russia, scientists from the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine in Changchun and other Chinese institutions reported on Mon 13 August 2018 in Transboundary and Emerging Diseases [see 20180815.5967476]. "The increasing demand for pork has resulted in a great increase in the volume of live pigs and pork products imported to China," heightening the risk of introduction, they wrote. The virus probably arrived in imported pork products, Kalpravidh says, which then infected pigs that were fed contaminated table and kitchen scraps.

A 2nd outbreak occurred on Tue 14 Aug 2018 at a slaughterhouse in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province; the afflicted pigs had been shipped from a market in Jiamusi, a town in Heilongjiang province, more than 2000 km [about 1243 mi] to the northeast. The virus struck again on Wed 15 Aug 2018 at a farm in Lianyungang, in Jiangsu province. The Chinese government has responded by culling sick and exposed animals -- nearly 9000 were killed in Shenyang alone -- blockading outbreak areas; disinfecting farms, markets, and processing facilities; controlling the movement of live pigs and pork products; screening animals; and conducting epidemiological surveys.

But there are serious challenges to containing the virus. Pig producers in China range from massive, sophisticated operations to small backyard farms; tailoring a response to suit them all "is the biggest challenge for China to control ASF," Yang says. The complexity of the production chain makes tracing paths of infection "an incredible effort to tackle," says Juan Lubroth, chief veterinarian at FAO's headquarters in Rome. Kalpravidh says China is trying to earn the cooperation of producers by immediately compensating them for culled animals, in hopes of stopping them from slaughtering sick pigs and selling their meat. But ticks and wild boar could also spread the disease, although their role is poorly understood.

So far, Lubroth says, China's "very sophisticated and knowledgeable veterinary workforce" has operated aggressively, and the government has been transparent about ASF's spread. But containing ASF "won't happen overnight," he warns.

[Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu and Shanghai to the north, Anhui to the northwest, Jiangxi to the west, and Fujian to the south. To the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.

The report in Science magazine includes a schematic map presenting the distances between the ASF foci in China, as of Tue 21 Aug 2018. The new outbreak in Wenzhou, in the province Zhejiang, addressed in item 1 above, is situated about 700 km [435 mi] south of the outbreak in the province Lianyungang. This is another major leap of the virus southwards. Drawing lines between the locations of the 5 known outbreaks, in chronological order, is rather simplistic. Since the virus has been, most probably, circulating on China's ground for at least 4 months before being eventually detected, the imaging of its actual chronological route of spread may be distant from reality.

As rightly stated by FAO's chief veterinarian, Juan Lubroth, "China's very sophisticated and knowledgeable veterinary workforce has operated aggressively"; unfortunately, this operation could commence only "after the horse (or rather pig) has bolted." An unimaginable task on their hands. - Mod.AS
