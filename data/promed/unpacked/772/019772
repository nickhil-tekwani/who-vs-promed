SALMONELLA ENTERITIDIS PHAGE TYPE 11 - UK

_Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type (PT) 11 has been isolated in increasing
numbers in England and Wales in the past three years. One hundred and two
human isolates were reported in the first 44 weeks of 1998 compared with 88
in the same period of 1997 (data from the Public Health Laboratory Service
(PHLS) Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens). A total of 135 isolates were
reported in 1997, compared with 110 in 1996 and 89 in 1995. Almost all
isolates have been antibiotic sensitive.
The seasonal pattern of reporting, with an increase in late summer and
autumn, is like that of other strains of salmonella, but the curve appears
to be shifting to peak later in the year. Cases are not obviously
clustered, but northern regions have reported more isolates. The age
distribution differs from that of most other salmonella strains, in that
two thirds of cases each year have been children under 5 years of age.
Interrogation of the Enter-Net database from other national laboratories
yielded no evidence of a similar pattern in other countries that contribute
to the network. Scotland reported some isolates of _S. enteritidis_ PT11 in
1998 and 1997, but the cases had a different age distribution. The other
participating nations have reported very few cases since 1996. Two
countries reported isolates from horses.

_S. enteritidis_ PT11 has been previously reported in hedgehogs in England
and Wales (1). The cases reported in autumn 1998 are being investigated. We
would appreciate any reports of isolates of _S. enteriditis_ PT 11 from
humans, animals, or foodstuffs, or any other relevant information that
could help us with our enquiries, please contact Sergio Brusin
(sbrusin@phls.co.uk).

[For those who may not be able to access the graph, it shows that the peak
of cases during years 1995/96 occurred between weeks 29 and 43. During
1997 the peak occurred between weeks 37 and 47, and in 1998 the peak had
not yet been reached by week 44. - Mod.ES]
