Re: >England and Scotland experimented with anthrax during World
War I. They dumped some spores on an island north of Scotland
which is still uninhabited now, some 80 years later... Henry Wilde,
MD <awilde@alaska.net>

The experimentsreferred were carried out in 1942 and 1943 by the
UK, US, and Canada and involved the release of spores on an
UNINHABITED island, Gruinard off the West Coast of Scotland.
Soil samples were tested annually from 1948 to 1968 and again in
1972 and 1979 by the UK Ministry of Defense staff.
These showed viable spores in some areas around the release sites.
It is not therefore correct to say that spores survive virtually indefinitely.
Different decontamination methods were tested and the areas around
the release sites were eventually decontaminated using a 5% solution
of formaldehyde in sea water in 1986-87. The island was handed back
to the heirs of the owners for the sum of UKL500 in 1990. In the words
of the Handel aria "Sheep may [now safely graze".
Refs: Nature 1981 vol 294 p 254, Nature 1990 vol 344 p 801.
We are currently working on non-toxic methods of decontamination
which could be applied to the skin and the environment.

The island in question is Gruinard Island, located one-half mile off
the northwest coast of Scotland. The British government exploded
anthrax bombs on Gruinard not during WWI but during the summers
of 1942 and 1943. In 1986, a group from CDE [Chemical Defense
Establishment, Porton Down, successfully decontaminated Gruinard
Island with a mixture of five percent formaldehyde, a sporicidal chemical,
in sea water. On April 24, 1990, the British Under Secretary of State
for Defense came to Gruinard and formally declared the island "fit for
habitation by man and beast."
Although the island is not inhabited, it is no longer contaminated by
anthrax spores.
