A few comments on the African horse sickness (AHS) situation in South Africa
-----------------------------------------------
Plettenberg Bay is in the Western Cape, and the serotype involved in
the deaths of 2 horses is AHSV type 5. The virus was introduced by
horse movement from the North of the country, where types 5 and 7 are
currently circulating. The 4 deaths in the Eastern Cape occurred on a
game farm and were due to AHSV type 2. This particular serotype has
been present in the Eastern Cape since 2001 and was isolated in the
2003, 2004 and 2005 seasons [see 20030318.0675].
AHS is not endemic in South Africa except for the subtropical North,
and the virus moves a variable distance down to the temperate South
each season. The distance moved depends on climatic factors favoring
the vector and the immune status of the population.
AHS appears to have become entrenched in the Eastern Cape possibly
because of the large donkey population and the numerous zebras on the
many game farms in which animals are [kept]. The virus circulates in
a subclinical form.
At present, we have recovered isolates from 6 of the 9 provinces in
South Africa.

[We are grateful to Dr. Gerdes for her kind response to our request
for data on the AHSV serotype(s) involved in the recent cases in
South Africa. Her appreciated geographical remark regarding the
situation of Plettenberg Bay in the Western Cape illuminates a
repeated AHS introduction into this province. - Mod.AS]
