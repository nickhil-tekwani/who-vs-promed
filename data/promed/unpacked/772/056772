Health officials have identified almost 100 sick people in Iowa and at least one in Minnesota in a multi-state _Salmonella_ outbreak investigation linked to chicken salad sold at Fareway stores.

The company that supplied the deli chicken salad to Fareway Stores Inc. has not been revealed by the regional grocery chain, state officials or federal officials. As of tonight, 16 Feb 2018, the grocer, which has about 120 retail stores, did not have any information about the situation on its website. It has not recalled any food in relation to the outbreak.

Iowa's Department of Public Health issued a public alert on Tue 13 Feb 2018 about the link between the chicken salad and the outbreak. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service followed up on Wed 14 Feb 2018 with its own warning. Those warnings did not report the number of illnesses. Today, 16 Feb 2018, the Iowa health department reported that 94 sick people are implicated: 28 of them have laboratory-confirmed infections from _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium, and 66 of them are probable cases.

All of the 28 confirmed sick people reported eating chicken salad from Fareway during the 7 days before they became ill. Of the 66 probable victims for whom confirmation tests are pending, all reported eating chicken salad from a Fareway store in the week before they became ill. Other probable cases have epidemiological links to a confirmed sick person, according to the Iowa health department update posted today, 16 Feb 2018.

Illness onset dates range from 1 Jan 2018 through 16 Feb 2018. There are likely more outbreak victims that are not yet showing up in state totals because of the lag time between illness onset, diagnosis and reporting to state officials.

In Minnesota, only one person had been confirmed as a victim of the outbreak, according to the state's health department Facebook page. The sick person lives in Martin County.

The chicken salad linked to the outbreak was sold at all of Fareway Stores Inc. grocery stores in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, according to federal officials. Neither the official websites nor Facebook pages for the Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota health departments had any mention of the outbreak as of tonight.
