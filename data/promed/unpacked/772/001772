Bird flu hits research farm in Chiang Mai
------------------------------------
A recurrence of the fatal bird-flu virus killed more than 1000 chickens at
an isolated research farm at Chiang Mai University, an official with the
Department of Livestock Development said yesterday.
Laboratory tests confirmed that the dead chickens were infected with the
H5N1 virus, which causes bird flu, the official who asked not to be named
told The Nation.
The department's director-general, Yukol Limlamthong, declined to comment
on the results of the laboratory tests, but did say that more than 500
chickens had been culled at the research farm to prevent an outbreak.
The university's Agriculture Faculty runs the farm.
The department has informed the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE]
of the latest development, Yukol said.
Officials are closely monitoring the situation, but the province does not
have to be declared a bird-flu zone, Yukol said. [This deserves
explanation. - Mod.AS]
More than 1000 chickens and 7 ostriches at the research farm were found
dead last Wednesday after having shown bird-flu symptoms.
Chiang Mail University lecturer Banchong Wongruang said the research farm
would be closed for the next 3 months, and during this period students
would be sent to private farms as part of their course work.
Banchong said the fatal disease might [have] been spread from an infected
farm nearby where chickens were culled one month ago, or from migratory
birds that had stopped at a pond near the farm.
Since December 2003, more than 39 million chickens -- about 800 000 of
which were raised in Chiang Mai -- were culled across the country due to
the bird-flu outbreak.
On 14 May 2004, the Agriculture Ministry declared that the country had
brought the outbreak to an end, but also said it would need to monitor the
situation for another 6 months.
The latest outbreak "clearly demonstrates that the virus is still
circulating", Hans Wagner, of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation,
said yesterday. He urged countries in the region not to let their guard down.
Asian nations must continue to implement epidemiological measures to keep
the disease from spreading, said Wagner, a senior animal production and
health officer at the UN agency's regional office.
Chiang Mai duck farmer Kong Pintasa said he was still too afraid to start
raising a new batch of ducklings after losing more than 400 ducks to bird
flu earlier in 2004.
"I am worried that the bird flu will come back and leave to me to suffer
the losses, and I don't have any money to invest," Kong said.
Kong, who had raised ducks for eggs for more than a decade, switched to
vegetables after the bird-flu outbreak.
Chiang Mai chicken farmer Chanaphol Jia-sawas said he was waiting for the
Agriculture Ministry to develop and introduce a bird-flu vaccine.
"An effective vaccine would be good for all chicken farmers," he said.

New outbreak of bird flu in northern Thailand, official says
------------------------------------------------------------
A new outbreak of bird flu has killed hundreds of chickens at a research
farm in northern Thailand, an official said Wednesday, in a re-emergence of
the disease that had appeared to be on the wane.
Agriculture Ministry officials have culled 1575 chickens at the Chiang Mai
University farm in Chiang Mai province after being informed about the
outbreak by the university, said Yukol Limlamthong, director general of the
Livestock Department. The farm, which is in an isolated area, has been
quarantined.
It contained various other avian species, including water fowl, but no
symptoms or deaths were recorded among them, Yukol said.
Thai officials said 14 May 2004 that the government was all but certain the
country was free of bird flu, after the last area to suffer an outbreak was
declared safe at the end of a 21-day monitoring period.
However, the latest infection in Chiang Mai is believed to have started on
22 May 2004, when about 473 chickens died of bird flu-like symptoms, Yuokol
said.
The avian influenza virus swept through 10 Asian nations earlier in 2004,
killing or forcing the cull of more than 100 million poultry, including
more than 37 million birds in Thailand.
The disease also jumped to people, killing 16 in Vietnam and 8 in Thailand.
Vietnam said it was bird flu-free at the end of March, though the World
Health Organization warned that it was premature to declare the disease
under control. Thailand was also about to declare itself free of bird flu,
but held off after the WHO warning.
