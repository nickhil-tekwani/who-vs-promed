Canadian meat products recalled
A Canadian meat processing company is recalling products distributed in the
United States following an outbreak of illness in Canada traced to _E.
coli_ bacteria, U.S. officials announced Tuesday. The products, made by
Venetian Meat and Salami Co. Ltd. of Hamilton, Ontario, were distributed in
Chicago, New York, New Jersey and northern Pennsylvania.
In Canada, 33 people have become ill from eating Venetian products, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
The recall affects all dry fermented meat products sold under the Venetian
Brand name with codes 300 to 363 and 004 to 007. Their labels also carry a
Canadian establishment number, 222. The products are a variety of specialty
meats including salami, cacciatore and casalingo. They should be returned
to the place of purchase, officials said.
