A 2nd death from a hantavirus [infection] in Veraguas province was confirmed by the authorities of the Ministry of Health [MINSA].

The individual is a 29-year-old male resident in the Hicaco community in the south of the Sona district, an area endemic for hantaviruses. Following this death, investigations have already been initiated.

Ricardo Chong, MINSA epidemiologist, stated that in this last case, medical attention occurred a little late so that sadly the individual died in the Dr. Ezequiel Abadía Hospital despite treatment.

The 1st death also occurred in the south of Sona district in the La Solidad community, where 15 cases were registered; 2 of these were fatal victims.

[This is the 2nd hantavirus infection case in Veraguas province that ProMED has posted. The 1st case, reported on 22 Sep 2022, also fatal, was a 25-year-old woman who lived in the La Solidad community in Sona. She was attended to in the Ezequiel Abadía Hospital as well (see Hantavirus - Americas (29): Panama (VR) 20220927.8705813). Most past cases have occurred in Herrera and Los Santos provinces.

Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
