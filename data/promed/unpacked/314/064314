The outbreak of the contagious bacterial equine disease glanders,
which has caused havoc across the kingdom, could take almost a year
to eradicate, a world authority on the condition has revealed.

Dr Ulrich Wernery, scientific director of the Central Veterinary
Research Laboratory (CVRL) based in Dubai, was called in by the
government to give his expert opinion about the spread of the illness
which has led to several horses and ponies being destroyed, stables
installing special precautions, and public demonstrations of anger.

Speaking to GulfWeekly shortly before flying back from Bahrain
International Airport after a 2-day visit, he said: 'We have been
completely overwhelmed and surprised by the situation here. It is a
time for all of us to learn, be patient, and work towards containing
and eradicating the disease.'

He revealed that an international team of experts from the Office
International des Epizooties -- World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE) in Paris, France -- will be arriving shortly to help
authorities tackle the problem.

The outbreak has affected the movement of horses and brought an
abrupt end to local horse racing and competitions.

According to an OIE report on the Bahrain outbreak seen by
GulfWeekly, the 1st 2 horses of mixed breed, which were positive
without clinical signs, originated from Syria and Kuwait and arrived
6 months ago.

Glanders is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium
_Burkholderia mallei_ that occurs primarily in horses and it has
spread across the kingdom. It is believed that around 20 horses have
had to be put down so far. Another 27 are on 'death row' awaiting
confirmation of infection.

Glanders can also be contracted by other animals such as mules,
camels, and donkeys. Dogs can also be infected in rare cases and it
is also a danger to people working close to sick animals without
protection.

Symptoms of glanders include the formation of nodular lesions in the
lungs and ulceration of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory
tract. The acute form results in coughing, fever, and the release of
a highly infectious nasal discharge. Death can occur within a few
weeks, while survivors act as carriers.

It has been eradicated from the US, Australia, and most of Europe
through surveillance and destruction of affected animals and import
restrictions.

During the 1st World War, Glanders was believed to have been spread
deliberately by German agents to infect Russian horses and mules on
the Eastern Front. This had an effect on troop and supply convoys,
which were dependent on horses and mules.

The reputed veterinarian with over 35 years of experience confirmed
that 47 horses have been infected on the island. Dr Wernery, 67,
said: 'We have to first identify all the positive cases. At present
more than half of the horse population has to be tested. It takes
time and it will take quite a while before we wipe out this disease.
I think the problem can be solved within a year. We are also very
astonished as there are quite a number of positive cases spread in
many stables around the island.'

Dr Wernery, who has dealt with a similar but smaller outbreak in the
quarantine facilities in Dubai a few years ago, said that all
suspected horses had to be quarantined and kept away from healthy
animals by a distance of 100 to 200 metres [330-660 ft]. He said:
'The horses have to be kept separate until we are 100 per cent sure
that they are negative or until we are 100 per cent sure that they
are positive, in which case we have to euthanise them.'

Glanders expert Dr Ulrich Wernery has urged that strict rules be
adhered to rid Bahrain of the killer horse disease. He told
GulfWeekly: 'All positive horses should not have any contact with
other horses and there should only be one person responsible for
these horses. The groom cannot move from a suspected to a healthy
horse because he can spread the bacteria. However, it is not a highly
contagious disease. It does not spread through the wind like
foot-and-mouth disease. It spreads among horses through the infected
droplets or pus that comes out of the horse's nose. Only 2 or 3 per
cent have lesions on the skin although sharing the same trough of
food or water can cause the infection to spread. Sharing the bit or
brush that has come in contact with the pus can spread the infection
and the groom looking after the quarantined horses could even spread
the bacteria through his shoes.'

Dr Wernery also said that while the possibility of all equines
contracting the disease is high, the chances of glanders spreading
into the small mule and camel population in the kingdom were 'very
low'. Children could also continue riding on healthy horses, he
believes, provided the stables offering lessons were taking proper
quarantine measures and did not move horses from one stable to
another.

Dr Wernery added: 'The disease cannot spread to humans if there is no
pus coming out of the nose. The caretaker or owner has to be careful
especially with a horse that is showing any sign of glanders. He
should NOT touch the ulcers or clean the trough without protection.
Just because a horse is positive, it does not mean that the infection
will spread.'

CVRL is the only laboratory certified to test the illness in the
Middle East by the European Union and OIE. Recently, the laboratory
upgraded its facilities to enable a maximum of 400 tests a day and
has tested more than 2000 horses from Bahrain.

The vet said that if a horse had come in contact with the bacteria
then it would test positive within 3 weeks. At the same time it was
not necessary for the infected horse to show any clinical signs of
nasal discharge or skin lesions.

After extensive meetings with the authorities and veterinarians here
[in Bahrain], Dr Wernery said that a decision has been taken to put
down a horse if repeated serology tests showed positive results or
the horse showed clinical signs of the illness.

He said the rule number one was to immediately put down a horse if
the blood test was positive and the horse showed clinical signs of
the disease as there was no question of treatment.

The 2nd major rule was to conduct more than one blood test on a horse
that was tested positive but did NOT show any clinical signs. Dr
Wernery said: 'First of all we want to exclude an error of samples.
We do not want to kill healthy horses. We have to make sure we
clearly identify a positive horse. Everybody makes mistakes and there
could be a mix-up anywhere -- on the field or even in the laboratory.
If the 2nd test is also positive the horse has to be put down even if
it does not show any clinical signs. However, if the 2nd test is
negative we have to do another test but the horse will stay
quarantined. The horses have to test negative in a couple of weeks
but it is a very rare situation and it is only possible if there has
been a mistake. In the case of a serology test returning
inconclusive, a skin test will be taken that will clearly show
whether the horse is positive or negative.'

The vet also added that he was very impressed with the way the
Bahrain authorities have handled the outbreak to date as they had
been 'transparent' and were doing a good job with limited facilities
and a small number of staff. He said: 'We have seen in the last few
days that they are doing a good job and they are doing the right job.
They lack some facilities. For example, we opened up 3 horses in a
quarantine station on the ground. There was not a proper post mortem
area but this incident gave us the opportunity to highlight ways to
improve the situation. They need a proper necropsy hall and a proper
incinerator.

'The positive side of this is that it will improve the whole system.
It is very sad to put down a lot of horses but this teaches us a
lesson. The Bahraini authorities are also very open. There is a very
good transparency and that is amazing. We have a very good overview
of the situation. OIE is also very positive towards this country.'

The experts have also taken pictures of infected horses and
authorities are putting together a CD for distribution among stable
owners in Bahrain.
