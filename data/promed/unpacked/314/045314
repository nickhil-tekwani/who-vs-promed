The Guyana government is calling for a Caribbean approach to deal
with the deadly Black Sigatoka disease now affecting the plantain and
banana industry in the region. Agriculture Minister Robert Persaud
said the approach to dealing with the fungal disease would require
the support and cooperation of all, including researchers, regional
institutions and farmers. He has requested resources for a regional
response to the disease.

He said that there are reports of serious infestation in the Windward
Islands, especially in Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
while Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago are also dealing with the
disease. In Guyana, significant acreages of plantain and banana have
been affected by Black Sigatoka, and the Ministry of Agriculture has
informed farmers and other stakeholders of the measures being taken
to deal with the outbreak.

Bananas rank among the most valuable of agricultural export crops for
several countries in the region, including Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and
hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. BS
seriously affects plant vigour, and fruit can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment causing further losses. It is spread by
water, wind, and contaminated materials including suckers for
planting. Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitary
measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural practices.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS), which
is considered less damaging because it affects older leaves. For more
information on both sigatoka diseases, see links below.

BS (and also YS) has been causing serious crop losses in the
Caribbean and continues to spread there. The recent detection of BS
in St Lucia despite national quarantine measures (ProMED-mail post
20100204.0381) would support the view that a regional approach, as
suggested above, is likely to be the best control option, especially
since wind-borne spores may spread between neighbouring islands.
