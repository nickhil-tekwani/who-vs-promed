A 28-year-old man from Pretoria developed an influenza-like illness with abrupt onset on 25 May 2012. His symptoms included backache, fever and rigors. He was admitted to a private hospital in Pretoria 5 days later with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a non-productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain.

Together with 8 other persons, the index patient had gone on an expedition to the Sterkfontein cave complex on 11 May 2012 (exactly 2 weeks prior to the onset of his symptoms). The expedition group had accessed "Bat Cave" through the cavern roof via a fixed ladder.

They had crawled into areas of the cave that were not often explored and noticed fine, soft dirt on the cave floor that was easily aerosolised.

The group wore hard hats but no masks and stayed underground for approximately 5 hours. Four other members of the group also developed an acute influenza-like illness approximately 2 weeks after the expedition; one other person was admitted to the same private hospital with a diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia.

The 2 hospitalised patients were treated empirically for an acute community-acquired pneumonia, and the attending clinician elected to add intravenous liposomal amphotericin B once histoplasmosis was deemed a possible diagnosis.

The 3 other patients were treated with oral itraconazole as outpatients. Urine specimens from the hospitalised patients were submitted to the NICD-NHLS for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen testing; however, the investigational assays were negative for both patients. Sputum samples from both patients have not yielded growth of _H. capsulatum_. Despite the absence of laboratory-confirmation of _H. capsulatum_ in this cluster of cases, acute pulmonary histoplasmosis remains the most likely diagnosis given the common exposure history and compatible clinical features.

The 1st outbreak of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis (APH) in South Africa was described in the former Transvaal Province in 1953 among 3 cave-explorers; this was followed by the description of 2 more outbreaks.

Cases were also described among miners who had entered old, disused mine shafts in the then Transvaal Province in the 1960s.

Two outbreaks were described in the former Cape Province in 1963 (Cango caves) and 1979 (De Hoop caves), and another outbreak was described more recently in the 1990s. _H. capsulatum_ was also isolated from environmental samples and from white-tailed rats that had been exposed to aerosols from cave soil samples in the former Transvaal Province.

Several laboratory tests are currently available for the diagnosis of APH. Culture of _H. capsulatum_ from a sputum sample would definitively establish the diagnosis of APH but is only positive among 10-15 percent of immunocompetent patients. The organism may be detected in Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smears in up to 40 percent of patients with APH. A complement fixation test can also establish the diagnosis of APH retrospectively by detecting a 4-fold increase in antibody titres between acute and convalescent sera; however, this test is not available in South Africa. The precipitin assay to detect H and M bands is also not currently available. However, an investigational assay that detects polysaccharide antigen in urine has recently been introduced by the Mycology Reference Laboratory at NICD-NHLS (+27 11 555 0325); this test is still being validated and requires submission of a urine specimen that has been refrigerated after collection. The sensitivity of a well-validated urine antigen assay for diagnosis of APH is reported to be 20 percent.

The vast majority of patients with APH develop a mild, self-limiting illness; however, patients who have been exposed to a large fungal inoculum or are immunosuppressed may develop an acute symptomatic illness that may become progressively worse. Mild-to-moderate APH does not usually require treatment, but oral itraconazole for 6-12 weeks may be indicated for patients who have symptoms for over one month. Patients with moderately-severe or severe APH may require amphotericin B for 1-2 weeks followed by oral itraconazole for a total of 12 weeks (Wheat LJ, et al. Clin Infect Dis 2007).

Prevention:
Cave-explorers should be made aware of the risk of APH before entering caves where cases have occurred previously or where the risk is unknown. The use of N95 particulate respirators may also be considered to minimise exposure, especially among persons at risk for disseminated disease.

[Clinically diagnosed infection with the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a rare infection in immunocompetent people, and cases may easily be missed because of the mild and transient symptoms. _Histoplasma capsulatum_ is found worldwide in soil and especially soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. A very arid atmosphere in the cave may have contributed to the fungi being found in the dust in the air.
