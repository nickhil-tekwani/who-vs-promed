Indonesian health authorities will launch an immunisation drive next week [week of Sun 10 Dec 2017] to contain a sharp rise in cases of diphtheria, which has killed at least 32 people, including many children, in the world's 4th most populous country this year [2017].

The health ministry said at least 591 cases had been reported since January [2017], a 42 percent increase from last year [2016], and called the outbreak an "extraordinary event". The ministry recorded 415 cases and 24 deaths last year [2016].

Indonesia has among the world's highest rates of diphtheria - along with India and sub-Saharan African countries - even though vaccinations have helped minimise global cases over the past 30 years.

The World Health Organisation recorded about 7000 cases around the world last year [2016]. In 1980, the figure was 100 000.

None of those affected in Indonesia had been vaccinated against the disease. The rise in cases was attributed to several reasons, including some people rejecting vaccinations and a lack of access to healthcare, Subuh said. The Pediatric Society of Indonesia urged the public to participate in vaccination programmes. "Immunisation is the best protection," it said. Immunisations will be carried out in the capital, Jakarta, and 2 neighbouring provinces, which have reported the highest concentration of new cases. The campaign would be stepped up in other regions from January [2018].

A diphtheria outbreak in Jakarta has been getting worse, making it a health emergency, an official said. There have been 25 diphtheria cases in 2017, claiming 2 lives, Jakarta Health Agency head Koesmedi Priharto said on [Fri 8 Dec 2017]. The number was higher compared to 2016, in which there were 17 cases and one death.

Generally, a disease outbreak is classified as a health emergency when the infection and mortality rate increases by 2-fold. In response to the report, he said, the administration will hold a program called Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI) in 5 municipalities and one regency in the capital. "If a person in an area is suffering from diphtheria, all people in the area must take part in the ORI," Koesmedi explained, adding that the ORI, which is set to be held simultaneously on [Mon 11 Dec 2017], is a measure that is usually conducted in an area where a diphtheria patient is found.

He further said the ORI required 3 injections administered at certain intervals. The 1st and 2nd injections are given in the 1st and 2nd month, while the last one is given 6 months later. "The immunization is actually given to children at the age of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 2 years and 6 years. Then, it is continued with an immune booster," he explained. He then called on all Jakartans to willingly get the vaccine, which will be given for free.

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Many of the complications of diphtheria, such as myocarditis and polyneuropathy, are due to toxin production. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In Indonesia, DTP is given at 2,3,4 and 18 months with a booster 6 - 7 years of age.

DTP3 (the 1st 3 doses) coverage is estimated to have increased nationally in Indonesia from 27 percent in 1985 to between 81 to 85 percent between 2010 and 2015; in Java, where Jakarta is located, DTP3 coverage was said to be equal to or greater than 90 percent in 2015 (http://www.searo.who.int/immunization/data/indonesia.pdf). However, UNICEF reported only 64 percent DTP3 coverage nationally in Indonesia in 2012 (https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/indonesia_statistics.html).

The rise in DTP3 coverage in Indonesia was associated with a marked decline in cases of diphtheria nationally from over 3000 cases in 1980 to 189 cases in 2009; however, since then annual number of cases increased to between 430 to 1192 cases; although, only 252 cases were reported in 2015 (http://www.searo.who.int/immunization/data/indonesia.pdf). The above news reports say that there were 415 cases in 2016 and at least 591 cases so far in 2017, likely the result of poor immunization coverage, which would allow diphtheria to spread person-to-person in the community. None of the diphtheria cases in Indonesia were said to have been vaccinated against the disease.

The diphtheria vaccine coverage rate of 80-85 percent is thought to be necessary to stop transmission. Although vaccination rates may be this high in Indonesia as a whole, rates may be much lower in some communities. If an unvaccinated person gets diphtheria, they can easily pass it on to the other unvaccinated people around them, who then can then spread diphtheria quickly through the community with a low vaccine coverage rate (http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/april/2_Review_Diphtheria_results_April2017_final_clean.pdf).

Indonesia is located mainly in Southeast Asia, situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans; it is the world's largest island country, with an estimated population of over 261 million people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia). Its capital, Jakarta, which is the 2nd most populous city in the world, is located on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, with over half of the country's population. Indonesia has 34 provinces, that are subdivided into regencies and cities, which are further subdivided into districts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia#Administrative_divisions).
