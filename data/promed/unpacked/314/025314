Heroin-cocaine switch blamed for drug deaths
---------------------------------------------------------
Chris Nuttall-Smith Vancouver Sun
Coroners in Vancouver and Victoria suspect dealers selling heroin as
cocaine are behind a recent rash of drug-overdose deaths and officials are
warning users to be sure they know what they're taking.
Sherryl Yeager, Vancouver's deputy regional coroner, said she thinks two
people who died of overdoses in Vancouver this weekend thought they were
using cocaine, but were given heroin instead. Dianne Olson, regional
coroner in Victoria, said three women might have died there under the same
circumstances last weekend. "I suspect when I get my toxicology reports
back there's going to be heroin in the mix," Yeager said Tuesday, adding
the dealers are often to blame.
"They will sell anything: if you want cocaine and they have heroin, they
will sell it. White powder's white powder -- there is no difference so you
have no way of knowing," she said. Yeager said one of the overdose victims
had been snorting the substance and another was injecting. John Turvey, who
works with drug users in the Downtown Eastside, recommended that users
never fix alone, that they should test small amounts to be certain of what
they have, and that if someone overdoses thers should immediately call 911.
