Two women miscarried due to the bacteria causing listeriosis in Brno
in the past 2 weeks, and the disease was transmitted to the newly
born baby in another case, but the child survived, Mlada fronta Dnes
(MfD) writes today, 6 Jan 2007. Both women miscarried in the 20th
week of pregnancy, MfD writes.
It says that though it is not yet clear how the women got infected,
all 3 said they like maturing cheeses, in which the bacteria was
previously found at some places in the country.
In the 3rd case, doctors were alerted by turbid amniotic fluid and
immediately administered antibiotics to the baby and saved it without
any more serious consequences, LN writes.
Eight people, including a newborn baby died of listeriosis in the
Czech Republic in 2006. A total of 62 people were diagnosed with
listeriosis. This is 4 times more than in 2005, LN writes. The
increased incidence was caused by maturing cheeses and some kinds of salads.

[The following is an excellent primer from the USA FDA that overviews
the relationship of pregnancy and infection with _Listeria monocytogenes_
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~pregnant/whillist.html>:
"What is _Listeria monocytogenes_?
It's a harmful bacterium that can be found in refrigerated,
ready-to-eat foods (meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy (unpasteurized
milk and milk products or foods made with unpasteurized milk)) and in
soil. Animals can carry this bacterium without appearing ill, and
thus, it can be found in foods made from animals. _L. monocytogenes_
is unusual because it can grow at refrigerator temperatures where
most other foodborne bacteria do not. When eaten, it may cause
listeriosis, an illness to which pregnant women and their unborn
children are very susceptible.
"How could I get listeriosis?"
By eating ready-to-eat meats, poultry, seafood, and dairy products
that are contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_. You can also get
listeriosis by eating contaminated foods processed or packaged in
unsanitary conditions or by eating vegetables that are contaminated
from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.
"How could listeriosis affect me?"
The symptoms can take a few days or even weeks to appear and may
include fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea or upset stomach,
headache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. In more serious
cases, listeriosis could also lead to the mother's death.
Most of the time, pregnant women who are infected with listeriosis
don't feel sick. However, they can pass the infection to their unborn
babies without even knowing it. That's why prevention of listeriosis
is very important. In any case, if you experience any of the above
symptoms, see your doctor or health-care provider immediately.
Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely to get listeriosis than
other healthy adults, and an estimated 1/3rd of all listeria cases
occur in pregnant women.
"How could listeriosis affect my baby?"
During the 1st trimester of pregnancy, listeriosis may cause
miscarriage. As the pregnancy progresses to the 3rd trimester, the
mother is more at risk. Listeriosis can also lead to premature labor,
the delivery of a low-birth-weight infant, or infant death. Fetuses
who suffer a late infection may develop a wide range of health
problems, including mental retardation, paralysis, seizures,
blindness, or impairments of the brain, heart, or kidney. In
newborns, _L. monocytogenes_ can cause blood infections and meningitis.
"Listeriosis and Pregnant Hispanic Women"
Studies show that pregnant Hispanic women may have a higher incidence
of listeriosis than pregnant non-Hispanic women. This is most likely
because they might make and eat homemade soft cheese and other
traditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. "Queso fresco"-- a
traditional homemade cheese, prepared from unpasteurized milk and
widely consumed by Hispanics -- has led to miscarriages, death of
newborns, and premature delivery caused by _L. monocytogenes_.
To prevent the risk of listeriosis, Hispanic pregnant women should
not eat homemade soft cheeses and other traditional foods made from
unpasteurized milk. Like all other pregnant women, they should follow
the food safety precautions outlined below.
"How can I prevent listeriosis?"
The good news is that listeriosis can be prevented! Here's how:
- Your refrigerator should register at 40 F (4 C) or below and the
freezer at 0 F (-18 C). Place a refrigerator thermometer in the
refrigerator, and check the temperature periodically. During the
automatic defrost cycle, the temperature may register slightly higher
than 40 F. This is okay.
- Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared food, and leftovers
within 2 hours of eating or preparation. Follow the 2-Hour Rule:
Discard food that has been left out at room temperature for longer
than 2 hours. When temperatures are above 90 F (32 C), discard food
after one hour.
- Use ready-to-eat, perishable foods, such as dairy, meat, poultry,
seafood, and produce, as soon as possible.
Don't eat:
- Hot dogs and luncheon meats unless they're reheated until steaming hot.
- Soft cheeses like Feta, Brie, and Camembert, "blue-veined cheeses,"
or "queso blanco," "queso fresco," or Panela unless they're made with
pasteurized milk; Make sure the label says, "made with pasteurized milk"
- refrigerated pates or meat spreads
- refrigerated smoked seafood - unless it's in a cooked dish, such as
a casserole (Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout,
whitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel is most often labeled as
"nova-style," "lox," "kippered," "smoked," or "jerky." These types of
fish are found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters
of grocery stores and delicatessens.)
- Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk
It's okay to eat:
- Canned or shelf-stable (able to be stored unrefrigerated on the
shelf) pates and meat spreads.
- Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood.
- Pasteurized milk or foods that contain pasteurized milk."
