34-year-old Suresh (name changed) was diagnosed with dengue. Though he appeared to recover within 2 or 3 days, it soon relapsed. And doctors found that he had contracted a new severe strain of the disease.

Speaking to the Mirror, Suresh shared, "I had a fever, headache, and rash, along with muscle and joint pain. I visited the doctor and, after various tests, [my illness] was diagnosed as dengue. I was admitted to the hospital due to my low platelet count, but I started feeling better within 2 days. I was discharged after a day; the doctor said my immunity was good and that I would recover early."

He added, "Two days after I was discharged, I once again had a high temperature and severe muscle pain. I then came to Ruby Hall and was admitted in the ICU for 3 days. The doctors started treating me for the ailment, and after several tests, they informed me that I have dengue associated with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It took almost 7 days for me to recover."

As dengue continues to prey on citizens, cases of HLH dengue, a condition with an 80 percent mortality rate, are being reported. Suresh is one of 6 patients who have been admitted with this condition so far. Their fever came with or without multi-organ failure. Serological and radiological investigations were conducted to confirm HLH, and treatment was given with IV fluids, antipyretics, and analgesics.

Scientists from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and doctors at the critical-care medicine department of Ruby Hall Clinic are working on these cases, trying to find pre-disposing factors or genetic predispositions in patients diagnosed with this condition.

Symptoms of dengue include high fever and a drop in platelet count. Some patients also develop low white blood cell (WBC) count and a rise in liver enzymes, thereby affecting the functioning of the liver. Dengue with HLH is the 3rd in the severe strain of the disease, the other 2 being dengue shock syndrome [DSS] and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF).

HLH dengue has a high mortality rate similar to (and symptoms similar of) the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a complication seen in western countries and associated with blood malignancy and rheumatic disease. It is difficult to diagnose patients with this condition, as after mild symptoms of dengue fever, the patient actually recovers for a while but then relapses after 3 or 4 days. The fever then peaks, and other complications affect the vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and heart.

Elaborating on the research they are doing, Dr D T Maurya, director of NIV, said, "We are working towards asserting whether any specific dengue virus serotype is associated with dengue HLH. We are also planning to perform genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that have been shown to be associated with HLH."

The team includes Dr Prachi Sathe, head of the critical-care medicine department at Ruby Hall Clinic, Dr Prashant Sakhavalkar, Dr R Borse, Dr Arunkumar, and Dr Paresh Shah, scientist D, of the Dengue Research Group from NIV.

Dr Sathe shared, "We observed that there are patients with dengue fever developing multiple organ failure and life-threatening conditions. But, they have not contracted DSS or DHF. Typically, these patients come to us with dengue, and after 4 or 5 days, their condition appears to improve. Then, after 3 or 4 days, they develop complications with high fever, increased drowsiness, and lab reports showing significant drops in WBC and platelet counts."

Dr Sathe added, "During further tests, parameters such as ferritin and lactate dehyregine (LDH) are also affected, and patients are found with elevated liver enzymes. These indicate damage to the blood cells due to altered immune response in the patients. To put it simply, the body's immune system that is supposed to kill the virus gets directed to the patient's blood cells and starts killing those instead. The immune system affects vital organs such as liver, kidney, and heart. The fever also reaches the brain."

Dr Sakhavalkar added, "We found that mortality in dengue occurs not only due to DHF or DSS. Lab parameters and the clinical scenario made us think about HLH, common in rheumatoid arthritis, familial disorder, HIV, and EBV infections. We want to create awareness for early detection of HLH dengue. Dengue with or without multi-organ failure needs to be investigated for HLH as the mortality rate is very high. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential."

Identifying HLH dengue (lab criteria states at least 5 criteria should be fulfilled):
1. Fever
2. Splenomegaly (abnormal enlargement of spleen)
3 Cytopaenia (reduction in number of mature blood cells)
4. Hypertriglyceridaemia and/or hypofibrinogaenemia
5. Haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, cerebrospinal fluid, or lymph nodes
6. Decreased or absent natural killer (NK) cell activity
7. Affected ferritin (protein that acts as blood-clotting factor)
8. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (a diagnostic test done to rule out HLH)

[Dengue infections are important mosquito-borne viral infections in the world and represent one of the major emerging infectious diseases. It is estimated that 2.1 million cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) occur every year, resulting in nearly 21 000 deaths [1]. Infection with any of the 4 dengue virus types results in a wide spectrum of clinical features from asymptomatic disease, an undifferentiated febrile illness, dengue fever, DHF, and DSS. The occurrence of DHF/DSS is believed to be due to interplay between the virus, host genetics, and host immune factors. Cross-reactive memory T cells also contribute to immunopathology by altering the cytokine profiles during secondary dengue infections and are also believed to be less effective in eliminating the new virus serotype (1).

When compared to other febrile illnesses and influenza, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts have been shown to be significantly lower in dengue virus infections. Therefore, it appears that severe dengue is associated with prolonged viraemia, leucopaenia, and an inappropriate virus-specific immune response (2).

Dengue-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a serious condition and may prove fatal if not detected early and treated appropriately. Diagnosis of HLH is challenging and usually missed, as clinical and laboratory findings are nonspecific. Moreover, the pathophysiology of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and/or sepsis is remarkably similar to HLH. Secondary HLH following infection by the dengue virus is now being increasingly recognized as a cause of severe form of the disease. In dengue patients with persistent low counts and multi-organ dysfunction, the possibility of HLH should be kept in mind, particularly in 1st-episode dengue infections. The diagnosis can be quite challenging, as it can be easily mistaken with other clinical situations, such as sepsis or other systemic inflammatory response syndromes Elevated ferritin levels higher than 10 000 micrograms/L has been demonstrated to be 90 percent sensitive and 96 percent specific for HLH and can be used as a screening tool for early detection of HLH (3). - Mod.UBA
