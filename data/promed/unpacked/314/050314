Control of epidemic sleeping sickness in Africa - background.
----------------------------------------
Sleeping sickness (SS) and other major communicable diseases in the rural
areas of Africa have recently been brought into relief by the devastating
pandemic across Africa (1).
SS is basically a disease of rural Africa, reportedly producing over 300
000 new cases every year (2). The main epidemic reservoirs for both
_T.b. rhodesiense_ (acute) and _T.b. gambiense_ (chronic) are the early
haemo-lymphatic infections, since these produce minimal symptoms in cases
who remain ambulant, usually itinerant, and who seldom bother to seek
medical aid - especially when planting or harvesting crops. Treatment of
the early-stage infection is comparatively simple and a complete cure
almost 100 percent certain (3).
After some 4-6 weeks (with 'rhodesiense') or sometimes much longer (with
'gambiense'). the trypanosomes penetrate the central nervous system and
initiate the second-stage infection, the treatment for which a toxic and
dangerous arsenical drug, Melarsoprol (Arsobal), is needed. Sadly, rising
levels of resistance to Melarsoprol are reported from Angola, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and Uganda. The newer less toxic
drug Eflornithine is too expensive and in desperately short supply (2);
great hopes are now placed on a new orally administered drug (DB-289)
discovered by scientists at the University of North Carolina, USA and now
being tested in Angola (1).
For the permanent control of sleeping sickness epidemicity it is absolutely
vital that all new cases be diagnosed within the first month of infection -
for 2 very important reasons:
1. It is the early haemo-lymphatic infection in man (and possibly also in
his domestic livestock) that constitutes the reservoir which feeds
epidemicity; tsetse flies have no access to trypanosomes in the CSF.
2. Treatment of the early pre-CNS infection with Suramin sodium (i.e., test
dose of 0.25g plus a further 0.75g) clears trypanosomes from the blood and
lymphatics within 30 minutes and keeps them clear for approximately 3
months. Although virtually 100 percent successful in curing the early
infection, Suramin has little or no effect on trypanosomes in the CSF.
Regular fortnightly or monthly medical surveillance of those at risk, by
well-trained mobile public health staff, would give timely warning of any
abnormal build-up of cases and, by diagnosing and immediately treating all
positives with Suramin to clear parasites from the blood and lymphatics,
would rapidly deplete the human reservoir of infection.
This activity should be supplemented by community-mediated bush clearing,
under skilled supervision, to reduce man-tsetse contact in high
transmission areas. This alternative approach to bringing major epidemics
permanently under control has been recognised in Africa by MSF. Over the
past few years MSF has handed over its activities to local health staff,
but still ensures the drug supply and monitors evaluation and treatment (4).
The need to enable local health staff to link outlying village communities
to the main Primary Healthcare delivery system, by regular surveillance and
ad hoc 'outreach' clinics, has long been recognised but never fully
implemented, due to:
1. The lack of reliable transport to enable the RHC staff to reach distant
settlements.
2. The lack of suitable diagnostic equipment (especially a high-quality
microscope) that can be used perfectly well in the absence of both
generated electricity and access to vehicle battery power.
Although 4 X 4 vehicles and trail motorbikes are ideal for this purpose
their capital/running/servicing costs and the numbers needed preclude
their serious consideration for anything other than supervision and patient
transfers.
All those with fever, headache, and malaise should be encouraged to come
immediately for examination; SS awareness and control measures should also
be included in the schools' curriculum.

[This posting provides background information on the sleeping sickness
infection, treatment, and case detection. The logistic constraints of
health services in rural Africa are well known, and we need not again
stress the importance of proper surveillance and management for control. It
should be noted that success with tsetse fly control has been obtained with
traps made of dark blue cloth impregnated with insecticide. - Mod.EP
