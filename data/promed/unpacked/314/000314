After almost 20 years without detecting Aujeszky's disease, Rio Grande do Sul again registered the disease. The outbreak was identified in a subsistence pig farm, located in São Gabriel. Confirmation arrived last Friday, 23 Dec 2022, when the National Laboratory for Agricultural Defense, in Minas Gerais (LDDV-MG) found the disease in one of the 46 specimens in the herd.

After receiving the report, teams from the Department of Animal Health Surveillance and Defense (DDA) of SEAPDR [Secretaria da Agricultura, Pecuária e Desenvolvimento Rural; Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural Development] and the Federal Superintendence of Agriculture in Rio Grande do Sul (Mapa/RS) isolated the property and, last Monday [26 Dec 2022], performed the sacrifice of animal health (culling). Now, the work is focused on epidemiological tracking in properties which sent or received pigs from the property up to 30 days before the manifestation of clinical signs. They also carry out a task force to go through all the creations located within a radius of 5 km [3.1 mi] from the focus [index farm] to collect blood from other pigs.

"It is important to make it clear there is no question of the virus advancing. It was a case, in a piglet, in this property," explains the director of the DDA, Rosane Collares. The source of the outbreak has not yet been identified, but the SEAPDR published a normative instruction, yesterday [27 Dec 2022], suspending the transport of carcasses of wild boar slaughtered for population control purposes, coming from São Gabriel.

The president of the State of Rio Grande do Sul Animal Sanitary Development and Defense Fund (Fundesa), who was there on Tuesday [27 Dec 2022], explains the affected livestock is not economically active. "This has no impact on any production or exports in the sector. The only country with restrictions on the disease was Russia, which no longer buys pork from Rio Grande do Sul", he assesses.

Fundesa supports the collection and shipment of material for analysis, in addition to providing antigens for sample processing. Serology is carried out by the LDDV-MG [National Laboratory of Agriculture Defense - Minas Gerais] and by the Instituto de Pesquisas Veterinárias [Institute of Veterinary Research] Desidério Finamor (IPVDF), in Eldorado do Sul. "The technical teams in the field are very competent and do an exemplary job", declares Kerber.

The president of the Pig Breeders Association of Rio Grande do Sul (Acsurs), Valdecir Folador, recalls the region where the problem occurs is far from industrial production, which does not imply negative consequences for pig farmers. Mapa will inform the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) about the disease in its routine semi-annual reports, says the superintendent of Mapa/RS, Helena Rugeri.

Disease history
---------------
Aujeszky's disease occurred in Rio Grande do Sul in 2003. According to Kerber, the virus probably came from Santa Catarina, via pigs, people, or vehicles which were there. "We focused on Pinheirinho do Vale and Aratiba. On that occasion, there was very strong contamination with the sacrifice of more than 27 000 pigs", she says. In addition to domestic, wild, and wild pigs, the disease can affect cattle, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, and wild mammals. However, it is not a zoonosis, that is, without risk to human health. The main signs are tremors, vocalization, loss of movement of the hind legs, pressure (pressing) of the head against objects, and spots on the abdomen.

[Pseudorabies, Aujeszky's disease, and mad itch are all names for this disease. Although one of its names is pseudorabies, it has nothing to do with the rabies virus, rather the animals are so affected by the intense itching, their attempts to relieve it cause some observers to think they are seeing the madness of rabies. It can affect a variety of animals with slightly different consequences and certainly a loss of condition, and marketability.

"Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. PRV-infected feral swine represent a potential source of infection for domestic pigs in North America, and thus active surveillance and other preventive efforts are important to maintain PRV-free status.

"The USA commercial swine industry obtained pseudorabies-free status in 2004, which was important because of the economic value of domestic swine production; however, feral swine remain competent hosts and represent a constant threat for reintroducing the virus into the commercial industry. Serologic surveys encompassing 35 US states showed the prevalence of antibodies against PRV in feral swine was high (18%)." (With thanks to ProMED Mod.PMB)

Pseudorabies general information
--------------------------------
"Pseudorabies (Aujeszky's disease, mad itch) is caused by a neurotrophic α-herpesvirus. The virus can be latent or subclinical in adult swine and pigs are thought to be the source of infection in other animal species. After a pig bite, the virus enters the skin and travels to the brain or spinal cord by retrograde axonal transport. The incubation period is 90 to 156 days. Piglets show seizures, tremors, ataxia, and death. In other species, severe pruritus, dermal abrasions, swelling, and alopecia develop at the site of virus inoculation.

"Other signs include ataxia, paresis, circling, aggression, depression, and seizures.

"Diagnosis is based on viral isolation and histopathology. There is no effective treatment. Pseudorabies has been eradicated from domestic swine in the United States."

Pseudorabies, swine, ruminants
------------------------------
"Pseudorabies is caused by a herpes virus. Most often a mild disease to asymptomatic disease in swine, it is highly fatal in cattle. The clinical signs are to some extent similar to rabies and justify the name, pseudorabies.

Epidemiology
"Pseudorabies has a worldwide distribution. Infected pigs shed the virus in the nasal and pharyngeal secretions, and because of the proximity of the 2 species in some livestock operations, transmission of the virus from swine into ruminants may occur. Ruminants are susceptible to pseudorabies infection after intradermal, subcutaneous, intranasal, or oral exposure to the virus. Following infection, the incubation period is between 2 and 7 days. Horses and human beings are resistant to pseudorabies virus infection.

Clinical signs
"Because of the relatively short incubation period of the pseudorabies virus, ruminants may die suddenly without premonitory signs. In more slowly developing cases, intense pruritus that may be localized or generalized develops. Dermal abrasions, swelling, pruritus, and alopecia occur at the site of virus inoculation. Fever is often present. Other clinical signs reported are bloating, ataxia, aggression or depression, salivation, excessive chewing of the tongue, pharyngeal/laryngeal dysfunction, dyspnea, and seizures. Most affected animals die shortly (within 2 days) after the onset of clinical signs.

Diagnosis
"In ruminants, a tentative diagnosis is often based on clinical signs and history of possible contact with pigs. On postmortem, histologic examination reveals a nonsuppurative inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, with perivascular cuffing and focal necrosis. Virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Serologic testing is most often used in pigs, since ruminants die rapidly and may not have detectable antibodies. Regional diagnostic laboratory should be contacted before submitting a sample.

"Treatment and prevention
"There is no effective treatment, and prevention is targeted toward reducing the exposure of ruminants to swine."

Pseudorabies, other species
"Pseudorabies (Aujeszky's disease) is a notifiable disease caused by the alphaherpesvirus suid herpesvirus-1 (SuHV-1). Swine are the natural hosts for SuHV-1, but other domestic and wild mammals, including ruminants, dogs, cats, raccoons, rabbits, and rodents, are susceptible to infection and fatal encephalitis. The name pseudorabies was applied because the clinical signs caused by the virus in rabbits resemble those of rabies. SuHV-1 has been eradicated from domestic swine through use of vaccination programs in many countries, including Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and New Zealand. The virus continues to circulate among wild boar and feral swine, which act as a reservoir for the virus. Australia is also free of pseudorabies. Aujeszky's disease is a widespread problem in domestic swine herds in Asia, Latin America, and some parts of Europe.

"SuHV-1 is shed in the saliva and nasal discharges of swine, and transmission can occur by direct contact with these discharges or aerosols, or ingestion of infected swine carcasses or other infected animals, especially wildlife. The virus can survive on fomites and in carcasses for several weeks. In swine, clinical signs depend on the age at exposure and virus strain. Subclinical infections and shedding occur commonly. When older pigs do develop signs, they typically develop respiratory disease. Encephalitis occurs in piglets or in adult pigs that are infected with virulent strains. Reproductive disease and fetal loss can occur in pregnant sows. Recovered pigs develop latent infection of neuronal tissues with reactivation and shedding of virus in semen and nasal, oral, or vaginal secretions following stress.

"Disease in dogs is uncommonly reported. However, clusters of affected dogs have been described over the past decade, primarily in hunting dogs that contact wild swine from parts of Europe (France, Germany, Belgium) and the southern United States (Florida and Oklahoma). This has been followed by the global expansion of wild swine populations. Disease in dogs may be more likely to occur in regions that are densely populated with wild swine, such as the southern United States and parts of Europe such as Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Dogs that reside on swine farms may also become infected. In some reports, packs of dogs have been infected after consumption of uncooked offal from infected pigs or pig carcasses. Dogs of any age, sex, and breed can develop disease, but dog-to-dog transmission does not occur. Cats can be infected after ingestion of pork waste or infected rodents, but reports of naturally occurring Aujeszky's disease in cats are extremely rare. Because subclinical infections and nonspecific signs are common in swine, identification of pseudorabies in dogs may be the first indication that disease is present in a swine herd or wild swine population."
