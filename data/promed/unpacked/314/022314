[The following information has been provided by Lars Blad in response
to Mod.NP's comment (see: ProMED-mail post "Meningitis - Russia
(Khabarovsk)" 20060830.2471, dated 30 Aug 2006) that no etiology for
the meningitis outbreak in Khabarovsk was available, although
enterovirus infection is probably responsible.]
I am able to assist on this issue. On the official website of the
Russian Federation Federal Service for Surveillance in the Field of
Protection of Consumer Rights and Human Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor)
<http://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/>,
a news release (in Russian) was posted on 29 Aug 2006 entitled: "On
the epidemiological situation in the Khabarovsk territory," wherein
it is reported that 2 enteroviruses, ECHO-6 and ECHO-30, have been
isolated from meningitis patients:

[ProMED-mail welcomes the cooperation of Lars Blad in obtaining this
information. Historically, echoviruses 6, 9, 11, 19, and 30 have been
associated with outbreaks of aseptic (serous) meningitis, accompanied
by a rash in the case of echoviruses 6 and 9. Fortunately, recovery
is usually complete within a few weeks, with risk of neurological
complications only in the very young.
In the current ICTV classification of viruses, ECHO-6 and ECHO-30 are
designated Human echovirus 6 and Human echovirus 30 and ranked as
serologically distinct members of the virus species _Human
enterovirus B_. - Mod.CP]
