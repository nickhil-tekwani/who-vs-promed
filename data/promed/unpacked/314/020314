The whole district of Gokwe South has been put under quarantine with vaccination of all cattle in the interface area planned to commence week beginning 22 Jun 2015. All areas immediately outside the vaccinated zone have been placed under high surveillance.

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
