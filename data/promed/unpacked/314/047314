[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In the latest developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak, the health ministry reported 4 new cases, as details emerged about a suspected Ebola death that triggered a swift response in Uganda, where the man's samples tested negative for the virus.

The new cases signal continued activity in some of the outbreak's current main hot spots, and the close-call in Uganda shows how fear of cross-border spread has prompted intensive tracking of contacts.

New cases in 2 hot spots
-------------------------
The newly confirmed Ebola cases in the DRC include 2 patients in Katwa and 2 in Butembo. Also, health officials are still investigating 177 suspected illnesses. One more person died from Ebola, a patient who was being treated at Katwa's Ebola treatment center.

The new cases lift the outbreak total to 823 cases, which includes 762 confirmed and 61 probable cases. So far, 517 deaths have been reported.

In the VSV-EBOV immunization campaign, 79 464 people have been vaccinated since 8 Aug 2018, more than half of them in Beni, Katwa, and Butembo.

Ebola scare in Uganda
--------------------
A family's transport of a Ugandan man who died on 8 Feb 2019 in the DRC's outbreak region across the border and back into Uganda sparked intensive contact tracing, location of the body, and sample testing, according to a statement yesterday [12 Feb 2019] from the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office.

The 46-year-old man was a construction worker who had been living and working the DRC for the past 8 years. He was admitted to the hospital in Bunia, one of the towns in Ituri province that has reported Ebola cases, in November 2018 with symptoms that included chest pain and a sometimes-bloody cough.

Over the following week his condition worsened, and he died at Bunia Hospital, where staff issued a death certificate and released his body to relatives, which included a group of 13 people from Tororo in Uganda. The group used the death certificate to cross the border and other checkpoints with the body. According to the statement, the death certificate said the man's cause of death was cardiac failure and pulmonary tuberculosis.

After learning of the incident, Uganda's health ministry -- with support from the WHO -- intercepted the man's relatives and the vehicle with the dead body in it before they reached their village in Tororo district. A ministry burial team and surveillance officer took oral swabs, conducted a verbal autopsy, and made plans to conduct a safe and dignified burial.

Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam, MD, the WHO's Uganda representative, said in the statement, "The immediate reporting by UMA and quick action by health workers as exhibited last night in this particular incident is what determines how quickly we respond and contain Ebola. I urge other Ugandans to take this as an excellent example as we prepare for a possible importation of EVD cases."

Uganda's health ministry said on Twitter that its teams conducted a dignified burial of the man in Tororo and that all people who were in close contact with the body have been quarantined. It added that samples taken from the dead man were sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute, where they tested negative for Ebola. It emphasized that there are no confirmed Ebola cases from Uganda.

As part of preparedness efforts for possible spread of the virus across the border, Uganda has been vaccinating healthcare and front-line workers in high-risk districts since 7 Nov 2018. So far, 3587 have been immunized, the health ministry said.

- Thu 14 Feb 2019. Rapid risk assessment: Ebola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, DRC -- 3rd update
[ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), abridged, edited]
https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/risk-assessment-ebola-virus-outbreak-north-kivu-and-ituri-third-update

This is the 3rd update of the rapid risk assessment published on the 9 Aug 2018. It addresses the public health risk associated with the current Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its implications for EU/EEA citizens. This update was triggered by the persistence of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in urban settings, the continuous increase in the number of reported cases during the past 4 weeks, the persistent occurrence of new cases among contacts unknown at the time of EVD diagnostics, and current challenges for the prevention and control of EVD.

Executive summary
--------------------
As of 6 Feb 2019, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 791 Ebola virus disease cases, including 737 confirmed and 54 probable cases. A total of 492 deaths occurred during the reporting period, consisting of an overall case fatality rate of 62%.

As of 29 Jan 2019, 65 healthcare workers have been reported among the confirmed cases.

While the majority of the cases have been reported in urban settings, some have also been reported in rural health zones surrounding urban centres. This suggests that transmission is also ongoing in rural areas. The weekly number of cases has increased to approximately 40 for 3 consecutive weeks, indicating that the viral circulation in the community is persistent.

Persistence of Ebola virus circulation
----------------------------------------
Despite the impressive mobilisation of response actors, significant challenges remain in this complex setting marked by a long-term humanitarian crisis and an unstable security context. According to WHO, the persistence of Ebola virus circulation in the community is driven by the suboptimal infection prevention and control practices in primary healthcare, incomplete contact tracing and follow-up, delays in detection and isolation of new cases, and community deaths leading to potential exposure of relatives to EVD.

Efforts are ongoing to strengthen community-led efforts to support key EVD prevention and control interventions. Outbreak response activities continue in order to offer high quality case management, perform ring vaccination campaigns, provide the community with safe and dignified burials, and ensure Points of Entry screening.

New EVD cases are expected to be reported in the coming weeks. A geographical extension is still possible, given the prolonged humanitarian crisis in the region, the important crossborder population flows to and from neighbouring provinces and countries, and the observed adverse impact of security incidents and community reticence that is hindering the implementation of EVD prevention and control measures.

Risk to the EU
--------------
The probability that EU/EEA citizens living or travelling in EVD-affected areas of DRC will be exposed to the virus is low, provided they adhere to precautionary measures. There are no international airports in the affected areas with direct flights to the EU/EEA Member States, which limits the risk of the virus being introduced into these countries. The overall risk of introduction and further spread of Ebola virus within the EU/EEA remains very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at local level.

[The ECDC raises the issue of suboptimal infection prevention and control practices in primary healthcare settings. This suggests training needs to be increased so spread of virus does not occur during healthcare. Such incidences will only add support to the community afraid to present to clinics, and further exacerbation of the outbreak. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 14 Feb 2019. Ebola DRC Disease outbreak news: update
[WHO, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-february-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Despite slightly fewer cases reported during the past week (see Fig. 1 at source URL), current epidemiological indicators highlight that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed regions. During the past 21 days (23 Jan to 12 Feb 2019), 97 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (see Fig. 2 at the source URL), including Katwa (59), Butembo (12), Beni (7), Kyondo (4), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (1), Manguredjipa (1), Mabalako (1), Masereka (1), and Mutwanga (1).* The recent case reported in the Komanda health zone was a resident of Katwa who was exposed to the virus and subsequently travelled to both Bunia and Komanda. This case comes 1 month after the last reported case in Ituri Province, underscoring the high risks of reintroduction to previously affected areas, as well as the potential for spread to new ones.

As of 12 Feb 2019, 823 EVD cases** (762 confirmed and 61 probable) have been reported, including 517 deaths (overall case fatality ratio, 63%). Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 118 of 287 health areas across 18 health zones [now 19], of which 37 health areas have reported a case in the past 21 days. Thus far, 283 people have been discharged from Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. One new health worker infection was reported in Katwa. To date, a total of 68 health workers have been infected.

WHO remains confident that this outbreak can be successfully brought to an end through strategies outlined in SRP 3. To achieve the goals set out by the plan, the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are appealing for USD 148 million. WHO and partners count on the continued support of the international community to provide the required funding in order to stop this outbreak.

*Excludes newly probable cases from Katwa (7) and Komanda (5), who died in November and December 2018 and were reported during the period of 21 January to 10 February [2019] following a retrospective reclassification of cases.
**Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning -- trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Fig. 1 (at the source URL) shows confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 12 Feb 2019 (n = 822). Fig. 2 (also at the source URL) shows confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases reported between 22 Jan and 11 Feb 2019 by place of residence, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (n = 101).

Public health response, WHO risk assessment, and WHO advice are discussed further in the full report (see source URL).

As this #Ebola outbreak drags on, the costs of containing it continue to rise. Today @WHO revealed that it and partners in the response need USD 148M to fund the response through July.

WHO is asking the international community to help support this effort. It is not clear whether countries will be able to come up with this level of funding, and what the consequences are if not. - Mod.LK]

[3] South Sudan, Western Equatoria: vaccine RFI
- Wed 13 Feb 2019. South Sudan: adverse effects
[Eye Radio, abridged, edited]
https://www.nyamile.com/2019/02/13/western-equatoria-ebola-vaccination-backfires-as-health-workers-hospitalized/

An Ebola vaccination has backfired in Western Equatoria's Gbudue state after health workers who were vaccinated last month [January 2019] were hospitalized after experiencing side effects. Eye Radio reported that several health workers who have been hospitalized in the state hospital said they were initially told that the side effects could end in a very short time but have now stayed for days.

"They told us that there was a [side] effect and it will not last longer. But up to now, it's still ongoing and I don't know what the problem is," one of the health workers was quoted as saying by Eye Radio.

The vaccine that protects against the Zaire strain of the virus, which is on the rise in the neighboring DRC, was given to the health workers last month [January 2019] by South Sudan's Ministry of Health in cooperation with health partners. South Sudan government received 2160 doses of the Ebola vaccine from Merck, the vaccine developer.

"I started [with a] headache, I was feeling like [I needed] to vomit, [which was followed by abdominal pain]. I was also feeling [too] cold and I could cover myself with 2 to 3 blankets," one other hospitalized health worker said.

For his part, Gbudue State acting Minister of Health Gibson Bullen assured them saying they should have peace of mind since the providers of the vaccination are here. "They should not worry much because the vaccinators and the WHO, which is administering the vaccines, are on the ground," he said.

[This is the 1st and only published report I can find of serious adverse effects from the Merck Ebola vaccine in use in the DRC. It is unknown whether other serious side effects have occurred but not been reported. This situation does not bode well for alleviating fears around the vaccine, but rather will exacerbate the suspicion communities already have. If anyone has more information on this report, it would be welcome. - Mod.LK]

[Medical Express, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-viral-decoyshow-ebola-virus-immune.html

Citation: Nehls J, Businger R, Hoffmann M, et al. Release of immunomodulatory Ebola virus glycoprotein-containing microvesicles is suppressed by tetherin in a species-specific manner. Cell Reports 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.065

A research team from Tubingen and Gottingen has described in the renowned journal Cell Reports a new mechanism how the Ebola virus escapes the immune system. The virus causes infected cells to release decoys that inactivate neutralizing antibodies and prevent immune cells from releasing important messenger molecules. These findings could lead to the development of new vaccines against hemorrhagic fever viruses.

As reported by the team led by the Tubingen virologist Professor Michael Schindler, the glycoprotein of the Ebola virus causes cells to release small vesicles bearing the Ebola virus glycoprotein on their surface. These so-called virosomes bind antibodies directed against the Ebola virus glycoprotein and could thereby interfere with control of viral infection by the antibody response. In addition, the virosomes suppress the release of cytokines and chemokines by macrophages. Macrophages are scavenger cells that release messenger molecules and thereby coordinate the immune responses against invading viruses.

Why do most patients mount an immune response against Ebola virus despite the release of virosomes? Again, the virologists have an explanation: "The immune system has developed countermeasures against virosomes," explains Schindler. "We were able to show that another cellular protein, which plays an important role in innate immune defense, can prevent the release of virosomes."

The newly discovered properties of virosomes are of importance for basic research. In addition, they have implications for therapy and prevention. "The virosomes apparently carry functionally intact Ebola glycoprotein on their surface, but are otherwise not infectious," explains Professor Stefan Poh-lmann, co-author of the study and head of the Infection Biology Unit at the German Primate Center in Gottingen. "This makes virosomes attractive candidates for vaccine development."

The researchers now want to investigate whether other hemorrhagic fever viruses also release virosomes and whether they can be used for the production of vaccines.
