Bacterial pneumonia that killed dozens of bighorn sheep in the western North Dakota Badlands during 2014 has resurfaced this summer [2015], sparking fears it will become an even bigger problem in the region.

The re-emergence of the illness has state wildlife officials reconsidering how to issue bighorn hunting licenses.

The Game and Fish Department called off the 2014 fall hunting season for the 1st time in more than 3 decades after pneumonia killed about 3 dozen sheep. The bighorn population managed by the state is not large -- an August 2014 survey counted about 300 animals -- and many that became sick and died in 2014 were mature rams, which hunters seek.

Hunters can only receive 1 sheep license in their lifetime, even if they fail to bag a ram during that single season. At least 10 000 hunters apply each year for the handful of licenses selected annually in a lottery.

"We do not want to give someone a once-in-a-lifetime license and then have them say, 'There's no sheep out there,'" state Wildlife Chief Jeb Williams said.

State officials decide in February whether there will be a fall hunt, then hold the license lottery. The wildlife agency is now considering waiting until after its summer population survey, "so we're not issuing once-in-a-lifetime licenses and then finding out disease is cranking up again," Williams said.

Officials are not sure why pneumonia has surfaced the past 2 summers. Contact between bighorns and domestic sheep is a possibility. The illness also occurred after the transplant of bighorns from the Canadian province of Alberta, though Williams said the bacteria have never been in the Alberta population and have not occurred in herds of transplanted sheep in other states.

The Badlands herds hit by pneumonia during the summer of 2015 are the same 3 herds that were affected in 2014, according to Game and Fish big game biologist Brett Wiedmann.

"Many adults and lambs showing signs of disease in August likely will not survive the winter," he said.

It is too early to tell the severity of the outbreak, according to Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Dan Grove.

"The recurrence of pneumonia this summer may be more apparent when females and lambs are recounted next March," he said.

The Midwest Chapter of the Wild Sheep Foundation has pledged USD 20 000 to help monitor the herds. The foundation typically auctions a bighorn hunting license each year to raise money for sheep management.

There are about 10 bighorn herds in the Badlands area where pneumonia is present, and Game and Fish will be monitoring whether the illness spreads to those that have not yet been affected. Removing the diseased herds is not being considered because the herds are considered a single population unit.

"We would have to start completely from scratch, and that's not an option," Williams said.

[There are many factors, including the possibility of an environmental factor, that affect the Bighorn Sheep. However, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, seems to have been introduced by domestic ovids.

_Pasteurella_ bacteria are most frequently isolated from pneumonic bighorn lungs. Gross and microscopic lesions resemble 'shipping fever' (a complex of bacteria) and other _Pasteurella_ syndromes of domestic ruminants. Fatal pneumonia is convincingly reproduced by experimental challenge with _Pasteurella_ sp., especially _Mannheimia haemolytica_ But, diverse species and strains of _Pasteurella_ are isolated, even within single pneumonia outbreaks. And healthy bighorns in non-pneumonic populations usually carry diverse _Pasteurella_, often similar to those isolated from the lungs of pneumonic bighorns.

A 2006 study of lungs from affected bighorn lambs yielded 5 different bacteria, including _Mycobacteria _sp.

However a 2010 study produced results that do not necessarily line up with the 2006 study, but then we would hope we have learned more by 2010.

"_Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ has been isolated from the lungs of pneumonic bighorn sheep (BHS). However experimental reproduction of fatal pneumonia in BHS with _M. ovipneumoniae_ was not successful. Therefore the specific role, if any, of _M. ovipneumoniae_ in BHS pneumonia is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether _M. ovipneumoniae_ alone causes fatal pneumonia in BHS, or predisposes them to infection by _Mannheimia haemolytica_. We chose _M. haemolytica_ for this study because of its isolation from pneumonic BHS, and its consistent ability to cause fatal pneumonia under experimental conditions. Since in vitro culture could attenuate virulence of M. ovipneumoniae, we used ceftiofur-treated lung homogenates from pneumonic BHS lambs or nasopharyngeal washings from _M. ovipneumoniae_-positive domestic sheep (DS) as the source of _M. ovipneumoniae_. 2 adult BHS were inoculated intranasally with lung homogenates while 2 others received nasopharyngeal washings from DS. All BHS developed clinical signs of respiratory infection, but only 1 BHS died. The dead BHS had carried leukotoxin-positive _M. haemolytica_ in the nasopharynx before the onset of this study. It is likely that _M. ovipneumoniae_ colonization predisposed this BHS to fatal infection with the _M. haemolytica_ already present in this animal. The remaining 3 BHS developed pneumonia and died 1-5 days following intranasal inoculation with _M. haemolytica_. On necropsy, lungs of all 4 BHS showed lesions characteristic of bronchopneumonia. _M. haemolytica_ and _M. ovipneumoniae_ were isolated from the lungs. These results suggest that _M. ovipneumoniae_ alone may not cause fatal pneumonia in BHS, but can predispose them to fatal pneumonia due to _M. haemolytica_ infection."

So if we continue to fast forward in time to 2014, we learn more data about BHS.

"Bronchopneumonia is a population-limiting disease of bighorn sheep (_Ovis canadensis_). The cause of this disease has been a subject of debate. Leukotoxin-expressing _Mannheimia haemolytica_ and _Bibersteinia trehalosi_ produce acute pneumonia after experimental challenge but are infrequently isolated from animals in natural outbreaks. _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, epidemiologically implicated in naturally occurring outbreaks, has received little experimental evaluation as a primary agent of bighorn sheep pneumonia.

Exposure to a single _M. ovipneumoniae_-infected animal resulted in transmission of infection to all bighorn sheep both within the pen and in adjacent pens, and all infected sheep developed bronchopneumonia. The epidemiologic, pathologic and microbiologic findings in these experimental animals resembled those seen in naturally occurring pneumonia outbreaks in free-ranging bighorn sheep."

So while this may not be last word on the malady affecting the BHS, for now it seems the most likely etiological agent.
