Deadly black mold causes evacuation of Texas families
------------------------------------
A potentially fatal black mold has forced at least 19 families in usually
dry West Texas to evacuate their homes and move into hotel rooms. The
mold's potential health effects range from cold- and allergic-type symptoms
to skin rashes, inflammation of the respiratory tract, bloody noses, fever,
headaches, malaise, neurological problems, and suppression of the immune
system.
A particularly rainy year has caused stachybotrys outbreaks in some of the
southern United States. Stachybotrys mold is not rare, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, but CDC has no
accurate information on how often it is found in homes and other buildings.
Molds of any type, including stachybotrys, simply need moisture and
something such as wood or paper to grow on, said Dr David Straus, a
microbiologist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and an
expert on indoor air pollution caused by molds. Stachybotrys cases are not
increasing, he said, but local media reports have heightened awareness of
the problem. Above normal rainfall in many parts of West Texas in recent
months, on top of heavy snowfall last winter, could have raised the
region's water table, Straus said.
To rid a home of the mold, the source of the moisture first must be
eliminated. Then the mold must be removed using a bleach-like solution, and
all the damaged materials -- sometimes including walls, ceilings, and
carpets -- must be torn out and replaced.

[Stachybotrys is a very serious health threat. Most often this mold is
associated with wet areas, such as homes after flooding. It has been found
on hay, which if fed to animals has caused death of the animals. - Mod.TG
