Mystery disease: Brazil's livestock authorities order the slaughter of 17
000 chickens as a mystery disease infects flocks
-----------------------------------------------
A mysterious respiratory illness killed 6000 chickens in Brazil, and the
authorities have ordered the slaughter of another 17 000 birds.
Reports from the Associated Press say that the authorities are uncertain as
to what the disease is, and the Brazilian agriculture department is
tight-lipped over questions. However, the director of the Department of
Animal Health at the Agriculture Ministry, Jorge Caetano Jr., said the
laboratory had already dismissed avian influenza and insisted that the
Ministry had taken every measure to ensure the disease is contained.
The agriculture authorities sealed off the area around the source of the
disease on a farm near the town of Jaraguari in the state of Mato Grosso do
Sul, and 100 farms have been reported to have been placed under quarantine.
The cause of the chicken deaths will be revealed next Tuesday [7 Jun 2005],
according to the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture.

[Deducing from the scarce information which has so far become available,
the mortality in this outbreak has been 26 percent (6000 out of 23 000
chickens). The age of the affected birds, PM findings and their vaccination
history against Newcastle disease (NCD) and Avian infectious
laryngotracheitis (ILT) is not known.
According to the cited statement of Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture,
results of investigations are expected on 7 Jun 2005, about 10 days after
the estimated (not published) date of the outbreak. Such a timetable might
indicate, among other things, that embryonating-eggs inoculation trials
have been implemented. This procedure, which will normally take 4-7 days,
is instrumental for the final diagnosis of both avian influenza and NCD. In
case avian influenza is involved, the strain's virulence is determined by a
prescribed method that includes the inoculation of susceptible chickens and
monitoring their mortality, a procedure which takes 10 days.
Until the completion of the ongoing investigations, the said diseases,
namely avian influenza, NCD and ILT, cannot be ruled out. - Mod.AS]
