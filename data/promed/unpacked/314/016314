[Epizootic ulcerative syndrome, or 'red spot disease' is quite a serious ulcerative disease of many (more than 100) species of freshwater and estuarine fish. The causative agent of red spot disease is a fungus, _Aphanomyces invadans_. The overall impact of red spot disease on wild stocks of fish is uncertain, although high losses in juvenile stocks are known to occur. The fungus is not known to cause disease in humans. However, advanced lesions in fish sometimes contain bacteria which potentially cause disease in humans. Therefore, people should not eat diseased fish. - Mod.PMB
