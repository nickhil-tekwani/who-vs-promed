A deadly and disruptive bee infection has been discovered in Krakow bees, worrying local beekeepers and ecologists.

American foulbrood is a bacterial disease that infects and kills young bee larvae, which can be devastating for the hive. Spores can survive in nectar and honey for as long as 40 years, making it difficult to contain the spread of the illness. Beekeepers usually burn the entire affected hive as a precaution. It is important that they not buy food from untrusted sources or move infected bees/materials from the area.

Infected hives have been found in Krakow on ul. Wroclawskiej and al. 29 Listopada. The Lesser Poland government has posted warning signs in a perimeter around the affected areas warning beekeepers of the danger in an effort to stop the spread.

The disease is not dangerous to humans.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.- Mod.PMB
