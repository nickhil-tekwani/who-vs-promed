The number of hand-foot-and-mouth diseases in Bangkok has risen to over 6000 from January to July [2016], a senior Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said Mon [1 Aug 2016].

Duangporn Pinjisekhikul, the director of the Health Department's Communicable Disease Control Division, said the number of the cases this year [2016] doubled from that of the same period last year [2015]. She said the cases increased apparently because of frequent rain recently, prompting the virus that caused the disease to stay longer in the environment.

So far, over 110 schools in Bangkok had been closed partially or entirely for several days after the virus spread there. Duangporn added that 85 per cent of the cases are 4-year-old children and younger.

[In Thailand, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is usually caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16. During a large outbreak in 2012, it was determined from patient specimens that Coxsackievirus A6 was the causative agent. However, the virus(es) included in the case number in this report are not stated, and may include a combination of Picornaviridae: _Enterovirus_ species.

An earlier report in July reported the Minister of Public Health, Dr Piyaskol Skolsattayathorn, as stating there were more than 20 000 HFMD patients in 77 provinces from 1 January to June this year [2016] with a death toll of 1. Most of the patients were in the northern region, followed by the central, northern and southern regions respectively, See previous ProMED Thailand post for more information on HFMD in Thailand (Hand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand: alert 20160705.4326755).
