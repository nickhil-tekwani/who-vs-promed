Napa County Public Health is investigating an outbreak of legionnaires' disease cases in Napa County [California, USA]. [It] is aware of 9 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease, 2 suspected cases, and 1 probable case for a total of 12 cases. All individuals have been hospitalized, and no fatalities have been reported at this time.

The cases were reported to Napa County Public Health between 11 and 27 Jul 2022. The cases reside in the City of Napa and in Calistoga. Napa County Public Health is working with the California Department of Public Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Napa County Environmental Health Branch of the Planning Building and Environmental Services Department (PBES-EH) to investigate and mitigate the outbreak.

"This is a continuing investigation," said Dr Karen Relucio, public health officer and deputy director of health and human services. "As part of the investigation, PBES-EH is conducting environmental investigations to identify possible sources of exposures to the bacteria, conducting environmental sampling for legionella, and recommending environmental remediation strategies to prevent further transmission of legionella."

Out of an abundance of caution, public health recommends that individuals who live in Napa County who become ill with pneumonia-like/respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache visit their healthcare provider. As it can take up to 2 weeks for symptoms to develop, Napa County Public Health recommends that those who develop symptoms within 2 weeks of being in Napa County also seek medical attention. Napa County Public Health has alerted healthcare providers in the area. Legionnaires' disease is treatable with antibiotics.

The risk of legionnaires' disease among residents or recent visitors to Napa County is low. Most healthy people exposed to legionella do not develop legionnaires' disease. People over the age of 50, especially those who smoke cigarettes, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease, or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for legionnaires' disease.

Napa County Public Health receives approximately 1 to 2 reports of legionnaires' disease each year. Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by bacteria called legionella. People can get legionnaires' disease by breathing in aerosolized (small droplets) water containing legionella bacteria. Aerosolized water can come from cooling towers (air-conditioning units for large buildings), hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains, and plumbing systems. Less commonly, people can get sick by aspiration of tap water containing legionella. This happens when water accidentally goes into the lungs while drinking ("goes down the wrong pipe"). People at increased risk of aspiration include those with swallowing difficulties. Home air conditioning units do not use water to cool, so these home units do not aerosolize water and are not a risk for legionella growth. Legionnaires' disease is not spread from person to person.

[Napa County (population 138 019 residents in 2020) is north of San Pablo Bay, the northern extension of San Francisco Bay; its county seat is the city of Napa (pop 77 480 residents in 2021), about 50 miles [38 km] north of the city of San Francisco. Napa County is known for its regional wine industry and is a major tourist destination in California. Calistoga (pop 5 228 residents in 2020) is a city about 30 miles [19 km] north of the city of Napa, along Route 29 which is lined by wineries, wine tasting rooms, restaurants, and hotels. A map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Calistoga,+California+94515/Napa,+California.

The news article above reports that a cluster of 12 cases of legionnaires' disease, 9 of which have been confirmed, were reported between 11 and 27 Jul 2022 in residents of the cities of Napa and Calistoga. We are not told of any epidemiologic factors linking these cases, other than their residence in Napa County. No cases were reported in tourists.

We will await the results of genotyping clinical isolates. Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates, if available, and environmental isolates of legionella will identify the environmental source responsible for the individual cases.

More information from knowledgeable sources on this cluster of legionnaires' disease cases in Napa County, California would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
