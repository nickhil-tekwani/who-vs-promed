Jampui Hills orange production badly affected
---------------------------------------------
Jampui Hills, popularly known as the orange producing valley, has witnessed
a drastic reduction in orange production following the spread of a peculiar
disease, which scientists describe as dieback. Jampui Hills is in the
tri-junction of northeast India along Tripura-Mizoram and Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh.

In Jampui Hills, the orange production has gone down by more than 50 per
cent. At present, only 3 of the 10 hills have orange production. The
economy of the region, which is dependent on oranges, has been badly
affected, as trees in most of the orchards that are more than half a
century old have been wiped out following the spread of dieback disease.

Meanwhile, the state government had sought help from the National Research
Centre for Citrus (NRCC), Nagpur. Dr Shibnarayan Sen, director for
Agriculture, Horticulture and Soil Conservation said, "We have taken lots
of initiative to rejuvenate the orange production in Jampui Hills but there
is a basic problem that the plants are very old and new trees that have
been planted give production only after 5 years. Due to lack of water, it
is difficult to spray the medicine (sulphur). The department is making
arrangements for water tanks."

[In India, the term dieback is used for several different diseases of
citrus, including greening (bacterial), tristeza (viral), nematode
infections, and multifactorial disease complexes, which may also include
viroids, fungi, and environmental factors. It is not clear which specific
problem is reported here. Sulphur 'medicine' as mentioned in this story is
effective against fungi and some pests but cannot be expected to control
bacterial, viral, viroid, or nematode pathogens.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed
to the general decline of citrus health in the region. The risk of
accumulating parasitic pathogens over time increases with the age of trees,
and the orchards mentioned above are very old. Disease management for most
citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of inoculum.
Replanting programmes, which are also being undertaken elsewhere in India
(ProMED-mail post no. 20080130.0375) will only be of long term benefit if
linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent
re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for
propagating material.
