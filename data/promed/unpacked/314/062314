Fear of bird flu in Binyamina after 18 chickens found dead
----------------------------------------------------------
18 out of 25 chickens [for checked, correct figures see the
commentary. - Mod. AS] were found dead in the northern town of
Binyamina on Thursday [3 Jan2008], in what veterinarians suspect might
have been caused by the bird flu.
Veterinary services put the rest of the poultry to death, and ran
epidemiology tests in the Beit Dagan veterinary institute.
Laboratory findings have so far located the existence of one [H5] of
the 2 proteins that are identified with the virus. Final results are
to be received later on Thursday [3 Jan 2008], and will indicate
whether the 2nd protein [N1] is also found in the chickens. [It was --
see comment at end].
Meanwhile, a closure had been declared surrounding the area, and the
transference of poultry [out of it] in any direction is forbidden.

[An immediate notification on the initial H5 finding has been sent to
the OIE on Thu, 3 Jan 2008, morning by the Veterinary Services in the
Ministry of Agriculture; it was copied to Israel's Ministry of Health.
The identification was carried out late evening, Wednesday 2 Jan 2008,
in the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit Dagan. The laboratory
investigation was completed Thursday afternoon, when N1 was identified.
The outbreak took place in a kindergarten facility in the
central-Israeli township of Benyamina (see map at URL at end). In the
backyard of the one-storey building, there is a 4X5 m [area], enclosed
within a mesh, where 12 chickens, 8 ducks and 6 pigeons were kept as
pets. Ten of the chickens and one duck died, found infected by HPAI
H5N1; all the remaining birds, namely 7 ducks, 2 chickens and 6
pigeons have been destroyed. A protective zone of 3 km and
surveillance zone of 10 km have been applied. Epidemiological
investigation is being carried out; the mesh, while keeping the birds
enclosed, does not prevent their possible exposure to droppings of
wild birds and to birds which land on the cage or come close to it.
Israel's previous outbreak of HPAI H5N1 occurred in March 2007 [not
reported on ProMED-mail. - Mod.JW]. It affected mainly farms adjacent
to the Gaza strip; there was also one single outbreak in the Jordan
Valley. Mass destruction was applied, to be analysed later. During the
same period, an FMD outbreak was detected on the other side of the
Jordan river, namely the Kingdom of Jordan. Israel has culled more
than 1.2 million turkeys and chickens after detecting the H5N1 virus.
There have been no human cases.
HPAI H5N1 has been recorded as widely spread in Egypt and Saudi
Arabia; it was just a question of time before the virus was identified
in other regional countries. Israel has established intensive
surveillance to detect H5N1 as early after its introduction (by
migrating birds?) as possible. - Mod. AS].
