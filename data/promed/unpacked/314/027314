The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says 701 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in the country in the 1st 2 months of 2022. According to the agency's recent cholera situation report, the cases were recorded in 12 states. They include Abia, Adamawa, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Borno, Cross River, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Rivers, Taraba, and Zamfara. The NCDC, in its report, also said 19 out of the suspected cases have died so far.

The agency said in week 8, 2 suspected cholera cases were recorded. "There was 33% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 7 [week of 13 Feb 2022] (3) compared with week 8 [week of 20 Feb 2022] (2)," the report reads. "Nasarawa and Rivers states account for 100% of 2 suspected cases reported in week 8.

"During the reporting week, only 1 cholera rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was conducted. The RDT conducted was from Nasarawa and it was positive (100%). No stool culture was conducted. "Of the cases reported, there were no deaths from the 2 states reporting with a weekly case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.0%. No new state reported cases in week 8. National multi-sectoral Cholera TWG [Technical Working Group] continues to monitor response across states." The agency said of all the suspected cases since the beginning of the year [2022], "age group <5 years is the most affected age group for male and female. Of all suspected cases, 47% are males and 53% are females."

In Gandhinagar district, about 100 people, including children, have been affected by cholera in the surrounding area and a child has also died. Cholera patients have been receiving treatment in government and private hospitals for the last 2 days.

The rising number of cases of diarrhea and vomiting in the eastern part of Kalol city has sent shockwaves through the health system. In just 2 days, about 100 cases have been registered in Tantra. An 8-month-old baby has died of cholera. Cholera outbreaks have erupted as sewers and drinking water have become contaminated. The area has been declared cholera-hit and house-to-house surveillance has been carried out by the government.

Cases of waterborne epidemics have also been reported from societies in new areas. Experts say that reflects an outbreak of cholera. A 9-year-old girl from a family living in the central part of the city also died after having diarrhea and vomiting. An outbreak of cholera was reported in the vicinity of about 2 kilometers [1.2 mi] after the outbreak was found to be cholera.

Special instructions were given to the Gandhinagar health system by Lok Sabha MP Amit Shah as the epidemic spread due to the mixing of drinking and sewage water. As a result of this alleged negligence of Kalol Municipality, cholera has spread its legs and taken away about 100 people.

As stated by Lutwick et al (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
