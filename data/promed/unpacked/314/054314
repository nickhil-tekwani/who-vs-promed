Russia ministry confirms bird flu outbreak in Far East region of Primorye
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Russia's agriculture ministry confirmed a bird flu outbreak in a
village in the Far East region of Primorye which was quarantined
after scores of chickens died.

"In 2 days, 28 out of 42 hens and guinea fowl died on a farm" in the
village of Vozdvizhenka, 110 km [68.3 miles] north of Vladivostok,
the ministry's veterinary control unit said in a statement on
Thursday [10 Apr 2008].

The dead birds had been incinerated, it added. A regional laboratory
made the discovery after testing samples taken from sick birds, and a
national laboratory was due to determine if it was the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus.

Authorities cordoned off the village, killed all other fowl on the
farm and vaccinated birds in the village and nearby areas, the ministry said.

[According to Russia's follow-up report No 7, submitted to the OIE on
11 Apr 2008, the probable source of the above outbreak or origin of
infection are hunted wild ducks and geese. The report further
describes the affected population as comprised of 28 susceptible
chickens (21 cases), 8 susceptible guinea fowls (7 cases), 3
susceptible muscovy ducks (no cases) and 3 susceptible ducks (no
cases) in a backyard. Poultry in the village were not vaccinated.
