The district health administration has put the entire district on alert following an outbreak of "indigenous" (infections which originate locally) cases of malaria at Mukkola in the Vizhinjam coast.

The outbreak, 1st reported on 23 Jul 2015, has now resulted in 17 cases of malaria, with 6 new cases being reported on Wednesday [29 Jul 2015]. While some patients are being treated at Vizhinjam community health centre, some are being treated at the General Hospital. Though measures to check the spread of infection and for vector control have been launched, more cases of malaria should be expected in the next few days, before the control measures begin to yield results, the district medical officer, Nita Vijayan, says.

Though "imported" cases of malaria (infection brought by travelling fishermen) are a usual occurrence in this part of the coast, the fact that the current outbreak has occurred locally has been a matter of concern. All cases, except one imported case, are _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria, a less dangerous strain of the infection. This is the 1st occurrence of malaria in the Vizhinjam coast this year [2015].

More health workers have been deployed in the area. The vector density of _Anopheles mosquitoes_ in the locality is high. Elimination of adult mosquitoes and active fever surveillance in the field are the main strategies being adopted by health workers. Spraying of larvicides in wells and idling boats (which have stagnant water pools and are major breeding sites for mosquitoes) are also on.

Mukkola panchayat in Vizhinjam has always been vulnerable to vector-borne infections, given the socio-economic conditions in the area and also because of several factors which were often beyond the control of the health administration, Dr. Vijayan said. Even though the health officials have been advising the local population to take personal protection measures against the night-biting Anopheles mosquitoes -- like sleeping under mosquito nets -- the fishermen preferred to sleep out in the open. They never reported fever till they were too sick, and most went back to work before the treatment ran its course

Officials said that some parts of Mukkola were under the Corporation, where the civic body's health workers carried out the field activities. In the rest of the areas, field staff of the Health Department were in charge.

[Kerala is usually regarded as a low-risk area for malaria. The information suggests that local transmission of _P. vivax_ is now occurring in the community. Larvicidal spraying has been initiated, and people are advised to use impregnated mosquito nets. - Mod.EP
