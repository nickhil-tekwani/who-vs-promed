An outbreak of norovirus at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin has caused the hospital to close to new admissions. Only the emergency department will be open for those with life-threatening conditions.

The outbreak, which has affected 23 patients and staff across several wards, follows a period of high levels of norovirus being experienced in the community. This, coupled with the pressures from the rise in COVID cases, has left the hospital under extreme pressure with a shortage of beds.

Hospital manager Alasdair Pattinson said that patients in immediate danger should call 999. He said: "We would assure the public that those facing life-threatening situations are continuing to be seen rapidly for life-saving treatment, as an absolute priority. Anyone attending at ED may well be redirected to 111 or another appropriate service. Those directed to hospital by 111 will unfortunately face a lengthy wait to be seen. This may also have an impact on access to wider NHS Grampian health and social care services."

The norovirus outbreak has affected 4 wards in the hospital. The wards most affected by the outbreak are 1, 5, 6 and 8. They are closed to visitors, with the exception of those receiving end-of-life care. People who feel their visit is essential are encouraged to contact the nurse in charge of the ward.

Mr Pattinson added: "We would like to apologise for the significant inconvenience this will cause some people and thank the Moray public for its patience and understanding. Our frontline staff continue to work incredibly hard to see and treat as many patients as possible, and I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their efforts."

Care for those in the 4 wards affected by the outbreak continues as usual.

[Norovirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide throughout the year, with peak activity in winter months, when it has been called winter vomiting disease. Infection is characterized by non-bloody watery diarrhea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and abdominal cramping pain, lasting 1-3 days, affecting all ages, but it can be severe, even deadly, in the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Transmission occurs via direct contact with people shedding _Norovirus_ in feces or vomitus or into the air during vomiting; transmission may also occur indirectly through environmental or food contamination with their feces or vomit, especially in closed settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, cruise ships, and hotels (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/norovirus/229110-ANoroCaseFactSheet508.pdf).

The ease of its transmission, a very low infectious dose (18 or more viral particles), a short incubation period (12-48 hours), environmental persistence (on surfaces for several weeks and in water for months), lack of durable immunity following infection, and little cross-protective immunity against different genotypes of the virus enables norovirus to spread rapidly in confined populations. As illustrated by the news report above, norovirus outbreaks in healthcare settings pose a risk to patients, healthcare personnel, and to the efficient provision of healthcare services (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/norovirus/norovirus-gen508.pdf). A discussion of the management of norovirus infection in healthcare settings can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/norovirus/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/norovirus/norovirus-gen508.pdf.
