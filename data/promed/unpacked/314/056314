On [Tue 1 Aug 2017], a 63-year old male was transferred to the Department of Tropical Medicine of the Medical Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg, Germany, with a 3 weeks history of recurrent fever of up to 40 C [approx. 104 F] and fatigue. The patient was of Cambodian origin but lived in Germany for over 30 years. He reported having returned on [Sun 23 Jul 2017] from a 4-month visit to Cambodia (Province Kompot) where he had visited his family.

After his return, malaria has been ruled out by negative thick and thin smear in a secondary care hospital in the region of Unterfranken, Bavaria, Germany, to which he was previously admitted. On the day of transfer a blood culture became positive with _Burkholderia spp_. and was confirmed by PCR as _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. The isolate is susceptible to the cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and tetracycline. A CT scan showed multiple lung abscesses on both sides and pleural effusion with one abscess fistulating into the mediastinum. The patient had no breathing difficulties in and no abscess sites on the skin or any other organ involvement and was immediately put on IV-antibacterials (1g meropenem 3 times a day and 500mg levofloxacin 2 times a day). He currently is in stable condition and became afebrile within 2 days of treatment. Apart from recently diagnosed diabetes he had no other underlying conditions.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.

For the microbiologists among our readers, a new (and 5th) member of the _B. pseudomallei_ complex has been described, _B. humptydooensis_ , from the Northern Territory of Australia and named after the small town of Humpty Doo near to where the isolate was found (Tuanyok A, Mayo M, Scholz H, et al: _Burkholderia humptydooensis_ sp. nov., a new species related to _Burkholderia thailandensis_ and the fifth member of the _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ complex.
