A World Health Organisation influenza expert says it's unlikely that
a dodgy batch of seasonal flu vaccine is responsible for bad
reactions in children. Dozens of babies and young children, mostly in
Western Australia and Queensland, have suffered adverse reactions
after having the flu shot, including fevers and convulsions. And the
Queensland Coroner is investigating the death of a 2-year-old
Brisbane girl, found dead in her cot a day after she and her twin
sister were vaccinated. Seasonal flu shots for children under 5 have
been suspended since Friday [23 Apr 2010].

Ian Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organisation
influenza centre in Melbourne, told the ABC [Australian Broadcasting
Corporation] the cases involved several different batches of the
vaccine. "If it was a single batch then you might think that that
might be the case," he said. "If multiple batches are involved then
that's less likely I think -- but again we still need to wait."

Australia's chief medical officer professor Jim Bishop has ordered a
review of hospitals records to better understand the scope of the
problem. He's also urged medical staff and parents to immediately
report any adverse reactions among children.

Australia probes seasonal flu vaccine reactions in children
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia's chief medical officer asked providers to stop giving
children under age 5 the seasonal flu vaccine made by CSL Ltd after
receiving reports of fever and convulsions in kids in Western
Australia who had recently been immunized. The country's drug
regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Good Administration (TGA), is
investigating the reports and will test samples of the vaccine that
CSL has agreed to provide, Bloomberg News reported today [23 Apr 2010].

CSL, an Australia-based flu vaccine producer, said in a statement
today [23 Apr 2010] it was urgently investigating the reports along
with federal and state health officials and that it has stopped
distributing its pediatric vaccine to reduce the risk of inadvertent
administration to children younger than 5. CSL is Australia's only
flu vaccine producer, but it is one of several companies that supply
seasonal flu vaccine for the Australian market. CSL's trivalent
seasonal flu vaccine covers 3 flu strains, including pandemic H1N1.

Over the past month, 22 children from the state [Western Australia]
were hospitalized after experiencing febrile convulsions within 12
hours of receiving the vaccine, The West Australian reported today
[23 Apr 2010]. Health officials added that one child became seriously
ill, and it was still unclear if the vaccine was the cause of the
children's symptoms.

Children ages 6 months to 5 years old in Western Australia [WA] are
eligible to receive free seasonal flu vaccination, and the pattern
and rate of adverse events has not been seen in any of the country's
other states, the TGA said in a press release today [23 Apr 2010].
"TGA will test batches of the vaccine used in WA for any
abnormalities," the agency said, adding that other Australian states
and territories are focusing their immunization efforts on high-risk
groups. The TGA also said it would explore if the reactions reported
in Western Australia relate to the vaccine or the state's vaccine
delivery system. Today's [23 Apr 2010] warning does not apply to
CSL's single-strain (monovalent) pandemic H1N1 vaccine.

The problem with CSL's vaccine comes as vaccination efforts are
ramping up across Australia and other parts of the Southern
Hemisphere where flu season typically begins sometime in May. Health
officials in Australia have warned that the season could see the
nation's 2nd wave of pandemic [A(H1N1)] flu. Demand for the vaccine
has been fairly strong, and some parts of the country have reported
vaccine shortages, according to media reports.

CSL's Fluvax, available in adult and pediatric formulations, is an
inactivated split-virus vaccine that does not include an adjuvant. It
contains the flu strains recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) for the Southern Hemisphere's seasonal flu vaccine: that is,
pandemic A(H1N1), an influenza A Perth-like H3N2, and a Brisbane-like
influenza B. In February [2010] the WHO recommended similar strains
for the Northern Hemisphere's next flu season.

The company's Afluria was one of 6 seasonal flu vaccines that were
approved for use during the United States' current flu season, and
CSL is one of the companies providing pandemic flu vaccine to the
country. According to background from the Health Industry
Distributors Association (HIDA), CSL vaccine accounted for an
estimated 8 million doses, or about 7 percent of the nearly 115
million seasonal flu vaccine doses that were projected to be
available this season.

In November [2009] the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under
an accelerated process, expanded its approval of CSL's seasonal and
pandemic vaccine for infants and children ages 6 months and older.

Australia's chief medical officer Jim Bishop has asked health
authorities in each state and territory to assemble a picture of how
many children under 5 have suffered adverse reactions after being
vaccinated against the flu and the numbers have begun to come in.

In Western Australia, health authorities have recorded 251 cases. 15
cases have been recorded in Queensland. The Northern Territory has
acknowledged 3. There have been 2 in Tasmania. South Australia
reported 1 case last week and Victoria's Health Department says there
have been just a handful of cases there.

Health officials in the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] and New
South Wales won't release their figures yet.

A health scare that has embroiled biopharmaceutical company CSL Ltd.
(CSL.AU) spread further Tuesday [27 Apr 2010], when authorities in
Western Australia [WA] state said more than 250 infants had fallen
ill after receiving seasonal influenza vaccines.

The WA Health Department said 55 children in the state had suffered
possible febrile seizures after being vaccinated, while another 196
suffered less severe reactions such as fevers and vomiting.

There is also a report that the coroner in Queensland state was
investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who died shortly after
being vaccinated.

CSL suspended distribution of its paediatric seasonal influenza
vaccine in Australia on Friday [23 Apr 2010] as authorities halted
influenza vaccinations for children aged under 5. A WA health
Department spokeswoman said the state's influenza vaccines were
supplied by CSL and 2 other manufacturers, Solvay SA (SOLB.BT) and
Sanofi-Pasteur SA (AVP.YY). CSL, which said Friday [23 Apr 2010] that
it was cooperating with an Australian government investigation into
the problem, was unavailable for comment.

Brisbane's Courier-Mail newspaper reported that a child was found
dead at her home in the Queensland state capital on 9 Apr 2010, 12
hours after receiving the influenza vaccine. It said an autopsy had
failed to identify a cause of death and the state's coroner was
conducting tests to check whether the fatality was linked to the vaccine.

CSL said last week [week of 19 Apr 2010] that its seasonal vaccine
immunized children against 3 influenza strains, including the
pandemic H1N1, also known as swine flu.

[The pediatric vaccine contains the influenza virus strains
recommended by the World Health Organization for the Southern
Hemisphere's seasonal flu vaccine: that is, the pandemic A(H1N1)
virus, an influenza A Perth-like H3N2, and a Brisbane-like influenza
B. (In February 2010 the WHO recommended similar strains for the
Northern Hemisphere's next flu season). It is unclear at present to
what extent the adverse reactions are related to an individual
component of the vaccine, or the whole CSL vaccine, or one or more
production batches of the vaccine. An autopsy of a deceased child has
failed to identify a cause of death or indeed whether the death was
linked to the suspect vaccine. Further information is awaited.

In Western Australia where the problem was first recognised, there
have been 251 cases. Now 15 cases have been recorded in Queensland,
and the Northern Territory has acknowledged another 3. There have
been 2 cases in Tasmania, 1 in South Australia and a "handful" in Victoria.
