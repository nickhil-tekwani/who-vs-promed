The vanilla growers in Sringeri [Chickamagaluru district] are in
despair due to the disease that has hit vanilla crops. The areca
[betelnut palm] farmers who lost their crops to yellow leaf disease
had opted to grow vanilla as an alternative crop.

Despite the good price, the farmers could not reap much profit owing
to the disease that hit the vanilla crop, says one farmer. The vanilla
yield was reduced by 50 percent last year [2010], and this year [2011]
it has seen further reduction.

Analysing the present status of dying vanilla crops, the future of
vanilla growers in the region appears bleak.

[_Vanilla_ is a genus of climbing terrestrial tropical orchids.
Commercially grown species include _V. planifolia_ (Bourbon vanilla),
_V. tahitensis_, and _V. pompona_, which are cultivated in different
regions. Vanilla food flavouring agents are derived from the plants'
processed beans and is the 2nd most expensive spice after saffron.

The crop is susceptible to many fungal pathogens; for example, species
of _Fusarium_, _Sclerotium_, _Phytophthora_ and _Colletrotrichum_
cause rots of roots, stem, leaves, beans and shoot tips as well as
immature bean drop. Vanilla, like many orchids, is also susceptible to
a number of viral diseases, causing mosaic, distortion or spots on
leaves, as well as general decline and loss of plant vigour.
