People in Western Australia's Gascoyne and Pilbara regions have been warned to take extra care to avoid contracting mosquito-borne viruses after heavy rainfall and localised flooding.

WA Health's managing scientist Mike Lindsay said Ross River virus (RRV) was active at above-average levels in the north-west during February and March [2014]. "Although case numbers decreased during April [2014], the latest rains in the Gascoyne and Pilbara may extend the mosquito breeding season, and in turn lead to increased activity of RRV or other mosquito-borne viruses over the next few weeks," Dr Lindsay said.

Symptoms of RRV disease include painful or swollen joints, sore muscles, skin rashes, fever, fatigue and headaches, and can last for weeks or months. There are no cures or vaccines for these viruses, WA Health said.

"People do not need to alter their plans to visit the Gascoyne or Pilbara regions as a result of this warning, but it is important to avoid mosquito bites by taking a few simple steps," Dr Lindsay said. These include avoiding being outdoors around dawn and dusk, wearing long, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing when outdoors, and applying a personal repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or picaridin.

[Although the above report does not indicate the number of Ross River virus (RRV) infections this year, it does indicate that RRV has been actively transmitted at above average levels in Western Australia so far in 2014. RRV transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant. RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Although not fatal, it causes acute polyarthritis in humans. The recommendations to avoid mosquito bites, given the expected increase in vector mosquito populations, is prudent.
