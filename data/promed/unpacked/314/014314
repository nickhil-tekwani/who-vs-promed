West Bengal State University [WBSU] have found 19 unique and highly aggressive variants of _Phytophthora infestans_. These variants are from the European 13_A2 [Blue 13] genotype and were responsible for the 2013-14 epidemic in West Bengal that shrank potato yield by 8000 kg per hectare.

Pathogen diversity was found to be highest near international borders with Bangladesh and Nepal. Both regularly import potatoes. In 2012, the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research had found 13_A2 imported with potatoes from Europe to be responsible for outbreaks in south India.

"There is a possibility that the pathogen travelled from south to east India, while pathogens from Bangladesh and Nepal also made their way in. They all adapted to local conditions and evolved into 19 variants," Dr Sanjoy Guha Roy, WBSU, [said].

There are regional variations in the pathogen. The team is screening the variants to build a database of their characteristics including response to fungicides, and also map variants to regions. The new pathogens are not only more aggressive but also evolving with every season. Most of them were resistant to metalaxyl, a commonly used fungicide.

The study suggests effective surveillance and detection measures. Stronger phytosanitary measures to screen imported seed [tubers] and prevent transmission can help curb the disease.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are vital. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, increasing the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop. All blight outside Mexico was A1 until in 1976 when potatoes were imported into Europe from Mexico to satisfy shortages. Soon after A2 strains were detected in Europe.

In Europe, it has been reported that regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist, strains like A2-Blue 13 (EU_13_A2; ProMED-mail posts 20090406.1332 and 20100212.0505) and A1-Pink 6 (ProMED-mail post 20100604.1851) are now dominating. Additional strains, such as A2-Green 33 (ProMED-mail post 20120202.1031230) and A2-Dark Green 37 (ProMED-mail post 20171029.5412307) are also spreading in the region. Furthermore, the incidence of strains with mixed A1/A2 parentage which indicate genetic recombination is also increasing (e.g. ProMED-mail post 20150317.3237610). This is particularly worrying and increases the threat of PLB.

A2-Blue 13 is considered the currently most aggressive strain, with resistances to some widely used fungicides. It creates larger lesions and produces more spores more rapidly and at lower temperatures than other strains. Furthermore, the period between infection and sporulation is only 4.5 days, compared to 6 or 7 days for other strains. It emerged in Europe, then spread beyond the region to North Africa, India and China (ProMED-mail post 20130111.1492024).

In India and the region, PLB outbreaks have been an annual occurrence (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archive). The report above now suggests the possibility that this may be at least partly due to the spread of Blue 13 variants. However, a lack of rigour in applying preventative measures may also be to blame.
