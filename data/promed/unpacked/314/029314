An Egyptian woman and child died of H5N1 [avian influenza], the health ministry said on [Mon 19 Jan 2015], the 4th and 5th persons to die of the illness in the country this year. [The death of the 47 year old woman was reported in ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (14): Egypt, H5N1 susp. 20150119.3103703. This report adds the child's death. - Mod.LK]

The 6-year-old child died in Minya province on Monday evening [12 Jan 2015], after a 47-year-old woman succumbed to the disease in Assiut province earlier in the day, ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar said. Both Assiut and Minya provinces are rural areas that have seen a number of bird flu cases in the past year. The ministry announced one other case in treatment, bringing the total number of cases in Egypt to 20 this year [2015] so far. This includes 5 deaths as well as 6 recoveries and 9 cases still under treatment, Abdel Ghaffar said.

The World Health Organization says there has been a jump in the number of H5N1 infections in people in Egypt, but that there does not appear to have been any major genetic change in the flu strain to explain the rise in human cases. At least 10 people died from the disease in Egypt in 2014. The WHO said last week that between 4 Dec 2014 and 6 Jan 2015 there were 18 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt, including 4 deaths, the highest ever monthly number of human cases in the country.

The WHO says that whenever bird flu viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases.

Egypt's H5N1 cases have largely been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers tend to raise and slaughter poultry themselves.

[Thus far, there have been no credible reports suggesting community spread of the virus, and nearly all appear to have had direct contact with infected poultry.

The Egyptian Government has announced the creation of a high-level "Supreme National Committee On Bird Flu", ordered by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, to be chaired the 1st year by the Minister of Agriculture (http://afludiary.blogspot.ch/2015/01/egypt-government-statements-on-h5n1.html).
