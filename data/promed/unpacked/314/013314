The number of dengue cases for the first six months of this year showed an
increase with 130 cases recorded to July 15. June and July had the highest
number recorded, with 37 and 25 cases respectively, but no deaths were
reported. However, the number of cases is expected to rise with the coming
of the rainy season. The authority has identified 11 areas as dengue-prone:
Pujut 7 and 8, Lutong, Jee Foh, Canada Hill, Pujut Padang Kerbau, Krokop,
Pujut Corner, Lereng Bukit, Lopeng, Lambir and Kampung Sealine in Lutong.
The high risk areas are Canada Hill, Krokop and Pujut 7 and 8. Meanwhile,
sources revealed that the relevant authorities are stepping up preventive
measures, such as fogging. Enforcement officers are also making
round-the-clock inspections to nab anyone found breeding _Aedes_ sp.
mosquitoes.
