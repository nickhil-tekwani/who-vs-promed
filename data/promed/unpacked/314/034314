Whooping cough is spiking across the border in Walla Walla County. Public health directors in Walla Walla and Umatilla Counties explain the surge. Another pertussis epidemic is in full swing in Washington. Hardest hit is Walla Walla County, which has seen the highest rate of infection in the state.

Walla Walla has 28 confirmed cases so far in 2015 with additional suspected cases boosting the number to about 55, said Walla Walla County public health director Harvey Crowder. The official rate is 47 per 100 000 persons.

Public health officials attribute the surge in pertussis, or whooping cough, to a weaker vaccine first used in 1997 to replace an earlier vaccine that triggered high fevers and seizures in some children. The current vaccine is safer, but protection seems to wane faster. In the mid-2000s, fully immunized people started coming down with whooping cough.

Crowder said he wasn't surprised by the upsurge in 2015. "For whatever reason the vaccine doesn't provide long-lived immunity," Crowder said. "We're going to see this again and again and again every 3-5 years until we get a vaccine that is longer-lived." He said the majority of people coming down with whooping cough were fully vaccinated as children. "Most of our cases have been adolescents and young adults," he said.

Across the border in Oregon, Umatilla County has had only 2 confirmed cases, according to public health director Meghan DeBolt, and no current ones. "There are no active pertussis cases in Umatilla County," DeBolt said. "We haven't seen a surge here." That doesn't mean Umatilla County residents should feel invincible, however. Crowder and DeBolt urged people to get boosters, especially if they spend time around babies. Pregnant women should get vaccinated every time they get pregnant. Infants are particularly susceptible, they said.

To put the current outbreak in perspective, Washington saw epidemic numbers in 2012 with nearly 5000 whooping cough cases, dozens of hospitalizations and 1 infant death. So far, in 2015, 341 cases statewide have been reported. In 2014, at this time, there were 57 confirmed cases.

Oregon has seen 144 cases so far in 2015 after ending last year with 413.

Deschutes County Health Services has identified over 20 cases of pertussis in the community since the start of 2015, after a 2014 that brought the highest count in 20 years, officials said on Tue 21 Apr 2015. All of the cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, have been investigated by Health Services Communicable Disease staff and close contacts have been notified.

In 2014, 60 cases of pertussis were reported in Deschutes County. This represented the highest number of annual cases reported in the last 2 decades, the department said. "The best defense against pertussis is a well-immunized community," the statement said.

Confirmed pertussis cases in 2015 by the numbers
• Statewide: 319
• Cowlitz: 7
• Clark: 39
• Lewis: 5
• Pacific: 4

With 319 cases of whooping cough confirmed statewide this year, health officials are urging people to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. In Cowlitz County, 7 cases have been confirmed, matching the total number of cases for all of 2014. The most recent case was diagnosed at the end of March 2015.

At least 5 students at Souderton Area High School have been diagnosed with pertussis, or whooping cough, prompting Montgomery County health officials to warn of an outbreak, the school district said in a statement this week.

Of the 5 cases, 3 have been confirmed, superintendent Frank T Gallagher said Wed, 18 Apr 2015. "Everyone's doing well," he said.

[A recently published paper in PLoS Computational Biology suggests waning immunity from the acellular pertussis vaccine as the main reason for the dramatic increase in pertussis cases: Gambhir M, Clark TA, Cauchemez S, et al. A change in vaccine efficacy and duration of protection explains recent rises in pertussis incidence in the United States. PLoS Comput Biol. 2015; 11(4): e1004138. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138:

Abstract
--------
Over the past 10 years the incidence of pertussis in the USA has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989.

We find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first 3 doses 80 per cent [95 per cent CI: 78 - 82] versus 90 per cent [95 per cent CI: 87-94]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available USA surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the 2 vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning. - Mod.LL
