[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of definite and probable
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), remain unchanged since the
previous monthly report; that is, the number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 167.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, and only one so far in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
----------------------------------------
As of 6 Oct 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 99 referrals, 59
deaths from sporadic CJD, 4 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3 from GSS,
one from familial CJD, and one from vCJD.

During the period 1992 to 2008, there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now
deceased. They occurred between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one
in 2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005,
6 in 2006, 3 in 2007, and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and
11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6
of the patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris area] and 17 in
the provinces. All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129
of the prion protein gene. No special risk factors were evident,
which distinguished these patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However, one patient had visited the
UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
------------------------------------------
As of 30 Sep 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 1077
referrals, 41 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic CJD,
5 from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

Atypical BSE (BASE) Transmitted from Asymptomatic Aging Cattle to a
Primate. Emmanuel E. Comoy, Cristina Casalone, Nathalie
Lescoutra-Etchegaray et al PLoS ONE. 2008; 3(8): e3017. (Published

Abstract
-------
Human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) results from foodborne
transmission of prions from slaughtered cattle with classical Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (cBSE). Atypical forms of BSE, which remain
mostly asymptomatic in aging cattle, were recently identified at
slaughterhouses throughout Europe and North America, raising a
question about human susceptibility to these new prion strains.

Brain homogenates from cattle with classical BSE and atypical (BASE)
infections were inoculated intracerebrally into cynomolgus monkeys
(_Macacca fascicularis_), a non-human primate model previously
demonstrated to be susceptible to the original strain of cBSE. The
resulting diseases were compared in terms of clinical signs,
histology and biochemistry of the abnormal prion protein (PrPres).
The single monkey infected with BASE had a shorter survival, and a
different clinical evolution, histopathology, and prion protein
(PrPres) pattern than was observed for either classical BSE or vCJD-
inoculated animals. Also, the biochemical signature of PrPres in the
BASE-inoculated animal was found to have a higher proteinase K
sensitivity of the octa-repeat region. We found the same biochemical
signature in 3 of 4 human patients with sporadic CJD and an MM type 2
PrP genotype who lived in the same country as the infected bovine.

Our results point to a possibly higher degree of pathogenicity of
BASE than classical BSE in primates and also raise a question about a
possible link to one uncommon subset of cases of apparently sporadic
CJD. Thus, despite the waning epidemic of classical BSE, the
occurrence of atypical strains should temper the urge to relax
measures currently in place to protect public health from accidental
contamination by BSE-contaminated products.

[Extracts from the authors' Introduction and Discussion]
------------------------------------
"Classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (cBSE), the 1st prion
disease identified in cattle, was initially reported in 1986 in the
UK. Food-borne transmission of cBSE to humans was observed 10 years
later as a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), leading
to a major public health crisis. This strain of cBSE is now rapidly
disappearing as a result of appropriate containment measures.
However, atypical forms of BSE have recently been identified in
Europe and North America as a consequence of cBSE testing performed
in these countries. Because these cases are only found sporadically
in older animals (greater than or equal to 8 years) coming to
slaughter with few or no signs of disease, it would be plausible to
suppose that atypical forms of BSE may have a lower virulence than
cBSE and be innocuous to humans. However, recent studies suggest that
one of the 2 main forms of atypical BSE, initially discovered in
Italy and referred to as the bovine amyloidotic spongiform
encephalopathy (BASE), might be at the origin of the cBSE epidemic:
inoculation of the BASE strain into transgenic and inbred mice showed
an apparent natural evolution towards the typical BSE strain.
Moreover, a possible link has been suggested between BASE and one
subtype (MV2) of human sporadic CJD (sCJD) on the basis of
biochemical similarities. In contrast to vCJD, sCJD is believed to
occur de novo without food-borne transmission. However, specific
contaminating events by ingestion are difficult to rule out because
human prion diseases can have silent incubation periods exceeding
years, as demonstrated for kuru.

The authors have shown that BASE, the 1st identified atypical strain
of BSE, originating from asymptomatic cattle, is transmissible by
intra-cerebral (i.c.) inoculation to a species of non-human primate.
Although this observation concerned only one animal, its survival was
substantially shorter than for all the macaques inoculated with
classical BSE as well as the majority of those inoculated with human
vCJD. Moreover, in earlier experiments by others on a total of 6
macaques inoculated i.c. with 50 mg of cBSE brain, none had an
incubation period of less than 30 months, and humanized transgenic
mice have been found to be highly susceptible to infection with BASE,
and completely resistant to infection with cBSE. If BASE is more
pathogenic than classical BSE for primates, it could indicate a more
readily transmissible infection from cattle to humans than previously
suspected.

The disease induced by BASE was different in all respects from that
induced by cBSE. The clinical presentation was characterized by mild
tremors and myoclonus, progressing to a marked cognitive disorder,
including spatial disorientation but without anxiety, aggressiveness
or loss of appetite. In contrast, cBSE presented signs of anxiety and
aggressiveness together with progressive difficulties in locomotion
as well as cerebellar signs (major ataxia), and severe decrease of
appetite with concurrent weight loss. The widespread spongiform
lesions and loss of pyramidal cells in the 3rd and 5th layers of the
frontal cortex together with the severe parietal lesions could
explain the prominent cognitive signs and the spatial disorientation
seen in the BASE-infected monkey, contrasting with the severity of
lesions in the obex and cerebellum consistent with the
in-coordination seen in animals inoculated with cBSE. Amyloid
plaques, the hallmark of BASE in cattle, are not produced in the
Macaque monkey, and conversely, cBSE does not produce plaques in
cattle, but does so in the Macaque, a clear indication that plaque
deposition depends as much on the host as the prion strain.

At the molecular level, under conditions of high proteinase pre-
treatment and detection using 2 antibodies reacting with either an
epitope in the N terminal octapeptide repeat region or the core of
PrP, BASE and cBSE were clearly distinguishable in primate. BASE was
detectable only by the core antibody, whereas cBSE was detectable by
both antibodies. This method can now be used to test both ruminant
and human samples to identify similarities and differences in their
molecular protein signatures, and to implement the classification of
ruminant and possibly human strains.

Although classical epidemiological studies have not found any link
between scrapie in sheep and goats and human CJD, newer molecular
biological studies now indicate that about half of all cases of
scrapie are due to previously undetected atypical strains that are
experimentally transmissible to sheep and mice. Their risk for humans
is unknown and is the subject of current studies in experimental
models, including primates. cBSE has been shown to be responsible for
human cases of vCJD, but the comparative risk for humans of BASE and
other atypical strains of BSE is still unknown, and its clarification
will require many years of epidemiological surveillance and molecular
biological testing of both bovine and human populations.

The 1st cases of BASE in cattle had PrPres electrophoretic profiles
similar to the MV2 subtype of sporadic CJD patients that, together
with the presence of amyloid plaques in both the cattle and the
patients, suggested a possible link between BASE and this subtype of
sCJD. However, our PrPres typing technique has shown that, in the
primate, PrPres of other MV2 sCJD patients exhibited a resistance to
proteolysis different from the BASE-infected primate, whereas PrPres
from vCJD-infected patients and primates behave similarly. This
observation, together with the absence of amyloid plaques in the
BASE-infected primate, weakens the likelihood of a direct link
between BASE and MV2 subtype sCJD patients. In contrast, the specific
signature of PrPres in the BASE-infected primate was similar to that
seen in 3 of 4 patients with the MM2 cortical subtype of sporadic
CJD. It is interesting that an important feature of the
clinical-pathological syndrome in this BASE-infected macaque -- the
absence of cerebellar involvement -- is also a common element in
patients with the MM2 subtype of human sporadic CJD. However, as
illustrated by the clinical details of our 4 tested MM2 cases, there
is considerable patient-to-patient variation, just as there can be
variation among individual animals experimentally inoculated with a
given strain of TSE.

It is not known whether atypical strains of BSE have been circulating
for years or represent new forms of disease, and continuing research
is clearly needed to answer both this and the equally important
question about a possible relationship to at least certain forms of
what are presently regarded as sporadic cases of human disease.
Moreover, the BASE strain has been described to evolve naturally
towards BSE after successive transmissions in inbred mice. The
stability and pathogenicity of this strain in humans remains to be
determined, and it is worth recalling that the stability of the cBSE/
vCJD strain, which retains its specific molecular signature in
different infected hosts, is the exception rather than the rule. As
has been previously observed, one patient exhibited both types of
PrP, i.e. type 2 typical of the MM2 subtype and type 1 observed in
the MM1 subtype. On the one hand, this demonstrates the interest of
such a simple biochemical test to refine PrP analysis, and on the
other hand it raises a question about the existence of different
PrPres signatures in the same patient, i.e., different prion strains
linked to multiple infections or to variants selected by the host."

In summary, the authors have transmitted one atypical form of BSE
(BASE) to a cynomolgus macaque monkey that had a shorter incubation
period than monkeys infected with classical BSE, with distinctive
clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features, and have shown
that the molecular biological signature resembled that seen in a
comparatively uncommon subtype of sporadic CJD. The authors cannot
yet say whether BASE is more pathogenic for primates (including
humans) than cBSE, nor predict whether its molecular biological
features represent a clue to one cause of apparently sporadic human
CJD. However, the evidence presented by the authors and by others
justifies concern about a potential human health hazard from
undetected atypical forms of BSE. Despite the waning epizoonosis of
classical BSE, it would be premature to abandon the precautionary
measures that have been so successful in reversing the impact of cBSE.

[The most significant outcome of this investigation is that it
suggests that the atypical BASE agent may posses a higher degree of
pathogenicity in primates than the classical BSE agent. Furthermore,
the experimental data suggest a possible relationship to one uncommon
subset of cases of apparently sporadic CJD in humans. However, at
this stage too much should not be read into these findings, which are
derived from analysis of the outcome of infection of a single
cynomolgus monkey.

Interested readers are recommended to consult the original text for
proper evaluation of the experimentation and of the implications of
this piece of research. - Mod.CP]

[4] Mother & son are 3rd & 4th cases in Spain
Date: Thu 25 Sep 2008

The mother of a Spanish man who died from the human form of mad cow
disease has also died from the illness, Spain's Ministry of Health
says. Spain has taken steps to avoid mad cow disease, and there is no
danger from eating meat, officials said. It is believed to be the 1st
case in the world where 2 members of the same family have died from
mad cow disease, said Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national
research center for mad cow disease. Until now, Badiola added,
clinical evidence that he's seen from the United Kingdom and France
-- which have had the most deaths due to the human form of mad cow
disease -- had not recorded 2 cases in a single family.

The mother, in her early 60s, died last month [August 2008]. The
government confirmed Wednesday [24 Sep 2008] that it was because of
mad cow disease but did not, by custom, make her name public. Her
son, 41, died in February 2008 from the same disease, Badiola said.

The latest confirmed case makes a total of 4 deaths in Spain from mad
cow disease since 2005. Three of these cases in Spain were in the
same northern province, Leon, which is another unusual aspect that
will be studied, Badiola said.

Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the
appearance of the human form of the disease, called variant
Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The health ministry
said there is no danger from eating meat in Spain because of existing
controls. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the 1st cases
of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, included isolating
infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with
animal proteins, the ministry said.

"The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions
that were made at the European level more than 8 years ago," the
ministry statement said. Badiola said that it's likely the mother and
son contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow
disease began in 2001 in Spain. The pair had similar eating habits,
Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys
and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. Researchers
will try to determine whether the mother and son shared a genetic
structure that might have made them more prone to contracting the
illness, Badiola said.

The family's home was in a village near the provincial capital of
Leon, 333 km (206 miles) northwest of Madrid. The other case in that
province was of a woman, 50, who was a local government worker in the
provincial capital. She died in December [2007] from mad cow disease.
The 1st confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005,
when a young woman died near Madrid.

In addition to the cases in Spain, as of June 2008 the following
numbers of cases of human mad cow disease had been reported: 167 in
the United Kingdom; 23 in France; 4 in Ireland; 3 in the United
States; 2 each in Netherlands and Portugal; and one each in Canada,
Italy, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Two of the 3 U.S. cases, 2 of the 4
cases in Ireland and the single cases in Canada and Japan were people
probably exposed to the mad cow agent while residing in the United
Kingdom, officials have said. One of the 23 French cases may also
have been infected in the United Kingdom.

[Byline: Al Goodman]

[Elsewhere, the number of US cases is given as 2. See the following:

[1] The US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center
report, June 2008
<http://www.cjdsurveillance.com/resources-casereport.html>
states the following: "During the period 1997 to 2008, 2 cases of
vCJD were reported, both contracted overseas. The 1st case was
recorded in 2004, disease contracted in the UK, and the 2nd in 2006,
disease contracted in Saudi Arabia."

[2] SEAC (the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee)
<http://seac992007.blogspot.com/2008/01/spongiform-encephalopathy-advisory.html>
states the following: "Infection is considered likely to have
occurred in the UK in 2 Ireland cases, 2 USA cases, and single
French, Japanese & Canadian cases. One of the French cases had a
history of possibly significant residence in the UK. One USA case is
thought likely to have been exposed to infection in Saudi Arabia,
rather than the USA."

My interpretation of these figures is that there have been no truly
indigenous cases of vCJD in the USA, and the discrepancy in the
number of cases attributed to the USA is probably due to a double
counting of the Saudi Arabian case. - Mod.CP]

The mother and son who died from the human form of mad cow disease
may also have eaten animal brains, said Juan Jose Badiola, director
of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease, according to
a report from CNN.

Spain's Ministry of Health said on Wednesday [24 Sep 2008] tests
confirmed that the woman, who died last month [August 2008], is the
mother of a 41-year-old Spanish man who died in April 2008 because of
the same disease. Badiola said that they had similar eating habits,
which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and
they may also have eaten animal brains, added the report.

This is Spain's 4th fatality from the disease since 2005 and marks
the 1st time that 2 members of the same family died of the disease,
government officials said. The health researchers said on Wednesday
[24 Sep 2008] tests confirm that the woman, 64, who died in August
2008 in the northern Castilla-Leon region had mad cow disease. Her
disease was a variant of Creutzfeltd-Jakob disease (vCJD) linked to
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Spain began taking
preventative measures against the disease in 2001.
