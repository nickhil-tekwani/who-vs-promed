[1] China, under-reporting suspected

When pigs on the Xinda Husbandry Co. Ltd breeding farm in northern China began dying in growing numbers in early January [2019], it looked increasingly likely that the farm had been struck by the much feared African swine fever [ASF], an incurable disease that has spread rapidly across the country since last year [2018].

But after taking samples from some pigs, local officials in the Xushui district of Baoding city, about an hour's drive from Beijing, said their tests came back negative, said Sun Dawu, chairman of Hebei Dawu Agriculture Group, the farm owner.

As hundreds of pigs began dying daily on the 20 000-head farm, the company obtained a test kit that showed some positive results for the virus. But after further lobbying by Xinda, officials just offered the company subsidies for farm buildings and other investments, said Sun.

Sun's account of events and pictures taken by farm staff of dead pigs lying in rows and a pile outside the farm could not be independently verified.

Xushui district said in a faxed response to Reuters on Tuesday [19 Mar 2019] that it was opening an investigation into the case, adding that it had found some "discrepancies" with the reported version of events.

"If there is illegal behavior, relevant departments will handle it according to the law," added the statement from the local government's investigative committee.

Farmers and other industry insiders told Reuters that China's ASF epidemic is far more extensive than official reports suggest, making the disease harder to contain, potentially causing pork shortages and increasing the likelihood that it will spread beyond China's borders.

"Our full expectation is that the number of cases is under-reported," said Paul Sundberg, executive director at the Swine Health Information Center in Ames, Iowa, which is funded by American pork producers.

"And if there's so much of that virus in the environment in China, then we are at increased risk of importing it."

China does not permit the commercial sale of ASF test kits, though many are now available. Official confirmation must come from a state-approved laboratory.

"Public confirmation of disease is the government's job," Sun told Reuters at his company headquarters in Xushui in late February 2019.

Frustrated by the lack of action and mounting losses from the disease, Sun eventually published details of the suspected outbreak on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo on 22 Feb 2019.

Two days later, it became the 1st ASF case in Hebei province, one of the north's top pig producing regions, to be reported by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, about 7 weeks after the company says it had alerted local authorities.

By then, more than 15 000 pigs on the Xinda farm had already died, said Sun, and the company even sold thousands of pigs, potentially spreading the disease further.

Sun said officials did not explain why their 1st test had been negative, though he suggested it may have been because they took samples from live pigs on the farm and did not test the dead ones.

China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not reply to a faxed request for comment on the case.

The agriculture ministry has warned against covering up outbreaks of the disease, and in January 2019 highlighted 2 large farms that had tried to conceal outbreaks.

[2] Cambodia, alert

African swine fever [ASF] has spread to parts of Viet Nam that border Cambodia's Ratanakkiri and Kratie provinces, a Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries official said on Friday [15 Mar 2019].

Tan Phannara, the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production director-general, told a Phnom Penh workshop that he had received informal information from animal feed companies and animal raising associations that outbreaks of ASF in Viet Nam were getting closer to Cambodia.

He called on Ratanakkiri and Kratie department officials to remain alert in monitoring for outbreaks.

"I have received information that [Vietnamese] provinces that border Ratanakkiri and Kratie are reporting cases of ASF, and so I urge all officials to be vigilant," he said.

In February 2019, Viet Nam became the 3rd Asian country after China and Mongolia to report outbreaks of ASF.

The disease has hit Viet Nam's USD 10 billion pork industry and is seriously threatening future pig exports, Vietnamese online newspaper VN Express said on Friday [15 Mar 2019].

17 Vietnamese provinces have reported outbreaks, with Taiwan, Dubai, the US and the UK banning pork imports from Viet Nam, with violators facing heavy fines and even imprisonment.

ASF does not harm humans but is deadly to pigs, and there is no vaccine or cure. China slaughtered almost 700 million pigs in 2017 due to an outbreak of the virus.

Ratanakkiri deputy governor Nhem Sam Oeun said he was unaware of any information regarding outbreaks of ASF in parts of Viet Nam that border his province. He claimed Ratanakkiri does not import pork from Viet Nam.

"Most [Vietnamese pork imports] come through Kampong Cham province. We have informed traders not to import [Vietnamese pork] into our province," he said.

Phannara added that there had been many cases of illegal Vietnamese pork imports, but the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production was working closely with provincial authorities to crack down on them, with no cases of African swine fever yet found in Cambodia.

Ministry of Health spokesman Ly Sovann could not be reached for comment.

[The rapid, wide spread of ASF in Viet Nam is of great concern. Since 19 Feb 2019, and as of 20 Mar 2019, 207 outbreaks of ASF have been officially reported in 20 provinces/cities, as follows: Thai Binh (n=89), Hai Phong (n=33), Hung Yen (n=28), Hai Duong (n=17), Ha Noi (n=12), Ha Nam (n=5), Dien Bien (n=4), Quang Ninh (n=3), Thanh Hoa (n=2), Thai Nguyen (n=2), Bac Ninh (n=2), Ha Tay (n=2), Hoa Binh (n=1), Lang Son (n=1), Bac Kan (n=1), Nam Dinh (n=1), Nghe An (n=1), Ninh Binh (n=1) and Son La (n=1).

The data from China are the following. Since 1 Aug 2018, and as of 20 Mar 2019, ASF was officially detected in a total of 116 villages/sites in 27 Provinces/Autonomous regions/Municipalities out of 34: Liaoning (n=22), Anhui (n=9), Hunan (n=8), Sichuan (n=6), Heilongjiang (n=6, of which one in wild boar), Inner Mongolia (n=6), Yunnan (n=6), Shanxi (n=5), Beijing (n=4), Hubei (n=4), Jilin (n=4, of which one in a wild boar), Guizhou (n=4), Shaanxi (n=4), Fujian (n=3), Jiangxi (n=3), Guangdong (n=3), Zhejiang (n=3), Jiangsu (n=3), Guangxi (n=2), Henan (n=2), Tianjin (n=2), Chongqing (n=2), Qinghai (n=1), Ningxia (n=1), Gansu (n=1), Shandong (n=1) and Hebei (n=1).

The gap between the ASF statistics in Viet Nam (207 outbreaks in one month), and China (116 outbreaks in more than 7 months) is striking. When one refers to the picture illuminated in item 1 above, suspected under-reporting of ASF in China seems plausible. - Mod.AS
