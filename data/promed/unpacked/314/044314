Diphtheria, a vaccine-preventable disease that has vanished from most parts of the world, has so far killed at least 10 children in Sindh, mostly in the last 2 months, health officials confirmed on Monday [26 Sep 2022] while health experts feared that number of deaths due to the highly lethal infection could be much higher than the official figures. "So far 10 children have lost their lives due to diphtheria in Sindh while 39 cases have been confirmed in the province", Dr Irshad Memon, Project Director of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) told The News when asked about the number of diphtheria cases and mortalities due to the bacterial infection in the province.

According to infectious diseases experts, diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of bacteria called _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ that make toxin. It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart rhythm problems, and even death. Senior pediatric infectious diseases expert Dr Asad Ali claimed that a diphtheria outbreak was being reported from Karachi and other parts of Sindh and as per official figures; so far it had claimed the lives of 10 children but claimed that the number of deaths due to the vaccine-preventable disease could be 5 times higher than the official figures.

"We need outbreak investigation, higher rates of routine childhood immunization and additional booster diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine in our EPI [expanded program on Immunization]", Dr Asad Ali, who is also the Associate Dean of Research at Aga Khan University, told The News. Dr Asad Ali maintained that many countries have eliminated diphtheria through vaccination as in those countries an additional booster of DPT vaccine is given to children in the later stage of their childhood but in Pakistan, no booster is given, which it is affecting the children with weak immunity.

Another senior pediatrician Prof Jamal Raza said "our immunization coverage is not very good. Officially, it is said that the vaccination rate is around 70 percent but it is much less than the official figures", Dr Jamal Raza, who is the Executive Director of the Sindh Institute of Child Health told The News. Interviews with several health officials and infectious diseases experts in Karachi and Hyderabad revealed that diphtheria cases were being reported now as a matter of routine but due to lack of experience and knowledge of general practitioners, they refer these cases very late to specialized hospitals when the disease progressed to an incurable stage. "We are seeing the diphtheria cases on and off at our facility and at the moment, we have a girl in serious condition at our intensive care unit. If a patient is referred late, even given anti-toxin proves ineffective and chances of survival become difficult", Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, Medical Superintendent of Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital said.

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. ProMED reported in the past on diphtheria outbreaks in Pakistan (see also's below) that were attributed to low childhood immunization rates.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is not manufactured as a monovalent vaccine; it is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with a full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult formulations (Tdap).

In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/infectious_diseases/ABCs/RIDRMJuly2009VaccinePreventpdf.pdf?la=en).

Pakistan comprises 4 provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 4 territories: the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan#Law_enforcement). Sindh is located in the southeastern region of the country and is the 3rd-largest province by total area and the 2nd-largest province by population after Punjab. It shares land borders with the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan and Punjab to the west and north, respectively, and the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south; Karachi is the capital of Sindh Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh).
