Netherlands ban endangers British export industry
-------------------------------------------------
A voluntary ban by Dutch cattle importers on the live export of cattle from
the UK threatens to devastate the British export industry, just as it was
recovering from last year's [2007] foot and mouth [disease] restrictions.

The move comes after 12 calves, which were exported from a farm in England
to 6 farms in the Netherlands had to be slaughtered after subsequent tests
on the English farm detected tuberculosis [TB] in the herd. A further 27
farms that have been in contact with the original 6 are now under
restriction and Dutch vets are testing more than 4000 cattle for the disease.

Unofficially, Belgian farmers are also refusing to take British calves and
adult cattle. Exporters fear that a complete ban on the trade of live
cattle throughout the European Union could be in force next week. The news
has shocked farmers in the Netherlands, which has been free of TB since 1994.

During 2006, the UK exported a total of 81 000 live calves. That figure
fell to 64 000 in 2007 as a result of export restrictions due to
foot-and-mouth disease, but was recovering well this year [2008] and latest
figures to June reveal that 40 000 had crossed the English Channel.

The next 3 months is the peak period when most UK calves are selected for
the export trade to the Netherlands, and any disruption to this trade will
result in the complete collapse of export businesses that have already lost
millions because of last year's [2007] foot and mouth disease ban.

NFU (National Farmers' Union) Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller said:
"This is a very worrying development at a time when Scotland's dairy
farmers are achieving BP 50 to BP 60 per head [USD 99.70 to 119.64] for
export-quality bull calves. "We have spoken to Scotland's chief vet to
raise our concerns while our Brussels office is in dialogue with their
Dutch union counterparts on the subject. If the Commission becomes
involved, then what we would want to see is a proportionate response to
this issue, one which takes the wider calf trade in the EU into
consideration and one which stops well short of a unilateral ban on live
calf exports from the UK.

"Scotland has worked hard to preserve its excellent record on TB. We
already have low incidence status and, as an industry, we have set targets
to further reduce the number of cases of TB seen here. Any suggestion of a
European ban on live calves affecting Scotland would be unjustified and
unnecessary."

[2] UK (Wales): badger cull policy discussed
Date: Tue 15 Jul 2008
Source: Wales Online, Western Mail report [edited]

Wales will kill badgers -- row
------------------------------
The DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)
secretary of state's decision to rule out a badger cull in England will not
affect proposals to go ahead with one in Wales.

Rural Affairs minister Elin Jones said nothing had changed and plans for a
cull in a pilot area as part of a package of measures to eradicate bTB
[bovine tuberculosis] were proceeding as announced last April [2008]. "It
has not affected my thinking at all. Various expert groups set up to advise
are gathering information as we speak on the various factors we need to
take account of," said Ms Jones. "Then at some point later in the year I
will be given advice from my officials as to what, when and where."

Among the issues that need to be addressed is the willingness of all
landowners to take part in the trial cull. This will only work if officials
are able to slaughter all the animals within a clearly defined area in
order to gauge whether it has any effect on the spread of the disease.

A small minority of farmers opposes a badger cull, and larger numbers of
landowners with small acreages may try to prevent it from happening. The
Badger Trust has already lodged an application for a judicial review of a
"naive and short-sighted political decision". The trust claims the badger
plays no role in the spread of bTB, which now affects more than 2000 farms
in Wales. Last year [2007] nearly 8000 cattle were culled at a cost in
compensation to farmers of BP 15.2m [USD 30.3m].

"The harsh reality is that Wales' bovine TB problem can be easily traced to
cattle movements and farming practices," says a Badger Trust report. "There
is a clear and known correlation between larger herd sizes and an increased
risk of bovine TB."

The National Farmers' Union has promised a legal challenge to what it calls
the UK environment minister Hilary Benn's "disgraceful abdication of
responsibility" in ruling out a cull. NFU president, Bedfordshire farmer
Peter Kendall and vice president Meurig Raymond, who farms in
Pembrokeshire, led a demonstration outside the House of Parliament after Mr
Benn's announcement. Mr Kendall said the NFU would mount a legal challenge
and withdraw from talks on cost and responsibility sharing. The Tenant
Farmers Association (TFA) has also pulled out of talks on sharing the costs
and responsibilities of animal diseases, which it describes as
"hypocritical and damaging" without controls of bTB in wildlife.

[3] UK (Scotland): badger cull policy discussed

TB outbreak raises fears of ban on UK calves
--------------------------------------------
There appears to be a real possibility that the export of young bull calves
from dairy herds in the UK to mainland Europe may be banned following the
discovery to bovine tuberculosis on 27 farms in the Netherlands.

A dairy herd in England, previously free from TB, has suffered a breakdown
and it is believed that calves from this farm are the source of the
problem, which was discovered during routine testing.

About 400 000 calves are exported at around 10 days of age from the UK for
veal production. These must come from TB-free farms. However, there is no
reliable test for TB in animals that are aged less than 42 days.

In certain parts of the European Union, there is a view that the UK is a
reservoir of disease: first BSE in 1996, then the world's largest epidemic
of foot and mouth disease in 2001 followed by a smaller outbreak of the
same disease last year [2007].

The vast majority of farmers and many leading scientists assert there is a
clear link between TB and badgers, which are deemed to be the principal
vector of this disease.

The latest forecast is that up to 40 000 cattle in England will be culled
during 2008. Only last week Hilary Benn, the secretary of state at DEFRA
(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs), ruled out a cull
of badgers. He said that a cull of badgers "could end up making the disease
worse if it was not sustained over time or delivered effectively and public
opposition, including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part,
would render this more difficult."

Jeff Rooker, a junior minister at DEFRA, is of a different opinion.
Speaking in the House of Lords he said: "Badger-to-cattle transmission is
heavy. It accounts for 70-80 per cent [of] cases."

[4] Ireland: badger cull policy discussed

Badger cull has desired effect in Ireland
-----------------------------------------
The incidence of bovine TB in the Republic of Ireland continues to decline,
as the department of agriculture in Dublin presses on with its cull of
infected badgers. A government spokeswoman explained that, even though
there had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of
testing had increased substantially following the opening of a new
laboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also
improved. "With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there
are so many pieces that go together," she said. "It's best to look at 5
year trends and that shows a steady fall in TB."

For example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003
had dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though
last year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6
per cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.

The Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in
containing the disease. "Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test
provides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and
GB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem."

In New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the
common vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that
had been taken out.

Badger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is
only triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study
implicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman
insisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely
to reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a
vaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no
problem with perturbation. "It seems our badger populations are quite
different," she said. "They have different diets, different reproduction,
and different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less
territorial."

The government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the
agricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out
about 2 thirds of the badgers in that area. About half of these were TB
infected.

Farmers contribute to the cost of the programme with a statutory levy on
milk sales, and on cattle slaughtered or exported.

[Additional information on the recent bovine tuberculosis developments in
England, which -- according to available science-based information -- is
directly related to the infection in badgers, can be found at
<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4340286.ece>.

DEFRA's explanatory information is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm>.

The number of new outbreaks in cattle during 2007, as reported to the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health), was: England -- 3153(!); Wales --
902; Scotland -- 58. Updated information on possible cases of human
_Mycobacterium bovis_ infections in the various parts of the UK would be
appreciated.

According to OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database)
interface data, bovine tuberculosis was present in the Netherlands during
2005 but no quantitative data were disclosed. Reportedly, the disease was
absent during the 1st half of 2006; no information is available for the 2nd
half of 2006 or for 2007.

OIE's WAHID data on new outbreaks in Belgium during the previous 2 years
are the following: 2006 -- 7; 2007 -- 5. From a reliable source we have
obtained the following unofficial information: "A farm in Belgium, just
across the German border, went down with TB last month [June 2008].
Allegedly, 22 cows out of 70 tested positive on the skin test."
Confirmation (or, it is to be hoped, denial) of the information above from
official sources would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
