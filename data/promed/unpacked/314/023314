With regard to the issue of the political nature of global warming and
health, the political issue is whether warming is occurring, and that
clearly is the case. Denial of this has now become an issue of propaganda
and politics, and this has been nicely documented in numerous discussions.
However, the effects of warming on health, vector distribution, and
pathogen distribution remains an issue of legitimate scientific debate, and
that is the focus of the SCIENCE article.
Two issues of THE LANCET this month have articles of interest to
ProMED-mail subscribers. One (See Working Group on Public Health and
Fossil-Fuel Combustion, Short-term improvements in public health from
global-climate policies on fossil-fuel combustion: an interim report,
Lancet 1997 (Nov 8);350:1341-49) is a model of short term reductions in
combustion and the immediate and sustainable positive effects on human
health; The November 15th issue, (Bouma MJ, Kovats RS, Goubet SA, Cox J St
H, Haines A. Global assessment of El Nino's disaster burden, Lancet
1997;350:1435-38)
emphasizes the tremendous magnitude of natural disasters associated with
ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) but leaves un addressed the issue that
epidemics are themselves natural disasters (as Nancy Lewis and I have
argued Lewis ND, Mayer JD. Disease as natural hazard. PROGRESS IN HUMAN
GEOGRAPHY 1988; 16:15-33).
Finally, an easily missed but very important Letter to the Editor in the
Nov. 8 issue of Lancet (Hogg RS, Anis A, Weber AE, O'Shaughnessy MV,
Schechter MT. Triple-combination antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan
Africa. Lancet 1997;350:1406) describes the results of a model developed by
the authors which demonstrates that triple combination therapy in
sub-Saharan Africa would alone constitute 8.3% of the GNP in the area
(variable by country), a very high cost for this one portion of one sector
of the economies of the region.
