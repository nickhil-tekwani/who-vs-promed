["Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic, arthropod-borne viral disease important in domesticated ruminants. This disease is characterized by high mortality rates in young animals and abortions in pregnant ruminants. Rift Valley fever is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Epidemics occur in this region when heavy rainfalls cause infected mosquito eggs to hatch, and large numbers of susceptible animals are present. Rift Valley fever first appeared outside Africa in 2000, when outbreaks were reported in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

Rift Valley fever epizootics are often accompanied by human disease. Many human cases are caused by occupational exposure to blood and tissues from infected animals, but mosquitoborne transmission can cause epidemics. The most common form of the disease is a self-limiting, flu-like illness; however, ocular disease and rare cases of fatal hemorrhagic fever also occur."

For the above and additional background information, please refer to the fact sheet "Rift Valley fever", prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf.

In May 2010, Botswana reported its 1st case of Rift Valley fever (RVF). The event was resolved on 29 Nov 2010. One outbreak was reported, this outbreak was situated in the Gaborone province (southeastern corner of Botswana, and 15 km (9.3 mi) from the South African border). See detailed information and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000009983_20101129_172841.pdf
