Some comments on the above postings are in order.
To my knowledge, the earliest reported recognition of this variant is in
the UK in 1984 (Threlfall et al. 1994). The proportion of _Salmonella
typhimurium_ isolated from humans that were this variant [DT104 began
rising rapidly in the UK in the 1990's but the data does not appear to show
that the total number of _S. typhimurium_ isolated from humans increased
significantly during this time. This suggests that this variant was
displacing previously dominant strains rather than superinfecting
previously occupied niches or occupying new ones.
With regard to it being "widespread", that is true if the term "widespread"
is intended to mean that isolates appear from animal and human sources
widely distributed in a geographic sense but it is not if "widespread" is
intended to mean that the infection is highly prevalent in these sources.
Our evidence suggests that it is not, at least in this region. In this
region, this variant increased as a proportion of all _S. typhimurium_
isolates from both humans and livestock that were acquired by the public
health laboratory and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory the during
mid-1990's but the total number _S. typhimurium_ isolates has not changed
appreciably from prior to that time. This variant was present in humans in
this region before 1997 but, because most isolates are discarded after a
year or less due to the lack of storage space, clearly defining when it
first appeared is not possible. We just happen to have some human isolates
that date from 1994 (Besser et al. 1997).
