COTONOU, 24 Sep 1998 - Three people died of cholera blamed on the
flooding, which has affected the area since July, officials reported by
telephone from Kandi, some 500 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of
Cotonou.
Cases of yellow fever have also been reported.
[Yellow fever does not normally follow floods, since the mosquitoes
which carry yellow fever breed in small containers or tree-holes, not
in pools left by receding flood waters. Perhaps the cases are really
hepatitis A, which is spread by contaminated drinking water -Mod.JW
