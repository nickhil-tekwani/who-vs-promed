Bluetongue in France in the island of Corsica
See also: 21 Nov 2003, 7 Nov 2003, 31 Oct 2003
(Date of previous outbreak of bluetongue in France reported to the
OIE: December 2003).
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 14 Sep 2004 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food
(DGAL), Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs,
Paris:
Date of the report: 14 Sep 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 18 Aug 2004.
Date of laboratory confirmation: 13 Sep 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location/No. of outbreaks
Corse-du-Sud department, Porto Vecchio district/ 1
Corse-du-Sud department, Cauro district/ 1
Corse-du-Sud department, Sartene district/ 1
Haute-Corse department, Prunelli-di-Casacconi district/ 1
Total 4
Number of animals in the outbreaks:
Outbreak: Porto Vecchio / Cauro / Sartene / Prunelli-di-Casacconi
species: ovi / ovi / ovi / ovi
susceptible: 363 / 23 / 150 / 283
cases: 20 / 1 / 4 / 1
deaths: 2 / 0 / 0 / 2
destroyed: ... / ... / ... / ...
slaughtered: ... / ... / ... / ...
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: LERPAZ-AFSSA(1), Maisons-Alfort.
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- isolation of the bluetongue orbivirus (BTV) on cell culture;
- PCR (polymerase chain reaction);
- virus neutralisation test.
C. Causal agent: virus serotyping identified serotype 16 (not
previously identified in Corsica) in 3 outbreaks and serotype 4
(previously identified in 2003) in one outbreak.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: likely to have spread from
infected zones due to vector circulation.
B. Mode of spread: possible spread into the districts where the
vector (_Culicoides imicola_) is still active.
C. Other epidemiological details:
- flocks infected with serotype 16 had been vaccinated against BTV 2/4;
- the outbreak caused by serotype 4 (Cauro district) involves sheep
introduced from mainland France and not subjected to the vaccination
protocol against serotypes 2 and 4 implemented during the 2003/2004
winter vaccination campaign.
Control measures:
The French Authorities wish to conduct as soon as possible the
eradication process for the outbreaks located in Corsica, by setting
up a series of appropriate sanitary measures, including the following:
- the setting up of an emergency unit;
- a ban on the movement of ruminants within a 20-km radius around the
outbreaks;
- quarantine of the affected premises;
- euthanising of sick animals;
- the setting up of vector control measures;
- strengthened clinical monitoring of farms at risk (in the
neighbourhood of the outbreaks).
The planned vaccination schedule will comprise 2 veterinary
interventions at an interval of 3-4 weeks. The 1st vaccination will
be conducted with an attenuated vaccine against serotype 2 and a
monovalent vaccine against serotype 16. The 2nd will include the 2nd
primary vaccination injection of attenuated vaccine against serotype
2 and the injection of a monovalent vaccine against serotype 4.
The animal movement restrictions that have been in place for the past
3 years are being maintained (2). These measures are aimed in
particular at prohibiting any shipment of live animals, domestic or
wild, of susceptible bovine, ovine or caprine species, or their ova,
embryos or semen, from the island of Corsica to the mainland of
France, to other European Union Member States or to third countries.
Within the framework of exemptions for the slaughter of animals
granted by European Commission Decision No. 2003/828/EC of 25
November 2003, no shipments of Corsican animals to mainland France
have taken place since 31 Mar 2003.
According to Chapter 2.2.13. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
the French Authorities believe that the island status of Corsica and
its remoteness from mainland France (160 km) allow the Departments of
mainland France to maintain their bluetongue-free status.
Furthermore, a serological surveillance programme will be carried out
to guarantee the absence of seroconversion in mainland France.

[Corsica has been infected since 2001. Mainland France, of course,
maintains a disease-free status. As the reports below indicate, many
of the major islands in the Mediterranean are infected with various
Bluetongue strains. - Mod.PC]
