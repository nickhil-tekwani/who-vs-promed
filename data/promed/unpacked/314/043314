A 2nd case of suspected anthrax in a 16-year-old teenager was recorded in Flondora village, Manoleasa commune [in Botoşani county], on [Tue 13 Jun 2017], by Prefect Dan Slincuat, a meeting of the Botoșani County Emergency Committee. According to him, the young woman is the daughter of a 46-year-old suspected of anthrax, who was hospitalized at Mavromati Emergency County Hospital on [Fri 9 Jun 2017].

Epidemiologist Irina Alecu from the Public Health Directorate mentioned that the condition of both patients is good, and they are in the hospital under specialized treatment, and responding well.

Anthrax is curable with proper therapy and treatment. "New information came to us yesterday [12 Jun 2017], when the Infectious Diseases Hospital announced that it was a man who had shown signs of anthrax. Therefore, we alerted all the units according to the procedures. We went to the territory to assess the family and contacts. The daughter of the [owner] was hospitalized yesterday [12 Jun 2017] because she presented a lesion in her hand," said Irina Alecu.

Health authorities await the results of the laboratory tests carried out at the [Cantacuzino National Institute of Research-Development for Microbiology and Immunology in Bucharest] to confirm or rule out the anthrax cases from Flondora.

Representatives of the Public Health Directorate (DSP), Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety (DSVSA), and the Emergency Situations Inspectorate (ISU) went to Flondora on Monday afternoon [12 Jun 2017] to take the 1st steps for investigating cases.

The DSVSA Director, Minodora Vasiliu, said there was an opportunity for anthrax to be contacted from a dead cattle. Veterinarians have launched an investigation that aims, among other things, to sample both the dead animal and the other 22 cattle that the man suspected of having contracted anthrax has in his household.

The last 2 cases of anthrax were recorded in Botoşani County in 2009.

[In Romania there are several cases of anthrax every year, but the cutaneous form of the disease is not a very serious life-threatening form, as is pulmonary anthrax caused by inhalation of the spores of the bacillus," said Alexandru Rafila on behalf of the Minister of Health. "Anthrax is not totally unusual in Romania. Generally there are several cases transmitted every year through contact with the diseased animal, that may lead to skin lesions that are treatable, and do not present such public health problems as the pulmonary or digestive forms of anthrax," explained Rafila.

A Botoşani farmer is suspected of having anthrax (cutaneous form), but for confirmation, biological samples were sent to the Cantacuzino Institute.

"It's a Botoşani farmer who has several cattle that have been vaccinated against anthrax," he says. "The local veterinary authority makes checks, and wants to see if there are any affected animals." The person has 3 skin lesions suggesting they might be anthrax, but have not been confirmed so far. Biological samples were sent to the Cantacuzino Institute for confirmation," the minister's adviser said.

Rafila specified that the farmer is currently under treatment.

If the farmer has 3 skin lesions it would have involved extensive handling of the carcass. It would appear that the herd had been vaccinated at some time, whether earlier this year (2017) or last is not clear. While a regular sporadic problem in the 1990s, usually of sheep, goats, and cattle, latterly it is infrequent with many years with no outbreaks. Unfortunately agricultural memories can be fragile and folk can forget what it looks like and handle a carcass foolishly. We will have to wait and see what comes of the hospital laboratory cultures, and from the veterinary investigation.

Our thanks to Sabine for noting this outbreak and organising a translation. - Mod.MHJ]
