>A couple of recent submissions, one on this thread ... have implied that a
well adapted pathogen will not kill its host. This is, I feel, something of
an overstatement of the case.

Doesn't the example of smallpox prove once and for all that pathogens can be
lethal to the members of host species?

There is no necessary and universal relationship between virulence and
Darwinian fitness of a pathogen. The outcome of natural selection depends on
conditions for survival and reproduction in the host in different organs,
how pathogen feeding affects the host, how it evades the body's defenses,
time available for transmission and mode of transmission.
Therefore conclusions can only be reached on a case by case basis,
identifying the opposing selection pressures and available genetic variation.

[This thread is getting to be more and more like a semi-somnolent
postprandial Senior Common Room discussion. If it doesn't develop either
some realistic death & destruction for the originally proposed species or
hypothesis rejection, I will cut the thread. AHEAD-Mod MHJ]
