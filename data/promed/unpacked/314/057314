Sask. anthrax outbreak forces farms under quarantine
-----------------------------------------------
Saskatchewan's worst ever anthrax outbreak has led to 113 suspected cases
in livestock and 76 confirmed deaths.
At least 28 herds in Saskatchewan are under quarantine after 113 suspicious
animal deaths in connection with the worst anthrax outbreak in the
province's recorded history. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is
continuing to vaccinate all animals on farms that have tested positive for
anthrax located east of Saskatoon from its reserve supply, but some
veterinarians in private practice have run out of vaccine.
"This is an area that doesn't typically see anthrax, so veterinarians don't
typically have it in stock," said Dr. Sandra Stephens, a Saskatoon-based
veterinary program specialist with CFIA, adding there is no shortage of
vaccine with the manufacturer, only a challenge of getting it to the area
quickly enough.
More than half of the quarantined farms have been retested and confirmed
for anthrax at the CFIA's laboratory in Lethbridge, Alta.
Most farms under quarantine raise cattle, but operations with horses,
swine, bison and white-tailed deer have also been quarantined, Stephens
said. Farmers who have lost animals to anthrax may qualify for an indemnity
of CAD 500 [USD 441] a head for cattle and CAD 350 [309] per horse. The
indemnity is available to encourage farmers to report anthrax cases and
properly dispose of carcasses.

Farmers struggle to halt anthrax outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Thin ribbons of smoke curling into the northern Saskatchewan sky have
become the marker of death for farmers battling to contain an anthrax
outbreak that may have lain dormant in the soil since wild bison roamed the
land generations ago.
In the 2 weeks since anthrax was discovered in a dead bull in Melfort, 136
animals on 21 properties have died of the disease. The Canadian Food
Inspection Agency said there is no way to know the extent of contamination,
which emerged for the 1st time around Melfort after spring rains saturated
the ground and brought the spores to the surface. But it may be the most
widespread anthrax outbreak in Saskatchewan since CFIA started keeping
records 25 years ago, said Dr. Sandra Stephens, a Saskatoon-based
veterinarian with the agency.
A vaccination campaign is being hamstrung by a lack of vaccine, and farmers
are roaming their pastures trying to identify sick animals before the
fast-acting anthrax kills them.
Livestock anthrax does not spread between living animals or through the
air, but Dr. Stephens said spores could be on any property that was
flooded, and could have been there for decades. "This could be a problem in
a very wide area. We could potentially see outbreaks through the rest of
summer," Ms. Stephens said.
So far, anthrax has killed cattle, horses, bison, sheep, goats and
whitetail deer, sometimes in a matter of hours. The CFIA says the outbreak
does not pose a significant human health threat. No animals from the
quarantined properties were sent to slaughter, and livestock anthrax rarely
affects people, an agency bulletin states.
The outbreak is centered on Melfort, a town of about 6000 people 175 km
northeast of Saskatoon. Most of the affected premises lie to the northwest
toward Prince Albert, which is 75 km away, while 2 properties are toward
the town of Wynyard, which lies 130 km to the south. There are about 180
000 head of cattle in the affected area.
Cattle farmer Ken Tegstrom has lost 4 bulls on his 200-head property 35 km
northwest of Melfort and now spends his days roaming his pastures to check
for early signs of illness. But the increasing summer heat is making that
job even more difficult as the animals become docile. "You drive around
inspecting your animals, and you expect the worst all the time. You see
smoke 2 to 3 miles down the road, and you know your neighbor is burning
another animal. It's quite depressing," Mr. Tegstrom said in a phone interview.
Carcasses of infected animals must be disposed of quickly and the
contamination contained to prevent other animals from coming into contact
with anthrax-laden bodily fluids. Mr. Tegstrom said that so many animals
died last week, farmers had no time to bury or burn them. Instead, the CFIA
decontaminated the carcasses by dousing them in formaldehyde and then
covered them with tarpaulins for later disposal. "The odor is a bad part
and hard to deal with. It's harder to see and more stressful than getting
rid of them quickly," he said. Farmers are now banding together to provide
wood for the pyres, he said.
The Tegstrom family has worked that property since the 1940s, and Mr.
Tegstrom said he had never seen anything like the current situation. "It's
very stressful. The whole community is exhausted. Anthrax is going to be
something we never forget," he said.
All livestock -- more than 5000 animals -- have been vaccinated in a 10-km
radius around the anthrax-positive properties to create a buffer zone, said
veterinarian Eldon Pederson, co-owner of the Mohawk Animal Clinic in
Melfort. But as more properties test positive, he said vaccine supplies
have run out. He has 11 500 doses on order, and a neighboring clinic is
waiting for 6000. "We still have people [sic] in that 6-mile zone that are
not vaccinated yet," Dr. Pederson said. "There's urgency all right,
especially for animals close to the outbreak. Animals at high risk need to
be vaccinated again in 2 or 3 weeks after the initial dose."
It takes about 8 days for the vaccine to take effect, during which time
further deaths may occur. Because anthrax was not known to be in the area,
animals have not been routinely vaccinated against it, but Dr. Pederson
said that is likely to change now.

As of 12 Jul 2006 at 12:00 noon MST, there are 30 premises that have
regulatory controls applied to them for the purpose of investigating an
outbreak of anthrax in northeastern Saskatchewan. Four Rural Municipalities
are involved at this time. A positive diagnosis on samples submitted for
diagnostic testing at either a provincial or federal veterinary laboratory
has been received for 23 of these premises. Samples from 6 of these
premises are still under test, and samples from one premises has tested
negative.
137 animals on the 30 premises being investigated have died, including 113
cattle, 3 horses, one pig, 12 bison and 8 White tail deer.
Carcasses have been disposed of by burning or deep burial using methods
aimed at minimizing/preventing environmental contamination with anthrax spores.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has vaccinated 1449 animals on these 30
premises. Private practitioners in the area have vaccinated approximately
5000 animals in the surrounding area; this surrounding area also
experienced flooding and soil saturation this spring [2006].

[Many thanks to Sandra for her comments. I spoke with her this morning, and
she provided some background information. This epidemic seems to be in
relation to a large swampy area which has drainage ditches. But the recent
heavy rains have resulted in extensive flooding, and this is believed to
have initiated the outbreaks. Canada Cooperative Wildlife is checking on
wildlife deaths in parallel with the veterinary responses; see above for
bison and white tailed deer. The affected area is within the northerly
border of the Canadian prairie black (chernozem steppe) soils, which are an
ideal environment for spore survival. This means that efficient carcass
disposal is very important. - Mod.MHJ]
