Rockland county health officials on [Thu 9 May 2019] announced new measles exposure sites in Nanuet and Monsey. Anyone who visited the locations [see list at the source URL above] or used taxis at the times listed last week [week of 28 Apr 2019] may have been exposed to measles.

Jewish religious and political leaders, including the mayor of New Square, have supported vaccinations. The outbreak began in New Square and has primarily affected the Orthodox Jewish community in Spring Valley and Monsey.

The county, private physicians and health centers have administered more than 20 000 vaccinations since the outbreak began.

Local hospitals have taken measures to protect patients, including having 1st responders communicate to the hospital via an app that there is a potential measles case and screening or restricting visitors.

Rockland County Executive Ed Day has declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak. It is the 2nd declaration after the 1st, banning unvaccinated minors countywide from indoor public spaces, was struck down by the courts.

The current declaration targets those with measles or exposed to the virus in the affected areas and does not affect those with religious or medical exemptions.

State lawmakers are looking to end religious exemptions to vaccinations for school-aged children.

There are an additional 466 reported measles cases in Brooklyn as o[Mon 6 May 2019], and more than 22 000 vaccinations were administered there. These outbreaks were traced to Israel, where an outbreak has made more than 3900 people sick and resulted in at least 2 deaths.

As of 3 May 2019, there were 764 cases in 23 states in the US in the largest outbreak since 1994, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles was eliminated in the US in 2000, but outbreaks can occur when travelers bring measles from other countries.

[2] USA: CIDRAP summary
Date: Mon 13 May 2019

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/us-measles-cases-pass-800-track-record-year


With 75 more measles cases reported in United States over the past week, the number of infections topped 800, putting this year [2019] on pace to pass the total for 1994, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its weekly update.

Maryland added to outbreak list, earlier outbreaks add more cases

The new cases boost the current US total to 839 from 23 states, with many of the cases linked to 10 outbreaks in 7 different states: New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Georgia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

The modern record of 963 cases occurred in 1994, the year the federally funded Vaccines for Children program began, an event that stabilized the number people vaccinated against the disease and set the stage for measles elimination in 2000.

Added to the outbreak list this week is Maryland. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) said 5 cases have been confirmed this year as of 9 May 2019. It said cases have been localized to a small geographic area involving 3 zip codes. 2 are centered in Baltimore and one is in Pikesville, a suburb just northwest of the city

Of the 75 new cases, more than half appear to be linked to large outbreaks in New York City and New York's Rockland county, both centered in Orthodox Jewish communities.

In its most recent update, NYC Health said as of 6 May 2019, 466 cases have been confirmed in Brooklyn and Queens since September, an increase of 43 from the last report. Roughly half of the illnesses are in children ages 1-4 years old.

The hardest hit area are the city's Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods, and as of 6 May 2019, 22 833 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine have been administered to people younger than 18 years old.

Meanwhile, New York's Rockland county said as of 10 May 2019, tests had confirmed 225 cases, an increase of 10 since its last report. Among infected people, 79.9% had not received any MMR vaccine doses and 4.9% had received one. Vaccination status was unknown for 12.1%. Children make up just over 80% of cases, with those ages 1-3 and ages 7-18 in the most-affected groups.

In California, where 4 outbreaks have been reported this year, 44 cases have been confirmed as of 8 May 2019, including 30 that are part of outbreaks in Butte county, Los Angeles county, and Sacramento county.

Toronto probes two travel-linked cases
--------------------------------------
In developments elsewhere, Toronto health officials are investigating 2 lab-confirmed cases in adults that are both travel related, according to a statement from Toronto Public Health.

The department said the public may have been exposed at several locations, including Pearson International Airport on 5 May and 8 May 2019, the former involving a flight that departed for the United Kingdom and the latter an incoming flight from the UK. Other locations included a restaurant and the Toronto Zoo.

The measles outbreak in the Angolan province of Lunda Sul has caused 47 deaths since the start of the year [2019], among almost 1300 registered cases, Angola's national director of Public Health told Lusa today [9 May 2019].

Isilda Neves [Director, Program in Technical Assistance to the MOH] told Lusa that a vaccination campaign to identify children who are not yet immunized against the disease, will start at the weekend [11 May 2019], lasting for 10 days.

Along with this campaign, the vaccination intensification in the districts of Saurimo, capital of Lunda Sul, and in the other municipalities of the province, has been underway since the 2nd week of April [2019].

"At the end of the week we are going to make a big intervention: We are training the teams to go all out. We have at least 100 teams, each with 4 elements -- 2 coaches, one support team for the mobilization, and another to register the vaccinated children," she said.

The campaign, according to the national public health official, takes place first in Saurimo, followed by the remaining 3 municipalities in the province.

"Since the beginning of the year [2019], there were 1297 cases and 47 deaths, mostly in Saurimo," added Isilda Neves.

Health authorities are trying to control the situation, in which more than 90% of cases are being registered in children who have not been vaccinated, she said.

"One of the problems we identified is that many children who have passed the age of measles vaccination have not been vaccinated. Since there are a large number of children in the same household, we are also finding cases in children under 9 months and this is our concern too," she said.

Madagascar: humanitarian situation report, quarter 1 - 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- Madagascar is facing an unprecedented measles epidemic due to low measles vaccination coverage (58 per cent nationwide). As of 3 Apr 2019 there were 122 840 registered cases, and 1233 reported deaths. The measles epidemic affects 107 out of 114 districts across all 22 regions of Madagascar.

- For the 1st quarter of 2019, UNICEF vaccinated over 1.9 million children under 5 years against measles. UNICEF also prepositioned emergency stocks consisting of medicines and basic equipment in 5 targeted regions.

- The nutritional status of the population of southern Madagascar remains precarious. The October 2018 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) results revealed that 970 000 people would be in a food security crisis or emergency between November 2018 and March 2019. From January to March 2019, a total of 6767 severely malnourished children were treated in the UNICEF programme. While, 17 365 mothers were trained in nutrition screening techniques.

- More than 59 166 people gained access to safe water through ongoing water trucking supported by UNICEF and the rehabilitation of 129 boreholes and construction of six new boreholes.

Situation overview and humanitarian needs
-----------------------------------------
Measles
-------
The measles outbreak, which began on 3 Sep 2018, has resulted in 122 840 cases as of 3 Apr 2019. It is a nationwide epidemic, with cases reported across all 22 regions in Madagascar. The epidemic has a national attack rate which is currently 33 042 cases per 1 million inhabitants; demonstrating a high rate of spread. Of concern, measles cases have been exported to Comoros and La Reunion. This epidemic is occurring in a context of poor immunization performance. 2/3 of cases are either unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. There have been 1233 deaths reported among the people with measles. Of these, 640 deaths have been notified in health facilities, and 593 at the community level, of which 191 are measles related and 402 non-classified by the community agents.

In Madagascar, there are basic measures to combat measles as well as good testing expertise, particularly through the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM). However, due to an overall weak health system, the country does not have the capacity to react to health emergencies of this scale without additional international support.
