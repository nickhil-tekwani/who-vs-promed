A 25-year-old nurse is currently being treated at the Hasan Sadikin
Hospital here for bird flu-like symptoms. She was admitted to the
hospital which has been treating a number of bird flu patients on
Thursday evening [1 Jun 2006].
"When she arrived at this hospital last night, her body temperature
was very high, namely 39.6 degrees Celsius [103 F], but now it has
decreased to 37 degrees Celsius [98.6 F]," Hadi Jusuf, head of the
bird flu medical treatment unit of the hospital, said here on Friday
[2 Jun 2006]. The hospital was planning to send the patient's blood
sample to the laboratory of the Health Development and Research Body
in Jakarta on Friday [2 Jun 2006]. The result of the laboratory test
is expected within the next 3 days, he said. "We could not confirm
[that she had contracted H5N1 avian influenza], although she had
earlier had contacts with 18-year-old and 10-year-old siblings, who
died of avian influenza recently," he said.
The ailing nurse had never had contact with poultry, but she had
treated [her?] sibling at Ujungberung Hospital, where she worked as a
nurse. If she is confirmed of being infected by bird flu virus, it
would be the first case of human-to-human transmission of the virus
[i.e. transmission from patient to nurse - Mod.CP], he said.
Meanwhile, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) announced recently
that international health investigators were finding no evidence that
efficient transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
has emerged from [i.e. spread beyond] a family cluster of cases in
Indonesia's province of North Sumatra.
As of 29 May 2006, according to the WHO the H5N1 virus has caused 127
deaths in 224 cases worldwide since it was detected in humans in late
2003. In all but a handful of cases, humans have become infected
through direct contact with ailing birds, their feces or blood.
Indonesia has detected 48 cases of H5N1, 31 of those appearing since
January 2006, and ending in 36 fatalities.

[2] Indonesia - Jakarta (Pamulang)

A 7-year-old Indonesian girl who died this week has shown up positive
for bird flu in local tests, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said on
Friday [2 Jun 2006]. The girl's samples have been sent to a World
Health Organisation-accredited laboratory in Hong Kong for
confirmation. Local test results are not considered definitive.
The girl from the Pamulang area on the outskirts of Jakarta died on
Thursday [1 Jun 2006] on the way to Sulianti Saroso hospital after
being treated for 2 days in a hospital in South Jakarta, said Health
Ministry spokeswoman Lily Sulistyowati. Sulianti Saroso hospital is
the designated avian influenza centre in Jakarta. "She had trouble
breathing and had lost consciousness when she was admitted to the
hospital," Sulistyowati said.
Two days before the girl died, her 10-year-old brother also died
after suffering flu-like symptoms, but health officials did not
manage to get his samples, she said. The family reported that a
number of chickens near their house died before the children went
sick, she added. Sulistyowati said the children's parents and their 2
siblings were taking Tamiflu after suffering similar flu-like
symptoms, but they refused to be admitted to a hospital.
Indonesia has seen a steady rise in its number of human infections
and deaths since its first known outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in late
2003. It has infected 48 Indonesians and killed 36 of them. Avian
influenza remains essentially an animal disease but climbing human
deaths have put many countries around the world on alert for fear it
may mutate into one that could pass easily among people and trigger a
pandemic, killing millions.
Indonesia attracted international attention in May 2006 when the
virus killed as many as 7 members of a single family in North
Sumatra. Experts said there could have been limited human-to-human
transmission in this cluster case. But they stressed genetic analyses
of the virus have not shown all of the traits that are known so far
to allow it to spread easily among people.
On Thursday [1 Jun 2006], workers culled around 1600 chickens in a
village in Tasikmalaya, West Java where a 15-year-old boy died of
bird flu on 30 May. The boy tested positive for bird flu in local
tests but the WHO has yet to confirm the case.

[These 2 new suspected, but not yet independently confirmed, human
cases of avian influenza are additional to the avian influenza totals
for Indonesia of 48 cases and 36 deaths cited in the above reports.
The deceased 7-year-old girl in the second report may identify
another potential cluster, since her brother died also of a flu-like
illness although he was never tested for H5N1 virus infection.

influenza web site (<http://www.who.or.id/eng/php/index.php>) showing
