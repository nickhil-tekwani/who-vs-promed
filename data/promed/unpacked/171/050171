Mango farms in Kintampo North [area of Brong-Ahafo] have been massively attacked by mango bacterial black spot disease, raising fears of poor harvest. The farmers say they do not have the financial strength to undertake mass spraying exercise. The area has become one of the major spots for mango plantation in Ghana. A total of 240 farmers are engaged in the cultivation of the grafted mangos covering 3000 acres.

[A farmer] said his 90 acres [36 hectares], which used to produce at least 150 tonnes of mango, gave him less than 50 tonnes this [2016/17] season due to the disease. An economic assessment by the Agric Department at Kintampo in 2015 showed the cost of the fruit loss to farmers was estimated at [approximately 4.5 million USD] at the time.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_. It was 1st described from Africa but is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90 per cent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging. Symptoms include small, irregular or star shaped, water-soaked lesions on fruit, which soon become raised and may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise.

Leaves also show small water soaked lesions, which become angular and raised, increase in size and may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species) which forms flat, rounded lesions. Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

The bacteria live as epiphytes but occur in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. They are essentially wound pathogens, but can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. BBS can be prevalent in both low and high rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

The disease is spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, and bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.

Recently, the pathogen was also reported as the cause of black spot on cashew in Ghana's neighbor, Burkina Faso (ProMED-mail post 20160601.4255664).
