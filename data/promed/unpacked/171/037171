Councilor David Ekod has said that about 20 000 animals have been killed by
a disease in Kerio Location in the past 6 months. Last month [April 2006],
he lost 300 goats to the disease, which local people have named lojuro.
Keiyo district livestock development officer Christopher Ajele said the
district steering group was aware and were carrying out investigations.
The area veterinary officer regretted that there was no drug to treat the
animals, but he suspected the disease to be pneumonia.

[Keiyo is one of the 18 districts in Kenya's Rift Valley province; Kerio is
a valley and the longest river in Kenya.
Strikingly similar information concerning goat mortality in Keiyo was
published in October 2000 (see 20001019.1806). It included the following
data: "Infected goats cough uncontrollably before succumbing to the disease
within 10 hours ... preliminary tests established the disease is linked to
the contagious caprine pleuropneumonia. However, more tests are to be
carried out."
See also moderator's commentary in the said posting.
Contagious caprine pneuopneumonia (CCPP), a severe disease of goats caused
by _Mycoplasma capricolum_ subspecies _capripneumoniae (Mccp)_, is endemic
in Kenya, where some vaccination is reportedly applied.
Additional information, if available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
