Horse and pet owners are at more risk of contracting an infection
spreading across the country than the rest of the population, a
leading veterinarian researcher says.
Scott Weese, associate professor at Ontario Veterinary College,
University of Guelph, started looking at community associated
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_(CA-MRSA) after a
cluster of cases was found in horses in Ontario.
A human strain of the bacteria was found in the horses, meaning the
infection initially was passed from people to horses, Weese said.
"But now it moves between horses and people. People working with
horses have a higher prevalence of carrying this bug," he said.
Surveys have found that about 14 percent of equine veterinarians are
carrying the bacteria and more than 10 percent of people working with
horses are carrying the bug. Almost all have the unusual strain found
in horses, Weese said.
Fortunately, much of the time the bacteria will be carried in the
nose and will not cause problems for either horses or humans, he
said. "But if the horses are carrying it, they are at greater risk of
infection, and there is a risk of transmitting it to people. It would
be skin and soft-tissue infections, similar to what happens in the
community," he said.
MRSA has also been found in domestic pets, such as dogs, cats and
rabbits, but, unlike horses, the strain of bacteria mirrors whatever
is found in people. "It's not picky about its host," Weese said.
"We started finding the strain in animals in California a year and a
bit ago, and it moved to Canada about a year ago," he said.
The bug can easily move among pets, people and other animals, Weese
said. That means pets can act as a reservoir of infection, and
doctors treating people with MRSA should also be looking at the pets,
particularly if people in a household are becoming re-infected, he said.
Unless infection sets in, the bacteria do not seem to stay in animals
for long, Weese said. "If you can keep them from getting re-infected,
by separating them from infected animals and humans, they get rid of
it themselves," he said.
In a report last week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal,
health officials warned that the organism is poised to sweep across
the country.
Vancouver Island Health Authority officials say that Victoria appears
to be the epicenter of the countrywide epidemic. Victoria already has
seen 800 cases of CA-MRSA, and its cousin, hospital-acquired MRSA,
since April 2006. While HA-MRSA is resistant to many antimicrobials,
the good news is that CA-MRSA responds to several types of common
treatment. Typically, it is seen in high-risk groups like the
homeless and drug users, but increasingly it is being seen in the
military and sports teams.
Routine infection control, prudent use of antibiotics and hand
washing are the best protection, Weese said. "Hand washing is
critical between touching horses."

[Indeed, in the past few years, Dr. Weese has published a number of
papers regarding CA-MRSA in horses and humans. Among them are these
citations with their corresponding abstracts:
1. Weese JS, Rousseau J, Traub-Dargatz JL, et al:
Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
horses and humans who work with horses. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2005;226: 580-83.
Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of nasal colonization with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in horses and
horse personnel.
Population: 972 horses and 107 personnel from equine farms in
Ontario, Canada and New York state.
Procedure: Nasal swab specimens were collected from horses and humans
on farms with (targeted surveillance) and without (non-targeted
surveillance) a history of MRSA colonization or infection in horses
during the preceding year. Selective culture for MRSA was performed.
Isolates were typed via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and
antibiograms were determined.
Results: MRSA was isolated from 46 of 972 (4.7 percent) horses (0/581
via non-targeted surveillance and 46/391 -- 12 percent -- via
targeted surveillance). Similarly, MRSA was isolated from 14 of 107
(13 percent) humans (2/41 -- 5 percent -- from non-targeted
surveillance and 12/66 -- 18 percent -- from targeted surveillance).
All isolates were subtypes of Canadian epidemic MRSA-5, an uncommon
strain in humans. All isolates were resistant to at least one
antimicrobial class in addition to beta-lactams. On all farms with
colonized horses, at least one human was colonized with an
indistinguishable subtype. For horses, residing on a farm that housed
more than 20 horses was the only factor significantly associated with
MRSA colonization. For humans, regular contact with more than 20
horses was the only identified risk factor.
Conclusion: Results confirm a reservoir of colonized horses on a
variety of farms in Ontario and New York and provide evidence that
one MRSA strain is predominantly involved in MRSA colonization in
horses and humans that work with horses.
2. Weese JS, Rousseau J, Willey BM, et al: Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in horses at a veterinary teaching hospital:
frequency, characterization, and association with clinical disease. J
Vet Intern Med. 2006;20: 182-86.
Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is an emerging
equine pathogen. To attempt to control nosocomial and zoonotic
transmission, an MRSA screening program was established for all
horses admitted to the Ontario Veterinary College Veterinary Teaching
Hospital, whereby nasal screening swabs were collected at admission,
weekly during hospitalization, and at discharge.
MRSA was isolated from 120 (5.3 percent) of 2283 horses: 61 (50.8
percent) at the time of admission, 53 (44.2 percent) during
hospitalization, and 6 from which the origin was unclear because an
admission swab had not been collected.
Clinical infections attributable to MRSA were present or developed in
14 (11.7 percent) of 120 horses. The overall rate of
community-associated colonization was 27 per 1000 admissions. Horses
colonized at admission were more likely to develop clinical MRSA
infection than those not colonized at admission (OR 38.9, 95 percent
CI 9.49-160, P less than 0.0001). The overall nosocomial MRSA
colonization incidence rate was 23 per 1000 admissions. The incidence
rate of nosocomial MRSA infection was at the rate of 1.8 per 1000
admissions, with an incidence density of 0.88 per 1000 patient days.
Administration of ceftiofur or aminoglycosides during hospitalization
was the only risk factor associated with nosocomial MRSA
colonization. MRSA screening of horses admitted to a veterinary
hospital was useful for identification of community-associated and
nosocomial colonization and infection and for monitoring of infection
control practices.

Staphylococcus aureus in horses and horse personnel, 2000-2002. Emerg
Infect Dis. 2005;11: 430-35.
Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infection was
identified in 2 horses treated at a veterinary hospital in 2000,
prompting a study of colonization rates of horses and associated
persons. 79 horses and 27 persons colonized or infected with MRSA
were identified from October 2000 to November 2002; most isolations
occurred in a 3-month period in 2002. 27 (34 percent) of the equine
isolates were from the veterinary hospital, while 41 (51 percent)
were from one thoroughbred farm in Ontario. 17 (63 percent) of 27
human isolates were from the veterinary hospital, and 8 (30 percent)
were from the thoroughbred farm.
13 (16 percent) horses and one (4 percent) person were clinically
infected. 96 percent of equine and 93 percent of human isolates were
subtypes of Canadian epidemic MRSA-5, spa type 7, and possessed
SCCmecIV. All tested isolates from clinical infections were negative
for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. Equine MRSA infection may
be an important emerging zoonotic and veterinary disease.
Europe (for example, Moodley A, Stegger M, Bagcigil AF, et al: spa
typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from
domestic animals and veterinary staff in the UK and Ireland. J
Antimicrob Chemother. 2006; 58: 1118-23) has also reported this
finding - Mod.LL]
