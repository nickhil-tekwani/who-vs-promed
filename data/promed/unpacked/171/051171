Georgia has officially notified OIE (Office International des Epizooties;
World Organisation for Animal Health) of 11 outbreaks of African swine
fever (ASF) in pigs. This is the 1st ever occurrence of the disease in
northern Europe [location described elsewhere as south east Europe/south
west Asia. Mod.SH].
Planning is underway to rapidly deploy an OIE/FAO/EC expert mission to Georgia.
ASF is generally prevalent and endemic in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
In Europe, ASF is still endemic in specific areas in Italy (Sardinia). No
reported outbreaks of ASF in other European countries have occurred since
1999 in Portugal.
On 17 May 2007, Georgia 1st notified the OIE of several outbreaks
attributed to porcine circovirus, which causes wasting disease in young
pigs. Tests carried out on samples submitted to the OIE Reference
Laboratory in Pirbright, United Kingdom confirmed the presence of African
swine fever virus. The source of the infection is currently under
investigation.
Classical disease control measures have been implemented by the Georgian
authorities, including the culling of animals and isolation of infected
properties. A total of 20 000 susceptible pigs from villages and private
farms were destroyed in 10 regions across the country. (See official report
of the country to the OIE at <http://www.oie.int/>).
An effective and rapid control of the outbreak will avoid ASF from
establishing a foothold and become endemic in the region.
Emerging transboundary diseases
-------------------------------
African swine fever (ASF) is a serious transboundary animal disease highly
lethal to pigs with the propensity for rapid and unanticipated
international spread and subsequent significant economic, trade and food
security consequences.
The rapid detection, notification and response in Georgia coupled with
international cooperation is crucial for the containment of spread and
eventual exclusion of this disease from the area. [For the list of OIE
reference labs, see commentary below. - Mod.AS]
The OIE continues to highlight the importance of having effective
Veterinary Services able to early detect and respond rapidly to an
unexpected event such as this. Only an effective national surveillance
system and transparency in reporting can ensure good control policies are
implemented.
Since the bluetongue outbreak in The Netherlands in August 2006, this ASF
outbreak in Georgia is the 2nd appearance of an emerging disease for
Northern Europe in a short time.
Background information
----------------------
African swine fever is a tickborne viral disease -- affecting only species
of the pig family -- which can result in very high mortalities. Infection
can occur via contact with infected ticks, and direct transmission is
important in domestic pigs, as the virus is shed in high concentration in
excretions and secretions of infected animals. The virus can be spread
through feeding with garbage containing infected meat. Specific hosts
include pigs, warthogs, bush pigs, European wild boars, American wild pigs,
and giant forest hogs. African warthogs and bushpigs are considered natural
reservoirs. There is not yet an effective vaccine available or effective
treatment against ASF.
The disease poses no danger to human health.

Russia's food safety watchdog was reported in this story as saying Thursday
[7 Jun 2007] it had imposed restrictions on meat imports from Georgia after
an outbreak of African swine fever registered in the South Caucasus
country. Rosselkhoznadzor said in a statement that "outbreaks of African
swine fever in Georgia have been registered in 10 populated areas,
including Tbilisi. In these areas, 20 000 infected pigs have been
destroyed. Georgia has imposed restrictions on the movement of cattle;
contaminated premises have been disinfected, and a quarantine regime has
been introduced in the disease-stricken areas."

[The identification of an exotic disease, when encountered for the 1st time
in a previously free country, is a tricky business. There are examples of
countries where such disease was evolving for extended periods before
identified and definitely diagnosed. The Georgian situation is not
exceptional. The authorities seem to have suspected ASF already at early
stages of the outbreak, in April 2007, but, as stated under
"epidemiological comments" in their initial "immediate notification" to the
OIE of 17 May 2007, "pathological material from 150 animals was tested in
the laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia. Agents of
secondary bacterial infections (Pasteurellosis, erysipelas, salmonellosis)
were detected. The presence of African swine fever and classical swine
fever was excluded." Their transparency and their initiative to send
suspected material to the OIE reference laboratory in Pirbright for
advanced testing are commendable.
For detailed information on ASF diagnostic methods, subscribers are
referred to chapter 2.1.12 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines
for Terrestrial Animals (updated 23 Jul 2004), available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00035.htm>. We hereby copy the summary
of the said extensive review:
"African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of domestic and wild
pigs that affects animals of all breeds and ages, and which is caused by a
virus that produces a range of syndromes. Acute disease is characterized by
high fever, hemorrhages in the reticuloendothelial system, and a high
mortality rate. Infectious virus can survive for several months in fresh
and salted dried-meat products.
"ASF virus is the only member of the _Asfarviridae_ family.
"Laboratory diagnostic procedures for ASF fall into 2 groups: the 1st
contains the tests for virus isolation and the detection of virus antigens
and genomic DNA, while the 2nd contains the tests for antibody detection.
The selection of the tests to be carried out depends on the disease
situation in the area or country.
"In countries free from ASF but suspecting its presence, the laboratory
diagnosis must be directed towards isolation of the virus by simultaneously
carrying out the inoculation of pig leukocyte or bone marrow cultures, the
detection of antigen in smears or cryostat sections of tissues by
fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and, where possible, the detection of
genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection of antibodies
in tissue fluids by the indirect fluorescent antibody test should also be
carried out at the same time.
"Identification of the agent: Tissues submitted from suspected cases of
disease in the field should be examined for specific antigen by the FAT on
smears or cryostat sections and for the presence of virus by inoculation of
primary pig leukocyte cultures, which are examined daily for hemadsorption
and cytopathic effects. The cells from negative cultures are examined for
antigen by FAT and subinoculation into fresh leukocyte cultures.
"The PCR can be used to detect virus genome in tissues and is especially
useful if these are unsuitable for virus isolation and antigen detection.
"In doubtful cases, the material is passaged, and the procedures described
above are repeated.
"Serological tests: Where the disease is endemic, or where a primary
outbreak is caused by a strain of low virulence, the investigation of new
outbreaks should include the detection, using the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, of specific antibodies in serum or extracts of the
tissues submitted.
"Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals: At present, there is
no vaccine for ASF."
