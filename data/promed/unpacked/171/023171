Mumps outbreak on the island of Anglesey, North Wales, December
2008-January 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over a 5-week period since late December 2008, 23 cases of clinical
mumps in young people have been reported in North Wales. All cases
have social links, and most of them have received 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine.

Since 27 Dec 2008, the North Wales Health Protection Team of the
National Public Health Service for Wales has been notified of 23
cases of clinical mumps. The onset dates are shown in the Figure
[displayed in the original text]. The age range was 9-37 years with a
median of 15-16 years, and similar numbers of males and females were
affected. The cases are all linked via family or social groups.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
The 1st case reported on 27 Dec 2008 was a student in Manchester
where, as confirmed by the Health Protection Unit, a number of mumps
cases have occurred among students in recent weeks. They received an
increase in notifications in the 1st week of December 2008, which
peaked in the 2nd week of December, and it is plausible that the
student was infected at this time. Transmission from this case
probably occurred at a Young Farmers party held on Anglesey on the 27
Dec 2008. Members of 2 local Young Farmers groups were invited,
comprising around 50 young people aged 13 to 27 years.

An unusual feature of this outbreak is that 20 of the cases had
received 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and 2
cases had had one dose. The only unvaccinated case was a 37 year-old
patient who was too old to have been offered MMR as a child. Most
cases appear to be mild, with no reports to date of orchitis or other
complications. MMR vaccine was introduced into the childhood
vaccination programme of the United Kingdom (UK) in 1988. The mumps
strain currently used in the MMR vaccine is Jeryl Lynn. However, some
of the older cases (over 17 years-old) in this outbreak will have
received MMR vaccine containing the Urabe strain, which was used in
the UK from 1988 to 1992.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
One case was admitted to the district general hospital where blood
for serology was taken. This was reported as negative for IgM against
mumps virus, but positive for IgG with no evidence of recent
infection. This sample was taken the day after onset of symptoms, and
would have been too early to capture an IgM response. A convalescent
sample has been requested.

Another case, who is a healthcare worker, had paired sera taken by
the Occupational Health Department, which showed a rising titre of
mumps antibodies and was therefore confirmed as recent mumps
infection by the regional virology laboratory.

Salivary swab samples of the remaining 21 clinical cases have been
submitted to the reference laboratory at the Health Protection Agency
Centre for Infections (CfI) at Colindale. The results for 3 cases
have been received to date and are as follows:

Case 1: the samples were IgM-negative and IgG-positive (very high
titre), possibly indicating infection. A repeat salivary antibody
test has been requested to ascertain whether IgM titres have
subsequently risen.

Case 2: the samples were IgM-negative and IgG-positive, although the
titre was not particularly high. This is consistent with past
immunisation, but does not allow confirmation of recent mumps
infection. The patient's general practitioner notes that it was a
very mild case of mumps.

Case 3: the samples tested IgM-positive and IgG-positive (very high
titre). Recent mumps infection is confirmed.

Two recent cases have been swabbed within 48 hours of onset, and
their samples will be tested by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] at
the CfI reference laboratory.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
Salivary swabs are usually submitted 2 weeks after notification of
clinical mumps. In this outbreak blood samples have been taken in
individual cases because of special circumstances. The laboratory
results to date indicate that this is a genuine outbreak of mumps,
although the timing of some of the samples may not have been optimal
for capturing the antibody response.

This outbreak is different form the one described in Austria in 2008,
where 49.1 percent of the young people affected had not been
vaccinated (1). However, in the Netherlands, a number of fully
vaccinated individuals were affected as part of an outbreak in a
predominantly unvaccinated community in 2008 (2).

Uptake of MMR vaccination has historically been high in Anglesey, and
the majority of cases in the outbreak had received 2 doses. The lack
of cases among unvaccinated individuals may reflect the high uptake
of vaccine, and an investigation is ongoing to determine coverage
rates for the birth cohorts involved. Current isolates from mumps
cases in the UK have been identified as genotype G. Further tests are
required in order to confirm that this is also the genotype for this outbreak.

The mumps component of the MMR vaccine does not provide the same high
levels of protection as the measles and rubella components. One dose
protects around 65 percent (62 percent-85 percent) of those who
receive it (3). A 2nd dose raises the effectiveness to around 85
percent. This still leaves one in 6 recipients of 2 MMR doses
vulnerable to mumps. This primary vaccine failure may be the
explanation for this outbreak, but the contribution of waning
immunity, secondary vaccine failure, must also be considered.

Infection control measures
--------------------------
Letters have been sent to the school many of the cases attend,
advising that all children should ensure that they have received 2
doses of MMR vaccine. Letters have also been sent to general
practitioners in the area alerting them to the fact that cases of
mumps are occurring despite complete vaccination status, and
preparing them for requests for MMR vaccination.
