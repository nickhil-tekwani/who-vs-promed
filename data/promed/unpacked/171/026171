[1] Summary of cases
Date: Sun 17 Mar 2019

https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/mmr-ii-and-proquad-measles-vaccines-are-available-most-pharmacies


MMR-II and ProQuad measles vaccines are available from most pharmacies.

According to various state governments and news publishers, the measles outbreaks during 2019 continue to expand throughout the USA.

The majority of the measles cases reported during 2019 are segmented into 2 categories, which are under-vaccinated individuals or related to international travel.

Countries such as Israel, the Philippines, and Ukraine continue to report significant measles outbreaks, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In response to this worldwide measles epidemic, the CDC reissued 17 Travel Alerts, on 11 Mar 2019.

- Currently, the 4 leading measles hot-spots in the USA as of 17 Mar 2019, are as follows:
- New York City, NY: as of 12 Mar 2019, there have been 158 measles cases.
- Rockland County, NY: as of 14 Mar 2019, 2019, there are 147 measles cases.
- Clark County, Washington: as of 15 Mar 2019, there have been 72 measles cases.
- Texas: as of 8 Mar 2019, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed 11 measles cases during 2019.

These 3 states have reported (388) measles cases, which exceeds the CDC data for January - 12 Mar 2019, which confirmed just 228 measles cases in 12 states. This data disparity is generally related to reporting timing.

Listed below are various state-based measles updates for the week ending 17 Mar 2019.

Arizona:
The Pima County measles case involves a 12-month-old baby. Paula Mandel, Deputy Director of the Pima County Health Department, says the child did not enter the infectious phase until it was back in Arizona.

California:
As of 7 Mar 2019, 6 confirmed measles cases during 2019. During 2018, 21 confirmed measles cases were reported in California. Evidence of California vaccination rates can be found in the 2017-2018 Kindergarten Immunization Assessment. The overall required vaccine rate in CA was 95.1 percent in 2018. This has climbed from around 90 percent in 2014. Marin and San Francisco counties remain in the yellow range, with MMR vaccination rates that are below 95%. For context, Alameda is at 97.1 percent, and San Mateo is at 96.9 percent.

Colorado:
Just 1 adult with measles has been confirmed as of 27 Feb 2019. A February 2019 report, during the 2017-18 school year, showed only 88.7 percent of kindergarteners in Colorado received the MMR vaccine.

Connecticut:
The Connecticut Department of Public Health confirmed the 2nd case of measles in New Haven County. On 7 Feb 2019, CTNews Junkie requested information from the state Department of Public Health regarding the number of unvaccinated children in each Connecticut town. The DPH denied this request on 5 Mar 2019.

Georgia:
The Georgia Department of Public Health has confirmed measles in 3 residents of the metro Atlanta area. 2 cases of measles were confirmed 13 Jan 2019 and the 3rd measles case was confirmed 26 Jan 2019.

Hawaii:
The Hawaii State Department of Health confirmed 2 measles cases during 2019.

Illinois:
The Illinois Health department confirmed 6 measles cases during 2019.

Kentucky:
One case of measles has been confirmed in a young child who was unvaccinated, reported the Kentucky Department for Public Health on 15 Feb 2019.

Michigan:
As of 1 Mar 2019, there were 4 cases of measles during 2019. Additionally, on 15 Mar 2019, Health officials have confirmed a case of travel-related measles in Oakland County. Officials said the individual was visiting from Israel and came to the Detroit area after visiting New York. The person made multiple stops in Metro Detroit and health officials warn that people could have been exposed to measles at the following locations. ...

New Hampshire:
The Boston Public Health Commission alerted the public of measles exposure. On 26 Feb 2019, an individual with confirmed measles traveled from New York City to Boston and subsequently to New Hampshire.

New Jersey:
The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is warning residents about 4 confirmed cases of measles. In unrelated incidents: A Bergen County resident developed measles after contact with a community outside New Jersey experiencing an ongoing outbreak of measles and potentially exposed individuals in Bergen County; An Essex County resident developed measles following travel from a country that is currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak of measles; and 2 Ocean County residents were confirmed to have measles and potentially exposed individuals in Ocean County between 26 Feb and 5 Mar 2019. And New Jersey health officials said on 14 Mar 2019, that a 3rd confirmed case of the contagious disease means that authorities are considering this a new outbreak. Previously, the NJDOH had declared between October 2018 and January 2019, a total of 33 measles cases were identified in an outbreak in Ocean County.

New York City:
As of 12 Mar 2019, there have been 158 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October 2018. The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel.

Monroe County NY:
The Monroe County Department of Public Health has confirmed a total of 7 measles cases during 2019. A person is considered immune and is unlikely to get measles if they were born before 1 Jan 1957, or have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

Rockland County NY:
As of 14 Mar 2019, there are 147 confirmed reported cases of measles in Rockland County, NY. Statistics released by the County show that over 10 of these patients say they did not have an MMR vaccine.

Westchester County, NY:
The Westchester County Health Department was notified that a Monroe College student has been diagnosed with measles. The student is a resident of New York City. Since August 1990, college students have also been required to demonstrate immunity against measles.

Oregon:
As of 12 Mar 2019, there have been 4 confirmed measles cases in Oregon related to an outbreak in Washington state. And 3 additional cases are not linked to the outbreak. Chief medical officer, Dr. Richard Leman said outbreaks can be tracked by comparing measles RNA. "So it's an RNA virus, and there are things we can do with that. But that takes much longer. So really the epidemiology is the gold standard and we can follow that up with fancy tests."

Texas:
As of 8 Mar 2019, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) confirmed 11 measles cases in Texas during 2019. DSHS is urging health care providers to consider measles when diagnosing patients because of early identification, along with immunization, is key to preventing measles from spreading. Previously, DSHS had 9 confirmed cases in 2018.

Washington:
As of 15 Mar 2019, Clark County Public Health (CCPH) has confirmed 72 measles cases during 2019. The majority of these people were not immunized, according to the county's public health department. And, more than 800 students considered exposed to measles in Clark County, have been ordered to stay away from classrooms for up to 3 weeks. "School exclusions are a critical tool and public health strategy to control outbreaks of disease in school settings," state health department epidemiologist Dr. Scott Lindquist said in a statement. "We have to be aggressive in identifying cases, isolating them and reducing public exposure to slow the spread and protect Washington residents."

[5] California (San Diego)

https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/one-doctor-is-responsible-for-a-third-of-all-medical-vaccine-exemptions-in-san-diego/


Dr. Tara Zandvliet has written nearly 1/3rd of all 486 medical exemptions from vaccinations for the entire San Diego Unified School District, according to vaccination records obtained by Voice of San Diego.

Dr. Tara Zandvliet doesn't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine. It is a philosophy most of her colleagues would agree with, most of the time, just not when it comes to vaccinations.

Amid ongoing measles outbreaks across the country, other doctors expressed concern science doesn't back up her rationale for granting exemptions and worry she is unnecessarily putting school children, and the public, at risk. Using medical exemptions to bypass California's mandatory vaccinations for school children is a practice on the rise, according to a study published in the journal Pediatrics. The number of medical exemptions has tripled since 2015, when California became the 3rd state to stop allowing families with children in public school to opt out of vaccinations because of personal beliefs.

Countywide, the percentage of kindergartners receiving a permanent medical vaccine exemption has increased 6-fold since the 2015-2016 school year, from 0.2 percent to 1.2 percent, according to data from the California Department of Public Health.

San Diego Unified "has noticed some physicians issuing exemptions that appear to be excessively frequent and based on criteria that is not aligned with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention," district spokeswoman Maureen Magee wrote in an email. She said the district has raised its concerns with legislators, as well as the local chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

School districts have no role in approving or disapproving the exemptions.

"Everyone looks at me like I'm the evil one," Zandvliet told me. "I've had death threats, people just think they know better."

But Zandvliet said she's honestly writing exemptions based on her best understanding of medicine.

A handful of doctors across the state, the study found, are relying on the same reasoning as Zandvliet to issue a medical exemption from some or all vaccines: family history of allergies or autoimmune diseases.

But most public health officials, as well as the American Academy of Pediatricians and the Center for Disease Control, do not endorse this as a reason not to immunize. It's a "soft reason," Dr. Mark Sawyer, an infectious disease specialist at Rady Children's Hospital, told me.

It is possible genetics may increase a child's risk of having an adverse reaction to a vaccination, Sawyer said. But so far, it is only a theory held by Zandvliet and a small handful of others. The theory is entirely untested, he said.

Zandvliet is listed as a "vaxx-friendly" doctor on many of the websites dedicated to helping parents find someone who might not be so insistent on giving their children vaccinations. She admits that many anti-vaxxers -- or those who might be vaxx-questioning -- find their way to her practice. But she said she only issues an exemption for those who meet her qualifications. She denies 7 out of 10 exemptions, she estimated. And her goal is always to persuade people to get all of their vaccinations, she said.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nigeria-reports-double-measles-cases-2019/


Nigeria health officials have reported nearly 6000 measles cases since the beginning of the year [2019], nearly double the number reported in 2018 during the same period.

Borno state has been hit the hardest by measles, reporting 3600 cases, primarily in children under 5 years. 15 measles related deaths have been reported to date.

According to Nigerian and global health officials, during the last 4 months, the increased level of hostilities resulted in massive displacement. More than 700 000 people are living in overcrowded camp-like settings in Borno state, significantly increasing the risk of epidemics and infectious diseases.

[7] Bulgaria:
Date: Sat 16 Mar 2019
Source: Sofia Globe [abridged, edited]
https://sofiaglobe.com/2019/03/16/chief-health-inspector-124-measles-cases-in-bulgaria/


There are currently 124 cases of measles in Bulgaria, chief state health inspector Angel Kunchev said on 16 Mar 2019, Bulgarian National Radio reported.

This is more than 4 times more than the number of cases since Bulgaria's Health Ministry started issuing regular updates on the country's measles situation in late February 2019.

Kunchev said that so far 112 parents had been fined for failing to have their children vaccinated.

The measles outbreak in Bulgaria had been influenced by the anti-vaccine movement, Kunchev said. Regular updates by the Health Ministry have said that the vast majority of measles infections have been of children who had not been vaccinated.

At the moment, most of the infections were in the district of Blagoevgrad, in Sofia and in Ihtiman, with just 2 in the Bulgarian Black Sea cities of Bourgas and Varna.

"But the virus is very mobile, and we expect it to migrate even more," Kunchev said.

He noted that in Ukraine, out of 56 000 infected children, 700 had died. In Romania, 5000 had been infected, and 60 had died. In Serbia, measles infection cases added up to 3500 and 2500 in Greece, while in the Republic of North Macedonia, there had been 450 cases of children infected with measles, and 4 had died.

In February 2019, as the measles outbreak began in Bulgaria, the Health Ministry issued an instruction via regional health inspectorates for a check-up of cases where children had not had the compulsory vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).

The inspections have identified numerous cases of failure to vaccinate children, a consequence of anti-vaccine disinformation on the internet.

Bulgaria's health authorities have sought to address the outbreak by dispatching teams to give free-of-charge vaccinations in various targeted areas.

The World Health Organisation said in February 2019 that the number of measles infections in Europe in 2018 was triple that in 2017 and 15 times the record-low number of people recorded in 2016.

A brief overview of the epidemiological situation with measles in Macedonia
---------------------------
This week, a total of 63 cases of measles have been reported (laboratory confirmed or with an epidemiological link).

- 29 cases of measles have been reported from Skopje (of which 79.3%, of them are incompletely vaccinated, unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status) while the other 34 are from 8 other cities in Macedonia.
- 11 cases were reported from Kumanovo and Tetovo, 72.7% of them were unvaccinated;
- from Veles: 4 reported cases, 2 vaccinated, 2 unvaccinated;
- from Struga - 3 cases, all unvaccinated;
- from Gevgelija 2 cases - one with unknown status and one incompletely vaccinated;
- 1 new case from Vinica (not vaccinated), Gostivar (unknown vaccine status) and Kratovo (non-vaccinated, not subject to vaccination).

A total of 555 cases of measles have been registered in Macedonia since the beginning of the epidemic in Skopje since December 2018, of which 439 have been linked to the epidemic in Skopje.

According to the place of permanent living, measles cases were registered in 18 towns in Macedonia, of which 394 cases were from Skopje, 50 from Tetovo, 36 from Kumanovo, 18 from Gevgelija, 9 from Debar, 10 from Struga, 7 from Gostivar, 10 from Veles, 5 from Kichevo, 4 from Kocani and the other 8 cities are sporadic cases.

The highest incidence of 100 000 inhabitants is registered in Skopje (63.8/100 000) and Gevgelija (52.3/100 000).

This week's epidemic of measles is reported in 4 regions, and is currently active (Skopje, Tetovo, Kumanovo and Gevgelija).

The largest number of cases are from the age group 0-4 years, 236 or 42.5% of the total. A high percentage of patients is also registered in elderly groups; persons older than 30 years with 37.5% (n = 208) and persons 20-29 years with 11.9% (n = 66).

Out of a total of 129 cases of children aged 1-4 years, 117 or 90.7% were unvaccinated, and out of 274 cases in people over 20 years of age, 71.9% (n = 197) were unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with unknown vaccine status.

From the total number of the registered 555 cases of measles, the highest number and percentage -- 303 or 54.6% -- are laboratory confirmed, 135 or 24.3% are epidemiologically related, while 117 cases (21.1%) are measles [suspected?].

Since the onset of the epidemic, in Skopje, the total number of vaccinated people under 14 years of age who are subject to vaccination with a 1st or 2nd dose, is 10 516 children. In the rest of the republic, from the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of vaccinated people up to 14 years with a 1st or 2nd dose is 5648 children. The total number of immunized persons aged 14 years with MRP vaccine since the start of the epidemic in the Republic of Macedonia is 16 164.

Authorities pointed out there was a measles epidemic in Sarajevo on Fri [15 Mar 2019], saying the disease has already claimed the life of a 7-month-old girl, while 113 persons are infected. None of the infected patients were vaccinated.

The "herd-immunity" of a population has to reach 95 per cent in order to prevent the disease from spreading and to protect those who cannot receive the vaccine.

However, currently, only 60.2 per cent of the population in Bosnia's Federation (FBiH) semi-autonomous region are vaccinated.

In recent years many parents have refused to allow their children to be immunised, following a global trend initiated by the anti-vaccination movement.

Authorities said they will start inspecting and monitoring all premises where children spend time, but the problem is that some of them are unregistered.

The law foresees fines for parents who do not vaccinate their children, but there are no legal procedures that could coerce parents into doing so, and many are willing to pay the fine.

Thirteen patients are currently hospitalised, which includes one child currently hooked on a respirator. Every day, more than 10 new measles patients visit the clinic, public health authorities in Canton Sarajevo said at a press conference on Friday [15 Mar 2019].

"It can be expected that the epidemic will within the next few days be intensified," according to the Sarajevo University Clinical Center.

The 1st case was recorded on 22 Jan 2019, cantonal health institution representatives said at the press conference.

An epidemic was already declared in Sarajevo in 2015 when 1500 cases were recorded.

Considering that immunization coverage is less than 50 percent in Canton Sarajevo, in theory, there is a chance that some 60 000 citizens could contract the disease. "We hope it won't come to that," said the head of the Epidemiology department, Aida Pitic.

In February 2019 it was reported that 3400 Israelis were infected with measles.

Israeli health officials continue to warn the country of possible exposures to measles as another 2 incidents were recorded on Thu [14 Mar 2019] and Fri [15 Mar 2019] in Ashkelon and Netanya, respectively.

The Ashkelon district health office reported a case of measles at the Leumit Health clinic in Kiryat Malakhi. Earlier in March 2019, another incident was reported at the Kiryat Malakhi public library. Since then, the city's health officials have urged its residents to inquire about vaccines.

[On 12 Mar 2019, the Jerusalem Post reported in an article written by Hagay Hacohen (https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Infectious-books-Measles-outbreak-suspected-in-Kiryat-Malakhi-library-583187) that "a nurse was dispatched from Israel to Poland, and 35 students, including their parents and teachers, were vaccinated against measles in Warsaw in early March 2019, when one student showed signs of contracting measles from her siblings and reported her that parents refused to inoculate her.

In a press release, the Ministry of Health stressed that the Polish Ministry of Health was informed of every step in the process and that after being vaccinated, the guided tour of Poland will resume as planned.

Judge Yehoram Shaked ruled recently that a divorced mother may vaccinate her daughter over the objections of her father.

Shaked wrote that vaccinating against measles is "necessary and obligatory," as measles could become "an epidemic." He compared refusing to vaccinate children to "crossing a busy road with one's eyes covered."
