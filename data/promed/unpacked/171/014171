Meningococcal disease in Uganda
---------------------------------------
From 28 Dec 2005 to 23 Jan 2006, 163 suspected cases of meningococcal
disease have been reported from the district of Nakapiripirit in
northeastern Uganda. 4 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were positive for
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A by latex test. 2 of these were also
confirmed by culture at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Uganda.
The Ministry of Health has constituted a National Task force, including
Medecins sans Frontieres, UNICEF and WHO to plan and coordinate the
response. WHO is also supporting the Ministry of Health in their field
investigations in affected and surrounding districts (Kitgum and Moroto)
and in strengthening surveillance.

[In this confirmatory posting from WHO, only cases in the Nakapiripirit
district of Uganda are mentioned. The original posting from the Ministry of
Health of Uganda noted 6 cases in Moroto. It is not clear whether the
Moroto cases are linked to the larger outbreak. - Mod.LL]
