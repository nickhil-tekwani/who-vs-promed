The United Kingdom pig industry has been shocked by a new outbreak of
Classical Swine Fever (CSF), the 16th in the current series of outbreaks,
which began on 8 Aug 2000. The new case, first outbreak for 30 days, is a
breeder/finisher farm 1.5 km from Topcroft, Norfolk in control Zone 6 (the
area where outbreak 6 occurred on 4 Sep 2000).
Local media also report the major multi-site production company, recently
sold, whose pigs were involved in the early swine fever outbreaks faces an
allegation of transporting pigs illegally on 5 Sep 2000 out of an area
subject to pig movement restrictions.
Detailed reports of the latest situation plus an overview of all the
outbreaks are available at: <http://www.pighealth.com/csf.htm>
