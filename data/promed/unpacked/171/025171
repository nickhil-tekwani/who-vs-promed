Koi herpesvirus is the likely cause of a carp die-off in New Dundee's Alder Lake [Ontario], says the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. After hundreds of dead carp were found floating in mid-August [2019], fish from the millpond were tested. Those samples tested positive for the koi herpesvirus, the ministry said.

The highly contagious virus is linked to large fish die-offs but only affects carp, koi and goldfish. The virus does not pose a risk to human health and is not a food-safety concern. "The disease is most often seen when water temperatures increase and fish are crowded especially during spawning," ministry spokesperson Jolanta Kowalski said in an email.

Residents living around the horseshoe-shaped millpond noticed juvenile carp floating dead at the shoreline in mid-August [2019]. In the days that followed, residents saw larger, more mature carp dying as well.

Mark Servos, a biology professor at the University of Waterloo who visited the lake during the die-off, said those observations fit the pattern for the virus. "It affected the younger fish first and then the older fish, so it's the exact pattern for koi herpesvirus. It's exactly what you would expect," he said, adding there's very little that can be done about it.

Fish with the virus can have symptoms including discoloured skin; swollen, pale, and rotting gills; sunken eyes and a notch on the nose; excess mucus; appetite loss; and erratic swimming, according to the province.

The virus has been found in wild carp, in a number of different lakes in south central Ontario. And while the Alder Lake die-off was "ugly", Servos said it might actually benefit the reservoir. Carp are an invasive species. They disturb the bottom of water bodies, causing nutrients to stir up and potentially feed algal blooms, he said. Without carp, there is more natural growth of plants and the water in the lake will become clearer, he added. "It was terrible that this occurred, but the fact that it's going to knock back the carp is probably going to have positive ecological consequences for the lake in the long term," he said.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. As other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it.

Despite the widespread detections of KHV in the USA, there were no reports of the virus in Canada until 2007, when large mortality events occurred in Ontario and Manitoba. - Mod.PMB
