A panel of scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, on Thursday [14 Jan 2021] to cooperate with their Chinese peers in researching on the potential origin of the novel coronavirus.

The WHO team underwent throat swabs and serum antibody tests for the coronavirus at the airport. They will go through the required quarantine procedures before conducting field work.

During the quarantine period, the WHO experts and Chinese scientists will communicate via video conference, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a media briefing on Thursday [14 Jan 2021] afternoon. China will strictly enforce COVID-19 containment requirements and facilitate the WHO experts.

The WHO confirmed the arrival of 13 scientists in Wuhan on its official Twitter account, saying "The experts will begin their work immediately during the 2 weeks quarantine protocol for international travelers."

Two scientists of the team tested positive for IgM antibodies in Singapore, where they are being retested for both IgM and IgG antibodies, the WHO said. "All team members had multiple negative PCR and antibody tests for COVID-19 in their home countries prior to traveling," it said.

"Understanding the origin of the disease is not about finding somebody to blame," said WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Dr. Michael Ryan. "Let this mission and let other missions be about the science, not about the politics."

This is the 3rd such visit since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. China had invited WHO experts twice, in February and July last year [2020], to carry out cooperation on tracing potential sources in China, during which the 2 sides formulated the China part of a global scientific cooperation plan.

A team of experts from the World Health Organization [WHO] arrived in Wuhan on Thursday [14 Jan 2021] to start a highly politicised probe into the origins of the coronavirus, as China reported its 1st death from COVID-19 in 8 months.

The 10 scientists, who must complete a 2-week quarantine in Wuhan before starting their work, arrived for their much-delayed mission to examine the origins of the pandemic.

The virus was 1st detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since billowed out across the world, killing nearly 2 million people so far, infecting tens of millions and eviscerating the global economy.

State broadcaster CGTN showed the plane carrying the team arrive from Singapore to be met by Chinese officials in full hazmat suits.

Their trip comes as more than 20 million people are under lockdown in the north of China, and one province has declared an emergency, with COVID-19 numbers climbing after several months of being relatively static.

China had largely brought the pandemic under control through strict lockdowns and mass testing, hailing its economic rebound as an indication of strong leadership by the Communist authorities.

But another 138 infections were reported by the National Health Commission on Thursday [14 Jan 2021], the highest single-day tally since March last year [2020].

Clusters are still small compared with many countries contending with rampant infections and record numbers of deaths, and the 1st virus fatality in several months -- reported in northern Hebei province -- seeded alarm across China.

Beijing is anxious to stamp out local clusters ahead of next month's [March 2021] Lunar New Year festival, when hundreds of millions of people will be on the move across the country.

Health authorities gave no details about the latest death except that it occurred in Hebei province, where the government has placed several cities under lockdown.

As infections have spread, northeastern Heilongjiang declared an "emergency state" on Wednesday [13 Jan 2021], telling its 37.5 million residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary.

The latest death comes as China braces for the scrutiny the arrival of the expert team of WHO scientists will bring.

Peter Ben Embarek, team lead for the mission, said the group would start with a mandatory quarantine at a hotel due to Chinese immigration requirements. "And then, after the 2 weeks, we would be able to move around and meet our Chinese counterparts in person and go to the different sites that we will want to visit," he said. He warned it "could be a very long journey before we get a full understanding of what happened."

Beijing has argued that although Wuhan is where the 1st cluster of cases was detected, it is not necessarily where the virus originated.

"I don't think we will have clear answers after this initial mission, but we will be on the way," Embarek added. "The idea is to advance a number of studies that were already designed and decided upon some months ago to get us a better understanding of what happened."

The long-delayed WHO trip comes more than a year after the pandemic began and has sparked political tensions over allegations that Beijing tried to thwart the project.

[3] WHO experts mission's travel to Wuhan - The Guardian, preface
Date: Tue 12 Jan 2021

When the scientists on the World Health Organization's mission to research the origins of COVID-19 touch down in China as expected on Thursday [14 Jan 2021] at the beginning of their investigation, they are clear what they will -- and what they will not -- be doing.

They intend to visit Wuhan, the site of the 1st major outbreak of COVID-19, and talk to Chinese scientists who have been studying the same issue. They will want to see if there are unexamined samples from unexplained respiratory illnesses, and they will want to examine ways in which the virus might have jumped the species barrier to humans.

What the mission will not be, several of the scientists insist, is an exercise in "finger-pointing at China," something long demanded by the Trump administration and some of its allies.

While some of the scientists will travel to China, others will be part of a wider effort that has drawn in global experts in diseases.

The importance of being on the ground in China, of seeing sites associated with the Wuhan outbreak, was underlined by Fabian Leendertz, professor in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms at Germany's public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, and part of the team.

Leendertz has few illusions how difficult tracing the origin of COVID-19 will be.

Involved in tracking down the source of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa to a bat colony in a tree, he has also worked on identifying when measles may have first jumped to humans.

While some have built up considerable expectations around the 1st visit, Leendertz cautions that his experience suggests it can take time to get to the initial bottom of outbreaks, if at all.

"We will see how long it takes. There's small possibility we will only come up with scenarios, that we won't be able to come up with a scientific proof. For example, my group published a paper last summer in Science where we found it was probably 25 000 years since measles spread from cattle to humans. Hopefully it won't take that long," he joked.

Leendertz, like other colleagues involved in the mission, is clear, however, about one thing. "This is not about finding China guilty or saying 'it started here, give or take 3 metres [9.8 ft].' This is about reducing the risk. And the media can help by avoiding Trump-style finger-pointing. Our job is not political.

"There will never be no risk, which is why it's not the time to say it is farming animals or people going into bat caves for guano. It has been a data-based investigation, and at the moment there is very limited data around the origin.

"We know the closest relative viruses in bat species. But we still need to find the original reservoir, if there were intermediate hosts and even intermediate human hosts."

And while China has suggested other places outside of the country where the virus could have originated, Leendertz believes that Wuhan remains the best starting point.

"I think the WHO philosophy is a good one. Start at the point which has the most solid description of human cases, even if we do not know that the Wuhan wet market was the point where it first spilled over into humans or was simply the 1st mega spreading event.

"From Wuhan we can go back in time to follow the evidence. [The origin] may stay in the region. It may go to another part of China. It may even go to another country."

While there was a conversation in the team about whether the research could be done remotely, when it looked for a moment last week the visit might be blocked by China, he is not convinced that would have been a useful strategy.

"You can't do an investigation of any outbreak remotely," he told the Guardian. "It's just not really possible. I don't want to give the impression we'll be taking swabs or finding bats, but it is really important to see the locations and the settings, the wet market in Wuhan, the virology institute, to see the wildlife farms, the potential interface between the virus and humans.

"We have already had a few productive online meetings with our Chinese counterparts, but it is better to be sitting down and brainstorming to develop hypotheses."

Leendertz's remarks on finger-pointing were echoed by fellow team member Marion Koopmans in an interview with the Chinese television channel CGTN.

"The WHO warned about the risk of emerging diseases, and I don't think any country is immune to that. So I don't believe this is about blaming. It's about understanding and learning that for the future of our global preparedness. So, I don't think we should be pointing fingers here. But it is important to start in Wuhan, where a big outbreak occurred. We need to have an open mind to all sorts on the hypothesis. And that's what we've been asked to do. But we need to start in Wuhan where we first learned about the situation."

Professor John Watson, a UK member of the team and a former deputy chief medical officer, echoed many of the same sentiments. "I've worked on outbreaks mainly in the UK," he told the Guardian. "And although in theory you could do it remotely, being on the spot makes a big difference. Understanding how a place works and having direct contact with the individuals involved.

"I am going into this with an entirely open mind, and the colleagues on the team I have managed to speak to are the same. This is a chance to go and find out the facts: what is available to know now and what lines of investigation might be fruitful in the future. I'm not sure a single trip will find all the answers -- it may never be wholly sorted -- but it is a start."

Leendertz is clear about one thing, however. While the international scientists on the team do the investigation, the complex and sensitive diplomacy around access will be handled by the WHO amid concerns in some circles that China might try and obstruct the work.

That job will inevitably fall on the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is expected to keep close tabs on the mission.

[The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 was subject to ongoing discussions since the earliest days of the pandemic's evolution. The following 3 candidate scenarios were presented in Ref 1 (slightly abridged):

1. Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses, it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor. Although RaTG13, sampled from a _Rhinolophus affinis_ bat, is about 96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD (receptor-binding domain), which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE2. This may indicate the required involvement of (dense?) populations of an intermediate animal.

2. Natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans, acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission. Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it.

3. Selection during passage. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world, and there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV. The possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2 deserves to be examined.

Wuhan is the site of several laboratories which have conducted research into SARS or SARS-related coronaviruses prior to the pandemic, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (WHCDC), and Wuhan University (WU).

As many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, it was initially assumed that, possibly, an animal source was present at this location. However, the earliest cases of COVID-19 were identified in patients who were not linked to the said market. In the (hitherto) absence of information on tests in the market's animals, its role in the epidemiology of COVID-19 remains to be visited.
