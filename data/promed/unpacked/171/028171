A new class of compounds might be used to treat and even prevent "mad cow"
disease and related diseases, U.S. government researchers said on Thursday.
A team at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
said they had identified a new class of compounds that slows the
development of such diseases in mice. The diseases are known as prion
diseases because they are caused by an abnormal version of a brain protein
known as a prion. They include bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE or mad
cow disease), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human form of the
disease, and the sheep disease scrapie. In these diseases, the prions fold
in an abnormal way, and the effect seems to be infectious. Big globs of
abnormal protein build up in the brain and eventually kill off other brain
cells. All such diseases are fatal and incurable.
Suzette Priola and colleagues at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in
Hamilton, Montana studied compounds known as cyclic tetrapyrroles, which
are currently used in treating cancer. They had already shown, in test
tubes, the drugs can stop the abnormal folding that turns a good prion bad.
The next step was to test this in a living animal. They injected mice with
a high dose of scrapie, then gave them 1 of 3 different cyclic
tetrapyrroles during the 80-day incubation period of scrapie.
Depending on when and how they got the drugs, the mice lived from 50 to 300
percent longer than untreated mice, Priola and her colleagues reported in
the journal Science. Multiple doses of the drugs provided better protection
than just 1 dose.
Priola says the research is urgent because people can acquire a form of BSE
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), known as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (nvCJD), from eating infected beef.
More than 40 people have died of nvCJD and doctors still do not know
whether this could be the start of a huge epidemic, because the disease has
an incubation period that can last for decades.
"Thus, with the potential exposure of millions of people to BSE and the
onset of nvCJD, the need for effective ... drugs has become acute,"
Priola's team wrote. "Since diagnosis of nvCJD in humans can be made only
after symptoms appear, we are trying to identify a compound that works
later in the disease," Priola added in a statement. Luckily, she added,
they have plenty to choose from. "The extremely wide variety of these
compounds available for testing makes our current search for one that can
affect disease after the onset of symptoms much more promising." The drugs
are relatively non-toxic in people, the researchers wrote.
They said the drugs cannot get into the brain because of a system called
the blood-brain barrier. They seem to act in the spleen and elsewhere in
the body -- where the prions are known to circulate. Therefore they would
not offer a cure but might prevent or slow the progression of the illness.
