On 27 May 1998 Indian Express published from Pune and many other Marathi
(local language) newspapers [reported an outbreak of dengue in Kolhapur
district of Maharashtra, village Washi.
According to the district health officer, 200 persons are affected, and the
chief of the (Panchyat) village council died.
Dengue has been known to be present in towns and cities, but during the
last 10 or 12 years has [also been affecting villages. This is a rather
difficult situation because the village health system is not in a position
to treat serious cases of dengue. This needs special attention of the
policy makers.
