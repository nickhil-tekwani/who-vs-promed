Minorities in Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin were 2 to 3 times
as likely as whites to be hospitalized for swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection], a disparity that city and
state health officials vowed to combat as the 2nd wave of the
pandemic diminishes and the possibility of a 3rd wave looms on the horizon.

"Local health agencies have to play a stepped-up role in reaching out
to racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, those who are homebound
and the homeless," said Seth Foldy, state health officer. "That is
our next challenge." Milwaukee health commissioner Bevan K Baker said
the disparity, which is evident also during normal seasonal flu, was
not surprising. "Is it troubling. Yes, it's troubling."

From 30 Aug to 21 Dec 2009, non-Hispanic whites in Milwaukee were
hospitalized for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus at a rate of just
over 14 for every 100 000 people; the rate for blacks was almost 28
per 100 000, and for Hispanics, more than 32 per 100 000. In the same
period, the statewide hospitalization rates were 11 per 100 000 for
whites, almost 38 per 100 000 for blacks and more than 30 per 100 000
for Hispanics. The hospitalization rate for American Indians in
Wisconsin was almost 35 per 100 000. Overall swine flu [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection] has been linked to 50 deaths
in Wisconsin. Since September [2009], the illness has caused 1229
hospitalizations in the state.

Officials don't know all of the reasons why there is a racial and
ethnic disparity in flu hospitalizations, but suggested a number of
possibilities. The nation already has disparities in a wide range of
health care measures, including diabetes, infant mortality, and
teenage pregnancy. More to the point, minority populations have
higher rates for some of the underlying medical conditions that can
make swine flu more severe: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.

A host of other issues may play a role in the swine flu disparity,
including having transportation to clinics, access to health care and
health insurance.

State and local health leaders said they anticipated this disparity
and made extra efforts to reach minority populations with vaccine
clinics. Health agencies worked with faith-based and community-based
organizations to organize clinics. They announced clinics on local
radio stations in Spanish and Hmong [the language of an Asian ethnic
group of people from the mountainous regions of Viet Nam, Laos,
Thailand, and Myanmar, many of whom have settled in the United
States. - Mod.CP]

Paul A Biedrzycki, Milwaukee's director of disease control and
environmental health, said the city worked with the Black Health
Coalition and set up clinics in census areas with large black and
Hispanic populations. Biedrzycki said the city's health department is
already examining ways to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities in
swine flu hospitalizations. One possibility is forming health "strike
teams" that could be dispatched to schools in neighborhoods where
there are many flu cases.

[The diversity of the minority ethnic groups (American Indians,
Alaskan natives, Polynesian and Asian immigrants), found to be at
greater risk of hospitalisation than the majority white population
(which is similarly heterogeneous), indicates that socio-economic
factors are responsible rather than differences in the susceptibility
of particular racial groups. Ultimately improvements in overall
welfare and living standards are likely to have greater benefit than
targeted healthcare provision.
