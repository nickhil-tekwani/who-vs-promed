Hepatitis A outbreak definitely involves mainstream population
---------------------------------------------------------------
In recent months, these headlines popped up in a Google search for "Hepatitis A outbreak" -- "KY hepatitis A outbreak kills 3 people, hospitalizes hundreds," "20th death reported in San Diego's hepatitis A outbreak," "Michigan posts 25th hepatitis A death."

And on 4 May 2018, the Indiana State Department of Health posted an outbreak update reporting 91 confirmed cases, with a 48 percent hospitalization rate. States with outbreak cases are using different starting dates for their outbreaks. Indiana started counting outbreak cases in November 2017. The state usually averages 20 cases per year.

Hepatitis A is most commonly spread when a person eats or drinks something contaminated with microscopic traces of fecal matter from an infected person, according to the Mayo Clinic. It does not spread through sneezing or coughing.

The genotype of some cases in Indiana matches that responsible for the ongoing outbreaks in Arizona, Kentucky, California, Michigan, and Utah, the Indiana health department reported.

The CDC declared the multi-state outbreak in March 2017. Since then, at least 1200 cases have been reported, and more than 40 people have died of the highly contagious liver infection. The federal agency is no longer posting information on a regular basis, instead leaving outbreak updates to individual states.

Food Safety News surveyed all 50 states in recent weeks about their hepatitis A cases. At least 14 reported increases in their number of hepatitis A cases during the outbreak period, when compared to their usual average annual case counts. While officials are pointing primarily to cases among people who are homeless and/or substance abusers and their close direct contacts. However, there are increasing reports of infected people who are neither homeless nor substance abusers.

More cases of the highly contagious virus are also being confirmed in foodservice employees in the outbreak states. Public health officials warn that large numbers of people can be exposed to the virus by foodservice workers. People are usually contagious before their symptoms, further increasing the danger of spreading the virus to others.

What is it and what are the consequences
----------------------------------------
"Hepatitis A, if it doesn't kill you initially, you will recover," said Seattle food safety attorney Bill Marler. "But it does have a pretty significant morbidity rate and it does have a pretty significant rate of people whose livers fail and who need a transplant."

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable, communicable disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus, according to the CDC. It is usually transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or consumption of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection. Most adults with hepatitis A have symptoms including fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice. For otherwise healthy adults, most symptoms usually resolve within a couple of months. Most children younger than 6 do not have symptoms or have an unrecognized infection. The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is to get vaccinated.

The vaccination is a 2-injection treatment with the shots given 6 months apart. Getting a vaccine or an injection of the antibody immunoglobulin within two weeks of exposure to Hepatitis A can protect against the infection.

For elderly people, pregnant women, and people with suppressed immune systems, Hepatitis A can be life changing. "Even people who are modestly sick will feel like they have the worst case of the flu for about a month -- that's kind of a minimum," Marler said. "The liver is a hugely important part of your body, and when your liver's off you feel horrible."

The virus is endemic in many parts of the world, often infecting people through the water. Antibodies produced in response to the infection last for life and protect against reinfection, so the people who live in places where it is common often have that lifetime protection and don't need to be vaccinated. But in the United States, most people are not immune -- hence the outbreak sweeping the nation.

The states named by the CDC in the outbreak, with case counts tabulated by the states' public health officials are:
- California, which had 919 cases in 2017.
- Indiana, which had 20 cases in 2017 and 71 so far in 2018.
- Kentucky, with 448 cases since August 2017, including 315 hospitalizations and 4 deaths. The most recent death was reported this past week [week of 1 May 2018].
- Michigan, with 828 cases, 665 hospitalizations and 26 deaths since the outbreak was declared there in August 2016.
- Utah, 149 cases in 2017 and 82 so far this 2018, with 2 deaths.

In addition, public health officials in Hawaii, Idaho, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Maryland say cases in those states are or could be linked to outbreaks elsewhere, according to a survey responses provided to Food Safety News.

Missouri reported 27 cases in 2017 and 73 so far in 2018. Officials there say the cases are the result of an outbreak there and said none of the people affected reported traveling to states with ongoing outbreaks during their likely period of exposure.

Officials don't know where or exactly when the outbreak started. They haven't found what Marler calls an index case, or the 1st illness. They know many cases in different states are part of one outbreak because samples from infected people have undergone whole genome sequencing and they have the same genetic fingerprint. The start could have come from an unvaccinated person who traveled to a country or area where the virus is endemic, or someone who ate, say, imported frozen sushi or strawberries that carried the virus.

In recent days, Indiana public health officials warned that people going to Kentucky should be vaccinated. Kentucky health officials, meanwhile, insist it's safe to come to their state.

While the CDC in 2006 urged that all 1- to 2-year-old children should be vaccinated, it has not taken the step of requiring foodservice workers to get the vaccine. In response to the ongoing outbreak, Kentucky has enacted a requirement that all children, regardless of age, who attend public school must be vaccinated before the 2018-19 school year begins.

The current outbreak has been spreading quickly through the homeless population, in part because people who are homeless often don't have access to restrooms and hand-washing facilities. It's also prevalent among people who share needles when using illegal drugs. Other groups at risk are men who have sex with men and people who travel to places where the virus is endemic.

In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause a sudden loss of liver function, especially in older adults or people with chronic liver diseases. Acute liver failure requires a stay in the hospital for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant.

State-by-state counts show hepatitis illnesses up and down
----------------------------------------------------------
Food-related outbreaks of hepatitis A are often associated with contamination of food during preparation. That can happen when a foodservice worker is infected by the highly contagious liver disease.

Person-to-person transmission of hepatitis A occurs via the "fecal-oral route," meaning infected food handlers who don't practice good enough hand-washing techniques can contaminate the foods and beverages they prepare or serve. And, because the peak time of infectivity usually occurs a couple of weeks before symptoms appear, food handlers often don't even know they are infected and therefore continue to work.

Food handlers include people who stock produce aisles in grocery stores and those who maintain self-serve snack and beverage machines in convenience stores and gas stations.

Hepatitis A symptoms may not occur until several weeks after exposure and may include abdominal discomfort, fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a yellowing of the skin called jaundice. In severe cases, hepatitis A causes liver failure and death.

While the CDC recommended in 2006 that all children 1 to 2 years old be vaccinated, the CDC has not recommended hepatitis A vaccinations for food service workers. Some local public health officials have hosted vaccination clinics for restaurant workers in recent months as reports of infected foodservice workers, but the vaccination is not required by federal or state laws.

One hepatitis A-positive foodservice worker can infect large numbers of customers and cause thousands of others to seek preventive vaccines. Illnesses and vaccines can cost thousands if not millions of dollars, and can cost restaurants its viability either by a downturn in customers or civil lawsuits.

All of this is preventable by a vaccine.

Food Safety News contacted health officials in each of the 50 states asking about the incidence of hepatitis A cases. Not all states provided all of the information requested. Most gave only "preliminary" counts for 2017 and 2018.

- Alabama: 23 cases in 2017; 3 so far in 2018. The numbers are consistent with previous years. No probable source has been determined and no link found to state with hepatitis A outbreaks.
- Alaska: Zero cases in 2017. That is normal.
- Arizona: 59 cases in 2017; 8 so far in 2018; not unusual. In 2017, the CDC confirmed a 12-person outbreak associated with an Arizona homeless shelter was the same from the strain responsible for the outbreak in San Diego.
- Arkansas: 8 cases in 2017; 13 so far in 2018 (*new data [30 Apr 2018]); numbers are a little higher than usual, mostly due to person-to-person spread. The state is investigating but officials say they have not found links between Arkansas cases and other outbreaks.
- California: 919 for 2017; numbers are dropping in 2018, but public health officials did not give a number. The number of cases reported in 2017 was substantially higher than in previous years due to widespread infections among homeless and/or substance abusers. The original source for the outbreak has not been identified. However, once introduced, Hepatitis A virus spread very fast in people with limited access to restrooms and hand-washing facilities.
San Diego, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and Los Angeles counties have declared local outbreak status, and outbreak-associated cases have been confirmed in other California jurisdictions.
County-by-county breakdown for 2017: San Diego 586 cases, with 401 people hospitalized and 20 dead; Santa Cruz 76 cases, 33 hospitalized, 1 dead; Los Angeles 12 cases, 8 hospitalized, none dead; Monterey, 12 cases, 10 hospitalized, none dead; other counties, 17 cases, 8 hospitalized; none dead. Total: 703 cases, 460 hospitalized, 21 dead.
- Colorado: 63 cases in 2017; 5 so far in 2008; higher than usual, and officials say about 1/3 of the cases were from transmission between men who have sex with men. 20 cases were identified in this population, which is an increase compared to previous years. 2 cases occurred in persons who were homeless; other cases likely were due to international travel and exposure to household members who were infected. 2 cases in 2017 and 1 in 2018 are linked to outbreaks in homeless populations in other parts of the country. Several 2017 Colorado cases that occurred in men who reported having sex with men had the same molecular sequence seen in several New York City male cases who reported having sex with men.
- Connecticut: 17 cases in 2017; 4 so far in 2018; not unusual. Risk factors were normal, and no link was established to outbreaks elsewhere.
- Delaware: 6 cases in 2017, 2 so far in 2018; not unusual. Probable source has not been determined. Delaware has 1 case that was linked to an outbreak in the Baltimore area involving men who have sex with men.
- Florida: 275 cases in 2017; 42 so far in 2018. The numbers represent an increase over previous years, but seem to be dropping in 2018. Most cases are defined as sporadic and not linked to other known cases.
- Georgia: 24 cases in 2017; 7 so far in 2018; not unusual. Patient interviews are attempted for all cases, but are not always successful in determining source or risk factors. 1 case involved a Michigan resident who got sick and was diagnosed while visiting Georgia and 1 case was in a South Carolina resident; neither of those cases is included in Georgia's count. In previous several years, 25 to 30 percent of patients who were interviewed traveled internationally and were not vaccinated.
- Hawaii: 8 cases for 2017, none so far in 2018. 2 were matched to California outbreak. Others were unrelated to outbreak or to each other.
- Idaho: 5 cases in 2017; 3 so far in 2018; lower than usual. One 2017 case and one 2018 case were associated with international travel. It is suspected that 1 case in 2017 and 1 in 2018 are linked to the multi-state outbreak, which includes Utah.
- Indiana: 20 cases in 2017; 71 so far in 2018 (*New data May 4); higher than normal. Person-to-person transmission is the likely source for most of these cases, and risk factors include the usual ones. Many of the 2018 cases have been tied to the multi-state outbreak, which includes Kentucky.
- Iowa: 9 in 2017; 1 so far in 2018. No other information was available.
- Kansas: 6 in 2017; 2 so far in 2018. No other information was available.
- Kentucky: 341 in 2017 with 238 hospitalizations and 4 deaths. Statewide outbreak was declared November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several cases in Kentucky with the multi-state outbreak. The 10-year average in Kentucky has been about 20 cases per year. In April 2018, public health officials urged people to get vaccinated. The state is requiring that all public school students who are not already vaccinated get the vaccine before the beginning of the 2018-19 school year.
- Louisiana: 8 cases in 2017. Other information not available.
- Maine: 7 cases in 2017, two so far in 2018; not abnormal. No single common point of origin and no link to outbreaks in other states.
- Maryland: 29 confirmed cases in 2017; 10 so far in 2018. In 2017, more than 50 percent of the confirmed cases had no specific source identified; 25 percent reported international travel as a source of infection; some cases were genetically matched to strains circulating in New York and parts of Europe; and other confirmed cases matched to a strain circulating in Colorado; 1 of those Maryland patients had traveled to, and was potentially infected in, one of the outbreak states.
- Michigan: 632 in 2017; 112 so far in 2018. The state had 802 cases from 1 Aug 2016, to 4 Apr 2018, with 25 deaths. Between 2011 and 2015, 327 hepatitis A cases were reported. This is the largest outbreak in the state's history. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread.
- Minnesota: For 2017, 30 cases; 4 so far in 2018; higher than past 3 years, but within typical range over past 10. Minnesota has determined a source for some but not all of its cases. The most common risk factor is travel outside of the USA, and public health officials say the cases are not linked to recent outbreaks.
- Missouri: 27 in 2017; 73 so far in 2018; higher than normal. Public health officials say the cases are due to an outbreak in Missouri and don't believe they are associated with outbreak cases elsewhere.
- Mississippi: did not respond.
- Montana: 3 cases in 2017; none so far in 2018; normal. Foreign travel is most common risk factor. No connection to outbreaks in other states.
- Nebraska: 7 cases in 2017, 3 so far in 2018; not abnormal. No known connection to outbreak states.
- Nevada: 20 cases in 2017; 5 so far in 2018. This represents a slight uptick. None has been linked to outbreaks elsewhere.
- New Mexico: zero cases in 2017 and so far in 2018.
- New York: 82 cases in 2017. Numbers for this year were not provided. Numbers exclude New York City. Sequencing analysis available for some cases demonstrated that some are linked to outbreaks in other states.
- North Dakota: zero in 2017; 2 in 2008, 13 in 2009; 2 in 2016. No other information available.
- Ohio: 46 cases in 2017, 31 so far in 2018; higher than normal. Some cases linked to those in Michigan and Kentucky
- Rhode Island: 6 cases in 2017; 1 so far in 2018; normal. One case was associated with incarceration in San Diego county, as well as food service employment in LA county, and could possibly be linked to the California outbreak.
- South Carolina: 21 cases in 2017; 1 so far in 2018; not abnormal. Exact source generally not known.
- Tennessee: 7 cases in 2017; 6 so far this year; not unusual. One case got the infection in Michigan.
- Texas: information not available.
- Utah: 149 cases in 2017; 68 so far in 2018; state typically sees fewer than 10 each year, and those are usually associated with travel or other risk factors. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to national outbreak of Hepatitis A.
- Washington: 27 cases in 2017; 10 so far in 2018; not abnormal; no clusters. A few cases had exposure while visiting outbreak areas. None of the cases were homeless and no evidence of ongoing person-to-person transmission.
- Washington DC: 1 in 2017; none in 2018. Not abnormal. No link to other outbreaks.
- West Virginia: 6 cases in 2017 and 17 so far this year [2018]; slightly higher than normal. Source yet to be determined, but is likely caused by person-to-person spread. Some cases reported visiting a restaurant that employed a reported Hepatitis A-positive food service worker. One case has been confirmed to be genetically linked to the multi-state outbreak occurring in other states.
- Wisconsin: 16 cases in 2017; lower than normal. In 6 of the 2017 cases, the infection was acquired via travel outside the USA; 3 cases were likely from visits to states where known large outbreaks were. Numbers likely reflect known outbreaks in California, Michigan, Kentucky, and Utah, combined with the mobility of the population.
- Wyoming: 18 cases in 2017; 4 so far in 2018, significant increase because of an outbreak in Natrona county. Usual occurrence is 2 cases each year.
