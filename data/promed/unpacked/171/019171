West Nile virus [WNV] infection began to be recorded in Voronezh
Oblast [region] not too long ago, however it is of concern to the
local public health officials. The estimated mortality from this
infection is 5 per cent and the most dangerous fact is that the virus
may affect the brain. Since the beginning August [2011] residents of
the oblast have contracted WNV, 5 of them locally. One person has
contracted the infection while in Turkey. The high season for WNV
infection is August and the 1st half of autumn.

[WNV continues to be a problem in southern and eastern Europe, into
Russia. There are still many weeks to go before killing frosts halt
virus transmission, so more human and equine cases can be expected.

Laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection (WNV) have
been reported in a number of European countries. From the beginning of
July 2011 to 11 Aug 2011, WNV infection has officially been reported
by Albania (2 cases), Greece (22 cases), Israel (6 cases), Romania (1
case), and the Russian Federation (11 cases). The reporting reflects
higher awareness among healthcare workers, enhanced laboratory
capacities, and favourable weather conditions with rainfall and high
temperatures leading to a substantial increase in mosquitoes such as
_Aedes_ and _Culex_ species.

The WHO Regional Office for Europe, together with key partners -- such
as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the
European Network for Diagnostics of "Imported" Viral Diseases (ENIVD),
and the Network for Communicable Disease Control in Southern Europe
and Mediterranean Countries (EpiSouth) -- have been closely monitoring
the regional situation of WNV.

WHO encourages the Member States to consider implementing relevant
public health measures in order to minimize the impact of a potential
WNV outbreak in countries at risk.

In humans, WNV infection is often an asymptomatic or mild febrile
illness. About 20 per cent of people who become infected with WNV will
develop West Nile fever. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150
persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe
form of disease (also called neuro-invasive disease). People over the
age of 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant
patients) are at the highest risk for getting severely ill when
infected with WNV.

Taking into account that 80 per cent of infections with WNV are
asymptomatic and fewer than 1 per cent present with severe symptoms
such as meningitis or encephalitis, health care workers should
consider the possibility of WNV infections during the epidemic period.
Due to the unavailability of vaccine against human WNV infection,
clinical management plays a key role in reducing severe outcome of the
disease. At country level, laboratory capacity for diagnosis should be
available. Enhanced human and veterinary surveillance activities will
assist public health authorities to implement control measures at
source.

Efforts to prevent disease transmission should focus primarily on
personal and community protection against mosquito bites. The general
population, especially in the affected areas, should be informed about
the typical presentation of the disease and vector control strategies,
particularly in the domestic environment.
