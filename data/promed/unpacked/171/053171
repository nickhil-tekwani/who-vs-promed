Bird flu testing on 2nd farm
-------------------------------
Officials investigating an outbreak of mild bird flu are testing
birds on a 2nd farm in north Wales. A total of 9 people were tested
after the H7N2 strain was found in chickens in the 1st case at a
smallholding in Conwy, with 4 people testing positive. The poultry
had been bought from the Chelford Market near Macclesfield.
The 2nd possible case is about 35 miles (56 km) away on the Llyn
Peninsula, Gwynedd, with birds being tested because of links to the
market. [For Gwynedd, about 30 miles south/south-east to Conwy, see

Chief veterinary officer Dr. Christianne Glossop said there was a
police presence at the Gwynedd farm to ensure no "unnecessary access"
to the premises. The farm is understood to be on the outskirts of
Efailnewydd, near Pwllheli. She said: "We are testing birds at the
farm because of its link with Chelford Market on 7 May 2007. "A
decision on any further action required regarding birds on the farm
will be taken on the basis of the test results."
Health officials have stressed that the disease found at the farm in
Conwy was the H7N2 strain of bird flu, not the more virulent H5N1.
The owners of the Conwy smallholding at Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, near
Cerrigydrudion, have tested negative for the virus. The couple called
in a vet after the Rhode Island Red birds, which they bought at the
market about 2 weeks ago, had started to die. Samples from the birds
were sent for testing, and the virus was confirmed on Thursday [24 May 2007].
Earlier on Saturday [26 May 2007], Dr. Glossop confirmed the birds
had been bought at the market, which is some 70 miles (112 km) away
from the Conwy farm, and said it was being regarded as one line of
inquiry. [see map of Chelford at:
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=53.266&lon=2.2738&scale=1000000&icon=x%3E>
- Mod. AS].
She said: "An important part of disease control is finding the source
of infection. "It has to be a very thorough process with a number of
lines of inquiry to follow." Announcing the latest tests of birds on
the Llyn Peninsula, she reiterated her appeal for anyone who
purchased from or supplied to the market on Mon 7 May, and had not
already been contacted by animal health officials, to contact their
local office. Similarly, any poultry keeper who visited the market on
that day and whose birds have subsequently become ill should do so,
Dr. Glossop said.
"In the meantime, all bird keepers throughout Wales should continue
their efforts to maintain high levels of biosecurity and maintain
vigilance by continuing to monitor their birds for signs of disease,"
she continued. "If you are concerned about the health of your birds
you should seek the advice of your veterinary surgeon, if you suspect
that your birds have avian influenza you should report it to your
local animal health office."
Of the 9 people tested for the virus, 3 were taken to hospital, but
have now been discharged.
Chief medical officer for Wales Tony Jewell said on Friday [25 May
2007]: "I would like to reassure the general public that the risk to
their health from this outbreak is very low. This particular strain
is not highly pathogenic and is normally only contracted following
close contact with infected birds. In addition the symptoms are
generally mild."
Of the 4 people who have tested positive, 2 were from Wales and the
other 2 were from north-west England. The 5 people who tested
negative are being treated as having had the virus as a precaution.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) wants
to hear from anyone -- who has not already been contacted -- who
purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market, Cheshire on Mon 7 May,
or any poultry keeper who visited the market on that day whose birds
have subsequently become ill. They are asked to contact their local
animal health office or the Defra helpline 08459 335577. Lines are
open between 0900 BST - 1700 BST 7 days a week.

Avian flu update
As part of the ongoing investigation into the source of the H7N2 low
pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in North Wales, the Chief
Veterinary Officer for Wales Dr Christianne Glossop has ordered
samples be taken from birds at a farm in the Llyn Peninsula.
Dr Glossop said, "We are testing birds at the farm because of its
link with Chelford Market on 7 May 2007. There is a police presence
currently at the farm, to ensure no unnecessary access to the
premises. A decision on any further action required regarding birds
on the farm will be taken on the basis of the test results.
"As part of the tracing exercise, I repeat my request for anyone, who
has not already been contacted by Animal Health officials, and who
has purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market in Cheshire on
Monday 7 May 2007 or any poultry keeper who visited Chelford Market
on this date whose birds have subsequently become ill, to contact
their local Animal Health Office or the Defra helpline.
"All bird keepers in Wales should continue their efforts to maintain
high levels of biosecurity and maintain vigilance by continuing to
monitor their birds for signs of disease. If you are concerned about
the health of your birds you should seek the advice of your
veterinary surgeon, if you suspect that your birds have avian
influenza you should report it to your Local Animal Health Office."
The Defra helpline number is 08459 33 55 77. (Open between 9am - 5pm
7 days a week).

[The 1st, confirmed H7N2 focus, and the 2nd, suspected one, have both
been recorded in Northern Wales. The market which is regarded as
their common infection origin is in Cheshire, demonstrating the
potential of wide-scale spread of diseases through animal markets.
And, it is reminiscent of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus
spread through sheep traded in UK markets in February 2001.
From a subscriber in the UK we have received the following comment:
"The infected birds which died were bought at Chelford Market from a
private dealer and there is no traceable paperwork. I find it quite
incredible that after everything that has happened with regard avian
notifiable diseases in the past few years, auctioneers allow private
sales out of the back of a van to go on at their premises on a sale
day without any formal identification or inspection".
Seems deserving a thought. - Mod AS].
