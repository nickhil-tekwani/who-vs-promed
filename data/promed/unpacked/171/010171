Commoner [TG] turned 38 cattle out to graze on the [New Forest] National Park in spring 2021, but 18 were later found to have lost their calves. Testing showed they were all carrying neospora, a bovine parasite that can be found in dog excrement.

[TG] urged dog owners to bag up and take their pets' mess home. He said: "It's gut wrenching. It will take a long time to clear the neospora out of the herd and will have a knock-on effect for several years. Picking up dog mess will make a big difference and will be a big help to the commoners."

Vet Alex Coombes said it was likely the Hereford cross cattle grazing at Longslade and Wilverley became infected after ingesting soil and grass contaminated by dog faeces left on the ground. He said blood tests showed the cattle had been fairly recently exposed to neospora. "The danger is they are infected for the rest of their lives, and current studies show they are 6-7 times more likely to abort again," he said.

"I do wonder if the increase in dog numbers and people using the forest during lockdown has increased the risk of it spreading throughout the forest. Please clear up after your dog responsibly; don't just throw it away. This disease can hang around in the environment for some time." He said the neospora parasite seemingly has no effect on dogs, so owners may be unaware a dog is a carrier.

Issues including dog mess and attacks on livestock were highlighted in a recent survey by the New Forest Association, which found recreational activities were damaging the New Forest environment.

[_Neospora caninum_ is a protozoan parasite of animals. Since its first recognition in dogs in 1984 and the description of the new genus and species _N. caninum_ in 1988, neosporosis has been detected in various species of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and deer. Neosporosis is one of the most frequently diagnosed causes of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide. Furthermore, _N. caninum_ infections in dairy cows may also be associated with premature culling and decreased milk production.

In general, _N. caninum_ is similar in structure and life cycle to _Toxoplasma gondii_, with 2 important differences: (i) neosporosis is primarily a disease of cattle; dogs and related canids are the definitive hosts of _N. caninum_, whereas (ii) toxoplasmosis is primarily a disease of humans, sheep, and goats; felids are the only definitive hosts of _T. gondii_.

Although antibodies to _N. caninum_ have been reported in human serum, the parasite itself has not been detected in human tissues. Thus, the zoonotic potential is uncertain; for a recent literature review, see http://ajcmi.umsha.ac.ir/Article/ajcmi-3300.

Several approaches have been used to control neosporosis in cattle herds. These include improving farm biosecurity, test and cull programs, test and exclude from breeding, and artificially inseminating with beef semen. Biosecurity may prove beneficial to avoid introducing the parasite into a closed herd not already infected with neospora.

Farm management practices to reduce _N. caninum_ infection can include
(i) minimizing fecal contamination of cattle feed or water by canids;
(ii) prompt removal of aborted bovine fetuses and fetal membranes; and
(iii) limiting the introduction of infected cattle into the herd and culling infected animals.

If using the test and cull method of control, every animal must be serologically tested, and those that test positive must be removed from the herd. Test-negative animals should be periodically retested because titers tend to wax and wane, and there is a possibility of horizontal transmission resulting in new infections. This approach can be devastating depending on how many in the herd test positive. Notwithstanding the risk of horizontal transmission, a more economic approach would be to test each animal and exclude the daughters of seropositive cows from the replacement pool. If a cow is valuable, there is always the opportunity to preserve the genetics by embryo transfer into a seronegative dam.

It is possible to reduce the risk of neospora abortions in dairy cattle by inseminating seropositive dams with beef breed semen. This is effective because crossbreed pregnancies have a more robust placentation with higher levels of peripartum pregnancy-associated glycoprotein, which may have a protective value. Beef breeds in general and the Limousin breed in particular are more resistant to neospora infection than are dairy breeds. Beef cow-calf herds that manage their cows on range for summer grazing have lower seroprevalence than those that do not, while increased seroprevalence is associated with higher winter stocking density.

These control methods might not be economically or practically feasible on dairies or beef cattle operations. Buying replacements originating from seronegative herds can mitigate the risk of introducing infected replacements into a negative herd. General management efforts to reduce stress from concurrent disease, environmental and social stress, and providing an adequate wholesome ration may reduce immunosuppression and hence abortion rates.

There is accumulating evidence that some cows infected with _N. caninum_ can develop a degree of protective immunity against abortion and/or congenital transmission, indicating that immunoprophylaxis to prevent abortion or congenital transmission is a feasible goal. A commercial vaccine is not currently available. In the future, vaccine development is likely to depend on identification of specific neospora genes that may enable the production of genetically engineered vaccines.

Most of the above information is derived from a review by C T Estill and C M Scully, which also includes information on the epidemiology, lifecycle, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical signs of the disease; see at http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/34/11184708/1118470834-58.pdf. - Mod.AS
