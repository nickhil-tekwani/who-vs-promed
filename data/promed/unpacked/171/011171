Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis, United Kingdom
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 4 Dec 2020 from Dr Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer, DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Oct 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 3 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: December 2019
Causal agent: infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus [IHHNV]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Lincolnshire, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Oct 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: saltwater
Population type: farmed
Production system: closed
Total animals affected
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
White leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 1 (scale 0 to 5) / - / - / - / - / -

Affected population: The affected population consists of imported farmed shrimp. The animals are imported as SPF post larval shrimp and grown on for human consumption for the UK market only. Live animals are not exported from the facility, and with the exception of one movement to a bio-secure research facility, live animals do not leave the site. The shrimp are grown on in a fully enclosed recirculation facility, using artificial seawater made up on site and which is heated to 28 deg C [82 deg F]. The site is located inland, approximately 55 km [34 mi] from coastal waters, and except for a contained irrigation reservoir, there are no other water courses within 1000 m [0.62 mi] of the facility. All effluent discharges into a soak away, and waste is disposed of in a bio-secure manner.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: With the exception of one movement of live animals to a fully enclosed, bio-secure facility, which took place prior to the start of the investigation, there have been no movements of live animals from this facility. The site produces animals for human consumption only; the animals leave the site as raw product, on ice.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance within infected and/or protection zone, traceability, quarantine, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results:
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / gene sequencing / 3 Dec 2020 / positive
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / real-time PCR / 3 Dec 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is a virus that affects some farmed and wild shrimp species. Signs of IHHNV include sluggish swimming and motionless or sinking shrimp. Shrimp farms with infected shrimp may experience mass die-offs and an increase in shrimp with cuticular deformations. IHHNV may cause infection in yellow leg shrimp, giant tiger prawn, northern white shrimp, blue shrimp, and white leg prawn. The virus is not known to affect other crustaceans. A diagnostic test is required to confirm the presence of the virus in a facility or population. There is currently no treatment or vaccine available for IHHNV. IHHNV is not a threat to human health."
