Friedrich Loeffler Institut (FLI) epidemiological bulletin No.
05/2007, 6 Jul 2007
---------------------------------------------------
1. New reports (domestic fowl: suspected)
a. Case data
No. cases / date / Fed State / district / community / No. ill / No.
deaths / No. birds in flock / species
1 / 5 Jul 2007 / Thuringia / Saalfeld-Rudolstadt / Saalfelder Hohe
(Wickersdorf) / 0 / 1 / 5 / geese
b. Additional Information
The Thuringian Office for Food Safety and Consumer Protection (TLLV)
in Bad Langensalza confirmed the H5 subtype in a dead goose in a
small group of birds. This flock was destroyed as a precautionary
measure.
This cluster appeared clinically normal, except for the one bird that
died. Further laboratory results are awaited. Restrictive as well as
observatory areas were implemented [see commentary.]
2. Background
According to data filed with the National Wild Bird Data Bank, 9692
wild birds, dead or alive, have been tested virologically and/or
serologically for avian influenza, as part of the national monitoring
performed in Germany since January 2007. Of these, as of 5 Jul 2007,
452 birds were from the Free State of Bavaria, 131 from the Free
State of Saxony, 462 from the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt, and 88
from the Free State of Thuringia. Beyond quantification, wild birds
have been ornithologically classified, as well as assigned a district
area, where they were found.
The comparison of sequences by the FLI of the HPAI [highly pathogenic
avian influenza] H5N1 viruses from dead mute swans from Nuremberg, as
well as from the Leipzig area (Frohburg), revealed great similarity
(at least 99.5 percent identity) in the HA gene for these viruses.
Furthermore, a strong phylogenetic relationship exists with isolates
acquired in 2006 from southern Siberia and Mongolia. Together with
isolates from an outbreak among chickens in Afghanistan, a
phylogenetic cluster can be determined. This cluster is strongly
related to isolates that were acquired in 2006 from the Krasnodar
area (Russia) and from Italy (mute swan).
Further investigation performed in cooperation with the European
Union Reference Laboratory for avian influenza in Weybridge (United
Kingdom), compared the HPAIV H5N1 viruses mentioned above, recovered
from the mute swans from Nuremberg and the Leipzig area (Frohburg),
with those from the turkeys that tested positive from the Czech farm
(Tisova) on 21 Jun 2007. Here again, there was a strong relationship
revealing 99.2 percent identity. The degree of identity points to a
common, yet to be identified origin for these 3 viruses.

[The early, detailed, and transparent information above, refers to
the 1st H5 avian influenza case in domestic fowl in Germany in 2007,
relating to a smallholding, which included 5 geese and 5 ducks. Final
confirmation (as H5N1) is expected. The location of the holding is
indicated (orange circle) in the map of Thuringia at the source URL
above; the other 4 locations in Thuringia, where infected wild birds
have been found, are shown as red circles.
The FLI website at the URL above, includes separate tables for each
of the 4 Federal German states affected (Bavaria, Saxony,
Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia), with data on suspected and confirmed
cases in wild birds, as well as 4 detailed maps, updated 6 Jul 2007.
