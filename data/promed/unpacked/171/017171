This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Outbreak locations: Appenzell [Inner Rhodes] and Hinterland, Appenzell [Outer Rhodes].
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 5099 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 26

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: import of semen infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.
Epidemiological comments: all sows that received semen from boars from the German boar station were slaughtered. All sows positive in PCR received semen from infected boars. All other slaughtered sows that received semen from this boar station in the last 2 weeks were tested negative in PCR. Currently testing is continuing on all farms that received semen from the boar station and contact farms.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results

[A map showing the affected locations in (northern) Switzerland is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000012656_20121205_165553.pdf.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus, a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of the pig. 2 major antigenic types of the virus exist, type 1 (European) and type 2 (American). The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine, semen, and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. No other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV.

The above and additional information are available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf.

According to the epidemiological comments in the Swiss notification to the OIE, the PRRS virus was introduced in imported semen from a German boar station. In Germany's annual reporting to the OIE (2011), PRRS (in domestic and wild animals) is included among the diseases "for which no Information has been provided". Further information will be appreciated.

PRRS is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
