The Republican Agency on Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan reported that
on 17 May 2000, the first death this year due to hemorrhagic fever was
registered in Kazakhstan. The patient was 17-year young man, a citizen of
the Dzhambul province (oblast). He turned for medical help the day after he
was fed upon by a tick. The local physicians made the right diagnosis and
prescribed treatment, but they couldn't save his life.

[The initial report provided no more information about the etiologic agent
of this disease than does this one. Could be a flavivirus, could be
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Could be something else. Unless we
receive more definitive information about the etiologic agent, we will not
post further in this string. - Mod.CHC
