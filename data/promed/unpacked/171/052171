Influenza Epidemic Breaks out in Armenia
---------------------------------------------------
YEREVAN, January 13 - An epidemic of a rather heavy [sic form of
influenza has broken out in Armenia.
Many of those who have fallen ill with the flu have high temperature,
up to 40 degrees, and cough with symptoms of bronchitis.
The disease has most likely come from Russia and other European
countries, said Armenian chief epidemiologist Vladimir Davidyants.
Armenian health services are doing everything to localise the
epidemic. Clinics are provided with additional medicines.
In the past few days, first medical aid services in Yerevan alone
registered 600 cases when their teams came to people who were ill
with the flu.
