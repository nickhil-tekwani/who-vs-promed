1. Follow-up report no 22, submitted 29 Aug 2013
------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological comments: The Animal Health Research Institute (National Laboratory) has confirmed rabies virus infection in 2 wild ferret-badgers which were found in Nantou County, by direct fluorescent antibody tests. From August 2012 to 25 Aug 2013, the number of dogs and cats vaccinated against rabies is 386 923 in total and consists of 70 396 in Taichung City, 67 095 in Tainan City, 13 326 in Hualien County, 34 496 in Nantou County, 12 521 in Pingtung County, 115 318 in Kaohsiung City, 19 700 in Yunlin County, 28 557 in Chiayi County, and 25 514 in Taitung County. Intensified vaccination activities targeted at dogs and cats still continue on the areas where infected ferret-badgers were found. The monitoring is ongoing.

2. Outbreak summary [as of 29 Aug 2013]

[The summary report above includes details of the 107 outbreaks of this unusual rabies epizootic in Taiwan.

The 1st 3 ferret-badgers to be found, by RT-PCR, as suspected rabies cases by the National Taiwan University in June 2013 (subsequently confirmed by the national laboratory), had been found dead on 23 May 2012 (Nantou county), 25 Nov 2012 (Yunlin county), and 29 Dec 2012 (Nantou county). Since the initial diagnosis, surveillance has been widely implemented, discovering, so far, 102 additional rabies-positive dead wild ferret-badgers and one dead Asian mouse shrew, spread over the entire southern part of Taiwan (see map). In addition, one (clinically affected?) wild ferret-badger was destroyed (follow-up report No 4, Taitung City, T'ai-Tung, 28 Jul 2013).

There is no information, so far, on any suspected cases in other animal species in Taiwan. - Mod.AS

[2] Oral vaccination, early preliminary trials

After visiting rabies-affected areas and laboratories in Taiwan, specialists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday [23 Aug 2013] praised the Taiwanese government's "swift and comprehensive" response to the re-emergence of rabies in the country and reported the preliminary results of their oral vaccination study on ferret-badgers.

The specialist team arrived in Taiwan earlier this month [August 2013] to assist health authorities on prevention measures and have been working with the Taiwanese CDC and the Council of Agriculture to identify clear strategies for rabies control.

Ryan Wallace, one of the 3 specialists, said "surveillance systems to detect rabid animals have been in operation since the 1st reported rabies case [and] the laboratory response to diagnose the disease, which was previously not recognized in this country, has been equally impressive."

"The full extent of the rabies reservoir in Taiwan is not yet understood in its entirety. Further testing of rabies-suspect animals and focused studies must be conducted before we could understand the extent of the disease spread. For this reason, all counties and cities in Taiwan should be considered potentially to have rabies in their wildlife populations," he said.

Oral rabies vaccination requires years of planning, preparation, and studies, Wallace said, before questions of what type of vaccine to use, what type of bait to use, and how to target reservoir animals can be adequately determined.

In the study, the specialists used 3 baits that are available in the US and 3 ferret-badgers that were in captivity were offered the bait.

The goal of the study, in which only placebos, not actual vaccines, were used, is to see if the coating on the bait would attract ferret-badgers, and if it did attract them, how the bait would be handled: actually ingested or simply chewed by the ferret-badgers.

"The ferret-badgers, unfortunately, did not seem very interested in any of these baits," Wallace said.

Some placebo baits were also placed with cameras in settings where ferret-badgers have existed, but no video of ferret-badgers approaching the baits was obtained.

"The small preliminary study probably indicates that the baits we have are probably not ideal for an animal the size of a ferret-badger, and they may not be very good at attracting ferret-badgers to eat them, which is required for vaccination," he said.

"In the US, we are currently using 2 types of vaccine for oral rabies vaccination in wildlife, and both of those should be evaluated as options for Taiwan if you decide to go the route of oral vaccination, but it's a long process," he said.

Asked about the need for an animal experiment, Wallace said animal model experiments play an important role in describing pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy when a new virus or disease is found.

[In order to get orally vaccinated, the bait must be attractive for the target animal and it must be thoroughly chewed in order to guarantee that the sachet is punctured so that the vaccine is released into the mouth of the consumer, exposing its oropharyngeal mucosa. The investigators will have to determine the bait flavor preferences of the target animals as well as their feeding behavior and physiology. This will require a coordinated, multi-disciplinary, probably extended research effort.

How and when was the virus introduced, as well as why infection is limited to a single, wild species population, are other issues to be addressed. - Mod.AS
