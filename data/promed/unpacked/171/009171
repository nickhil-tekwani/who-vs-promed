The 1st case of potato wart in 3 decades was discovered in a field in central Jutland last month [September 2014], and now the authorities are afraid that it may have spread.

"We are taking the possibility of an outbreak of potato wart, which has not happened in 33 years, very seriously," Kristine Riskaer, nature authority NaturErhvervstyrelsen, said. "We know that the farm had already delivered 1/5th of its production to the factory before we were alerted, so we must conclude that there is some risk that the infection may have spread."

Riskaer said that talks will be held with potato farmers about good production practices. "The situation calls for accountability all round," she said.

NaturErhvervstyrelsen will continue to study fields at risk of infection to ascertain any potential long-term consequences of the fungus. The current outbreak of potato wart has occurred in potatoes that have been turned into potato flour.

[Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia (including the South Island of New Zealand) and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds.

On infected tubers, "eyes" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age and eventually rot and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, and both quantity and quality of harvested tubers is severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia (see link below).

There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.
