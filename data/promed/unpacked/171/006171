[The good news in the past week is that there were no new countries added to the list of those with WPV1 isolations or cVDPV isolations. The not good news is the ongoing transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan (6 in the reporting week ending 1 Jan 2020 and 6 reported by Pakistan yesterday [2 Jan 2020]; see media report below).

The numbers provided in today's global update will probably not be the final tallies for 2019, as there are delays in reporting. For example, with 2 newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 reported from the DR Congo last week, if you see the dates of onset of most recent cases, the date is 31 Oct 2019, suggesting a lag time of approximately 2 months. Hence, we may not have a final tally for 2019 until the end of February 2020.

Other not so good news is the continued positive environmental samples for cVDPV2 in Pakistan. The positive samples indicate there is continued circulation of the virus in Pakistan.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries -- 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific -- with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples mean that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Pakistan, 6 new cases (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh)
Date: Thu 2 Jan 2020
Source: Dawn [edited]
https://www.dawn.com/news/1525876/6-polio-cases-emerge-on-second-day-of-new-year


Five new cases of polio were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and one from Sindh on Thursday [2 Jan 2020], taking the national total to 123 since last January [2019].

According to the National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio, of the cases to have surfaced in KP, 2 are from Tank, 1 is from Bannu, 1 is from Dera Ismail Khan and 1 from Mohmand.

In Tank, the 2 affected children were a 30-month-old girl and a 5-month-old boy. In D.I. Khan, a 24-month-old girl, in Bannu, a 26-month-old boy and in Mohmand, a 6-month-old boy have tested positive for the virus.

In Sindh, the new polio case was reported from Dadu.

Of the 123 cases to have been reported since last year [2019], 88 are from KP, 20 from Sindh, 9 from Balochistan, and 6 from Punjab.

It is worth mentioning that in 2018, only 12 cases were reported while in 2017, 8 cases had surfaced.

EOC Coordinator Dr. Rana Safdar, while talking to Dawn earlier, had said that the polio virus had been rampant throughout 2019 due to a number of factors. "We have just started our battle afresh with the successful December [2019] nationwide campaign, the 1st since January [2019] as the April [2019] attempt was [affected] by the unfortunate Peshawar incident in which some persons staged a drama that children of a school were affected with polio vaccine," he said.

"Two follow-up national campaigns are planned in February and April 2020 that, along with efforts for improving the routine immunisation coverage, can turn the tide. However, collective efforts at all levels are imperative," said Dr. Safdar.

"Considering current risks, the National EOC urges all parents to proactively vaccinate their children against all vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, free of charge from the nearby health facility," he added.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 5. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death.

While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of 5 is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.

There are only 2 countries in the world -- Pakistan and Afghanistan -- where polio cases are being reported. Pakistan remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organisation due to which, since 2014, every person travelling abroad has to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

[These newly confirmed cases are also confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website: https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces. The media report highlights the absence of vaccination campaigns in the country in the interval from the January 2019 campaign until the December 2019 campaign, leaving infants from birth to age 10 months unprotected against poliovirus infection.

With the addition of these 6 newly confirmed cases, the global tally of WPV1-associated cases with onset of illness during 2019 will now be 149: 26 in Afghanistan and 123 in Pakistan.
