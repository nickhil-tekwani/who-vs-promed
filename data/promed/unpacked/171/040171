Mussel beds closed due to toxin
-------------------------
Officials closed all mussel beds in Galicia yesterday after identifying the
presence of Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin in the waters. DSP
is a toxin that produces gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Treatment is symptomatic.
While this seems to be an annual occurrence, there are concerns about the
economic impact of closing the beds to commercial harvesting of mussels.

[Information on Diarrheal Shellfish Poisoning toxin is available on the
website of The University of Miami, Marine and Freshwater Biomedical
Sciences Center <http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/science/dsp.htm>
"DSP is a gastrointestinal illness without neurologic manifestations
reported worldwide (ILO 1984, Halstead 1988, Aune & Yndstad 1993). It is
caused by the consumption of contaminated shellfish (Halstead 1988).
The first reported cases of DSP were in the Netherlands in the 1960s,
followed by similar reports in the late 1970s from Japan (Aune & Yndstad
1993). Since then, more than 1300 cases have been reported from Japan, with
the peak season from April to September. Other outbreaks have been reported
in Europe and South America as well as the Far East. In Spain, over 5000
cases were reported in 1981; In France in 1984 and 1986, over 2000 cases
were reported each year and over 300 cases were reported in Scandinavia in
1984 (Asomata et al, 1978, Yasumoto et al, 1980, Viviani 1992, Aune &
Yndstad 1993). Mussels exported from Denmark to France caused DSP poisoning
in over 400 people in 1990 (Hald et al, 1991). Finally in 1991 DSP was
reported in over 100 people in Chile; in 1992, DSP was detected in toxic
concentrations in shellfish beds in Uruguay (Lembeye et al, 1993, Mendez
1992, Aune & Yndstand 1993). Although DSP is reported worldwide, the most
highly affected areas appear to be Europe and Japan (Aune & Yndstad 1993).
The causative organisms are the marine dinoflagellates Dinophysis, although
there is an uneven distribution among species and location of toxin
production. These dinoflagellates are widely distributed, but do not always
form red tides. The associated toxins produced by the Dinophysis
dinoflagellates are okadaic acid and its derivatives; there are at least 9
total toxins produced by these dinoflagellates. (Asomata et al, 1978,
Yasumoto et al, 1980, ILO 1984, Lee 1989).
Clinical presentation
This is a self-limited diarrheal disease without known chronic sequelae.
There is no evidence of neurotoxicity and no fatal cases have ever been
reported (Halstead 1988, Viviani 1992).
Diarrhea was the most commonly reported symptom (92 percent), closely
followed by nausea (80 percent) and vomiting (79 percent), with onset 30
minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Complete clinical recovery is seen even
in severe cases within 3 days (Asomata et al, 1978, Viviani 1992, Aune &
Yndstad 1993).
Diagnosis:
A mouse bioassay using an intraperitoneal injection of toxin extracts with
a 24-hour waiting period is used in Japan and shellfish with DSP toxin
levels greater than 50 MU/kg are banned; similar surveillance systems have
been established in the European countries (ILO 1984, Viviani 1992, Aune &
Yndstad 1993). An HPLC method for detection of DSP toxins is available and
used in Sweden for monitoring purposes (Lee et al, 1987).
Management and Treatment:
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive with regards to short-term diarrhea
and accompanying fluid and electrolyte losses. In general, hospitalization
is not necessary; fluid and electrolytes can usually be replaced orally.
Other diarrhetic illnesses associated with shellfish consumption, such as
bacterial or viral contamination, should be ruled out (Aune & Yndstad 1993).
Molecular Mechanism of Action:
_D. fortii_ at levels of 200 cell/litre in mussels and scallops becomes
toxic for humans; the minimal amount of DSP toxins required to induce
disease in humans was 12 MU.
Okadaic acid, dinophysiotoxin 1 and 3 are acidic, while there is another
neutral group of toxins which are polyether lactones named pectonotoxins
and yessotoxin. Diarrhea is caused in mice when the acidic component of
okadaic acid is injected interperitoneally. Pectonotoxin 1 causes liver
damage in mice under similar circumstances. Both the pectenotoxins and
yessotoxin are lethal in mice with ip injection.
Okadaic acid is lipophilic. It is a potent inhibitor of protein
phosphorylase phosphatase 1 and 2A in the cytosol of the mammalian cells
that dephosphorylate serine and threonine. It probably causes diarrhea by
stimulating the phosphorylation that controls sodium secretion by
intestinal cells similar to _Vibrio cholerae_, although by a different
mechanism. Okadaic Acid also acts through the variations of cellular
concentration of the Ca2+ second messenger. It strongly increases the Ltype
inward Ca2+ current in isolated guinea pig cardiac myocytes. Finally,
okadaic acid functions not only as a tumor promotor (promoter of skin tumor
in the mouse using DMBA as the initiator), but it is also capable of
reversing cell transformation in some oncogenes.
