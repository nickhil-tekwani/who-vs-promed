FASCIOLIASIS, HUMAN - CAPE VERDE: REQUEST FOR INFO

We have had two patients diagnosed with _Fasciola hepatica_ in the last 2
months here at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Both are
men from Cape Verde; unclear what ingestion risk each had; both came to the
USA with a couple of months of abdominal pain and weight loss in Cape
Verde. One had a mild case, and the other had multiple "eosinophilic
abscesses" throughout his liver, seen on CT scan and confirmed by liver
biopsy, as well as 15 kg weight loss, 35% eosinophilia, and alkaline
phosphatase of 300. Both were confirmed by serology - ELISA based on whole
trematode antigen. We have treated one with triclabendazole (Novartis/Ciba
in Switzerland) and he tolerated it well.
We are wondering if other people have seen cases of _Fasciola hepatica_
here in the USA or in Cape Verde. Is there a high incidence in Cape Verde?

[According to the bible (Acha & Szyfres, 2nd Edition, 1987) there were some
500 cases in France during 1956-57 and a further 200 in the Lot valley in
1957. The common source was watercress. It is common in some French
departments, e.g., in HauteVienne there was an annual occurrence with 121
cases during 1955 to 1979. Also common in Italy, Poland, & England (40
persons in 1972). In Latin America it is underestimated in the literature.
Cuba -- 100 cases up to 1944 and many since; Chile -- 82 cases up to 1959;
also in Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico,
Dominican Republic, & Mexico. Basically, if you look, you shall readily
find. For example, in Jauja Province, Peru, in 1968-69 1,557 faecal samples
from children 7 - 14 years old revealed trematode eggs in 15.6%. In
Atlixco, Mexico, fascioliasis was found in 0.6% of the population. In a
bovine hyperenzootic area of Corozal, Puerto Rico, _F.hepatica_ eggs were
found in the faeces from 100 humans (1982). It should be noted that Acha &
Szyfres have no references on this human disease after 1982. - Mod.MHJ]
