Killer heroin report published
------------------------------
The outbreak was first discovered in Glasgow. A report into the deaths of
23 drug users, who died after injecting contaminated heroin, has been
published by a medical team in Glasgow. Doctors investigating the outbreak,
which also affected drug users in the Liverpool and Dublin areas, have
drawn up 12 recommendations to prevent further deaths.
The report describes an "unprecedented outbreak of severe illness" among 60
users in Scotland, mostly in Glasgow, between April and August 2000. It
said that 23 users died as a result of taking the drug, some within hours.
All of the victims developed a serious abscess after they had injected into
muscle or accidentally outside a vein. But it is still not known how the
heroin was contaminated.
Most addicts inject into their veins and oxygen in their blood kills the
bacterium [which is an organism that is exquisitely sensitive to oxygen in
the heroin. But there is no oxygen in [devitalized muscles, meaning the
poison [bacteria which would eventually kill them could grow unseen.
Greater Glasgow Health Board investigated the outbreak identifying the
bacterium _Clostridium novyi_ [as the etiologic agent in many of the cases.
The health board's Dr Syed Ahmed said that this discovery will help them
deal with future outbreaks. He said: "This is the first ever outbreak [of
this organism anywhere in the world. Clearly in the future if there are
one or 2 outbreaks this is the bacterium we will be homing in on. So it is
possible we may be able to identify the organism sooner." In many cases the
_Clostridium novyi_ infection caused untreatable multiple organ failure,
according to the clinical analysis of the outbreak which affected a 109
addicts in Scotland, England, and Ireland.
More than 40 people across the UK and Ireland are believed to have died
after taking the drug. A special police unit was established to deal with
the spate of deaths and medical experts from the United States were called
in to help track down the cause. Doctors initially feared the illness,
which caused severe inflammation of vital organs, was anthrax, but ruled
that possibility out after tests at the government's chemical weapons
research centre.
Greater Glasgow Health Board said it could happen again, underlining the
vulnerability of street heroin users -- and the need for effective
treatments. The 12 recommendations made include improving communications
between doctors and hospitals dealing with any further outbreak -- and also
the flow of information to users.
The recommendations are:
[1 When there is no obvious cause of death of a known drug user,
pathologists should be told immediately to enable necessary specimens to be
taken.
[2 When there is a risk of serious or unusual infection, doctors should
inform clinical microbiologists that patients are known drug users and
discuss what specimens should be taken.
[3 Information about any unusual infection in a drug user should be given
to the local public health consultant who should inform the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health.
[4 Tissue samples from living and post-mortem cases involving severe
tissue infection should receive additional treatment.
[5 Steps should be taken to ensure hospital laboratories are maintained
with qualified staff to enable them to cope with such outbreaks.
[6 A properly resourced prospective research study should be undertaken to
ascertain the underlying incidence and nature of soft tissue infection.
[7 Drug Action Teams should review arrangements for communicating
information for those at risk from future outbreaks.
[8 Health boards should review arrangements for receiving and treating
drug users.
[9 Drug Actions Teams should continue efforts to make drug users aware of
the dangers of injecting.
[10 In future similar outbreaks, there should be pro-active, consistent,
and open communication with the media.
[11 The coordinating health board should use a pre-existing outbreak
website to disseminate information, available, and publicized on
commonly-used search engines.
[12 An international meeting should be convened to consider what lessons
should be learnt from the outbreak and what could be done to prevent future
incidents.
A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) is due to open at Glasgow Sheriff Court next
month into the deaths of 18 men and women from Glasgow who died from the
apparently contaminated drug batch, which is now believed to have come from
Afghanistan.
