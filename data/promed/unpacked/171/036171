South Africa's agriculture ministry today [19 Feb 2018] reported highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu outbreaks involving Western Cape province sea birds, including African penguins that will be treated for their illnesses because of their endangered status.

In a statement, officials said 7 birds from 6 sites on the province's coastline have tested positive for the virus. One of the birds has survived, and the treatment protocol involves nutrition, hydration, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics, as needed.

South Africa reported its 1st H5N8 outbreak in poultry in June 2017 and has noted a few detections in wild birds, though no outbreaks have been reported in poultry since October.

In H5N8 developments elsewhere, Iraq yesterday [Sun 18 Feb 2018] reported 2 more outbreaks on poultry farms, one that began on [11 Feb 2018] in Diyala province and another that began on [12 Feb 2018] in Baghdad province, according to a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Over the 2 locations, the virus killed 52 750 of 95 200 susceptible poultry, and authorities destroyed the survivors as part of outbreak response.

[HPAI H5N8 virus appeared in Great Britain in December 2016, and then it spread to many regions of the old world. In South Africa, control measures have halted the outbreaks in poultry (the last one was in October 2017), but this report shows that the virus is still circulating in the region.

The African penguin (_Spheniscus demersus_) is a species confined to southern African waters. African penguin populations, which breed in Namibia and South Africa, have declined by 95 percent since pre-industrial times.

[Iraq's follow-up report No. 5 of the Iraqi HPAI H5N8 event, published Mon 18 Feb 2018, is available, with an interactive map showing the 2 new outbreaks' locations, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=25979. Since the start of the event in Iraq, on 27 Dec 2017, a total of 8 outbreaks in poultry have been reported to the OIE involving the following accumulated epidemiological statistics:

Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
478 400 / 266 550 / 224 540 / 253 860 / 0.
