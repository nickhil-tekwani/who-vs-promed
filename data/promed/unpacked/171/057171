The recent death of a man from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare
brain infection carried by mosquitoes, was the first from the disease in
the country this year, state health officials said.
The patient, aged 44, of West Warwick, died June 21. The cause of death was
confirmed Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Only five to 10 people nationwide are infected each year, according to the
state Health Department.
The virus is carried by mosquitos that breed in swamps and contract EEE by
feeding on the blood of infected wild birds. Sometimes, the virus is
acquired by mosquitos that bite humans and horses outside the swamps. The
virus cannot be passed between humans or from horses to humans except by
mosquitoes.
The disease, characterized by fever, muscle aches and nausea, is fatal in
30 to 50 percent of all cases, health officials said.
