A young Romanian woman showing bird flu-like symptoms has been admitted to
the contagious diseases hospital in Bucharest, the hospital's director
Adrian Streinu-Cercel said. The 25 year old woman, who "has respiratory
problems", comes from Sita Buzaului, a village in central Romania where
bird flu is suspected, Streinu-Cercel said.

Romanian health authorities are on the hunt for several dozen tonnes of
chicken products produced at a farm in Codlea, central Romania, where the
deadly H5N1 strain of the flu was found last weekend. They fear the virus
may have contaminated chicken products shipped to supermarkets.

The scare comes as the eastern European country awaits a decision Tuesday
from Brussels about joining the European Union, with EU officials already
worried about food safety in Romania.

Bird flu has been confirmed at 56 sites in Romania since the disease first
surfaced in October 2005 in the country's Danube delta. There have so far
been no confirmed cases of it spreading to humans.
