A disease that rots lobsters' shells and can kill the crustaceans affects 30
percent of lobsters along the New England coast, damaging the industry in
many areas, scientists said Wednesday.
The disease's cause and how it spreads remain a mystery, though theories are
emerging, and the scientists said they would seek state and federal money
for more studies.
The disease does not taint the lobsters' meat but makes shells too unsightly
to serve whole. It can weaken lobsters so much that some die prematurely.
Researchers in the region first noticed the disease in the 1980s, with
shells marked by little black spots. But in recent years, the researchers
said, shells have become fully enveloped by the disease and, in the worst
cases, have rotted entirely.
Scientists said trawl and trap studies showed egg-carrying females were most
susceptible to the disease. The studies also showed lobsters living in
warmer waters appeared to contract the disease more readily.
Hans Laufer, a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology at the
University of Connecticut, said he believed lobsters might contract the
disease from alkylphenols, chemicals that are byproducts from industrial
sources. Laufer stressed his studies were preliminary.
In 1999, the lobster industry in Rhode Island generated $30 million and
employed 425 fishermen, according to Mark Gibson of the state Department of
Environmental Management. 4 years later, the industry produced $16.7
million and employed 279.

[Undoubtedly the lobster industry has declined. There have been a number of
lobster die-offs in the last decade. Many arguments as to the cause(s) may
be made, including pesticides and warmer waters, the latter promoting more
bacteria and viruses. However, the ultimate cause remains elusive; if the
industry is to survive, clearly some research into the demise of the lobster
is needed. - Mod.TG]
