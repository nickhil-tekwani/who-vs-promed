Hepatitis E Fact sheet
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>)
commented that there is no evidence for transmission of hepatitis E
virus by transfusion. The following 2 comments make it clear that
this information is incorrect. - Mod.CP]

There are several genotypes of hepatitis E virus [HEV]. Genotype 1
and 2 infect humans, genotype 3 mainly swine. Infection with genotype
3 among swine is worldwide, independent of prevalence of hepatitis E
virus infection in humans in the respective region. Transmission
between swine is likely to be faecal-oral. Uninfected swine are
infected in the presence of infected swine within weeks. Prevalence
depends upon the region of the world and upon the age of swine.
Antibody prevalence at the age of 4 months is 50 to 90 percent. RNA
prevalence in serum and faeces is between 5 and 55 percent and is
highest at the age of 2 to 4 months.

This genotype 3 is the one which is found in so-called autochthonous
transmissions. How the virus is transmitted from swine to humans is
not clear. In France, a surgeon was infected who trained his surgical
technique on swine (Colson et al. 2007). Some Japanese publications
reported transmission by uncooked or undercooked liver or meat from
swine, boar or venison (Matsuda et al. 2003, Tei et al. 2003, Yazaki
et al. 2003, Tamada et al. 2004, Masuda et al. 2005). Infection was
confirmed epidemiologically by disease of persons who ate or by
demonstration of virus in the meat not eaten (Tei et al. 2003, Li et
al. 2005). Yazaki et al. (2003) found HEV RNA in 7 of 363 swine
livers bought in grocery stores, Feagins et al. 2007 in 14 of 127
livers bought in the US. Two out of 3 of these RNA positive livers
were infectious when fed to naive swine. Recently, an epidemic in
Italy was published apparently caused by locally produced sausages.

As there is a viraemic phase in hepatitis E virus infection, the
virus may be transmitted by blood. There are at least 6 documented
transmissions by blood transfusion; there are, furthermore,
documented transmissions by transplantation. The risk for plasma
products is unclear as there is no reason to assume that the virus is
inactivated by one of the current virus inactivation methods, i.e.
the solvent detergent procedure (the method acts on the virus
envelope, and hepatitis E virus is not enveloped).

Most infections may go unnoticed because either HEV infection is not
suspected and not tested for and/or genotype 3 may cause a milder
form of disease in humans. Seroprevalence studies with more recent
tests show a seroprevalence around 10 percent and more.

I'd like to draw to attention to a recent summary of hepatitis E
virus (HEV) transfusion transmissions. Such events were initially
reported from particularly Japan, yet more recently also from e.g.
Germany (see below). More complete information is available from
PubMed; interested readers should use the search phrase "HEV
transfusion transmission".

Hepatitis E virus infection: a paradigm shift?] [In German]

By Pischke S, Potthoff A, Hauroder B, Schlue J, Manns MP, Cornberg M,

Abstract: Hepatitis E is an infectious disease caused by the
hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly a self-limiting
travel-associated disease without chronic evolution. In recent years,
an increasing number of autochthonous HEV-infections has been
described in industrialized countries. HEV-infections frequently take
a mild clinical silent course of disease in immunocompetent
individuals, and thus HEV infection is largely under-diagnosed.
Therefore, the anti-HEV-prevalence is much higher than anticipated
with 2-20 percent in Western Europe.

HEV genotype 3 infections must be considered as zoonotic infections,
with several animals, including swine, serving as reservoirs. Cases
of HEV-transmissions by blood transfusion were described not only in
Asia but also in France and the UK. HEV-infections may take severe
courses in pregnant women and patients with chronic liver diseases,
sometimes leading to acute liver failure. In addition, several
centres described cases of progressive chronic HEV-infection in organ
transplant recipients and HIV-positive patients during the last 2
years. In this review, we summarize the current state-of-the-art on
the knowledge of HEV-infections in industrialised countries.
