Signs of whirling disease have been found at the Midway fish hatchery and
it will mean the loss this season of more than 300 000 catchable rainbow
trout, 21 percent of the catchable fish stocked in Utah each year.
Traces of the parasitical disease were detected through new DNA testing.
Standard tests continued to be negative, the state Division of Wildlife
Resources (DWR) said.
It is the first time the disease has been found in a state-operated
hatchery in Utah. The affected fish were found in dirt raceways at the
lowest portion of the hatchery, closest to Deer Creek Reservoir, where the
parasite recently was confirmed.
It was believed the disease was introduced at the hatchery by fish-eating
birds or other predators.
The state Fish Health Board agreed to have 220 000 7- to 9-inch fish,
which did not test positive for the disease, stocked in Jordanelle
Reservoir, which also has tested positive for the parasite, said Tom
Pettengill, DWR sport fisheries and aquatic education coordinator.
Another 600 000 2-inch fish will be released at the Jordanelle and Deer
Creek reservoirs, but, because of their small size, only a small percentage
are expected to survive and grow large enough to be caught.
Most of the catchable fish from Midway are stocked in northern, central and
northeastern waters. To lessen the impact on these waters, some of the fish
that would have been stocked in southern Utah from other hatcheries will be
put in the northern waters."People are going to notice the loss of fish
statewide, not just in the northern part of the state," Pettengill said.
To make the best use of the available fish, the division will put most of
them into reservoirs and lakes instead of rivers and streams. Pettengill
said the fish survive better in the reservoirs and lakes, which means a
higher return to the anglers.
Whirling disease is caused by parasites attacking cartilage in the head and
spine of young trout, deforming the fish. In advanced stages, the nervous
system is affected and fish swim in circles. It is not harmful to humans.
The disease was first discovered in Utah in 1991 in a hatchery owned by the
family of Gov. Mike Leavitt on Spring Creek in Wayne County.
Strawberry Reservoir, Utah's premier trout fishery about 30 miles southeast
of Midway, has not been affected.
Joe Valentine, who heads the DWR fish hatchery system, was surprised at how
quickly the disease has spread through the Provo River system. When it was
first found near Woodland above Jordanelle Reservoir last August, he
thought it would take 10 years to spread to the hatchery, not 10 months.
The loss of the fish has far-reaching consequences for businesses selling
fishing gear in addition to the financial health of the DWR, which relies
heavily on revenue produced by the sale of 500 000 fishing licenses each
year.
Byron Gunderson of Holladay's Fish Tech Outfitters said now would be a good
time to reduce trout limits statewide and heavily promote catch-and-release
angling.
