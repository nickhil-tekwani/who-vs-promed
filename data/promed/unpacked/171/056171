Uganda: nodding disease or 'river epilepsy'
-------------------------------------------
A rare and unexplained brain disease has affected hundreds of Ugandan
children, health workers say. The "nodding disease" causes seizures,
and affected children become physically and mentally stunted, which
can lead to blindness and even death.

"Nodding disease" is not unknown to medical science, but the
best-known concentration of cases had previously been reported from
southern Sudan. A medical NGO in the Mundri area of western Equatoria
had reported an estimated 300 cases around 2003.

Northern Uganda's Kitgum district, an area recovering from 2 decades
of civil war, appears a new epicentre of the disease. Local leaders
Obonyo Yokoyedo told IRIN that 200 children in his village of Okidi
alone had the illness. "We have lost 3 girls... one drowned in a well
during a seizure; the other 2 went several weeks without eating," he
said.

Janet Oola, Kitgum health officer, said hundreds of children had
presented symptoms of the "nodding disease" in the district in 2008.
"It is an early stage of epilepsy," she added.

A likely cause of the disease is a neurological effect of the
parasitic worm that causes onchocerciasis (river blindness). Recently
published medical research supports a link and doctors who have
studied nodding in the field say the 2 are connected.

Prof James Tumwine of Makerere University in Kampala, who
participated in a WHO-sponsored investigation into the outbreak in
Sudan, described the disease as a form of epilepsy linked to
onchocerciasis. However he told IRIN he found it "incredible" that
such a large number of cases were being reported in Uganda. "The
infected children need immediate treatment for seizure and
onchocerciasis."

Ugandan health ministry officials confirmed the disease had been
reported in northern Uganda, but its cause was yet to be established.
"It has spread to many villages in Kitgum, and we are working with
WHO to establish the cause," Paul Kagwa, ministry spokesman told
IRIN. "At the moment, it is still a mysterious disease."

River blindness is transmitted by black flies infected by the
filarial worm _Onchocerca volvulus_. It is endemic in 30 African
countries. A major public health campaign focuses on annual treatment
with the drug ivermectin, supplied free by manufacturer Merck & Co
Inc. The programme in Africa has over 50 million people receiving
treatment.

A medical officer in Uganda's northern Gulu district, who preferred
anonymity, told IRIN that cases of nodding disease had been reported
in Awere village in 2008. A health ministry team visited Gulu,
Kitgum, and Pader and found that the disease was more common among
people living near streams. Five streams -- Pager, Lakankodi, Adinga,
Lanyalyang, and Anyuka -- cut across the affected villages.

Proving the link has not been easy, and research into other possible
causes such as toxins has not produced answers. An epidemiological
study in 2004 was inconclusive.

A study in December 2008 suggests that the "seizure disorder" had
been reported in Tanzania as long ago as the 1960s and should be
treated as a "syndrome" whose possible link to onchocerciasis was
"intriguing."

In June 2009, a review of studies in 8 African countries, including
Uganda, looked at the statistical links between river blindness and
epilepsy and found that for every 10 percent increase in the
prevalence of onchocerciasis, epilepsy rates go up 0.4 percent.

The report's authors say they found "a close epidemiological
association between the 2 diseases" in the data of over 70 000
patients. The study, in the PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases journal
goes on to suggest a new terminology: Should a causative relationship
be demonstrated, onchocerciasis [...] could thus also be called
"river epilepsy."

Epilepsy affects some 50 million people worldwide, according to the
WHO. "Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or
muscle jerks, to severe and prolonged convulsions," according to a
WHO fact sheet.

Grace Lanyero, a psychiatrist at Kitgum government hospital, said
food seemed to trigger off the attacks among the children she has
seen. "This is a seizure, which begins when the victim begins to
eat," she told IRIN. "The child starts nodding with uncoordinated
hand movements that don't reach the mouth." The affected children,
she added, were being treated with anti-convulsive drugs and
medicines to relax the muscles and control nodding.

[One parent] cannot understand what ails her 2 grandchildren, who
have been bedridden for 3 weeks. The children nod endlessly whenever
food is presented to them, and cannot eat properly. "I tried all
means of treatment in Kitgum government hospital, but nothing
[worked]," she said. "I even tried a traditional healer who
slaughtered a black goat but nothing has worked."

[Another parent] from Pajule village in Pader District told IRIN that
her 14-year-old son developed the complication in mid-2005. All
attempts to treat him have failed. "He started presenting unusual
behavior; whenever food is brought for him, he nods and fails to put
food into his mouth," she said. Sometimes, he would appear to have
lost his memory, start nodding, and eventually fall to the ground.
The boy's father, developed similar symptoms and eventually lost his
sight, Aweko said.

The WHO website cites nodding disease as an example of a disease that
is not fully understood.

[The emergence of cases of nodding disease in Kitgum district
indicates the disease is becoming more widespread in the region.
Cases have been reported in Sudan dating back to the 1980s (see
references below), Uganda and Tanzania, and an association of
epilepsy with onchocerciasis has been postulated and studied since
the 1990s (see references below).

The findings of studies into this association in the Sudan were
summarized in a WHO document discussing the circumstantial evidence
suggesting there may be a link between nodding disease and
onchocerciasis:

"Dr Hans Remme reported on existing data from WHO on nodding disease.
The information revealed that the occurrence of nodding disease
appears to be focused on one district in South Sudan, Mundri. 4
investigations were conducted in 2001 and 2002. Based on 87
documented cases, nodding and/or seizures are initial symptoms. Other
symptoms include: severe stunting, poor sexual development, and
mental retardation. The age of onset was mostly found to be 9-16
years.

"Nodding disease may be similar to the "Nakalanga" syndrome reported
[along the Nile near Jinja in eastern Uganda] some years ago for
which a link with onchocerciasis was suggested. It was observed that
no more new cases were recorded when elimination of the vector from
the Jinja Focus was achieved in the late 1960s. New cases have been
reported in the Masindi District where ivermectin treatment is
ongoing while in other districts there is a decline in incidence.

"The link between onchocerciasis, epilepsy, and ivermectin treatment
is not at present clear and needs to be urgently evaluated. No brain
lesion was found at (computerized tomography) (CT) scans in 5
children in Cameroon with Nakalanga in comparison to controls. In a
study in Cameroon, Nakalanga and/or epilepsy cases had a higher
microfilarial burden than controls. Epidemiological data on the
frequency of epilepsy in relation to the endemicity of onchocerciasis
are inconclusive.

"The Nakalanga disease could have a multi-factorial cause, including
onchocerciasis and nutritional factors. The focal nature of epilepsy
could be due to co-factors including,
- other epileptogenic infectious diseases (more frequent close to
rivers than further away);
- a specific strain of _O. volvulus_, and
- genetic predisposition.

It was suggested that clarifying the link between epilepsy and
onchocerciasis on the one hand, and epilepsy and ivermectin treatment
on the other, could provide data on another benefit of ivermectin
treatment and could interest in particular donors such as UNICEF.

In view of the findings above, it has been recommended that
- the African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) should
commission a comprehensive epidemiological study on Nodding disease
in South Sudan, to complement available data and to verify and
further characterize the epidemic outbreak;
- a subgroup should be formed to develop an operational research
proposal for looking into the broader issues relating to nodding
disease, Nakalanga, epilepsy, and their association with
onchocerciasis and ivermectin treatment. The subgroup should consider
including in the research agenda a placebo-controlled study of
epileptics hospitalized for ivermectin/placebo treatment." (The full
document is available at <
http://www.who.int/apoc/about/structure/tcc/tcc22_final_report.pdf >.)

Interestingly, a review of studies addressing this possible
association with a meta-analysis of existing data, did not show an
association (see ref 3 below). Of interest, a table contained in
Marin B et al. comparing studies (both peer reviewed, and personal
communications) seemed to demonstrate statistically significant
associations between onchocerciasis and epilepsy in Uganda (refs 5,
6), Tanzania (M Tayler, unpublished communications to the authors)
and Burundi, whereas there weren't statistical associations in
studies conducted in Central African Republic, Cameroon, Benin,
Burkina Faso, and Mali. In contrast, in a newly published report by
Pion et al (see ref 7), the authors demonstrated an association
between the prevalence of onchocerciasis in a community and the
prevalence of epilepsy in the community, and explained the difference
in their findings from those of Marin et al as: "A major difference
between the review of Druet-Cabanac et al. [3] and our analysis is
that we introduced the quantitative dimension of _O. volvulus_
infection by defining the onchocerciasis prevalence in a village as
the risk factor." The authors speculated, "In areas of low
endemicity, the possible effect of onchocerciasis on epilepsy in such
an analysis will also be masked by the relatively higher proportion
of epilepsy cases due to alternative aetiologies." They further
explained that, "The mathematical properties of this relationship
implies that the higher the prevalence, the higher the proportion of
individuals with heavy microfilarial loads in the population."

It is clear that "nodding disease" is a real phenomenon in children
in Africa, and from a variety of studies, it seems to be more
prevalent in areas with very high endemicity of onchocerciasis... but
have Koch's postulates been satisfied in defining a cause-effect
relationship here? - Mod.MPP

[In Kitgum district, anecdotal reports indicate that patients with
symptoms of nodding disease have been observed in the district for
the last 20 years. The problem hasn't been well investigated due to
the war that has been going on in the region, hence contributing to
the escalation of the problem over the years. The burden of
onchocerciasis in the district wasn't known till March this year
[2009] when an expert team from The Carter Center confirmed high
endemicity of onchocerciasis in the sub-counties of Amida, Akwang,
Layamo, Palabek Gem, Kitgum Matidi, Palabek Ogili, and Mucwini. The
team found that close to 60 percent of children below 15 years of age
in the endemic sub-counties have onchocerciasis.

There is definitely need to investigate further and establish the
link between the nodding disease and onchocerciasis as suggested
above. This should guide the initiation of appropriate control
measures. Current control measures, however, need to concentrate on
treating epilepsy and initiating measures to control onchocerciasis.
Community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) should be
initiated in the district to control and eliminate onchocerciasis
from the district. This is the core strategy for the African Program
for Onchocerciasis control (APOC) <
http://www.who.int/apoc/en/index.html>. The strategy relies on active
community participation to distribute ivermectin treatment to people
who need it. The intervention should be complemented with river
dosing using acaricides to destroy the water crabs that harbor the
black fly larvae.

[It should be pointed out that neurocysticercosis is a possible
cause. At present, the link to onchocerciasis is highly speculative,
whereas neurocysticercosis is a well known cause of neurological
symptoms in African children. - Mod.EP]
