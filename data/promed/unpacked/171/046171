An explosion of reported early syphilis cases in Clark County [Nevada] since 2012 has been deemed an outbreak by the Southern Nevada Health District. [Las Vegas, with a population of 613 599 in 2014, is the county seat and most populous city in Clark County, which has a population of about 2 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas).]

Reported cases of the sexually transmitted disease have skyrocketed 128 percent in Southern Nevada since 2012, with 694 new-onset cases of the disease confirmed in 2015, the health district said.

An early syphilis case is one that has been contracted over the past 12 months, the health district said in a statement. "We are considering this an outbreak because disease rates in our community are continuing to climb and we see no plateau at this point," health district Chief Health Officer Dr Joe Iser said in the statement.

The recent boom in Clark County early syphilis cases is limited to Clark County residents, health district medical epidemiologist Dr Tony Fredrick said. Fredrick said it's unclear why the number of cases has jumped but the health district is investigating.

Of the 694 new-onset cases in Clark County in 2015, 615 were reported among men, Fredrick said. That's consistent with national statistics, which showed 91 percent of new diagnoses in the United States in 2014 were among men. Of those 91 percent, 83 percent of cases affected men who had sex with other men [MSM].

Fredrick said unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners are believed to contribute to these comparatively high rates. The Southern Nevada Health District's statistics are just the latest to show high rates of syphilis in the Silver State. Nevada had the highest rate of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases in the West in 2014, at a rate of 12.8 per 100 000 members of the population, the health district said.

[Las Vegas, located in the desert of Southern Nevada close to Nevada's border with Southern California, is a major resort city known primarily for gambling and nightlife, and is one of the leading destinations in the United States for conventions, business, and meetings. Notifiable diseases are reported by the jurisdiction (city, or state) of usual residence at the time of disease onset, not necessarily where the disease was acquired. As a tourist destination, it is likely that many additional cases of syphilis that are reported from other locations, were actually acquired in Las Vegas, as were many of the 694 cases of syphilis reported from Clark County, Nevada. For a map of Nevada that shows the location of Las Vegas, see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Las+Vegas,+NV.

The pattern of high and increasing rates of primary and secondary syphilis in men, out of proportion to rates in women, in Clark County is similar to that occurring in many other places in the US and elsewhere, and reflect an ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis and gonococcal disease, in men who have sex with men (MSM). Reasons for these rising rates in MSM are discussed in prior ProMED-mail posts (see also's below). - Mod.ML
