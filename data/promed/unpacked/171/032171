[1. Kazakhstan notified to the OIE on 9 Jun 2010 an outbreak of FMD,
serotype O, affecting cattle, sheep and goats in Kokchetav, the Aqmola
province; see, with map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9387.
This outbreak was preceded by mass mortalities in Saiga antelopes
(_Saiga tatarika_), suspected to be caused by the same FMD virus
strain.

2. According to Kazakhstan's reports to the OIE, vaccination was
widely applied during previous years. For example: during the 1st 6
months of 2010, "Routine vaccinations" covered 3 999 340 cattle and 7
917 900 sheep/goats. During the 2nd half of 2010, the numbers were,
respectively, 1 928 900 and 5 616 130. Has vaccination been prohibited
since? In case affirmative, why?

Information on the serotype of the virus involved, and on the country
of origin of the "new introduced live animals" which are reported as
the source of infection, will be much appreciated.

According to the results of the genotyping, carried out in July 2010
on the isolate from Kazakhstan, the causative agent of the 2010
outbreak was topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2; it was found close to
strains from Iran and Pakistan as well as to the 2007 strain from
Kazakhstan (see at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000N%20O%20Kazakhstan%202010.pdf).
