According to the Sudanese Ministry of Health, between 3 Oct [2013] and 5 Nov [2013], a total of 22 suspected yellow fever cases, resulting in 7 deaths, occurred in West and South Kordofan. The case fatality rate is 36.3 per cent, OCHA [the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] reports in its latest Humanitarian Bulletin.

Initial investigations indicate that the people affected came from Gengaro, Selegi, Masalit, Ghara, Alkarkar in Lagawa locality, Dumaik and Barno in Reif Asharqi locality, and Umaddar in Keilak locality. These people are reportedly seasonal workers, coming to Kordofan from eastern Sudan to work in the gum Arabic plantations.

In response, a small-scale vaccination campaign was launched on 29 Oct [2013] targeting 1000 people in the affected areas. To date, 400 of the 1000 people have been vaccinated. Seasonal workers travelling from eastern Sudan to the affected areas have been vaccinated prior to their departure to Kordofan. On 30 Oct 2013, a total of 2000 vaccine doses were made available in the 2 states.

The Sudanese Health Ministry is conducting [has conducted?] a yellow fever vaccination campaign between 9-12 Nov [2013], targeting 45 000 people who have not previously been vaccinated. UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) have provided mosquito nets, vaccines, and financial support to the Ministry.

Late last year [2012], there was an outbreak of yellow fever in [neighboring] Darfur region, in what the WHO termed "Africa's worst in decades." The total number of suspected yellow fever cases has reached 849, including 171 deaths (case fatality rate 20.1 per cent). A 3-phase vaccination campaign was conducted and about 5 million people were vaccinated in the 5 states of Darfur.

[Reactive yellow fever vaccination is already underway in West and South Kordofan where mobile populations are being targeted for vaccination to prevent further transmission. Surveillance and communications should be sustained to improve vaccine uptake and assess the impact of vaccination.
