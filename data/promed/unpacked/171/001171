Two Tibetans have died from pneumonic plague (a disease carried by mice and other rodents) in a southern county of Tibet. Chinese authorities are now ordering county residents to stay at home, local media reported. The 2 victims, who lived in Lhoka city in Lhoka prefecture's Tsona county, died in September [2022], a source living in the region told RFA, adding that no one has been publicly identified. "Moreover, people are not allowed to discuss it," the source said, requesting anonymity in order to speak freely. "But we have learned that the 2 individuals had been helping someone else showing symptoms of the plague. One of them died at a hospital in Tsona county," the source added.

A strict lockdown is now in force in Tsona, with county residents being told not to leave their homes, the source said, RFA reported. "And authorities are warning people not to talk openly about this issue, saying they will be charged with spreading rumours if they are caught." A statement made on [27 Sep 2022] by the Disease Control Center of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other official Chinese reports has confirmed 1 of the 2 deaths so far, saying the individual died on [25 Sep 2022] after developing breathing difficulties and a high fever. When reached for comment, the staff at the Tsona county's Public Office also confirmed one death but declined to provide further details of the plague's spread or the number of people now infected.

"We have been able to contain the rodent plague for now, so if anyone wants to travel to Tsona county, they just need to follow the protocols already established to stop the spread of COVID-19," the staff member said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, RFA reported.

Authorities in China's Inner Mongolia, issued a rodent plague warning in April [2022] in the region's Baotou city, warning residents to keep away from mice and other wild animals, after finding a dead mouse in Baotou, according to a [3 Apr 2022] report in the Global Times, the official media source.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or sometimes without having a preceding bubo, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to be the case here, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
