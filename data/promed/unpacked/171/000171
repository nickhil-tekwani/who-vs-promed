Ongoing outbreak of aseptic meningitis in south-eastern Latvia, Jun-Aug 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: J Perevoscikovs, A Brila, L Firstova, T Komarova, I et al, State
Agency Infectology Center of Latvia, Riga, Latvia]

Summary
-------
An outbreak of aseptic meningitis has been ongoing in several areas of
Latgale region, in the south-eastern part of Latvia since the end of June
2010. By 9 Aug 2010, 114 cases had been notified. Most of the cases were
registered in the city and amalgamated municipality of Daugavpils and
neighbouring territories. According to current evidence, 2 types of
enteroviruses, coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30, are the causative
agents of the outbreak.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
A large aseptic meningitis outbreak caused by at least 2 enteroviruses
(coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30) is still ongoing in the
south-eastern part of Latvia. The epidemiological pattern of the outbreak
(age and sex distribution of cases) corresponds to the usual characteristic
of the enteroviral infection, with the majority of cases in males and young
children or adolescents. The incidence of aseptic meningitis was high in
2006 and 2007, and low in 2008 and 2009. Although in previous non-epidemic
years (2007-2009), seasonal increases of enteroviral meningitis began in
May to June, this year [2010] the outbreak started later, at the end of June.

In view of the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections
and taking into account reopening of schools after the summer holidays,
further spread, importation, and transmission of infection to other Latvian
regions cannot be excluded. The risk of international spread is assessed as
not significant. Further monitoring and data analysis are to be performed
on a regular basis.

Ongoing outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with echovirus 30 in the
city of Novi Sad, Autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia, Jun-Jul 2010

Summary
-------
Since June 2010, incidence of aseptic meningitis has increased in Novi Sad,
Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. From 2 Jun to 25 Jul 2010, 80
cases of aseptic meningitis were notified, with an incidence rate ranging
from 10 to 366 per 100 000 population in different local communities. The
majority of cases (n=64) were aged between 2 and 15 years. Echovirus 30 was
cultured from 2 of 4 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The outbreak, for which
no common source has yet been identified, is ongoing.

Discussion
----------
Outbreaks of aseptic enteroviral meningitis are notified in the Autonomous
Province of Vojvodina every 4 to 5 years. The largest previous outbreak
occurred in 2000, with 461 cases reported that year (the incidence rate in
the province was 23 per 100 000 population and incidence rate in the City
of Novi Sad was 28 per 100 000 population). Outbreaks of aseptic
enteroviral meningitis were notified in all neighbouring countries
(Croatia, Hungary, and Romania) in the last 2 decades. In Kosovo under
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, an outbreak with a total
of 878 cases of acute neurological syndrome was reported in 2006 to the
World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe: enteroviral origin
was detected. Enteroviral meningitis outbreaks involved many communities
throughout other countries within Europe and also other continents.

As expected in temperate climate, the ongoing outbreak has occurred in hot
summer months, spreading by direct or indirect contact. Although none of
the common sources (contaminated food or water) has yet been implicated,
since viral meningitis outbreaks are sometimes associated with recreational
use of water, the use of public swimming pools had been considered a
potential source of infection in this outbreak but no such exposure of
cases has been identified.

Previously reported outbreaks of enteroviral meningitis have demonstrated a
predominance of males in child cases, with a sex ratio of 2:1. Our findings
are consistent with this. They are also in line with these reports that
find a large proportion (70 per cent) of cases under 15 years of age, but
there was a higher incidence rate (149 per 100 000 population) in children
aged 5-15 years.

According to its epidemiological features, this outbreak is likely to
continue towards the autumn months. No specific control measures are
available for non-polio enteroviruses. Good personal and communal hygiene
is recommended (thorough hand washing as a routine practice, prompt and
safe disposal of waste and faeces, and prompt washing or disposal of the
soiled articles in preschool and nursery facilities), as well as
disinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaning products, and
avoidance of shared utensils and drinking containers. All susceptible
people and parents of young children are advised to ask for medical help
immediately when there is onset of sudden headaches, fever, nausea, and
vomiting.

A 3-step model has been suggested for diagnostic procedures in order to
ensure comprehensive diagnostic investigation, including local medical
investigation and usual analysis (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
serology) of acute cases, then as a 2nd step, extended analysis of
suspected cases by a reference laboratory for commonly recognised causative
agents (or less common agents if indicated, such as, in returning
travellers), and finally identification of specific pathogens in cases with
unknown aetiology.

Monitoring circulating enteroviruses is important because individual
serotypes have different temporal patterns of circulation and the changes
in predominant serotypes can be accompanied by large-scale outbreaks of
enteroviral illnesses. Environmental surveillance has been used
successfully in monitoring enterovirus circulation and assessing the extent
or duration of epidemic non-poliovirus enteroviruses in specific populations.

Viral ("aseptic") meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in people with
normal immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days and the
patient recovers completely. Different viral infections can lead to viral
meningitis. But most cases, particularly during the summer and fall months,
are caused by enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses,
and echoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either
have no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with low-grade
fever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections
develop meningitis.

Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often
spread through direct contact with an infected person's stool. The virus is
spread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet
toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the
diapers of an infected infant.

Enteroviruses and other viruses can also be spread through direct or
indirect contact with respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal
mucus) of an infected person. This usually happens through kissing or
shaking hands with an infected person or by touching something they have
handled and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The viruses can also stay
on surfaces for days and can be transferred from objects. Viruses also can
spread directly when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets
containing the virus into the air we breathe.

The time from when a person is infected until they develop symptoms
(incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An
infected person is usually contagious from the time they develop symptoms
until the symptoms go away. Young children and people with low immune
systems may spread the infection even after symptoms have resolved. For
