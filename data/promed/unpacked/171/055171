Ref: Eckerle I, Corman VM, Mueller MA, et al. Replicative capacity of MERS coronavirus in livestock cell lines. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Replicative capacity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was assessed in cell lines derived from livestock and peridomestic small mammals on the Arabian Peninsula.

Only cell lines originating from goats and camels showed efficient replication of MERS-CoV.

These results provide direction in the search for the intermediate host of MERS-CoV.

Conclusions (excerpt)
---------------------
To identify potential intermediate host species of MERS-CoV, we used in vitro testing to determine virus permissiveness in select cell culture models. In general, cell lines cannot depict the full pathogenicity of in vivo infection because infection is influenced by epithelium-specific differentiation of target cells and the presence of immune cells. However, for viruses such as CoVs, whose tropism is believed to be determined mainly by the availability of an appropriate entry receptor, epithelial cell cultures could indeed constitute valid surrogates of virus permissiveness in vivo. With these limitations in mind, our results are in concordance with the findings of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in camels and with information regarding patient contact with animals in reports of 2 human cases of MERS-CoV infection. One of the patients owned a farm on which camels and goats were kept. Before onset of his own illness, the patient reported illness in several goats on his farm. The patient did not have direct contact with animals, but he reported having eaten goat meat and having had contact with one of the animal caretakers, who suffered from respiratory disease. The second patient reported direct contact with a diseased camel shortly before onset of his symptoms.

In our study, production of infectious virus particles was seen in goat lung and kidney cells and in camelid kidney cells. Excretion patterns indicative of kidney infection should be investigated once further clues to the identity of the MERS-CoV animal reservoir become available. Our preliminary findings suggest that ungulates, such as goats and camels, are a possible intermediate host of MERS-CoV; thus, exposure to urine and feces from these animals might constitute a source of human infection. Moreover, food products derived from these animals (such as, meat and milk) should be tested for their potential to transmit MERS-CoV. The results of our study suggest that investigations into the MERS-CoV animal reservoir and intermediate host should focus on caprid (such as goats) and camelid hosts, and we identified several new cell lines for use in virus isolation studies.

[The cell lines cultivated in parallel were, reportedly, from goats, sheep, cattle, camelids (dromedary and alpaca), rodents, insectivore bats, and human and nonhuman primates. In addition to livestock cell lines, the authors used rodent, insectivore bat, and primate cell lines in the experiments. Bat and primate cells known to be permissive for MERS-CoV served as controls.

Replication was seen in lung and kidney cell lines derived from domestic goats and in umbilical cord and kidney cells from camelids (_Camelus dromedarius_ and _Llama pacos_) .

The most efficient replication was seen in the goat kidney cells; goat lung cells, alpaca kidney cells, and dromedary umbilical cord cells also showed strong replication, but virus did not replicate in sheep, cattle, rodent, or insectivore bat cells. For further details, figures, a table, and references please refer to the original paper at the source URL above.

According to Qatar's notification to the OIE dated 28 Nov 2013, samples from the patient's farm were "collected from the 14 existing camels in addition to one sheep, some pigeons, and chickens and some environmental samples". Was the "sheep", in fact, a goat?

Special attention deserves to be paid to the authors' comment on the possibility that exposure to urine and feces from infected goats or camels might constitute a source of human infection. Such sources may potentially contaminate the environment, becoming a risk to people who did not come in direct contact with animals as, in fact, has been the case in a considerable percentage of patients.

Regarding animal feces as a potential source of infection, see also item [3] and commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20131113.2053932.

As the authors further suggested, there is need to study the potential of food products, such as meat and milk (from both species), for their potential to transmit MERS-CoV.

Clinical observations in goat and camel holdings in affected locations deserve to be intensified. - Mod.AS
