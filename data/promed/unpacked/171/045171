A young man has fallen prey to Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, CCHF], raising the death toll from the disease to 7 in the Karak district [Kohat division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa], locals said.

The latest victim, [a man from] Sarki Lawagher area, died in the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar after suffering from the virus for more than a week, according to relatives.

However, Dr Majid Khattak, the in-charge of the special unit established for dealing with the fatal disease in the local health department, told media persons [in Karak] on [Wed 1 Nov 2017] that the Congo virus had taken the lives of several people in the district, but the exact number was not available as the patients were treated in hospitals outside the district.

Meanwhile, deputy director livestock department Dr Naeem Shah Khattak informed reporters that so far the department had spent Rs 500 000 [about USD 4750] on the precautionary measures against the Congo virus.

He claimed more than 40 000 cattle had been vaccinated by the department across the district, besides fumigating different regions. He said people were fearful of the spread of the virus.

Mr Khattak said special kits had also been distributed among the butchers to keep them safe from the disease since the virus could transmit from cattle to humans. He said that a site had been selected for building a slaughterhouse in the district.

[The report of the 7th case from Karak district is a cause for concern, indicative of some underlying risk factors leading to emergence of new cases. The report above mentions animal vaccinations, while according to WHO, there are no vaccines currently available for animals or humans (see below) (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/)

"The following control measures are recommended in various sectors:
1. Controlling CCHF in animals and ticks
It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.

2. Reducing the risk of infection in people
Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in Eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.
In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Public health advice should therefore focus on several aspects.
Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);
- wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;
- use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;
- use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;
- regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;
- seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; and
- avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.

Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
- wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering, and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;
- quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughter.

Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
- avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;
- wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;
- wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.

3. Controlling transmission in health-care settings:
- health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.
- as a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.
- samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.
- recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever."
