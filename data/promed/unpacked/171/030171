Chinas latest SARS outbreak has been contained, but biosafety concerns remain
-----------------------------------------------
Update 7: 18 May 2004
It has been more than 3 weeks since the last case was placed in isolation
in Chinas latest SARS outbreak, prompting the World Health Organization
(WHO) to declare that the chain of human-to-human transmission appears to
have been broken. But WHO experts and the Chinese authorities are still
trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak. The investigation has
centred primarily on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, where
experiments using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus have been carried
out. Two researchers at the institute developed SARS in late March and
mid-April 2004. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and the institute was
closed a day later.
Preliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a single
infectious source or single procedural error at the institute -­ and it is
conceivable that an exact answer may never be determined. Neither of the
researchers is known to have directly conducted experiments using live SARS
coronavirus. But investigators have serious concerns about biosafety
procedures at the institute ­- including how and where procedures using
SARS coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus
samples were stored.
WHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of
laboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all member states to view this
latest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety practices of
institutions and laboratories working with SARS coronavirus.
During and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of specimens
were collected from possible human cases, animals and the environment.
These specimens, which may contain live SARS coronavirus, are still kept in
various laboratories around the world. Some of them are stored in
laboratories at an inappropriate containment level. SARS coronavirus has
also been propagated in reference and research laboratories, and
distributed to other laboratories for research purposes. Research using
live and inactivated SARS coronavirus -­ and other pathogens capable of
causing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories.
WHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and recommendations:
WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 Apr 2003)

Summary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS laboratory
workshop of 22 Oct 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/en/SARSLabmeeting.pdf>
WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS coronavirus
specimens and cultures (18 Dec 2003)
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/>
In these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL 3) as
the minimum containment level to work with live SARS coronavirus. WHO also
urges member states to maintain a thorough inventory of laboratories
working with and/or storing live SARS coronavirus and to ensure that
necessary biosafety standards are in place.
WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to contain the
latest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by way of extensive
contact tracing and the quarantine and medical observation of such
individuals. Once again, it has been demonstrated that SARS is a
containable disease.

[According to the above information, transmission of the SARS coronavirus
(CoV) in China has been interrupted after 3 generations of cases. It
appears as though transmission was interrupted very shortly after
identification of SARS CoV infection in the index patient from Anhui
province. Due to delayed identification of the etiology of this patient's
illness, transmission to 2nd- and 3rd-generation cases had occurred before
control measures were implemented. As soon as control measures were
implemented, further transmission did not occur.
As mentioned above, it is possible that an answer to the question of how
the 2 index cases who had been working in the laboratory might have been
infected with the SARS CoV may not ever be found. In the post-SARS epidemic
period (loosely identifying the epidemic period as Nov 2002 - Jun 2003), it
appears as though a significant risk factor for infection with SARS CoV has
been working in laboratories that are conducting research on the SARS CoV.
We hope lessons have been learned and this too shall be a historical note.
Increased awareness of the disease, early recognition, and early
implementation of control measures are all essential and effective in
interrupting person-to-person transmission and preventing a repeat of the
epidemic of 2003. - Mod.MPP]
