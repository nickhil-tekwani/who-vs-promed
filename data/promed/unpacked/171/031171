Extra outdoor playtime for children living rurally during lockdown is being blamed for an increase in a dangerous form of _E. coli_ infections.

The increase was recorded mainly in toddlers and children of primary school age during the 1st 4.5 months of 2021. Most of the extra cases were in children in rural areas and health officials believe lockdown was to blame as schools and childcare facilities were closed and children played outdoors more.

"Most of the excess of cases in the 1st 5 months of 2021 is accounted for by children 1 to 9 years of age, particularly in rural areas," the Health Service Executive (HSE) said. "This increase is largely due to children having spent more time at home, with greater exposure to the outdoor environment, during the closure of schools and the extended lockdown as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, during the 1st months of 2021."

The strain of _E. coli_ responsible, known as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, is found in the intestines of cattle and sheep and causes livestock no problem but it can be devastating in humans if they come into contact with it through animal feces, soil, or water contaminated with animal waste, or undercooked meat. It often causes severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea but can also lead to a kidney complication, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 5-10 percent of patients. Around 5 percent of those who develop HUS die.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) was notified of 244 cases up to the middle of May 2021.

[Earlier in 2021, reports of EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ ) clusters in Ireland were linked to serotype O26 and daycare centers. The serotype or serotypes of the cases reported here are not stated. It is likely that most of the cases are not related to one another as the risk factor appears to be outdoor play with exposure to the pathogens in the rural environment.

O157 is the prototype of strains of enterohemorrhagic _E coli_. O26 is one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include O121, O104, and O111. Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 percent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5).
