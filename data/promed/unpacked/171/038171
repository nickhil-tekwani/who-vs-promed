Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: the outbreak was detected following movement control activities carried out by the Official Veterinary Services. One horse, in the municipality of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, resulted positive by complement fixation test. The animal died from a snake bite before an additional test could be performed. The animal was buried on the farm.
The Official Veterinary Services conducted investigations on the neighbouring farms and on farms epidemiologically linked to the farm of the positive animal.
Clinical inspections were performed and samples were taken from 2 animals with suggestive respiratory signs; samples were sent to the National Agricultural Laboratory in Recife/Pernambuco (Lanagro/PE). One sample, from a mare in a farm located in the municipality of Varzelandia, Minas Gerais, was positive by complement fixation test. A mallein test was carried out and diagnosis was confirmed on 17 May 2012. The animal was destroyed on the farm under the supervision of the Official Veterinary Services.
Surveillance and clinical inspections of animals having been in contact with the sick animal as well as investigations in order to identify the source or origin of the disease are being conducted by the Official Veterinary Services. To date, no suspicion of disease in animals in the other inspected farms has been observed.

Control measures

[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Brazil is available at http://healthmap.org/r/2ser.

This report highlights an anomalous epidemiologic feature of this zoonotic disease in the Americas. Brazil is the only country reporting the disease but it is reporting it at fairly high levels and from multiple locations around the country, although most locations appear to be in the Northeast. For example, since 2005 there have been reports from almost half of the states -- 13 states out of Brazil's total of 26 states and the Federal District.

In 2011, according to OIE WAHID, there were 9 outbreaks reported from 3 states in the Northeast Region -- Pernambuco, Paraiba, and Rio Grande do Norte -- quite some distance from this current new case in Minas Gerais. In 2005, there were 34 outbreaks from 8 states, mostly in the Northeast again but also including Amazonas State. In 2006, the pattern continues with 25 outbreaks from 4 Northeastern states; in 2007, 30 outbreaks from 7 states were reported; in 2008, there were 50 outbreaks from 7 states reported; in 2009, 34 outbreaks were found in 5 states, and in 2010, there were 27 outbreaks found in 6 states.

Of course, to understand this pattern we must know about where the disease comes from and it appears we will not learn anything new from this outbreak. We also must understand the concentration of the disease in the Northeastern states of Brazil and why other countries in the Americas with similar epidemiologic factors are not reporting the disease, that is, does the lack of reports from other countries imply a reporting problem or the bona fide lack of cases due to variance in the epidemiology of the disease in these regions versus the Northeastern states of Brazil? Finally, does the epidemiology of the disease differ within Brazil when it occurs in Amazonas or Minas Gerais versus the more commonly identified Northeastern States? - Mod.PC
