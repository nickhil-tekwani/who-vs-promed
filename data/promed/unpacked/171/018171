On a related tangent, you may be interested to know that we are putting the
finishing touches on a distance-education survey-level epidemiology course,
Nursing & the Health of Communities. Its modules illustrate the roles of
epidemiology in measuring and promoting the health of communities; they
explain surveillance and screening, among other epidemiologic concepts; and
the course is built around federal and provincial annual reports on the
health of Canadians.
