The nation's only maker of the anthrax vaccine is about to be sold to an
investment firm headed by a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. The State of Michigan says it has accepted a $25
million bid from a subsidiary of Maryland-based Intervac for the Michigan
Biologic Products Institute. The state-owned MBP has a Pentagon contract to
supply anthrax vaccine for all U.S. military personnel. The massive
vaccination program began last year to protect against possible biological
warfare with Iraq. Contract details are secret.
Crowe tells United Press International today that, with the ongoing threat
of biological attacks, sales of the anthrax vaccine could expand beyond the
United States. He says, "We think the market is going to be pretty good."
The sale of MBP to Intervac subsidiary BioPort is expected to close this
summer, following approval from the State Administrative Board and First of
Michigan bank. Under the deal, the Lansing-based lab and its 184 workers
would be offered shares in BioPort, which was created just for the deal.
Crowe, who served as chairman of the joint chiefs under former President
Ronald Reagan and as an ambassador to the United Kingdom, is the lead
investor in BioPort. The state says the $25 million bid includes "cash,
secured notes, royalties and product donations."
MBP Chairman Dennis Schornack says about 20 companies had expressed an
interest in the lab, which has lost as much as $5 million annually for
several years. A $10 million bid from SmithKline Beecham

On pp255-256 of the May copy of ASM News there is an article on
"Bioterrorism: Microbiology key to dealing with threats", by an ASM staff
writer, Jeffrey Fox. This is an inside report largely from, and boosting,
USAMRIID. It ignores research elsewhere.
Towards the end there is this paragraph:
"Hence (in relation to criticisms of DOD), following soul-searching
negotiations and reviews, DOD late in 1997 established a $322 million,
10-year contract with with DynPort, a subsidiary of DynCorp of Reston, VA.,
to address these problems. DynPort will oversee a consortium of companies,
including Parexel, Southern Research Institute, McKesson Bioservices,
Kenimer & Associates, Cost Management Systems, and several potential
vaccine manufacturers including Covance, Oravax, and Greer Laboratories, to
evaluate experimental medical products, work with the US Army Medical and
Development Command to establish safety and efficacy of such products for
licensure by FDA, and take other steps to produce and distribute these
products as needed for US troops."
