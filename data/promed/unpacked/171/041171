10 additional deer test positive for chronic wasting disease in West Virginia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary test results indicate the chronic wasting disease (CWD)
agent was present in 10 hunter-harvested deer collected during the
2010 deer firearms hunting season.

"As part of our agency's ongoing CWD monitoring effort, samples were
collected from 1056 hunter-harvested deer brought to game checking
stations in Hampshire County and one station near the southern
Hampshire County line in Hardy County," said Frank Jezioro, Director
of the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR).

The 10 CWD-positive deer included 2, 2.5 year-old does; 2, 1.5
year-old bucks; 5, 2.5 year-old bucks; and one 3.5 year-old buck. 9 of
the latest positive deer were harvested within the borders of
Hampshire County. However, one was harvested in Hardy County near the
border with Hampshire County. The area in West Virginia from which CWD
has been detected continues to expand, as evident with the latest CWD
positive deer from northern Hardy County. The number of infected deer
detected in West Virginia in 2010 now totals 22, 2 less than the
number of infected deer detected in 2009.

CWD has now been detected in 83 deer in Hampshire County and one deer
in Hardy County for a total of 84 CWD-positive deer in West Virginia.
The DNR will continue to update management actions designed to control
the spread of this disease, prevent further introduction of the
disease, and possibly eliminate the disease from the state as
information from deer testing within West Virginia is gathered and
scientists across the country provide more information on how to
combat CWD in white-tailed deer.

"The detection of the positive CWD deer in Hardy County is
discouraging," said Jezioro. "As we strive to meet this wildlife
disease challenge and implement appropriate management strategies, the
continued support and involvement of landowners and hunters will be
essential."

An expansion of the current ban on supplemental feeding and baiting of
deer in Hampshire County is being considered with the occurrence of
this CWD-positive deer in Hardy County. Current research indicates
that supplemental feeding and baiting of deer increases the chance of
disease transmission far above the normal clustering of deer on
natural and agricultural feeding areas. The DNR remains committed to
keeping the public informed and involved in wildlife disease
management actions.
