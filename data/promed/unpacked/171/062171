French authorities are investigating 50 _Salmonella_ infections to see if they are related while they try to find a common source. The National Reference Center (CNR) for _Salmonella_ at the Institut Pasteur has identified 50 cases of salmonellosis with very similar genetic characteristics since June [2021].

Sante publique France and the directorate general for food (DGAL) confirmed to Food Safety News that they are investigating the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis cases to identify whether all the patients, or some of them, have been infected from a common food source.

Strains were isolated from patients between 21 Jun and 2 Aug [2021]. There are 23 women and 27 men affected aged from 0 to 86 years old. Sick people live in 10 different regions of France with the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA) region being the most affected with 23 patients. Eight patients were hospitalized but have all now been discharged, and there are no deaths to date.

Patients have been asked about what they ate and places of food purchases in the week before onset of their symptoms. For foods consumed by a number of people, traceability investigations are started to identify possible distributors, suppliers, or common producers.

Currently, officials are looking at several avenues concerning different types of food. One line of enquiry has seen the DGAL request information from Spanish authorities about a chicken egg packing center in Spain, which is thought to have supplied the places of purchase egg or egg products cited by 3 cases. However, authorities said at this stage, it was not possible to point to a product or to have strong suspicions about a specific food as being the source of infection, and investigations are ongoing.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding these cases of salmonellosis, which appear to be related genetically.

It is too early in the investigation to know whether the imported eggs are the vehicle for transmission. Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should be used only as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
