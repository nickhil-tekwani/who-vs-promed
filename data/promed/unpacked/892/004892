Seven Die, 2,000 Contract Leptospirosis in Kazakhstan.
An epidemic of leptospirosis has been declared in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the
administrative center of the East-Kazakhstan region, Itar-Tass learned at
the republic's health department on Monday. Seven people have died and over
2,000 people have already contracted the dangerous infectious disease,
spread mainly by mice and other rodents.
Medics, together with the local administration are taking urgent measures
to curb the epidemic. Over two million tenge (one US dollar=83.25 tenge)
have been allocated from the local budget. Also, throughout the city there
is an effort to disinfect shops, apartment house and offices.
Medicines are being purchased as part of the effort to curb the epidemic.
However, popular medicines such as penicillin and streptomycin do not
always produce a desired effect. People with leptospirosis develop grave
complications, such as encephalitis, myocarditis and pyelonephritis.
Consequently, Kazakh medics have asked their Moscow colleagues to help.
