The moderator noted that post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies is
no longer 20 shots in the stomach, which is true.
I think it advisable, however, to point out that neither is it a
single shot, as mentioned in the 1st article. To the best of my
understanding under current CDC guidelines, post-exposure prophylaxis
for persons not pre-exposure vaccinated currently consists of a
regimen of 1 dose of RIG (Rabies ImmunoGlobulin) and 5 doses of HDCV
(Human Diploid Cell Vaccine) over a 28-day period.

[Bob is correct -- see

which, in spite of the date, is the most recent word on human rabies
vaccination from CDC. - Mod.JW]

I note that one of the articles in the advisory states that rabid
bats are (by implication) easily recognized by behavioral changes.
The literature (and personal experience) doesn't indicate this. Rabies
is an old disorder of bats. [To state that] it seems to have reached
a state of relative innocuousness would be incorrect, as bats do die
of rabies. However, many do not die, and long-term survival (indeed,
recovery) is, uniquely among these mammals, both possible and
apparently frequent.
The literature indicates bats can survive at least 18 months (through
a hibernation cycle) and still shed virus. One should not assume that
a bat "acting normally" is necessarily uninfected. Since the ice age,
the virus has likely had to come to a kind of equilibrium in bats,
and does not affect them as it does other mammals. This seems to be
especially true of insectivorous bats. Think, perhaps, of the
specificity of herpes ...the virus among bats is well-adapted.
