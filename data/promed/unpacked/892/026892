11 people have died in Cuba after drinking illegal alcohol, the public heath ministry has said. At least 40 others have been admitted to hospital in the capital, Havana, and several remain in a serious condition.

The toxic liquid was stolen from a government department and sold as traditional Cuban rum, according to reports read on state television. The victims suffered symptoms of poisoning by methanol, which is commonly used as a solvent or fuel.

The 1st cases were seen on Monday [29 Jul 2013], and by Wednesday [31 Jul 2913], 7 fatalities were reported. Illegal methyl alcohol, also known as wood alcohol, is highly toxic and can lead to nausea, headaches and blindness.

The authorities called on anyone suffering symptoms to come forward for urgent medical treatment; 2 employees from the Cuban Institute of Pharmacy and Food are being investigated, state TV said. The 11 people who have died were aged between 37 and 58 and lived in the La Lisa district of Havana.

[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of methanol-contaminated whiskey or other alcohol products. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates, it is generally small, and, consequently, primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.

Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.

Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care, it is possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, depending on the amount and individual tolerance.

Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently, there is a longer elimination half-life.

Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours after ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.

Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.

Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type of treatment to be helpful.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.
