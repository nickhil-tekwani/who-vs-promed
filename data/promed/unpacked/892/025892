Scientists are trying to learn why dead dolphins are washing up on northwest
Florida shores. Over the weekend, 3 dolphin carcasses a day washed ashore
and over the last month, the average has been about one daily.
Most were full-grown, had bellies full of fish and many of the females were
pregnant, evidence ruling out various sicknesses, said George Gray,
coordinator for a Fort Walton Beach wildlife rescue group.
Officials suspect the deaths may be related to an outbreak of red tide, but
that has not been confirmed. Laboratory tests are pending. Red tide is an
alga that in significant concentrations can be deadly to sealife and harmful
to humans.
Most of the dolphins washed up in Choctawhatchee Bay and its connecting
bayous, but a few have turned up dead on Gulf Coast beaches.
In late summer and early fall, a red tide outbreak near Fort Walton Beach
killed thousands of fish, but no dolphins were affected. Dozens died during
a simultaneous outbreak about 50 miles south near Panama City, Florida.
