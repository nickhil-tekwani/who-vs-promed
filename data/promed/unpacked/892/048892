Quebec boy dies from rabies; case believed to be first in over 35 years
MONTREAL - A boy who contracted rabies from a bat died Friday in what is
believed to be the first Quebec case of [rabies in humans in
more than 3 decades.
The 9-year-old boy had been in critical condition in a hospital since he
was admitted last Friday. He was believed to be the first person to fall
sick from rabies in Quebec in more than 35 years.
Doctors said the boy had probably been exposed to the rabies virus about
a month ago while he was on vacation with his parents in a Laurentian
wildlife reserve. The bat in the cabin or vacation quarters may have been
released without being tested for rabies.
Public-health authorities were investigating the death. Earlier this week
they urged parents not to panic, saying the risk of rabies spreading from
person to person is practically non-existent.
But there was concern about the boy's parents being exposed to the bat
and family members were receiving preventive treatment. Relatives and
friends of the boy were also being tested for the virus.
It can take up to 90 days for the rabies virus to incubate before
symptoms appear.
The virus can cause acute encephalitis in all warm-blooded hosts,
including humans, and the outcome is nearly always fatal.
The first symptoms of rabies in people are fever or headache, which can
last for several days. The symptoms then become more severe, including
delirium, insomnia and hallucinations.

[This boy was diagnosed antemortem with direct immunoflourescent assay from
skin from neck. The strain of rabies is believed to the silverhair bat
strain.
Thank you Dr. Lapointe for bringing this to our attention. I would like
to gratefully acknowledge Dr. Jane Mahlow of the Texas Department of
Health Zoonosis Control, and Dr. Candice McCall of the CDC and Dr. Chuck
Tremarche for their excellent assistance in getting more information on
this case. - Mod.TG
