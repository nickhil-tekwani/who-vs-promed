[1] Connecticut: raccoon, human exposure

A mother and her young child who were attacked by a raccoon at a school bus stop last week are undergoing rabies treatment. The attack happened last Thursday [5 Dec 2019] at a bus stop off of Georgetown Road in Weston.

Animal control officer Mark Harper said the child was getting out of a vehicle and the raccoon "came out of nowhere" and started grabbing at the child's legs. The mother then went around the vehicle and grabbed the raccoon.

The mother and child, who were bitten on the arms and hands, were transported to Norwalk Hospital.

"The poor kid was petrified with what happened," Harper said.

When police arrived, the raccoon had already fled. A neighbor said the raccoon was later seen in a swampy area.

After Harper was able to track down the raccoon, it then attacked him. Harper then euthanized the raccoon. The animal later tested positive for rabies.

Harper said it has been between 10 and 15 years since a similar incident happened in town.

Last October [2019], an 84-year-old Hamden woman was bitten on the hand by a raccoon while working in her garden. The raccoon later fled and was not found. The woman was transported to Yale New Haven Hospital.

According to the Mayo Clinic, rabies treatment includes a series of vaccinations. A fast-acting shot (rabies immune globulin) prevents the virus from infecting you. Part of this injection is given near the area where the animal bit you, if possible, as soon as possible after the bite.

This is followed by a series of rabies vaccinations to help your body learn to identify and fight the rabies virus. Rabies vaccinations are given as injections in your arm. Four injections are given over a 14-day period.

[2] South Carolina: cat, human exposure

The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) says one person has possibly been exposed to rabies by a stray cat in Aiken County. DHEC says the person has been referred to their healthcare provider.

In a report, DHEC says the exposure happened on 18 Dec 2019 when the victim was bitten by a black-and-white stray cat on their property outside New Ellenton. The cat was tested the next day, and on 20 Dec 2019, was confirmed to have rabies.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite, which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal. However, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

DHEC says this cat is the 9th animal in Aiken County to test positive for rabies in 2019.

DHEC says if you have reason to believe that you, your family members, or your pets have come into contact with this cat, or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Aiken office at (803) 642-1637 during normal business hours (M-F, 8:30-5:00).

DHEC says be sure to immediately wash any part of your body having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention.

To report a bite or exposure on holidays and/or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

DHEC says there have been 146 cases of rabid animals across South Carolina this year [2019].

They also say in 2018, 4 of the 100 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Aiken County.

[Neither of the communities in this posting mentioned holding a rabies drive, nor did either article encourage individuals to get their pet(s) vaccinated. Rabies is an old disease that can still take your life or the life of your pet. I am surprised these articles don't tell us more about rabies drives or urge the public to vaccinate.

Rabies virus remains a deadly disease, which is preventable by vaccination. Take your pets for vaccination. It helps protect you too. There are very few people who have ever survived this disease, and their life post-rabies is difficult, to say the least. Please protect yourself. Please protect your pets by getting vaccinations.

Pets without vaccinations who may get bitten or get in a fight with a wild animal may well be euthanized out of precaution to keep people safe. It is a painful way to lose a companion. Even young puppies and kittens can be infected with rabies.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start.

After a bite or other rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel through the body to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period, and it may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain), the type of rabies virus, and any existing immunity.

The 1st symptoms of rabies in human beings may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2-10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. To date, less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented, and only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the bite/scratch with copious amounts of soap and water. Seek medical attention.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient-assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities. https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html. - Mod.TG
