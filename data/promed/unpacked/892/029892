Of these, 16 are hospitalized in the Maggiore Hospital: 10 of the 16 are improving; 4 are stable and 2, a man and a woman over 60 [years of age], are in a serious clinical [condition].

It has become a crisis [that requires] scientific expertise from various related fields. A briefing for the public is scheduled for Thu 6 Oct [2016].

From Public Health, numerous environmental investigations are being carried out. Specifically, they are performing water sampling at the home of the sick, in the network of public water supply, especially of the contribution from the well Bizzozero and irrigation systems in the fields of sport. The water network has been hyperchlorinated for safety.
