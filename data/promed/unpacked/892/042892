In a study which I presented in Nov 1999 at the Annual Conference of the
American Public Health Association, we (my colleagues in Pakistan and at
the University of Washington) presented data (collected in 1998 in
Pakistan) which suggest there is a possibility of patients being wrongly
diagnosed as Typhoid and hence treated unnecessarily.
Our study also suggested that the Widal Test is still a pretty reliable and
cost effective test, and could be done even in very basic clinical setups.
The newer tests for Typhoid which are available are detection of anti-LPS &
anti-flagellin antibodies by the ELISA method (sensitivity 89.4%,
specificity 94.9%) (1) or dot enzyme immunoassay (sensitivity 90%,
specificity 91%) (2). But they are some times 5-10 times more expensive
than the Widal Test.
