China falls short in reporting foot-and-mouth disease
------------------------------------------------
China's 1st-ever admission of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] at the weekend
did not reveal the extent of the country's problem with the
livestock-wasting illness, officials in the animal feed industry said this
week.
Although Beijing has become more open in reporting disease since the
initial cover-up of the SARS epidemic in 2003, they said it could have done
more to alert the world to an FMD outbreak that has raged for more than 2
months, raising doubts about China's commitment to international standards.
"They don't want to admit to the world they have a problem," said a foreign
agricultural expert based in China.
China confirmed late-April outbreaks of FMD among cattle in its eastern
provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu, the World Organization for Animal Health
said at the weekend on its Web site (<http://www.oie.int>).
The Paris-based body, known as the OIE, cited information received on 13
May 2005 from Jia Youling, director-general of the veterinary bureau of
China's Ministry of Agriculture.
Beijing had never before [sic; see commentary] admitted the presence of
FMD, which causes severe weight loss in cloven-hoofed animals and often
surfaces in China.
"It's a bit late to announce this news. FMD has been big in pigs since
after Chinese New Year," said the purchasing manager for a feed company in
Wuhan, central China, referring to the February holiday.
The feed industry officials said the government had not reported cases in
pigs that spread to 10 Chinese provinces, slashing demand for pig mash in
some areas by up to 50 percent in April, before being brought largely under
control this month.
"We have already filed our complete report to the OIE," the ministry's Jia
told Reuters on Wednesday [18 May 2005] when asked if his office was
investigating the pig outbreak.
In April 2003, China fired its health minister after a cover-up of the
outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, sparking vociferous
criticism worldwide.
The country has won cautious praise for its post-SARS efforts, which have
included the installation of a sophisticated surveillance and reporting
system that was used in 2004 to monitor avian flu, which sickens chickens
and can kill humans.
China has also begun to crack down on unsafe blood collection, which had
helped speed the spread of AIDS. It acknowledges 840 000 HIV/AIDS cases,
though foreign experts put the figure between 1 million and 1.5 million.
"We have seen a greater commitment from China since the SARS outbreak, and
greater openness," said Maria Cheng, spokeswoman in Beijing for the World
Health Organization. "During the avian flu outbreak, they were faster to
ask for help."
FMD does not affect humans, and outbreaks are relatively easy to control in
a country where most hogs are raised on small, family-run farms, industry
officials said. But local officials were reluctant to publicise problems
for fear that culling could devastate village economies.
The OIE's weekend announcement was carried in a few Chinese financial
papers, but was not mentioned on the Ministry of Agriculture's Web site or
in most newspapers.
Overall demand for animal feed in China is still up about 10 percent this
year compared with 2004, when the poultry industry was decimated by an
outbreak of avian flu, a Sichuan-based official with another large feed
company said.
Some company officials said China was reluctant to report FMD in pigs for
fear of sparking a similar crisis in the pork industry.
In the 1st 3 quarters of 2004, China slaughtered 487 million pigs. Pork
exports of 95 200 tonnes in the 1st quarter of 2005 were worth USD 224
million, Ministry of Agriculture data showed.
In contrast, beef exports in the 1st quarter this year rose 15 percent to
3469 tonnes, worth USD 7.4 million. China slaughtered 36 million cattle in
the 1st 3 quarters of 2004.
"If they report this disease in pigs, people would be afraid to eat pork.
But beef isn't very important for the economy, and they reported it in
areas where there are very few cattle anyway," the Wuhan-based official said.

[China has been sending annual reports to the OIE on its animal disease
situation at least since 1996. The last official reporting to the OIE on
FMD in (mainland; excluding Hong Kong) PRC related to 8 outbreaks in May
1999, affecting 68 bovines and 1212 porcines in Fujian, Hainan and Tibet,
caused by FMD serotype O. This might have been a part of the worldwide
panzootic caused by the PanAsia FMD O strain or Middle-East/Southern Asia
(ME-SA) topotype. Previously, FMD had been reported in mainland PRC in 1998
and 1997, namely 2 outbreaks in July 1998 (Yunnan; no virus type
mentioned), and 3 in July 1997 (Yunnan). During 1997, unspecified number of
outbreaks were reported also from the Hong-Kong area, and the Chinese
mentioned FMD virus serotypes A, O and Asia 1.
According to OIE annual reports of the years 2000-2002, PRC reported no FMD
cases. A report for January 2003 mentioned 3 clinically diagnosed FMD
outbreaks in swine in Hong-Kong. Since September 2003, China began to duly
provide monthly reports. According to the available monthly reports Sep
2003 - Nov 2004, FMD was absent. No further such reports are available, but
an annual report for 2004 might be expected during next week's General
Session of the OIE in Paris. Indeed, the sending of an "Immediate
notification report" on 13 May 2005 may hopefully herald China's desirable
improved transparency.
The current FMD outbreaks in China have reportedly been caused by virus
type Asia 1. According to the monthly report of the FAO World Reference
Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease at Pirbright, 8 samples from cattle
in Hong Kong have been received there during March 2005, all positive for
FMDV serotype Asia 1. This serotype is restricted to the Asian continent;
during the early 1960's it spread to the Middle East, where it seems to
have become endemic since. It seriously affected cattle, sheep, and goats.
(In central and Eastern Asia, pigs are known to be seriously
affected). Several ME countries routinely vaccinate against 3 FMD
serotypes, namely O, A and Asia 1. The virus has never penetrated Europe;
the European Commission for FMD (EUFMD) has been engaged for decades with
studies and activities to prevent such spread.
Clear official Chinese data on the current disease situation in various
species, with special attention to porcines, and further data on the
characteristics of the current causative virus, will help. - Mod.AS]
