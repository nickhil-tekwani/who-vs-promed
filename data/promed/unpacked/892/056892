Uganda: bilharzia on the rise in Jinja
--------------------------------------
Over 65 per cent of the population in Jinja District living around
water bodies are suffering from bilharzia [schistosomiasis]. The
district tropical diseases coordinator, Mr Gilbert Bayenda, last week
[week of 4 Apr 2011] said children are the most affected. Mr Bayenda
said the situation is compounded by some people shunning treatment.

Bilharzia is a parasitic disease caused by worms called schistosomes
[flatworms]. The worms can be killed using praziquantel drugs. "The
schistosomiasis (bilharzia) control programme provides regular
education and free annual praziquantel to children and adults at a
risk of infection. However, uptake of this preventative treatment is
low, at 42 per cent because children in communities we distribute the
drug reject it yet the prevalence rate is high at 65 per cent," he
said.

[Jinja is located east of Kampala on the northern shore of Lake
Victoria. It can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map
at http://healthmap.org/r/0Gsz. A map showing the districts of
Uganda is available at

Infection with _Schistosoma mansoni_ is highly endemic and a recent
study found a clear association between infection and socio-economic
status (Muhumuza S et al: Association between socio economic status
and schistosomiasis infection in Jinja District, Uganda. Trop Med Int
Health. 2009; 14(6): 612-9, available at
