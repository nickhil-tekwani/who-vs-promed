West Nile Virus Surveillance Data as of Mon 6 Oct 2003
------------------------------------------------------
Human - cumulative data
-----------------------
As of Mon 6 Oct 2003 there have been a total of 1130 probable or
confirmed cases of human infection in Canada and 7 deaths (an
increase of 71 cases and no deaths since Tue 30 Sep 2003).
Saskatchewan remains the most severely affected province with 663
probable or confirmed cases and 3 deaths, followed by Alberta with
236 probable or confirmed cases (increases of 42 and 12,
respectively). This indicates a reversal of the previous trend and a
marked decline in notification of human cases of West Nile virus
infection:
Province/No. probable cases/No. confirmed cases/No. deaths/
Nova Scotia / 0 / 1* / 0 /
Quebec /13 / 2 / 0 /
Ontario / 71 / 1* / 2** /
Manitoba / 114 / 13/ 2 /
Saskatchewan / 644 / 19 / 3 /
Alberta / 2 / 234 / 0
British Columbia 14* / 1* / 0 /
Yukon 1* / 0 / 0 /
Total 859 / 271 / 7
*Linked to travel outside of province
** 2 probable cases; death due to other causes
[The probable cases in British Columbia and Yukon, and the confirmed
cases in Nova Scotia and Ontario, are considered to be travel-related
and not indigenous cases. In the 7 days since Mon 29 Sep 2003 the
number of probable or confirmed cases has increased from 1035 to
1130. Most of the new cases occurred in Saskatchewan (63) and Alberta
(12). In all, 79.6 percent (899/1130) of the cases in 2003 have
occurred in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West
Nile virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus.
All the deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec,
in contrast to the situation in 2003 when few cases have been
reported from Ontario and Quebec, and overall considerably fewer
fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Equines - cumulative data
-------------------------
As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, 406 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have
been reported; Quebec (7), Ontario (42), Manitoba (53), Saskatchewan
(154), Alberta (150).
[The number of presumptive or confirmed equine cases of West Nile
virus infection has decreased by 5 (all in Alberta) since Tue 30
2003. There have been no extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Tue 30 Sep 2003, 517 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive;
Quebec (84), Ontario (109), Manitoba (259), Saskatchewan (34),
Alberta (31).
[This represents an increase of 26 West Nile virus-positive mosquito
pools since Tue 30 Sep 2003. In contrast to the data for other
animals, the greatest number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito
pools was recorded in the province of Manitoba (50.1 percent),
whereas relatively few were found in Saskatchewan (6.6 percent) and
Alberta (6.0 percent). There have been no extensions of range. -

*Note that in the Ontario count, after the 4th confirmed positive
bird, no further testing is carried out and the birds are listed as
presumed positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 11 933 birds submitted for
testing, 11 038 birds tested, and 1519 confirmed West Nile
virus-positive. In addition there were 3733 sightings of dead birds.
This represents [an additional] 186 birds tested (a decline on the
previous week) and 296 more birds confirmed West Nile virus-positive.
Most of the new virus-positive birds were reported from the central
provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba). There has been no
