Human plague case confirmed in Santa Fe County
----------------------------------------------
The 1st case of human plague in New Mexico in 2005 has been confirmed in an
adolescent from Santa Fe County. The New Mexico Department of Health
reports that the patient has been hospitalized and is recovering. The
department is conducting an environmental assessment of the youth's home to
determine whether there is any ongoing risk to the public.
"We have been seeing plague cases in cats, dogs and rodents in many of the
north central counties of New Mexico," says Dr. Paul Ettestad, the
department's public health veterinarian.
Plague is a bacterial disease that is usually contracted from bites from
infected fleas but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected
animals. The symptoms of plague include fever, swollen lymph nodes, chills
and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea. The symptoms in cats are
similar.
The department reports that plague can be successfully treated with
antibiotics if it is promptly diagnosed.
There have been cases of plague in animals reported in 2005 in Rio Arriba,
Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos, Colfax and Bernalillo Counties.
There were no reported cases of human plague in the state in 2004. 1 case
was reported in Torrance County in 2003 and 2 cases were reported in 2002
in Santa Fe County. The last plague fatality occurred in 1994 in a Rio
Arriba County child.

[The specific aspects of this case are not included. That the adolescent
is recovering suggests strongly that this is a case of bubonic plague and
was diagnosed and treated promptly.
_Y. pestis_ infection is endemic in the southwestern USA. Introduction of
infection into wildlife occurred following the introduction of plague in
San Francisco in the early 20th century (1).
