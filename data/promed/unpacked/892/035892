The number of confirmed cholera cases at Bentiu IDP camp and Rubkona County of Unity State has risen to at least 111, officials said. The National Ministry of Health reported 21 confirmed cases of cholera from Bentiu IDP camp Rubkona County on 14 Apr [2022].

Cholera is a disease characterised by sudden onset of profuse, watery diarrhea without fever or abdominal cramps. Vomiting, which can be severe, and painful leg cramps are also common symptoms.

For the last couple of years, South Sudan has experienced devastating floods affecting a large number of people, mainly women and children, and displacing them from their homes and livelihoods. Stephen Tot Cheng, the Minister of Health in the state, speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Thursday [2 Jun 2022], said 111 cholera cases have been recorded in Rubkona County and Bentiu IDP camp so far.

The state minister pointed out that the cholera outbreak was due to poor hygiene and sanitation in the area. "In the camp, children defecate outside openly, and there are no proper hygiene and enough latrines, so this was the cause of the cholera outbreak," Tot said. "The cholera vaccination is still going on in all parts of the camp and Rubkona."

Meanwhile, Jal Kuol Malou, director of Rubkona County Health Department, confirmed that cholera cases have risen to 111. "The cholera cases might reduce because we are in the quarter of the year now. We have managed to vaccinate 25 196 people," he said.

[4] Cholera, possible: Ukraine (Mariupol)

Piles of unburied bodies from the Russian slaughter in Mariupol have led to a cholera outbreak, authorities in the Ukrainian city have said. The port saw fierce fighting, in particular around the Azovstal steelworks, before it fell to Vladimir Putin's forces, following a long siege. Some of those killed in Mariupol are buried in graves, but piles of bodies remain. The sheer number of bodies left to rot in streets and rubble of buildings are now beginning to contaminate the drink supply, an adviser to the city's mayor has said.

Petro Andryushchenko told Radio Svboda that it is "difficult to convey the reality of Mariupol regarding the bodies of the dead." He said there were corpses "everywhere," which can't be stored "because the occupiers cannot cope with such an insane number. There is not enough power to even bury them in mass graves."

Speaking on Ukrainian TV, he said that along with rotting rubbing rubbish, "all this gets into the water, into the sea, into sources of drinking water. As far as we can record, we can say that the epidemic has basically begun." He added that there has been a sharp increase in death in the city, which has been made worse by a lack of medicines and labs that can be used to fight infection.

"It is very difficult to record the causes of death, but we know for sure that the death rate has not decreased, but rather is growing," he said. "All this suggests that, in fact, Mariupol has already entered the first phase of the epidemic."
