Brazil approves Pfizer vaccine for children as young as 6 months
----------------------------------------------------------------
Brazilian national health regulator Anvisa has approved the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech for children aged between 6 months and 4 years, the government body said in a statement Friday night [16 Sep 2022].

The move broadens the availability of the vaccine, which is sold under the brand name Comirnaty for adults and is already available in Brazil for older age groups.

Brazil's vaccination rates are already among the world's highest, with almost 90% of the population having received at least one dose, according to the Our World in Data project, which collects official numbers from governments worldwide.

On Friday [16 Sep 2022], the South American country reported 97 deaths nationwide due to the coronavirus, far lower than the daily peak of 4250 recorded in April 2021.

[[Brazil] has decades of successful inoculation campaigns that have created the infrastructure needed to deliver jabs en masse, while instilling trust among the population.

In Brazil, successful inoculation drives in the last half century against smallpox, meningitis, polio and measles means that very few people are opposed to vaccines, said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Sao Paulo.

The same can be said for several other nations in the region, which have previously launched expansive inoculation campaigns after traumatic infectious disease outbreaks in recent decades.

"This confidence, built up over several years, is based on the benefits of our extensive vaccination schedule," said Leda Guzzi, a Buenos Aires-based infectious disease expert.

Effective public health messaging has been key, too, said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health and a collaborating researcher at Rio de Janeiro's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. ...

Even with an impressive 63.3% of the population vaccinated, the region remains below the threshold that most scientists say is needed to offer mass protection. Omicron is now raging in much of Europe despite similar levels of inoculation.

Among children, vaccination rates also vary dramatically from country to country in Latin America, with authorities in Mexico and Brazil relatively slow to approve shots for minors.

High rates of fatigue, brain fog 9 months after nonsevere COVID-19
------------------------------------------------------------------
About 9 months after COVID-19 infection, 19% of nonhospitalized adult patients in a German cohort had fatigue, 26% had mild cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), and 1% had moderate cognitive dysfunction, according to a multicenter study.

The study, published late last week in EClinicalMedicine, also showed that the incidence and risk factors for fatigue and cognitive impairment differed by age-group.

The researchers administered the FACIT-Fatigue scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment to 969 participants who had tested positive for COVID-19 at least 6 months earlier at 3 German hospitals from 15 Nov 2020-29 Sep 2021. A total of 55% of patients were women. The patients' results were compared with those of 969 matched controls from a prepandemic, population-wide survey.

A median of 9 months after COVID-19 infection, 19% had clinically relevant fatigue, compared with 8% of controls. Risk factors included female sex, younger age, history of depression, and altered consciousness, dizziness, and muscle pain -- but not illness severity -- during acute infection. "This suggests that the affected organ systems, especially central and peripheral nervous system involvement, are more relevant for the development of fatigue than overall illness severity," the authors wrote.

A total of 26% of patients had mild cognitive impairment -- roughly twice the expected proportion -- and 1% had moderate dysfunction. Risk factors for impaired cognition included older age, male sex, lower educational attainment, and a history of neuropsychiatric disease.

The link between fatigue and cognitive impairment was insignificant, and only 5% of patients had both conditions, while 14% had only fatigue, and 22% had only cognitive dysfunction. While fatigue tended to improve with time, the onset of cognitive impairment appeared to be delayed by several months.

"Fatigue and cognitive impairment are 2 common, but distinct sequelae of COVID-19 with potentially separate pathophysiological pathways," the researchers wrote.

The team added that these persistent conditions may place a considerable burden on the health system. "Patients with post-COVID fatigue will require professional help, e.g. through specialized interdisciplinary outpatient clinics and rehabilitation programs," they wrote. [Tim J. Hartung, Christian Neumann, Thomas Bahmer, et al. Fatigue and cognitive impairment after COVID-19: A prospective multicentre study. eClinical Medicine, part of Lancet. Published: 17 Sep 2022 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101651]

Diabetics' excess weight, not blood sugar, tied to COVID-19, long COVID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adults with diabetes and a high body mass index (BMI), not high blood sugar levels, are at greater risks of COVID-19 infection and long COVID, according to a meta-analysis involving more than 30 000 UK adults from 9 cohort studies presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting taking place this week in Stockholm, Sweden.

"Our early findings support the idea that obesity-related mechanisms may be responsible for the excess risks of COVID-19 associated with diabetes, rather than high blood sugar per se," said Anika Knuppel, PhD, a lead researcher on the study from the University College London, in an EASD news release.

To conduct the study, researchers combed 9 major studies from the United Kingdom to look at self-reported COVID-19 infections and long COVID among adults and associations with HbA1c levels (average blood sugar level), self-reported or medication-based diabetes, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.

The 31 252 participants were aged 19 to 75 years old, and 57% were women.

The researchers found that people whose BMIs in the overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2) or obese (30 kg/m2 or greater) category had 10% and 16% greater odds of COVID-19 infection, respectively, compared to healthy weight individuals. For long COVID, the association was even greater, with overweight people having 20% greater odds, and obese people having 36% greater odds.

Average blood sugar level and diabetes status revealed no association with COVID-19 or long COVID.

""Our early findings suggest a link of adiposity with COVID-19 infection and long COVID-19 even after taking into account socio-demographic factors and smoking. We need to further explore what makes people with overweight and obesity at risk of worse outcomes and how this relates to severe cases", says Knuppel." - Mod.LK]

[3] Remdesivir-induced variants

Citation: Andreas , Thomas Günther, Alexis Robitaille, et al. Remdesivir-induced emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants in patients with prolonged infection. Cell Reports Medicine. 3 (9): 100735, 20 Sep 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
• Analysis of SARS-CoV2 intra-host diversity in longitudinal samples from 14 patients
• Prolonged infection does not generally result in fundamentally increased diversity
• Remdesivir treatment can result in rapid fixation of newly acquired mutations
• Treatment-associated evolutionary bottlenecks promote emergence of novel variants

Summary
We here investigate the impact of antiviral treatments such as remdesivir on intra-host genomic diversity and emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants in patients with a prolonged course of infection. Sequencing and variant analysis performed in 112 longitudinal respiratory samples from 14 SARS-CoV2-infected patients with severe disease progression show that major frequency variants do not generally arise during prolonged infection. However, remdesivir treatment can increase intra-host genomic diversity and result in the emergence of novel major variant species harboring fixed mutations. This is particularly evident in a patient with B cell depletion who rapidly developed mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene following remdesivir treatment. Remdesivir treatment-associated emergence of novel variants is of great interest in light of current treatment guidelines for hospitalized patients suffering from severe SARS-CoV2 disease, as well as the potential use of remdesivir to preventively treat non-hospitalized patients at high risk for severe disease progression.

Discussion
...Taken together, our work demonstrates that, while not generally observed in long-lasting infections, novel viral intra-host species may rapidly emerge in the context of antiviral treatments such as remdesivir therapy. Differentiating between true escape and stochastically arising variants in such patients, however, represents a particular challenge that will greatly benefit from additional data.

Our findings are significant in light of recent discussions regarding the use of remdesivir to treat non-hospitalized patients at high risk for disease progression, as well as potentially new antiviral therapeutics that are about to be incorporated into patient treatment strategies (e.g., protease inhibitors such as Paxlovid or RdRp-inhibiting compounds such as molnupiravir). Unlike remdesivir, for which patient reports and in vitro studies on resistance mutations are available, similar data for Paxlovid or mulnopiravir treatment regimen are still lacking.

Therefore, we suggest monitoring patients with long-lasting viral infections by frequent testing of respiratory samples with whole viral genome analysis and variant determination and extending this monitoring to new directly acting therapeutics that may impose a different form of selection pressure when used in these patient populations.

[The finding that "remdesivir treatment can increase intra-host genomic diversity and result in the emergence of novel major variant species harboring fixed mutations" is important to confirm since the implications are significant leading to emergence of new variants. - Mod.LK]

[4] COVID case series

COVID-19: Analysis of published case-series
-------------------------------------------
An inevitable byproduct of COVID-19 on health care has been the publication of thousands of case-series that summarize patient cohorts treated by individual clinics, hospitals, cities, countries ... and world regions. As of 20 Sep 2022, the GIDEON database (www.GideonOnline.com) has abstracted 7988 relevant case series indexed in PubMed. An additional 1514 surveys for SARS-CoV-2 antigen or antibody have also been identified and collated. The following analysis does not include trials of therapeutic agents or diagnostic tests.

These 7988 case-series examine the clinical and epidemiological features of a combined total of 17 158 669 patients with COVID-19 (mean, 2014 patients per series). Given that 609 848 852 cases of COVID were reported to date globally (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/) , the mean cohort size of case-series represents only 2.81% of officially-reported cases. Obviously, this figure is at best a rough estimate, given the veracity of case reporting, incorporation of specific patients and cohorts into multiple studies, geographic variability in publishing, biases, practices, constraints, etc.

Two countries have accounted for 33.9% of all published case series: China (1695 case-series, 21.2% of total) and the United States (1018 case-series, 12.7% of total). As in the above analysis, the 662 751 cases / 2 679 353 cases that appear in case-series from China / the United States represent 9.22% / 2.84% of total cases officially reported by these countries.

Additional analyses of case series and surveys include charts which are updated daily and sortable by region, clinical parameter, and other variables. In the following screenshot, the left chart has been sorted by region and the right chart by clinical parameter (https://www.gideononline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sort.png).
