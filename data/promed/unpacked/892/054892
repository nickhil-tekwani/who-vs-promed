Zambia: mystery illness needs quick identification
--------------------------------------------------
The mysterious illness that has hit the people of Chisomo area in
Serenje District [Central Province] needs to be quickly identified
and contained to curb further loss of life among the villagers. Since
Wednesday [25 Feb 2009] when 9 people died as the strange disease
broke out, the death toll has quickly risen to 11 and could climb
even further if the problem was not identified.

This may explain the panic that the disease has spread among the
residents of Chisomo, who are reportedly running away from medical
authorities investigating the killer disease. Be that as it may, it
will not help these important investigations if the people of Chisomo
do not cooperate with those tasked to address their problem.

It appears that the people of Chisomo may be running away from the
health authorities out of ignorance and there is need to step up
publicity on the importance of cooperating with the probe team. The
office of the district commissioner in Serenje can help address this
problem by mobilising opinion leaders such as teachers, pastors,
and traditional leaders to educate the people about the
investigation. The mobilisation of local opinion leaders needs to be
done as a matter of urgency because any further delays may result in
more deaths. The local leaders have a duty to help in the
sensitisation of the community and ensure that villagers there
co-operate with the medical staff.

The staff on the ground have already ruled out cholera and we hope
that those studying the samples will expedite the process and
identify the disease. From the reports, the disease may spread
further as it appears to be highly infectious and kills quickly. The
fact that 11 people have died within a matter of days in itself
renders the problem in Serenje an emergency and hopefully the
ministry of health will move in quickly. It is also hoped that
movement to and from the area will be strictly monitored to avoid the
spread of the disease.

[From the scanty description of the illness above, it is difficult to
develop any differential diagnosis. The exclusion of cholera suggests
that disease is probably not food or water-borne. Any disease
occurring in central Africa that is inducing panic in a rural
population, and apparently highly lethal, could be attributed to one
of several viral hemorrhagic fevers (although in the present case
hemorrhagic symptoms are not specifically mentioned). The Serenje
district of Zambia is close to the border with DR Congo (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zambia_pol01.jpg>), hence
Ebola or Marburg fevers are remote possibilities. Recently an
initially undiagnosed disease affecting several patients in South
Africa, but contracted in Zambia, was caused by a previously unknown
arenavirus (see ProMED-mail archive references below). Further
information is awaited.
