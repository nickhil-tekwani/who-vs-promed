In Colombia, 3 outbreaks of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) have
been confirmed in horses in the departments [state or province
equivalent] of Magdalena (2) and Cordoba (1), which are related to the
epidemiological situation in the area, where the disease is endemic
and has characteristics of the epizootic cycle. Up to date, there have
been 44 [equine] deaths reported.

[Unfortunately, the dates when these VEE cases occurred in 2010 are
not given. The VEE virus subtype involved in these 3 outbreaks is not
stated.

The 2 departments mentioned are located on the Caribbean coast of
Colombia, where the VEE virus subtype ID is almost certainly endemic.
VEE virus subtype ID is not associated with equine epizootics. The VEE
virus subtype that causes equine epizootics, some massive with
spillover into humans in northern South America, is subtype IC. Equine
animals are the amplifying hosts. Published reports indicate that a
change from subtype ID to IC can occur with a mutation in just 2 base
pairs. Equine VEE cases can be presented by vaccination. Since VEE
virus infections are sporadic, many owners do not vaccinate their
equine animals.
