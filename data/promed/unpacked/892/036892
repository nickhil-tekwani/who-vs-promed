I don't think that reports of a new virus in Sakalin should be taken
to mean that the virus is the Sakalin virus to which Andy Main
refers,particularly in view of the comments in the original report
that the virus had been discovered in material collected in the oil
and gas pipeline construction area.Sakalin group viruses are tick
transmitted and associated with marine birds.
The original report however is quite ambiguous.How was the virus
discovered?Was it isolated from a patient,from the environment,etc?

Reports, even if from Izvestia, of a "new" disease are intriguing. More
information is needed as to symptoms, whether the patients are humans (report
merely said "doctors"), the age group(s) affected, etc.
It is not true that the "Sakhalin area has never been medically explored".
Perhaps it has not been explored sufficiently (what area has?) but there have
been studies by D.K. Lvov and others of the Ivanovsky Institute, Moscow, and
these studies have gone on for many years. Indeed, there is a virus by the
name "Sakhalin virus" isolated from |Ixodes putus= uriae| ticks from Sakhalin
Island. This nairovirus has not been associated with human disease but is
mentioned as an example. Other viruses from that area include some human
pathogens. Intensive collections of arthropods have yielded many viruses in
the Sakhalin area.
What the term "materials" (i.e., from which the new virus putatively has been
isolated) means is unclear, particularly in regard to the phrase "collected in
the area". I assume these specimens were from patients in the area and not
from oil, ground water, or other such environmental substances.
