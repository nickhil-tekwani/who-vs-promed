US Declared Canine Rabies-Free, CDC Announces at Inaugural World
Rabies Day Symposium
---------------------------------------
For the last several decades, state and local public health
authorities in the United States have been working tirelessly on the
prevention and control of rabies. Coincident with the recognition of
World Rabies Day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has formally declared the elimination of the type of rabies
previously found in dogs in the United States. This declaration is
supported by animal rabies surveillance nationally.
"The elimination of canine rabies in the United States represents one
of the major public health success stories in the last 50 years,"
stated Dr. Charles Rupprecht, Chief of the CDC Rabies Program.
"However, there is still much work to be done to prevent and control
rabies globally."
Rabies in humans is preventable, yet accounts for at least 55 000
deaths annually around the world; almost one death every 10 minutes.
The World Rabies Day initiative, founded by CDC and the UK charity
Alliance for Rabies Control and co-sponsored by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE),
aims to bring together the appropriate stakeholders to raise
awareness and funding for rabies prevention and control globally.
"We are looking at this as larger than a one-day event," says Dr.
Deborah Briggs, Executive Director of Alliance for Rabies Control,
"This is the 1st step in a long-term effort towards human rabies
prevention and animal rabies control globally."
In the United States, canine rabies elimination was achieved through
implementation of dog vaccination and licensing, and stray dog
control. "We remain optimistic that this official declaration of
canine rabies-free status in the United States could be replicated
throughout the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere." says Rupprecht.
However adoption of dogs from other countries with canine rabies
demonstrates the fragile nature of the current canine rabies-free
status of the United States and highlights the need for global
control and continued emphasis on rabies prevention and control from
the local to national levels.
"The elimination of dog-to-dog transmission of rabies does not mean
that people in the USA can stop vaccinating their pets against
rabies," warns Rupprecht. "Rabies is ever-present in wildlife and can
be transmitted to dogs or other pets. We need to stay vigilant."
Despite the elimination of canine rabies, the disease remains a human
threat in the USA particularly from bats. Rabies also remains a
potential threat through spillover infections from wildlife to
domestic animals adaptation to new animal reservoirs, movement of
potentially infected animals, and lack of adequate vaccination
coverage of domestic animals, particularly cats and dogs.
"We can thank the tremendous historical efforts at the state and
local levels over the past several decades for the ultimate
elimination of canine rabies in the USA," says Dr. Rupprecht. "Our
public health infrastructure, including our quarantine stations,
local animal control programs, veterinarians, and clinicians all play
a vital role in preserving the canine rabies-free status in the USA."

[The last USA rabies cases in dogs reported by ProMED were in 2007 in
Virginia (archive no. 20070503.1433) and Georgia (archive no.
20070104.0040), but it was unclear if the dogs acquired the virus
from a wild mammal. Although canine rabies in the USA has been
eliminated, there is always a threat to humans or canines of rabies
virus exposure from a variety of wild animals in areas where the
virus is endemic. As Dr. Rupprecht emphasized, it is important to
continue to immunize pet dogs and cats against rabies. - Mod.TY]
