Outbreak statistics
Species Swine
Apparent morbidity rate 0.64 percent
Apparent mortality rate 0.00 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 0.00 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 0.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: During the routine active surveillance in
the livestock markets, a pig was found NSP [non-structural protein]
antibody positive. The prefecture animal disease control competent
authority traced back to the farm of origin. The animals on the index
farm were not vaccinated with FMD vaccine. The clinical investigation
showed that all pigs on farm were clinically healthy.

Samples for serological tests and virus isolation were collected and
sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute).
The laboratory confirmed 10 positive results for NSP [non structural
protein] and all negative for virus isolation and RT-PCR.

A total of 3 pig farms within 1km radius of the index farm have been
under vigilant monitoring and no clinical or epidemiological evidence
of infection has been found.

Control measures - Measures applied Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Vaccination in response to the

[Taiwan's struggles to rid itself of FMD are an object lesson in how
difficult it is to become free without vaccination once the disease
has become well established, particularly when there is little
certainity where the new outbreaks are coming from. Countries,
according to OIE, can be: Free of FMD; Free of FMD with Vaccination;
have an FMD free zone within a country and finally, an FMD free zone
within a country where vaccination is practiced.

Previous outbreaks this year (2009) have involved clinically sick
animals, which is not surprising given the use of unvaccinated
sentinel pigs as the animal. Health officials in Taiwan were actively
trying to achieve free status over the past few years. In the
particular instance reported here, there were no clinically ill pigs
but NSP (non structural protein) antibody positive animals. Just
another piece of evidence that predicts that it will be a good little
while before Taiwan can be free of this difficult and economically
costly disease. It has been particularly costly to Taiwan as they were
a major exporter to Japan before the 1997 outbreak and they are still
wrestling with the fallout from that, which you see here. - Mod.PC]
