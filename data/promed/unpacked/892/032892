Measles attacks 3026, kills 8 in Malawi
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in Malawi has [affected] over 3000 people and
killed 8 in Blantyre [the commercial capital in the south] alone. A
total of 26 cases have been recorded by Monday [10 May 2010] in
Mwanza and Neno districts. Last week health officials announced it
would require USD 4.1 million to vaccinate over 6 million children countrywide.

The situation has forced the government to jump the gun and implement
its 3-year interval measles civic education and vaccination campaign
to kick start immediately. 4 districts in Malawi's Southern region,
including Blantyre, are now [involved in] a crash programme. Last
week campaigns were rolled out in the Blantyre, Chiradzulu and Mzimba
districts.

Deputy Minister of Health Theresa Mwale said: "With assistance from
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), France and Belgium, we have rolled
out this vaccination campaign. We are mainly targeting children below
15." She called on all people to go for the vaccination.

Symptoms include a rash, running nose, temperature, and red eyes. In
Mwanza alone 13 cases have been recorded and 11 in Neno district in
the Southern region "Vaccination has already [been] rolled out in hot
spot areas but there is need to cover the entire districts as soon as
we can," said Mwanza District Health officer, Dr. Frank Sanyizi.

In a related scenario, 2 children died of measles last week in
over-populated Chinsapo residential area just some 15 kilometres [9.3
miles] away from the main referral Kamuzu Central Hospital, and 3
kilometres [1.9 miles] from the Catholic run Likuni Hospital in the
capital city, Lilongwe. Both the official and non-official figures
currently list 3026 sick and 8 fatalities. Cases from other districts
across the country continue to be [reported].

[The number of confirmed cases of measles in Malawi has increased
from more than 1400 reported on 27 Apr 2010 to the current figure of
at least 3026. It seems likely that the current situation, as
elsewhere in Africa, is a consequence of the inability of
the economy of the country to sustain a routine vaccination programme.
