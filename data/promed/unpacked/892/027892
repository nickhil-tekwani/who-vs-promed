[The groundnut [a.k.a. peanut crop [in Andhra Pradesh has become the
target of an unprecedented virus and thrips attack during the current kharif
season. [Peanut bud necrosis tospovirus, PBNV is destroying [the standing
groundnut crop in thousands of acres in [Anantapur, Kurnool and Chittoor in
Rayalaseema region of the state. Together with the red-headed caterpillar,
groundnut plants have been destroyed in more than 2.40 lakh hectares of the
total 7.20 lakh hectares in Anantapur district alone, and about 15 000
hectares in the other two districts.
Anantapur is the major groundnut-growing district in the state, accounting
for nearly 50 per cent of the total area under groundnut crop in the state
and contributing more than 60 per cent to the state's output. Andhra
Pradesh is the second largest groundnut- producing state in the country,
after Gujarat. Rough estimates put the loss so far on account of the virus
attack at more than Rs 300 crore.
The [epidemic has struck at a time when farmers are yet to recover from
[last year's severe drought, the lowest production in a decade.
State agriculture officials are involved in a fire-fighting operation to
control the spread of the disease. The state government has so far supplied
2.3 lakh litres of 'monocrotophos' to spray over the affected plants, and
has also pressed nearly 300 sprayers to spray the chemical [in an effort to
contain the disease. However, [it may be too little and too late.
I. V. Subba Rao, Vice-Chancellor of Acharya N. G. Ranga Agriculture
University feels that [the decades-old practice of mono-cropping of
groundnut in those districts should be blamed for the growth and spread of
the virus. [He advises farmers to plant inter crops besides groundnut.
Many environmentalists are [concerned about indiscriminate spraying of
monocrotophos, which has been banned in many advanced countries. [They
contend that it will be counter-productive, as it leaves lethal toxic
residues in the air, on [food and fodder crops, and on water bodies thereby
affecting the health of humans and cattle for a long time to come.

[PBNV is one of at least 12 species in the genus _Tospovirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_. The virus was first reported in India in 1968 and is
recognized as the most economically important virus of several leguminous
crops in southern Asia. The virus is transmitted by _Thrips palmi_.
Peanut bud necrosis is present in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Thailand and China. According to D.V.R. Reddy, Principal Scientist
(Virology) at the International Center for Research in the Semi-Arid Tropics
(ICRISAT), Patancheru, India, the disease may have damaged over 30% of the
crop in the Anantapur district, the major peanut-producing region of Andhra
Pradesh. Crop losses could exceed $100 million USD. According to Reddy,
the most popular peanut cultivars grown in the state are known to be highly
susceptible to the disease. Management of the disease involves use of
conventional plant breeding for disease resistance, development of
transgenic cultivars using the nucleocapsid protein gene, vector management,
and appropriate cultural methods. For additional information on
