Algae outbreak
--------------------
Recreational users of the Merri River have been urged to steer clear of a
section of water at Dennington after the discovery of a potentially toxic
blue-green algal bloom. Warning signs were being installed last night at
the affected area, near the boat shed and Dennington bridge.
South West Water Authority chief executive officer Russell Worland said a
laboratory confirmed late Tue Mar 30 the presence of _Anabaena circinalis_,
which is known to be potentially toxic. Mr. Worland said it could be some
time before the all-clear was received.
A similar outbreak in the Curdies River at Peterborough in 2003 took a
month to clear up. "This area of the river is estuarine in nature and has
varying salt levels associated with tidal impacts. The salt generally
knocks out the blue-green algal blooms," Mr Worland said. He said the past
few days of rain would also help flush out the system.
Mr. Worland said the main concern was for people using the river for
canoeing and other recreational purposes. "The blue-green algal blooms are
something people should keep their eyes and other sensitive parts of the
body clear of," he said. "There's a risk involved, so unfortunately
recreational activity has to be curtailed." Young people in particular
have been urged to keep their distance until the all-clear is
received. That stretch of the river is not used for watering
stock. Additional testing will be carried out to determine whether the
algae are located further upstream.
SWW will meet with fisheries department, catchment management authority,
and city council representatives today. Low river flows combined with
elevated nutrient levels and a burst of late summer weather are enough to
trigger a bloom.

[Borrowing Mod.TG's comment from a prior ProMED-mail posting, "Many species
of cyanobacteria produce populations that are toxic to humans and animals.
Blue-green pond scums have been linked to the poisoning of cattle and dogs,
and occasionally people. Some species of cyanobacteria appear to be
nontoxic and are harvested as a food source. It is therefore not
recommended that wild algae populations be gathered and eaten without some
knowledge of the organisms involved. _Anabaena_ is a blue-green alga." -
