Despite the passage of about one month, the wildlife and provincial government have not succeeded to overcome the "Rani Khait" [Newcastle disease] in peacocks in various areas of Tharparkar [Sindh province] as 9 more precious birds have become victims of the dreadful disease raising the overall death toll to 193.

On demands of organizations working to protect precious birds from extinction, the provincial government and livestock department made tall claims of solid steps, dispatching poultry experts' teams, and carried out vaccination, but all in vain.

According to wildlife department sources, despite presence of teams comprising veterinary experts and carrying medicines to cure the disease, the problem has not been come to an end. The residents of the affected areas seem terrified over the situation and repeatedly demanding authorities to control the disease as soon as possible.

The non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working for saving precious and majestic birds have also expressed concerns over massive deaths of peacocks.

The dwellers of Tharparkar have also warned to stage protest if more teams and medicines were not dispatched for the area to cure "Rani Khait".

[Peacocks, _Pavo cristatus_, is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent. Virtually all birds are considered susceptible to infection with Newcastle diseases virus (NDV; Fam. _Paramyxoviridae_). It is unclear whether these dead birds were free-ranging or owned peacocks. It is also uncertain whether the diagnosis was confirmed.
