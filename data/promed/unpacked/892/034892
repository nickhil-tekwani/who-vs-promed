December Update On Avian Influenza Wild Bird Sampling
--------------------------
Samples Collected From Mallards in Niagara County Indicate Low
Pathogenic Virus; Finding Poses No Risk to Human Health
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)
today announced test results which indicate that a virus found in
samples collected earlier this month from wild mallard ducks in
Niagara County was low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). LPAI has
been detected several times in wild birds in North America and poses
no risk to human health.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the presence of
LPAI H5N1 from 2 of 27 mallard ducks collected from the Tonawanda
Wildlife Management Area in Niagara County on 21 Oct 2006. This low
pathogenic strain of avian influenza occurs naturally in wild birds
and typically causes only minor sickness or no noticeable signs of
disease in birds. These strains are common in the United States and
around the world. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses are very
different from the more severe highly pathogenic H5N1 circulating in
parts of Asia, Europe and Africa. Highly pathogenic strains of avian
influenza spread rapidly and are often fatal to chickens and turkeys.
To date, USDA and United States Department of Interior (DOI) have
announced 12 presumptive positive and/or confirmatory test results
for low pathogenic avian influenza in 6 other states (MI, MD, PA, MT,
IL and OH). In all cases, there has been no detection of Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in North America. As the expanded
surveillance of wild birds for highly pathogenic avian influenza
increases in the coming months, USDA and DOI expect additional
detections of the "North American strain" of low pathogenic H5N1
avian influenza.
USDA and DOI are posting all suspected LPAI H5N1 detections on the
Internet at <http://wildlifedisease.nbii.gov/ai/LPAITable.pdf>
A link is also available on USDA's avian influenza website at
<http://www.usda.gov/birdflu>
New York State continues to work collaboratively with USDA, DOI, and
academic institutions to sample wild birds throughout the State for
the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Live birds as well
as hunter-killed birds will be sampled. Only a simple swab is needed
for testing so that live birds are not harmed through the sampling.
To date, New York State has collected more than 845 wild bird samples
for testing. No other LPAI detections have been found. DEC continues
to seek the participation of hunters in this effort and thanks those
who have participated thus far.
Samples taken from loons and other birds found dead along Lake
Ontario in recent weeks have also been tested for strains of avian
influenza, but results to date have been negative. The cause of this
mortality is Type E botulism, a disease that has killed thousands of
loons, gulls, and other waterbirds on the Great Lakes over the past 5 years.
DEC and USDA will continue taking samples throughout New York State
in the next few months. Swabs are taken in the field and then sent to
the New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell
University where they are tested for the virus. Sampling is expected
to continue into February 2007 to reach a 1600-sample size goal.
