To prevent further spread of FMD, SENASA [Animal Health Authority] has shot
some 400 animals, bringing the total slaughter to 4000 head.
Some 400 animals were sacrificed on Saturday in a field in the Correntes
locality of San Luis in Palmar because of the FMD outbreak declared there
at the beginning of February 2006. It has forced the SENASA authorities to
slaughter more than 4000 cattle.
The latest slaughter was carried out in a field next to the San Juan
establishment where last week they detected an animal with FMD signs; that
animal was shot immediately on diagnosis. The animal shared drinking water
with the San Juan Establishment herd belonging to the Romero Brisco family.
These 400 animals belonged to a number of small producers. According to the
head of Federacion Corrientes de Sanidad Animal (Fucosa), this action was
taken because of the risk of contact infection. The Jose Antonio Romero
Brisco herd comprised approximately 3600 animals.
