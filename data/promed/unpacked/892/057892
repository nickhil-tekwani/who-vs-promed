Exposure to RB51 through raw milk or milk products: how to reduce risk of infection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
People who have consumed raw milk or raw milk products that are potentially contaminated with RB51 are at high risk for brucellosis infection. For these people, symptom monitoring and antibiotics to prevent infection (also called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)) is recommended.

PEP for RB51 should include:
- doxycycline, in addition to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or another suitable antimicrobial, for 21 days;
- those with contraindications to doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should consult with their health care provider;
- prophylaxis for exposure to _Brucella_ species other than RB51 routinely consists of a combination of doxycycline and rifampin. RB51, however, is resistant to rifampin in vitro and to penicillin, so rifampin and penicillin are not recommended.

Symptom monitoring
------------------
Routine serologic tests for brucellosis are not effective for diagnosing or monitoring RB51 infections. So those at high risk should be monitored for the development of symptoms of brucellosis. Monitoring should include:
- for 4 weeks from last exposure, check temperature for fever;
- for 6 months from last exposure, watch for broader symptoms of brucellosis.
People potentially exposed to RB51 who develop symptoms should consult a health care provider.

If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results.

[These RB51 exposure recommendations from the CDC National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology (DHCPP) were updated on 1 Sep 2017, perhaps in response to the Texas case. Unsubstantiated rumors have suggested that more cases have occurred associated with the unpasteurized milk. ProMED awaits information from Texas and/or the CDC regarding this incident. - Mod.LL
