I found your correspondence of Nov 1995 on the net and wondered if you
discovered the cause of camel deaths in Ethiopia.
We have a similar, if smaller scale, problem here in the United Arab
Emirates with a Camel breeder losing about 15 animals in the last week or
two. At the same time last year he suffered similar losses. So far, females
and calves have been affected. Separately quartered males have not. The
disease is acute and characterised by rumenal distension, hypersalivation,
collapse respiratory distress and death, often in the space of 2-3 days.
We are waiting for blood biochemistry and haematology results, and have
suggested checks on food for plant toxins, but our lab facilities are
limited and results may not be fast.
Any ideas you may have will be most welcome. If you know of any
veterinarians with suitable experience of camel disease I would be grateful
for their contact details.
