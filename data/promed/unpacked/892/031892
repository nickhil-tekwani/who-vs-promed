The Alabama Department of Public Health [ADPH] is investigating cases of _Legionella_ disease linked to a condominium complex in Baldwin County. State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said the ADPH is not aware of any serious illnesses from the outbreak. _Legionella_ is not spread person to person. People are infected by breathing a mist or vapor containing the bacteria.

"There have been a little over a dozen people so far that we know about over several months," Harris told the State Committee of Public Health this morning [15 Dec 2022]. "All recovered. No serious illnesses to this point, thankfully. We were able to begin working with the property owner there," Harris said. "They've been cooperative and are following CDC guidance and our guidance on trying to remediate that and on notifying the public on that."

ADPH did not release the name of the complex. "ADPH plans to release more information in due course, but this disease is not spread person to person and so the general public is not at risk," Ryan Easterling, director of communications at ADPH, said in an email. "Risk occurs for those exposed in the facility, and the property owner is in the process of notifying all residents, owners, rental agencies and employees, and also posting signage for any other members of the public who access the property. ADPH will continue to be in close communication with complex management and is currently satisfied with its adherence to CDC guidance and its proposed plan to make this information known to condominium owners and those who may otherwise make use of the property."

According to the ADPH, most healthy people exposed to the _Legionella_ germ do not become sick. People at higher risk are those older than 50, are current or former smokers, have chronic lung problems such as COPD, have weak immune systems from cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure, or are on chemotherapy.

_Legionella_ disease symptoms can include cough, fever, shortness of breath, headaches, and muscle aches. These symptoms are similar to other common respiratory illnesses, so people should tell their doctors any potential exposures to sources of _Legionella_ disease. _Legionella_ disease can develop into pneumonia that requires treatment with antibiotics.

The germ that causes _Legionella_ disease occurs naturally in the environment. It grows best in warm water. Some places where the germ can be found include hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, and decorative fountains.

[Not much information is given in the news report above. We are told there are "cases of _Legionella_ disease linked to a condominium complex in Baldwin County," but we are not told the type of disease these people have. Outbreaks caused by _Legionella_, a gram-negative bacillus, are either Legionnaires' disease (LD) or Pontiac fever. The fact that we are also told none of the illnesses are "serious" makes me believe that the outbreak is likely Pontiac fever, rather than LD. The case fatality rate for LD is about 10% and for Pontiac fever, 0%.

LD is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis with fever, malaise and muscle aches that are less severe than LD; symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Pontiac fever develops hours to 3 days after initial infection, versus 2 to 10 days for LD. Attack rates for Pontiac fever are high; up to 95% of exposed persons become ill versus less than 5% for LD. Unlike LD, there appear to be no predisposing host conditions for Pontiac fever.

Risk factors for LD include age 50 years or older, smoking (current or historical), chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD), immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html). LD takes its name from an outbreak among people attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in 1976. Pontiac fever takes its name from an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan.

Both LD and presumably Pontiac fever are acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, hot tubs, sprays in groceries, water fountains, and cooling towers. People who are prone to aspiration can also develop LD following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

The diagnosis of Pontiac fever is usually made on the basis of epidemiologic, clinical, serological, environmental microbiology findings, and, in a variable portion of the affected people, the development of antibodies to the bacterium isolated from the environmental water source. Urinary antigen testing, an assay that detects only _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen, is uncommonly positive, and cultures are rarely positive for _Legionella_ in patients with Pontiac fever. For a discussion of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of Pontiac fever, see Edelstein PH. Urinary antigen tests positive for Pontiac fever. Clin Infect Dis. 2007; 44: 2229-31; https://doi.org/10.1086/510394.

More information on this cluster of cases of legionellosis in Baldwin County would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Baldwin County (pop., 231 767 in 2020) is located in the southwestern part of the US state of Alabama, on the Gulf of Mexico coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama). - Mod.ML
