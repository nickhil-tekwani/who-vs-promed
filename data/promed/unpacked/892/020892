Cattle mortuaries in Stavropol are located in flood zone
-------------------------------------------------------
There are at least 11 cattle mortuaries and 15 anthrax cattle
mortuaries that are currently in Stavropol's flood zone. [Context
would indicate that these cattle "mortuaries" are officially recorded
burial sites. - Mod MHJ] That creates a danger of epidemics and
epizootics as a result of flooding or [rising] ground water.
According to state veterinary service reports there are 671 cattle
mortuaries in Stavropol but only 307 of them are compliant with
veterinary and sanitary standards (that includes 176 cattle
mortuaries and 131 anthrax cattle mortuaries). The location of some
of the cattle mortuaries is not known , because when [they were
created] they were not [identified] with any signs or warning signs.
The most dangerous mortuaries are located in the ecology-resort area
that is under security. It is called "Kavkazsiye Mineralniye vodi"
(Kavkaz mineral waters).
For the last quarter of 2006, the Podkumok river's waterside
[riverbank] at Georgiyevskiy district went down as a result of
erosion and soil slippage. The waterside is 12 meters from a mortuary
and further fall of waterside may lead to an emergency situation.
Another danger is that some mortuaries that do not have any warning
signs can be used by [local residents] as places for cattle breeding.

Dangerous cattle mortuaries are discovered in Novosibirsk
------------------------------------------------------------
Following inspections conducted in 8 districts of Novosibisrk, 353
functioning cattle mortuaries and 160 anthrax cattle mortuaries were
identified, according to the Russian Agricultural Surveillance
Department press service. The 8 districts [that were inspected] are:
Ust-Tarskiy, Tatarsky, Barabinkiy, Moshkovskiy, Ordinskiy, and a
veterinary waste factory located at Moshkoskiy district. [But only 6
districts identified. - Mod MHJ]
The following violations were discovered during inspection: no papers
on the justification of territory allocated for the cattle mortuary;
mortuaries were not designed as enclosed areas; there were no locks
at the mortuaries; there were no responsible people identified, etc..

[According to norms, a mortuary should be filled in one level with
ground, puddle and then with at least a 70 cm thick layer of
concrete. The designated territory should be also fenced. However,
in reality the grounds designated for the mortuaries that were used
included territory that was not appropriate for cropping
(?cultivation). Thus, the cattle mortuaries were frequently placed
near water marks (?). That was done according to previous (outdated)
cropping laws and regulations - Mod.NR]
[Under the Soviet system these cattle graves were not only mapped but
regularly soil sampled. What actions were taken when soils contained
anthrax spores was unclear; most positive graves went negative in 5-8
years. There are no significant scientific papers resulting from
these routine soil analyses. The sites were meant to be fenced.
Concreting them over was a concept, not a common reality. Off and on
we see reports such as this in the Russian press but their genesis
and purpose is unclear. A number of these anthrax graves do present a
risk to local livestock obviously but, unfortunately, what percentage
is unknown and what differentiates a persistent spore laden grave
from a spore-free grave is also unclear. Spores in acid soils, e.g.,
with a pH of 6.0 or less, soon die, that is known. How spores work
their way from the buried cow carcass to the surface can only be
speculated. Pasteur invoked earth worms as he recovered viable spores
from worm castes. The rest of us suspect that fluctuating water
tables may be more effective. That most anthrax graves are spore free
is obvious as otherwise their historical universality would ensure
that all cattle would have to be vaccinated annually, as there are
few farms where this disease has not occurred sometime in the past
150 years.- Mod MHJ]
