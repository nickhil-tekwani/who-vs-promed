Seasonal influenza update number 211
------------------------------------
Summary:

Globally the northern hemisphere influenza season was at inter-seasonal levels in most countries. Influenza B virus continued to be the majority of late season detections in most regions.

In North America, influenza levels were at inter-seasonal levels with some influenza B circulation still detected.

In Europe, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels in most countries.

In eastern Asia, influenza activity approached inter-seasonal levels in most countries with influenza B virus predominating.

In tropical Asia, influenza activity continued to decline in most countries. In northern Africa and western Asia, influenza activity remained low in most countries, with influenza B the predominant virus detected.

In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity is still low, although in some countries, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity is slowly increasing. Influenza detections were still low.

Based on FluNet reporting (as of 15 May 2014, 09:00 UTC), during weeks 17 to 18 (20 Apr 2014 to 3 May 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 81 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 40 300 specimens. 3739 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1696 (45.4 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 2043 (54.6 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 278 (31.2 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 613 (68.8 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 49 (89.1 per cent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 6 (10.9 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[Overall, throughout the northern hemisphere, the winter influenza epidemic is in decline or absent. And the southern hemisphere seasonal influenza epidemic is more subdued than in previous seasons. No new influenza strains have made their appearance in either hemisphere, and respiratory syncytial virus no longer appears as a significant feature. Influenza B virus infection occurs more prominently where influenza A virus infection is in decline. Readers are recommended to view the pdf file of the original text, where the data are present in detail in diagrammatic form. - Mod.CP]
