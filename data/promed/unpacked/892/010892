[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where an Ebola outbreak killed more than 4000 people in 2008, remains on high alert in March 2015 following 14 reported cases of cholera in the country since late February 2015. The city has not recorded any cases of the disease, but conditions for an outbreak remain favorable, however, with the council not being able to provide enough potable water, while fruit and vegetable vendors as well as those selling pre-cooked food are literally littering the streets.

Cholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate environmental management, including poor refuse collection, which is also common in the city. The situation is made ominous due to the fact that 434 cases of watery diarrhea were reported in the city in the 2nd week of March 2015, compared to the 361 reported in the previous week.

Director of health services Prosper Chonzi told journalists that there had been no confirmed cases of cholera in the city. "All cases of diarrhea are being sent for further investigations and we are happy that since the beginning of the outbreak, there has not been any single case of cholera recorded in Harare," Chonzi said. Most of the cholera cases have been reported in Beitbridge, on the border with South Africa, and Mashonaland East province along the border with Mozambique.

The government recently dispatched health teams to Mudzi District in the province following 3 reported cholera cases there, with Health and Child Care Minister David Parirenyatwa saying that there was need for cooperation between Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Mozambique has been identified as the source of the current cholera cases which have spread to neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of 13 Mar 2015 Mozambique had recorded 5894 cases and 47 deaths since 25 Dec 2014, Malawi 88 cases and 2 deaths since 13 Feb 2015, and Zimbabwe 14 cases and no deaths since late February 2015.

Zimbabwe recorded Africa's worst cholera outbreak in decades between 2008 and 2010 when more than 4200 people died from about 100 000 reported cases following the virtual collapse of the public health system. The outbreak spread to neighboring countries, especially South Africa and Botswana, as people travelled there to seek medical assistance.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Greater Accra Region)

In spite of the fact that many health facilities in the Greater Accra Region recorded high numbers of cholera cases in 2014, TV3's Catherine Frempong reports that holding centres which were to be constructed to arrest a possible outbreak in subsequent years were yet to be completed. This means pressure on health facilities could worsen in 2015, as nearly a hundred cases have been recorded in the Greater Accra Region alone. The construction of the holding centres which started during last year's [2014] outbreak have mostly stalled, while others have broken down. In 2014, the Greater Accra Region alone saw over 20 000 cholera cases, with over 2000 deaths.

"We did not declare the epidemic over so we didn't get to zero before we ended 2014. We were still recording cases even in December 2014. But it had reduced drastically compared to what we were recording in the middle of the year when we had the rains" that's according to Greater Accra Regional Health Director Dr Linda Van-Otoo. The outbreak last year [2014] exposed the unpreparedness of most health facilities as majority of them had no cholera holding bays, whiles those which had were overwhelmed by inadequate space.

The Ridge Hospital OPD [outpatient department] at Adabrabraka as of 18 Mar 2015, had 90 cases. The cholera bay with cholera cots, which hosted patients 2014, is no longer reliable. Cases are now treated at the OPD. "The bed that they lie on has a hole in it and a bucket is put under the hole; so when the diarrhea comes they just come as if they've turned on the tap. So sitting or even lying on a mattress where there is no hole will not be good. So those are the areas we also need improvement in."

LEKMA Hospital, recorded 1427 cases with 18 deaths in 2014, using a makeshift ward, a cholera bay which started after the outbreak has stalled; and already 2 cases have been reported. "If we run into the epidemic that we had last year, it will be a big challenge for us if that isolation center is not completed as soon as possible; a health official at LEKMA cautioned.

The Greater Accra Regional Health Director appealed to individuals and corporate organizations to assist the health facilities to complete the cholera isolation centers. Dr Linda Van-Otoo confirmed that the region alone has recorded 100 cases as of 18 Mar 2015, and thus asked residents to observe good hygienic practices to prevent the disease.

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Kasese District)
Date: Mon 23 Mar 2015

Uganda's Bwere General Hospital has blocked cholera victims from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] from accessing treatment at the health facility in Kasese district, sources confirmed on Monday, 23 Mar 2015. This comes a few days after health officials in Kasese confirmed an outbreak of cholera in the district which they say could have been spread from DRC. At least 6 cholera victims were admitted in the isolation unit at Bwere General Hospital last week [week of 16 Mar 2015].

Most of the victims were residents of Nyabugando ward, which is close to Mpondwe-Lubiriha town council along the Uganda-DRC border. It was reported that cholera had severely affected several villages in Ituri region in DRC forcing several victims to seek treatment from Bwere General Hospital.

Dr Timothy Muke, the head of the Bwera hospital isolation center says management has instead offered to provide medical supplies to health centers in Lubiriha and Kasindi towns in DRC so that patients are treated in their own country. There are more than 40 cholera patients in health centers in Lubiriha and Kasindi towns in DRC.

[4] Cholera - Kenya (Bomet County)
Date: Tue 17 Mar 2015
Source: AllAfrica, The Star [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201503171111.html


Hotels in Bomet town have been closed following a cholera outbreak. 2 people have died and 33 others admitted in hospital. The cases were reported in Chepalungu and Bomet on Fri 13 Mar 2015

Health executive Stanley Kiplangat attributed the outbreak to water shortages in the county. He said residents fetch untreated water from Nyangores River for use in hotels, restaurants and at home. Kiplangat addressed the press in Bomet town yesterday. He said many hotel owners buy water, whose source is unknown, from boda boda [bicycle or motorcycle taxis] operators and water bowsers [tankers]. Water levels at Nyangores River have gone down because of drought.

Some residents have accused the county government of not setting up effective measures to address the outbreak. They said one hotel was exempted from closure. Residents said the hotel owner uses water from Nyangores River. Other hotel owners said he is well connected to powerful county officials.

"The county government has failed terribly. This is the hotel that discharges its raw sewer to this main river but we are surprised it has been left out," a businessman told the Star in Bomet town. "It is very wrong and we are contemplating challenging this or taking some stern action."

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
