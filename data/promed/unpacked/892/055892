The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 22 Apr 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1353, of which 1287 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there were 880 deaths (814 confirmed and 66 probable) and 387 people healed.
- 68 suspected cases are under investigation;
-13 new confirmed cases, including 5 in Katwa, 4 in Vuhovi, 1 in Butembo, 1 in Mabalako, 1 in Masereka, and 1 in Beni;
- 6 new confirmed case deaths, including 2 community deaths, 1 in Butembo and 1 in Masereka; 4 deaths at CTE, including 3 in Butembo and 1 in Katwa.

News of the response

Minister of Health visits Butembo teams
---------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, went to Butembo this Tue 23 Apr 2019 to comfort the teams of the response after the tragic events of the Easter weekend. The teams were still in shock, so it was important for the minister to be with them so that they know they are not alone in this event. He regretted that the unacceptable happened as teams' efforts began to bear fruit in the field. In recent weeks, there has been an increase in the number of reported alerts and greater ownership of the response by the community, which has begun to open its eyes to the danger posed by this disease. With these advances, it was then possible to hope for a reduction in the number of cases in the city of Butembo in the near future.
- However, the Minister of Health insisted on the importance for the teams not to give up and continue to reach out to this wounded population. He noted that several community leaders, who were so far silent, have strongly condemned the murder of Dr. Richard Mouzoko. Moreover, when he arrived in Butembo, the minister was greeted by a delegation of customary chiefs who assured him that they were fully involved in sensitizing the population. He hopes this will further facilitate the work of the response teams.
- He asked the security commission to do its job to ensure the safety of all the actors involved in this response, because it is not normal for a person to lose his or her life when here to heal and save the lives of millions of Congolese. He reminded the teams that they have no choice but to finish off this epidemic as soon as possible, as each passing day is an extra day when officers are exposed to violence. Ending the epidemic once and for all is also the best way to honor the memory of all the colleagues who died during this epidemic, as well as all the patients for whom the health workers fought and who did not survive the disease.

#Ebola: +4 cases today. It's the 1st time since [1 Apr 2019] that the number has been so low. Most days in April [2019] there have been double-digit numbers. But the slowdown of activity in the wake of the killing of Dr. Mouzoko may mean this number is artificially low.
2. Only 130 doses of vaccine were administered yesterday; 180 the day before. This after 10 days or so of 700-900 doses a day being used. Dangerous to go slow on this.

News of the response

Mass of thanksgiving, Dr. Richard Mouzoko
---------------------
- A mass of thanksgiving was held this Sat 20 Apr 2019 at the Butembo hostel in memory of the Cameroonian epidemiologist deployed by WHO, Dr. Richard Mouzoko Kibound, who died the day before [Fri 19 Apr 2019] in an attack on health clinics. This mass was said by the chaplain of UCG [Catholic University of Graben] university clinics, Father Christian Tandari, who revealed that if God reminded him of Dr. Richard Mouzoko on Good Friday [Fri 19 Apr 2019], it is to show that Richard is good in Christ; like Christ, as a physician, Richard gave his life for his brothers. The body of the deceased arrived this afternoon in Goma, from which he will be repatriated to his country of origin.
- Dr Aruna, national response coordinator, on behalf of the Minister of Health, regretted this act and urged members of the national and international response not to give in to discouragement, but rather to continue their efforts until the end of this epidemic in order to honor the memory of their missing colleague.
- In addition, another attack took place this Saturday [20 Apr 2019] around 3:00 a.m. in the Katwa sub-coordination office located at the Katwa Reference General Hospital. This attack was mastered by the police in Katwa, and the death toll is a dead assailant and 3 wounded still on the side of the attackers.

[2] Summary
- Mon 22 Apr 2019. DRC notes 23 new Ebola cases as another hospital attacked
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drc-notes-23-new-ebola-cases-another-hospital-attacked
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the weekend and through today, the Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 23 new Ebola cases and 19 deaths, while a Katwa hospital saw a violent attack that left one of the assailants dead.

The totals swell outbreak numbers to 1340 cases, of which 1274 are confirmed. The number of deaths rose to 874.

The Katwa attack came one day after a hospital attack in Butembo that took the life of a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist deployed to the outbreak region. Both Katwa and Butembo have been hot spots of virus activity in the last several months; more than half of all cases reported in recent weeks originated in Katwa.

According to officials, the attack in Katwa took place around 3:00 a.m. local time on [Sat 20 Apr 2019] at the sub-coordination office located at the Katwa Reference General Hospital. Police controlled the attack, and 3 assailants were wounded in addition to the assailant that the police killed.

The attacks are another challenge to response efforts in the region, which have been hindered by community resistance and earlier violent attacks.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, tweeted the same day about the most recent attack: "Appalled by another attack on health workers saving lives in DRC. The violence not only disrupts vital Ebola outbreak response but also creates risk of disease spread. Latest attack was 24 hours after Butembo and @WHO colleague's death," he said.

Eight of the 19 deaths recorded since [20 Apr 2019] took place in the community, which raises the risk of further disease spread as family members and funeral attendees may have been exposed to the virus if an improper burial took place.

One of the community deaths described 2 days ago occurred in a 10-month-old child from Beni, who died shortly after arriving in an Ebola treatment facility. The health ministry said patients who die within 24 hours of arriving at a treatment facility are classified as a community death.

As of today, the DRC said 105 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Ring vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine continues, with 104 544 people vaccinated since 8 Aug of last year [2018]. This includes 28 056 in Katwa, 22,777 in Beni, 12 656 in Butembo, 6740 in Mabalako, and 4433 in Mandima.

[The community deaths do not appear to be decreasing. Until the members of the community change where individuals go to the Ebola treatment centers for medical care when they are sick, Ebola will continue to spread. Proper PPE is lacking in the community centers, and safe burials are not likely to be regularly performed. - Mod.LK]

[3] Response
- Wed 24 Apr 2019. Uganda: outbreak simulation
[AllAfrica/WHO, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201904240906.html

Uganda's Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness and response have capacity gaps that need urgent attention to be able to effectively respond to a potential outbreak of the disease. The gaps were identified during a simulation exercise (SimEx) that was conducted recently in Wakiso (Entebbe) and Kasese (Mpondwe and Kagando) districts.

Specifically, the SimEx tested the functionality and coordination of the preparedness pillars, identified weaknesses, and proposed urgent actions for improvement. It critically evaluated readiness at national, district, and community levels.

Among the challenges identified was inadequate coordination and communication between the public health emergency operations centre (PHEOC), district authorities, and health workers in Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and at points of entry (PoEs). This challenge was evident at the Entebbe Grade B hospital ETU, Entebbe International Airport, and at Kagando hospital in Kasese district. In a real EVD outbreak, this challenge would lead to delayed identification, notification, transfer, and management of patients ,which is potentially dangerous.

Surveillance preparedness had gaps in designation and preparation of isolation areas, tracing of contacts, and security at the ETUs for patients and property. At Mpondwe border PoE and at Kagando hospital, major gaps identified included inconsistent screening of travellers, inadequate deployment of screening staff, and improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and poor observance of infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols. Case definition forms were also not available at Mpondwe PoE.

For case management, the inadequacies were in patient management; wearing and removing PPEs by health workers; knowledge on preparing chlorine solution; observance of the 5 moments of hand hygiene; waste management; and adherence to the buddy system. Other gaps were on patient documentation and signage in the ETUs.

Regarding IPC, the SimEx pointed out inadequate disinfection of surfaces, adherence to IPC protocols, and poor handling of patient property, which can expose health workers and other people to the disease. At the ETU, the exercise identified a lack of well-defined roles for the laboratory team members, which affects sample collection and management. Risk communication preparedness was lacking adequate IEC materials in local languages at PoEs, in the ETUs, and in the communities.

However, there were a number of positive aspects observed in all the pillars. For instance, the National Task Force was found to be on top of the process and can easily mobilize different pillars to respond to an outbreak in record time. Communication between the PHEOC and public health emergency sites was also good. Primary and secondary screening at the PoEs and in the community were also well done. There are adequate materials such as thermometers, PPEs, hand washing facilities, and chlorine in all the sites, an indication that the country has taken major prevention and control precautions should an outbreak occur.

The ETU at Bwera was noted to be adequately prepared, and the health workers demonstrated good knowledge of EVD management. The unit was also well maintained with good hygiene, waste management, and availability of enough water. There was an excellent collaboration between security and health workers at Mpondwe PoE.

In addition, the SimEx found heightened community risk perception pointing to the good work done on community engagement and risk communication. The village health teams, especially in Kasese district, were prepared and demonstrated the ability to identify suspect cases and promptly pass on EVD information in the community.

Ambulances were also found in all the designated areas and transported "patients" as required in an outbreak situation. Logistics such as PPEs, infrared thermometers, and handwashing facilities were found in all places, as required, and were being used. [See the link for the original article by WHO. - Mod.LK].

At a protest on Wednesday [24 Apr 2019] in Butembo, the biggest city to be affected by the current outbreak, dozens of Congolese doctors and nurses marched behind a banner reading "Ebola exists" and urged authorities to take additional security measures.

"If our security is not guaranteed, we will go on strike from the 1st week of May [2019]," Dr. Kalima Nzanzu said, reading from a memo to Butembo's mayor, Sylvain Kanyamanda.

Kanyamanda told Reuters that he understood the health workers' frustrations and that the government was determined to respond to their demands.

An Ebola outbreak in Congo has killed more than 800 people and infected hundreds more. The crisis has worsened due to local mistrust of the government and aid workers. Ebola treatment centres have been burned to the ground, and many people are reluctant to see a doctor. Canadian doctor Vinh-Kim Nguyen tells us what he saw on a recent mission to Congo for Doctors Without Borders.

[4] Vaccine
- Wed 24 Apr 2019. 2nd experimental vaccine
[The Guardian, abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/24/rumour-violence-congo-drc-ebola-outbreak-out-of-control
[Byline: Esdras Tsongo and Rebecca Ratcliffe]

An experimental vaccine, made by Merck and thought to be highly effective, is being offered to frontline workers as well as known contacts of Ebola patients, and in turn, their contacts. However, health workers warn that there are also delays in reaching contacts. Around one in 10 people offered the vaccine either decline the offer or are absent.

It is likely that a 2nd experimental vaccine, developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, could be rolled out within the next 2 months, according to Yap Boum, professor at Mbarara University, Uganda. It's thought the vaccine will be used as a preventative measure in surrounding areas where the disease has not yet spread, but this will require large numbers of health workers to administer the treatment.

"The human resource is really the key point," said Boum, who is also regional representative for Epicenter Africa, the research arm of MSF. "Then you have the logistics: How are you going to deploy it? It seems simple, but when you are in DRC and you see the state of the roads and you are in rainy season, it complicates some of those things.

"The vaccine is not the [magic] bullet," he added. "We may use the 2nd vaccine, but if there is still distrust in the community [the outbreak] will continue."

Of more than 90 000 people vaccinated against #Ebola, only 71 developed the disease. Of these, 56 had the 1st symptoms less than 10 days after vaccination, before they could develop their immune protection, and 9 died.

No deaths were recorded among vaccinees who developed #Ebola disease more than 10 days after vaccination. The overall case fatality rate was reduced among all vaccinated persons who developed #Ebola (9 of 71 or 12.6%).

[5] Crisis
- Wed 24 Apr 2019 DR Congo: Imminent hunger crisis threatens Ebola-stricken North Kivu
[Relief Web / Norwegian Refugee Council, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-imminent-hunger-crisis-threatens-ebola-stricken-north-kivu

An average of 87% of displaced people are living on just over a meal a day in areas already plagued by conflict and Ebola in Congo's North Kivu [province]. Families affected by the deadly virus have lost access to food and are on the brink of malnutrition.

Ebola cannot be eradicated if people are left starving, warns the Norwegian Refugee Council. "Fighting Ebola should not make the world forget that millions of Congolese cannot find enough to eat," warns NRC DR Congo country director, Maureen Philippon. "This is due to conflict and insecurity, displacement, a series of poor harvests, and upset economic activities. The current Ebola crisis further worsens these conditions."

An unintended consequence of the outbreak has been its adverse effect on the economy of upper North Kivu. People infected or suspected of Ebola infection have been forced to abandon their work when they are incubated.

According to recent data collected by the UN, several areas in upper North Kivu -- including areas affected by the Ebola outbreak -- are experiencing major spikes in hunger rates. During the 1st 3 months of this year [2019], the province experienced between a 31% to 66% increase in hunger among displaced families and the communities hosting them.

"We are deeply concerned that the international community is sacrificing one crisis for another, rather than looking at the whole picture, and now the population is suffering further as a result," warned Philippon. "We must rethink how we address these needs."

Upper North Kivu's territories have been insecure for years with massive inter-communal and inter-ethnic conflicts causing the majority of farming families to flee and abandon their fields. This has led to instances of crop failure and a decline in markets. Low humanitarian funding has also had a crippling effect on the people in need within these areas. Several aid agencies have had to close operations in the beleaguered province between 2017 and 2018.

"People are much less likely to seek treatment or be treated successfully for Ebola if their basic needs are not being met," said Philippon. "If we continue on this course, we will face a double wave of sickness and loss of life much sooner than we think."

Facts and figures:
- 70% increase in hunger was recorded in DR Congo between 2017 and 2018.
- Between 2016 and 2018, there was a nearly 5% increase of Congolese people who listed a lack of food as their motivation for fleeing their homes.

- Sat 20 Apr 2019. New Attack on Ebola Center in Congo; One Militia Member Killed
[VOA News, abridged, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/a/new-attack-on-ebola-center-in-congo-1-militia-member-killed/4884172.html

Militia members have attacked an Ebola treatment center hours after another attack killed a staffer with the World Health Organization, a Congolese official said Saturday [20 Apr 2019]. Butembo city's deputy mayor, Patrick Kambale Tsiko, told the Associated Press that the attackers armed with machetes tried to burn down the center in Katwa district overnight. Military and police guarding the center killed one militia member and detained 5 others, he said.

Such violence has deeply complicated efforts to contain what has become the 2nd-deadliest Ebola virus outbreak in history, with the number of new cases jumping each time treatment and prevention work is disrupted.

An attack on Friday [19 Apr 2019] on a hospital in Butembo killed an epidemiologist from Cameroon who had been deployed to the outbreak in eastern Congo. Tsiko cited witnesses as saying the attackers wrongly blamed foreigners for bringing the deadly virus to the region.

This outbreak now has more than 1300 confirmed and probable cases, including 855 deaths, since being declared last August [2018]. The number of new cases has risen alarmingly in recent weeks after other attacks, leading the WHO to convene an expert committee that decided the outbreak, while of "deep concern,'' is not yet a global health emergency.

Both attacks by rebel groups and community resistance have posed serious challenges to containing Ebola, which can spread quickly and can be fatal in up to 90% of cases. Congo's North Kivu region had never faced an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever before, and health workers have battled misinformation and rumors. Some residents did not believe Ebola was real.

In the hospital attack on Friday [19 Apr 2019], gunmen burst into a conference room and forced people onto the floor, taking their belongings and "accusing them of perpetuating false rumors about Ebola,'' according to a statement by IMA World Health, a Washington-based aid group that supports the hospital. The gunmen then shot the Cameroonian doctor in the abdomen and left, firing into the air and sending staff and patients fleeing.

Friday's [19 Apr 2019] attack was at least the 4th on an IMA World Health-supported facility involved in Ebola response efforts, the statement said. Four days earlier, attackers looted a nearby clinic and briefly kidnapped a nurse. The clinic remains closed.

While the new attack on the treatment center in Katwa is the 1st by militia members, it has been attacked a number of times by anxious families who sought to claim the bodies of loved ones who died of the disease.

The REDHO / ASBL [non-profit organization] Human Rights Network is concerned about the insecurity of Ebola teams in the town of Butembo. REDHO / ASBL, in its press release of this Mon 22 Apr [2019] made 3 recommendations.

This platform of human rights organizations recommends to the authorities responsible for maintaining order and peace that they prevent damage by protecting the population and its property and paying particular attention to the nursing staff during this period of the epidemic of Ebola virus disease.

[They also recommend to] the attorney general of the Republic of Butembo, as well as the Butembo detached military auditor, that they conduct a sincere investigation to ensure that the perpetrators are tried in accordance with national and international laws.

REDHO also recommends that caregivers remain vigilant in reporting suspected cases to authorized services.

-Tue 23 Apr 2019. The Doctor Killed in Friday's Ebola Attack Was Dedicated ... But Also Afraid
[NPR - Goats and Soda, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Nurith Aizenman]


Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung arrived in Democratic Republic of the Congo just 4 weeks ago, one of hundreds of disease experts that the World Health Organization has recruited to help curb the ongoing Ebola outbreak there.

An epidemiologist from Cameroon, Mouzoko was assigned to lead the local response team in one of the worst hot spots within the city of Butembo. He was an instant hit with his team, able to joke around with them even as he pushed them hard.

But at least one colleague says that behind the scenes, Mouzoko was starting to grow uneasy. Since February [2019] there had been a series of direct attacks on Ebola responders. Gunmen stormed 2 Ebola treatment centers in 3 separate assaults. And increasingly, when health workers and burial teams would enter some of the hardest hit communities, they were threatened with stone-throwing or worse.

"One of [Mouzoko's] colleagues told me he would say, 'I'm scared in this environment,'" says the WHO's head of on-the-ground operations for the Ebola response, Dr. Michel Yao. Mouzoko had a wife and 4 children in Cameroon, the oldest just 12. "He would say, 'I have my kids. I need to be careful so I can go back [to them].'"

On Friday [19 Apr 2019], Mouzoko's worst fears were realized. Two armed men burst into a staff meeting he was leading. Yao says witnesses told him the attackers 1st grabbed staffers' cell phones and other equipment, then began shooting. Two people were injured. Mouzoko was killed.

Hours later, around 3:00 a.m. Saturday morning [20 Apr 2019], a handful of people tried to set fire to another Ebola command center, this one at a hospital in a suburb called Katwa. Police fought them off, killing one attacker and capturing 3 others.

Several days later WHO and Congolese officials are still grappling with what comes next.

One challenge, says Yao, is that it's still not clear who precisely was behind each attack. That makes it hard to tease out their motives, let alone figure out how to stop them.

For instance, the fact that the gunmen in Friday's [19 Apr 2019] attack were so focused on stealing equipment "suggests an economic motive," says Yao. But he notes that witnesses also report that the assailants accused the team of making up Ebola as a ruse to make money off the population. The witnesses told him that the attackers said, "Ebola doesn't exist! [You've] invented the disease."

That fits into a larger pattern of community distrust that has plagued Ebola responders since the outbreak was declared last August [2018]. There have been years of armed conflict in the outbreak zone. Dozens of armed groups are active in the area. And many citizens feel victimized by the government. So they're suspicious of authorities, and by extension, health workers.

Over the last several weeks, WHO and government officials say they've been stepping up outreach efforts aimed at winning people's confidence.

But with each attack, they've had to take time to regroup and reassess their security precautions. And that's required pausing key activities like vaccinating people exposed to the virus. The result has been a surge of new infections. Before the 1st major attack in February [2019], there were roughly 30 new cases a week; this month the weekly new case count has regularly hovered around 70 and even reached as high as 110.

That pattern seems likely to repeat itself in the aftermath of the attack that killed Mouzoko.

Yao says the team has substantially cut back its operations, while officials assess how to keep them safe.

At a recent all-staff meeting, says Yao, several team members expressed openly what Mouzoko had reportedly been feeling privately, that this work might simply have become too dangerous.
