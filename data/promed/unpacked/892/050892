With 71 fresh cases surfacing Saturday [4 Sep 2010], the total number of
dengue cases in the city went up to 1226. According to official sources,
out of the total cases so far, 1061 have been reported from Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD) areas and 125 from New Delhi Municipal Committee
(NDMC) areas. The remaining cases have emerged from other parts of the city
while some are from some outstation. The total number of deaths due to
dengue has been 3 this season [2010].

What is cause for concern is that in comparison to previous years, the
number of infections this year has crossed the 1000 mark within 3 months
when even in years which were the worst for the disease the 1000-mark was
attained only at the very end of the season. According to statistics
released by the MCD, the number of cases till August end in 2009 was only
12 while the infections were 136 and 24 in the same periods in 2008 and
2007 respectively. The total number of dengue cases and deaths were 1312
and 2 (2008), 548 and 1 (2007), and 3366 and 36 (2006).

What is baffling the civic authorities is that besides the unauthorized
colonies and low-lying areas of the capital, affluent regions and
establishments have been found to be conducive for mosquito breeding.

Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP),
the department that implements antilarval measures in Delhi, detected 40
per cent of the total breeding sites in posh south and central Delhi
colonies. A massive cleaning up campaign to tackle the dengue menace will
begin from Monday [6 Sep 2010].

The MCD and the NDMC will start spraying operations for killing of larva in
all stagnant pools of water in public places.

[This report is an example of how dengue virus vector mosquitoes can breed
in more affluent neighborhoods as well as in poorer ones. Given the steady
increase in dengue cases in Delhi for over a month, one wonders why the
vector mosquito control effort is just now getting started.

The monsoons have always been welcomed by the people of Karachi but the
pleasant showers have a flipside -- a sharp rise in dengue fever cases. So
far this year [2010], 93 cases have been reported to the government in
Sindh, with up to 20 cases reported directly after the rains, said Dr
Shakeel Malik, who is in charge of the Dengue Surveillance Cell. The cell
was activated on Tuesday [24 Aug 2010] given the rise in numbers. Out of
this year's patients [2010], 70 tested positive for the virus and were
treated. Only one of them was from Thatta and the rest of them were from
Karachi.

As with most information gathering in Pakistan, however, these numbers are
only the official statistics. Haematologist Dr Tahir Shamsi, who is the
director of National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD), warns that the
government's data is incomplete as the dengue cell isn't receiving numbers
from all of the hospitals in the city. "[The NIBD] alone received 9
patients in the last 24 hours," he said to prove his point. "There have
been a total of 21 cases reported this month [August 2010]."

Dr Bushra Jamil of the AKUH [Aga Khan University Hospitals], said that the
months between May and October are peak months for the outbreak of the
viral fever. "We get patients in the hundreds during this time every year
but fortunately the mortality rate is not very high," she said.

noted that the dilemma of the extensive flooding in the country, especially
in Sindh, may aggravate the situation. This situation illustrates the
dilemma of where best to invest time and limited resources in the face of
the national disaster of the extensive floods. It is not surprising that
dengue takes a back seat when more than a million people are adversely
impacted by the floods.

Mosquitoborne dengue fever has killed 36 people in Laos this year [2010],
the worst epidemic in at least 5 years, the World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Friday [20 Aug 2010].

"It's a big epidemic year for dengue here," WHO epidemiologist Hannah Lewis
told AFP from Laos. She said that in the last 5 years, the highest annual
number of reported deaths was 22, with about 10-15 deaths the norm.
However, Lewis said there appeared to be no particular cause for the
increase and that dengue epidemics were cyclical. The last severe epidemic
in Laos was 7 years ago, she said, adding that "many other countries in the
region also have this same pattern."

The communist government has been taking appropriate measures, including
prevention, fumigation, education, and clinical training, she said.

Laos, with about 7 million people, is one of Asia's poorest nations.

[PRO/MBDS is grateful to Dr Barry Dyer for information on dengue situation
in Laos. According to the newswire above, a total of 36 fatalities due to
dengue infection were reported in Laos between 1 Jan 2010 and 20 Aug 2010.
However, the newswire does not mention total numbers and locations of cases
over the same period.

Since 1983, dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) have become
increasingly important public health problems in Laos. Cases have been
occurring in big and crowded cities, mostly in 5 provinces (Vientiane
municipality, Borikhamvay, Khammouane, Savannakhet, and Champassak) in
Laos. The 1st larger outbreak was recorded in 1987. The outbreak caused
9699 cases and 295 deaths, affecting several provinces (see
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section332/Section519_2396.htm>).

Following the outbreak in 1987, the annual incidence of dengue declined
until 1995, when another outbreak occurred with 7781 cases and 31 deaths.
Since the mid-1990s, the scale and frequency of outbreaks have increased,
while the case fatality rate has been decreasing. Usually, dengue
transmission reaches a seasonal peak during the months of July and August,
shortly after the onset of the rainy season. For more details regarding
surveillance and response, see
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/epidemiology/dengue/lao_profile.htm>.

In the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO) report
available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/dengue/data.htm>, the
number of reported cases of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever
(DF/DHF) in Laos between 2000 and 2010 (week 20) were shown as below:
Year: cases / deaths
2000: 1377 / 4
2001: 3968 / 3

88 per cent higher than last year's [2009] 33 102 for the same period but a
health official noted that the higher figure may be due to the government's

nationwide. There were 465 deaths were recorded so far this year [2010]
compared to the 350 deaths recorded in 2009 over the same period. The DOH

Over the last 3 days, 17 new cases of dengue fever were reported, to a
total of 58 since March, prompting the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) to warn households to pay special attention to areas where water can
accumulate. Of the new cases, 15 originated in or near Gushan District,
Kaohsiung City. Local health officials are paying special attention to the
area, which has turned into a hotbed of dengue fever infection.

The nation's 1st death from DHF this year [2010] was a 75 year old woman
from Gushan.

CDC deputy director-general Chou Jih-haw said the center was working with
local officials to step up mosquito-control efforts and educate residents
in the area about cleaning out containers, vases, old tires, and other
places where pools of water can easily build up and provide an environment
for mosquitoes to proliferate.

Health officials said that violators may face fines of TWD 3000-15 000 [USD
94-470], and may repeatedly be fined until improvements are made.

According to the Regional Health Agency, the circulation of dengue virus
persists in Mayotte. On 1 Sep [2010] health authorities revealed that 75
cases of dengue have been confirmed on the island in the lagoon [area] and
31 probable cases were [also] identified.

As a reminder, "surveillance of dengue in Mayotte was reinforced in March
[2010], following an outbreak of dengue fever in the Comoros. It is based
on virological surveillance by CHM (Centre Hospitalier de Mayotte)
laboratory, an active search by the Anti-Vector Agents (LAV) of sick people
in the vicinity of any probable or confirmed case of dengue, follow up of
suspected cases seen by physicians in the sentinel surveillance network and
the Emergency Department [of the] CHM, and monitoring the distribution of
antipyretic drugs by the sentinel network of pharmacies.

On 1 Sep [2010], the lab CHM confirmed "75 cases of dengue fever on a total
of 914 tests carried out since early March [2010], 13 new cases confirmed
since the last epidemiological point of 22 Jul 2010." In addition, the
number of probable cases was 31, 7 new cases identified in less than 2
months. The single serotype of dengue virus circulating in Mayotte is type 3.

The Regional Health Agency said that since the start of circulation of the
virus in Mayotte, 9 people have been hospitalized at CHM," of which 6 (67
per cent) had the simple form of dengue fever and 3 with signs signifying
[medical] alerts." So far, no severe form of dengue and no deaths have been
registered.

17 new cases diagnosed during the 1st week in August [2010]." According to
Dr Antoine, there was a noted increase in infection during the months of
July and August. As compared to only one case in February, 6 by June, and
with the number jumping to 15 in July.

"People should be making it difficult for the mosquitoes to breed, just
make it difficult by cleaning up the place," he said. Presently there are 2
types of [dengue virus] strains recorded in Grenada -- type 1 and type 2,
and there have been 2 cases of DHF both of which were mild and were treated
successfully.

Dengue deaths in Honduras increased to 62 following confirmation of the
death of a 36 year old construction worker infected by the virus. Despite
the government decree last July [2010] of a national state of emergency in
order to halt the spread of the disease, the number [of cases] continues to
increase and 53 700 cases of classical dengue fever and close to 1800 cases
of DHF have been recorded.

Since the beginning of 2010, dengue has killed at least 530 Brazilians.
This number, that takes into account just 8 months of this year [2010], now
exceeds the old record of 2008, when the disease took 478 victims [lives].
The states of Sao Paulo, with 120 [deaths] and Minas Gerais with 82
confirmed [dengue] deaths, have 38 per cent of the deaths in the country.

The data were gathered from the 26 state Secretariats of Health, as well as
the Federal District, and consist of just confirmed [dengue] deaths.
Despite this, these [data] are not definitive. On the one hand, the number
of victims could be even more, as there are another 202 deaths under
investigation, and on the other, the Ministry of Health still has to review
the information provided by the states.

In addition to the record [number] of deaths, in 2010 dengue has caused
more serious cases. As of 3 Jul [2010], there were 9688 DHF cases and
dengue with complications recorded -- these data include confirmed cases as
well as those still being analyzed. This number is less than that of 2008,
when there were 22 140 confirmed occurrences of serious [disease].

The number of dengue cases in the state increases. According to a bulletin
released this Thursday morning (26 [Aug 2010]) by the state Secretariat of
Health, in 2010, Pernambuco has 39 332 reported cases of classical dengue
fever with 9726 of them confirmed. The number of reported [cases]
represents an increase of 513.7 per cent in relation to the same period in
2009, when 6246 suspected cases with 1335 confirmed cases were registered.

In 2010, 249 patients have presented with symptoms suspected of DHF. Of
these, 53 cases have been confirmed. Of the 59 deaths that were associated
with dengue this year, 16 have now been discarded, 5 were confirmed, and 38
continue under investigation.

Research carried out by Fiozcuz [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation] sowed that larvae
of the dengue [virus] are more resistant to insecticides. In the
laboratory, _Aedes aegypti_ larvae were subjected to doses of Temefos
[abate larvicide], the insecticide used since 1996 by the Ministry of
Health to combat foci of the disease in the whole country. The results
indicated that 30 per cent of the larvae that were exposed to the product
were resistant.

[Resistance to Temephos is not surprising, following many years of its use
as a larvicide. It has been an important product in vector control
programs. It would be of interest to know what alternative larvicides are
being considered. - Mod.TY]

[The 30 Aug 2010 edition of Portal Click
(<http://www.portalclick.com.br/portalclick/2010/08/30/juiz-de-fora-ja-conta-17-mortes-por-causa-da-dengue/>)
reported that the town of Juiz de Fora had 17 DHF deaths. Juiz de Fora is a
municipality in Minas Gerais state, and is the 4th largest municipality in
the state in population exceeded by Belo Horizonte. The latest fatal case
was a 3 month old infant. The municipal Secretariat is concerned about the
possibility that a new dengue virus, dengue virus 4, has been introduced
into the state. This appears to be speculative at the present time, with no
laboratory confirmation of it presence. - Mod.TY

17 deaths in one year are not just a few. A prime example is the death of a
infant from DHF. It was expected. ProMED-PORT has repeated this to
exhaustion. The incidence coefficient is about 1700 cases per 100 000
population, fatality was a little less than 1:1000 (quite reasonable), and
the mortality was 3.2 per 100 000 population -- very high. - Mod.LJS]
