Response to John Grabenstein, others interested.
Having read the paper in question, I had no trouble finding appropriate
references, to adequate controls. It is not my intent to criticize you, but
suggest a re-read may be in order. The issues are too important, to be
dismissed so lightly. Let's discuss the issues a bit!!!
I am familiar with this and other related research and have not found the
work, to be deficient in scope, experimental design nor results and
conclusions. The issues are extremely vital and appear to be legitimately
valid. I would like to inquire why you and your employer, the DOD, are so
focused, on disproving this work. It you are indeed involved in looking for
contributing factors, to what is referred to as GWS or GWI or PGI, why then
are you not willing to build upon what has provided to you, through this
worthwhile research effort? Could a larger population be tested? Certainly!
Could additional control groups be added? Absolutely!! Could a wide-scale
study be performed on those from the GW Era (Deployed & Non-Deployed) and
from earlier and more recent military personnel, who are also sharing
symptoms and those not exhibiting any symptoms? Of Course!! The issues are
more is not always better and too many have suffered too much for too long.
There is no need to delay medical diagnostics and treatments, in order to
perform additional or expanded studies. Remember, these researchers, who
have done the research and authored this paper, did not have the resources
available, that you and your employer have had. These independent
researchers were able to provide their valuable study findings, on a
relative shoestring. Yet, for 9+ years, after many millions of dollars
spent, DOD has been unable to come up with any concrete or
significant findings. One begins to consider the reasons may be deeply
anchored, in not wanting to find the answers. It is beyond reason why that
would be the case, but it certainly looks that way, to an ever growing
population.
The issues are accountability, credibility and responsibility. The issues
are, today, as they have been for over 9 years, since health problems
started being reported, by deployed and non-deployed GW Era military and
civilian contract personnel. The issues are the sick and the dead. The
issues are no sincere efforts have been made, by those who are supposed to
be responsible, to find the answers.
The issues are no meaningful medical diagnostic and treatment protocols
have been developed and initiated for many thousands of US & allied Vets.
The issues are hundreds, perhaps thousands of wives and children of these
ill, dying and dead, also have GWS types of illnesses.
The issues are also the criticizing of good solid scientific research
instead of making a sincere effort to answer to address the real issues.
The issues are spin doctoring, not about Docs doing good science.

In Drs. Asa, Cao, and Garry's article in Experimental & Molecular
Pathology, I certainly did see the mention of positive controls and
negative controls. My concern is about the scientific adequacy of the
controls selected. I tried to convey that the controls were not "proper."
Given that squalene is already in every human body, I'm concerned that we
don't know from the paper if the positive controls already had antibodies
before receiving the NIH
placebo. Nor do we know as an explicit experiment that intentional
injection of squalene will lead to antibodies to a substance already
present. Similarly, for negative controls: if the NIH product is believed
to induce anti-squalene antibodies, are there data to show that the test is
negative before the injection of the squalene-containing placebo? The standard
scientific approach is to change just one variable at a time, not to change
both the sample (the group of humans studied) and the exposure (NIH's
squalene-containing product) simultaneously.
It is a fine scientific goal to search for an assay that would reliably
detect anti-squalene antibodies. Once we have one, it will be useful in a
variety of research and clinical settings, including assessing the health
of Persian Gulf War veterans. But if we aren't certain what a test is
measuring, it's premature to proceed.
The healthy give-and-take of scientific discourse is intended to result in
ever-better science. If I am wrong, that will become apparent in due
course. Peer reviewers have certainly taught me many things and pointed out
my shortcomings often enough in my career.
