It is well known, especially among primatologists, that many human
infectious diseases are transmitted with some frequency to animals. For
example, measles (transmitted from infected children) can be devastating to
non-human primates and _M. tuberculosis_ infection, shigellosis, hepatitis
A and B, and a number of human respiratory viral infections are known to
infect non-human primates and are thought to be of human origin.
