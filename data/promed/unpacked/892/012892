Hepatitis A infections linked to children adopted from Ethiopia and
their family contacts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 19 Jul 2007, The CDC Health Alert Network issued an official
Health Advisory titled "Hepatitis A Infections Linked to Children
Adopted from Ethiopia and Their Family Contacts." It is reproduced
below in its entirety:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently
received reports of hepatitis A in children and adults linked to
adoptees from Ethiopia. Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the
hepatitis A virus. Symptoms usually occur abruptly and include
fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice
(yellowing of the skin or eyes), and diarrhea. Jaundice is common in
adults but rare in children. Most children under the age of 6 years
do not get sick from the infection, but can spread it to older
children and adults, who often become ill. Older persons and persons
with chronic liver disease can have more serious illness. The overall
mortality rate from hepatitis A is 0.3 percent, but it is 1.8 percent
among persons aged >=50 years. Symptoms generally last up to 2
months; there is no chronic (long-term) form of the disease.
The virus is found in the stool (feces) of persons with hepatitis A.
It is usually spread from person to person by putting something in
the mouth that has been contaminated with stool. Frequent hand
washing with soap and water, particularly after using the bathroom,
changing a diaper, and before preparing or eating food, is very
important in preventing the spread of hepatitis A. To prevent
hepatitis A virus infections, the CDC recommends that travelers to
areas with high rates of hepatitis A, including Ethiopia, receive
hepatitis A vaccine as soon as travel is considered. The CDC also
recommends that all children >=1 year of age receive the hepatitis A
vaccine. Other household members and caregivers of children adopted
from Ethiopia should consider being vaccinated before adopted
children are brought to the United States.
Adopted children, household members, or other persons experiencing
symptoms of hepatitis A should contact a healthcare provider for an
evaluation. Persons exposed to hepatitis A who have not been
previously immunized should contact their healthcare provider or
local health department to determine if they should receive an
immunization or immunoglobulin that might prevent the illness. More
information about hepatitis A is available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis>.
CDC recommends that all international travelers consult a travel
healthcare provider 4-6 weeks prior to travel to determine if any
other measures, such as immunizations or medications, are indicated
for the planned itinerary. Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as
measles and mumps, are still common in many parts of the world,
including developed countries. The CDC website
(<http://www.cdc.gov/travel>) has a specific section for Traveling
with Children, which includes general health advice for international
adoptees and their adoptive parents, and Travel Notices, which
describe current disease information of interest to travelers.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[The simple message is that the Ethiopian adoptees themselves are
unlikely to be at risk from hepatitis A virus infection, whereas
their new North American parents and other adults they may have
contact with may incur a slightly enhanced risk of developing severe
forms of hepatitis in the long term. Vaccination should be considered
imperative for all intending parents. Hepatitis A vaccine has been
licensed in the United States for use in persons 12 months of age and
older. The vaccine is recommended (before exposure to hepatitis A
virus) for persons who are more likely to get hepatitis A virus
infection or are more likely to get seriously ill if they do get
hepatitis A. The vaccines currently licensed in the United States are
HAVRIX (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) and VAQTA (manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc).
Hepatitis A viruses are resistant to elevated temperature and low pH
and can persist in the environment on contaminated surfaces for long
periods. For information on disinfectants used to destroy resistant
viruses like hepatitis A virus on hard surfaces (e.g., counter tops,
tables, floors), see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/sterile.html>.
