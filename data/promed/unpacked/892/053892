Cat deaths might be signs of disease
--------------------------------------
A dead cat in Sioux Falls has tested positive for
a bacteria that could infect humans. The cat,
sent to the state lab in Pierre, was found to
have tularemia, also known as "rabbit fever," a
tick- borne disease that can infect humans, said
Sioux Falls Police Lt. Tom Olson.
It was 1 of 5 cats found dead in the area of
Cactus Hills mobile home park in north Sioux
Falls during the past 6 weeks. The department's
animal control division received the results
Tuesday, Olson said. There could be more
unreported cases of the disease, he said.
"Our concern is with the number of incidents
we've had with dead cats that potentially some of
the residents up in that area may have contact
with the cats," Olson said. "And this disease can
be spread through the contact with the dead
animal."
Judy Buseman, city public health director, said
the disease is not a major threat to public
health. "This is a naturally occurring disease in
North America. It shows up in all the states,"
she said. "This is not a public health emergency."
South Dakota last year [2006] had 6 cases of the
disease in humans, with an average of 200 cases a
year nationwide, Buseman said.
People should wear rubber gloves when handling a
dead animal, double bag the animal for disposal
and wear tick repellent, Olson said. The disease
is treatable but could be fatal in humans, he
said. Officers informed residents in the Cactus
Hills neighborhood Tuesday of the disease.
People can become infected through tick bites, by
handling infected, sick or dead animals, by
drinking contaminated water, or by inhaling
airborne bacteria, according to animal control
officials.
Tularemia in humans is treatable with antibiotics, Buseman said.
The Cactus Hills neighborhood has had a
long-standing problem with stray cats, said Bob
Rabine, who lives in the neighborhood. He has
used city traps to catch the stray cats in his
yard, he said. "We've caught as many as 3 or 4 of
them," Rabine said. "They were a nuisance and our
dog hated them."
The owners of the mobile home park are supposed
to require pet owners to register their pets, the
Ewoldts said. "The people that own the trailer
park have no clue that people have these
animals," Barb said.
Cactus Hills owner Joe Hayes said he follows the
city guidelines and does his best to keep track
of who has pets. He limits residents to 2 pets
per mobile home. Hayes said Tuesday evening [12
Jun 2007] that he had heard about the issue from
news reports but had not been contacted by the
city. "The city hasn't notified me, no tenant has
called me to say that there is an issue," he said.
Tularemia will present with many flu-like
symptoms, said Dr. Aris Assimacopoulos, director
of infection control at Avera McKennan. Symptoms,
however, must be coupled with close contact with
an infected animal or a tick bite, and a specific
test should be done for the disease, he said.
Tularemia is not known to transmit from person to
person, Assimacopoulos said. "It's really that
close contact is what it's going to take," he
said.
There are at least 2 antibiotics used to treat
the human cases of the disease, Assimacopoulos
said. "The treatment is actually fairly short,"
he said. "You're talking 1 to 3 weeks."
While tularemia is not commonly seen by
veterinarians and is not common in the pet
population, the disease is devastating for cats,
said Dr. Dawn Dale, with the Dale Animal Hospital
in Sioux Falls. Infected cats can develop sores
on the skin, fever, and signs of pneumonia, or
even look like rabies, she said. "By the time
your cat is sick with it, he's probably dying
from it," Dale said. She said the animals can
also be treated with antibiotics.
The disease typically is seen in wild rabbits and
cats, so pet bunnies are not at much of a risk,
she said. The best protection for pets is flea
and tick medications from a veterinarian, Dale
said.

[This article seems to place blame on a certain
area. Yet ticks are opportunist and simply want a
warm body for a blood meal. If there are this
many stray animals, then the emerging problem may
be rabies, which could be a public health
emergency.
_Francisella tularensis_, a gram-negative
pleomorphic bacterium, is the causative agent of
tularemia. This infectious disease was 1st
described in Japan in 1837. The name of the
disease is related to a 1911 description of a
plague-like illness in ground squirrels in Tulare
County, CA, and work done by Dr. Edward Francis.
Dr. Francis described his personal experience
with more than 800 cases in 1928. The causative
agent is found in more than 100 species of wild
animals, including birds and insects, worldwide.
The most virulent of the 4 known strains is found
in primarily in North America. The strains appear
to vary in both virulence and geographical range.
The route of transmission and factors relating to
the host and the organism influence the
presentation. The organism produces an acute
febrile illness in humans
Cats may display lethargy, and some relatively
non-specific respiratory difficulty. Cats may be
at increased risk because of their predatory
nature with rodents.
Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and
tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose
levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol
have been associated with relapses in people.
Early treatment should prevent death. Control is
difficult and is limited to reducing tick
infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.
Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many
organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine
previously available for people at high risk of
infection (such as laboratory personnel) is
currently under review. Recovery confers
long-lasting immunity.
