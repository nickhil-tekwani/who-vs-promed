Officials in Jonglei state have reported an outbreak of the deadly
Kala azar disease in the area. The disease which struck this week
[week of 2 Aug 2010] has already left 48 people dead and more than
130 people hospitalized, with the fear that the death toll could get higher.

Reaching many areas in rainy season in Jonglei state is difficult.
According to the minister for law enforcement in the state, Gabriel
Duop Lam, the victims were having difficulty accessing areas where
they could receive medical treatment.

Mr Duop who returned from Ayod town on Thursday [5 Aug 2010] added
that many patients are locked up in villages due to lack of transport
and heavy flooding in the area, thus making it difficult for them to
access health units.

In Ayod, 48 people died and 138 people are admitted, Duop said,
adding that it was not possible to evaluate fatalities in areas
inaccessible by road from Ayod County center.

Fangak and Pigi Counties have also reported kala azar cases according
to Radenta Ayen, Jonglei state minister of health, who described the
development in Ayod as "the worse."

Ayen said health facilities will be sent to the area immediately. She
swiftly called for international humanitarian organization for
assistance. Kala azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is
common in northern Counties of Jonglei state.
