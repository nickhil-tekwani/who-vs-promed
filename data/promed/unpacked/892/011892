Poliovirus Weekly Update as of 18 Sep 2018, World Health Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 18
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 2
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 43
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2017: 96

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 1 new case of wild poliovirus (WPV1).
- Democratic Republic of Congo - 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), from Kandahar province, Kandahar district, with onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2018]. This brings the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 to 14.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 4.
- No new positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Nigeria
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Nigeria in 2018 is 8.
- The most recent cases, from Miga Local Government Area (LGA), Jigawa state, and Baure LGA, Katsina state, had onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2018].
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
- 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week, both from Mongola province; 1 in Yamaluka district with onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2018] and 1 in Bumba district with onset of paralysis on [5 Aug 2018]. additionally, one cVDPV2 was also detected in a healthy community contact in Mongola province.
- DR Congo is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the 'Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication'. The high-level meeting was convened by HE the Minister of Health, as well as the WHO Director-General and the Regional Director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- No new cases were reported in the past week.
- Somalia has reported a total of 7 cases in 2018: 4 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3 and 1 cVDPV2&3. Circulating VDPV2 was also detected in 1 environmental sample collected on [2 Aug 2018] in Waberi district, Banadir region. Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in the country in 2018 remains 12 (4 from Eastern Highlands, 2 from Enga, 2 from Madang and 1 from National capital district and 3 from Morobe provinces).
- Papua New Guinea officially launched its outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang and Eastern Highlands provinces. Round 2 of the outbreak response commenced [20 Aug 2018] in Madang, Morobe, and Eastern Highlands provinces while vaccination activities in Chimbu, Enga, Hela, Jiwaka, Southern Highlands, and Western Highlands provinces began on [27 Aug 2018]. Nationwide campaigns are planned for October/November [2018].
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response is currently being reviewed and will be expanded as necessary.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented across the country, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

Middle East

[Reading the weekly updates from the GPEI/WHO tends to be disconcerting as I try to find "good news" items to counterbalance the "not so good news items". I guess a "good news" item is the absence of positive environmental samples in Pakistan.... but past experience shows being happy with one week of no positive samples is offset by positive samples being reported in the following week or 2.... And again, one can be pleased when there are no new WPV1 cases reported from Pakistan and Nigeria as well, but then one remembers the WPV1 cluster of cases reported in Nigeria in 2016, had a virus that was similar to one seen in Borno in 2011.... Hence, how long do we have to watch to be certain there isn't silent transmission ongoing in a conflict zone (Somalia, DR Congo, Northern Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan.... to name a few)?

This week's not so good news include a new WPV1 case reported in Afghanistan, bringing this year's total reported cases due to WPV1 infection to 18, compared with a same year-to-date total in 2017 of 10.... And 2 additional cases of cVDPV2 in the DR Congo, bringing this year's cumulative number of cases to 43, compared with 49 in 2017... but in 2017 there were outbreaks in a total of 2 countries (DR Congo and Syria), whereas in 2018, there are 4 countries with outbreaks (DR Congo, Somalia, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea) but 2 separate outbreaks in Nigeria and 3 separate outbreaks in the DR Congo.... All but Papua New Guinea involve countries and areas with civil unrest that has hampered both vaccination activities and acceptance as well as surveillance activities.
