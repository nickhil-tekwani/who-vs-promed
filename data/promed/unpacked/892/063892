There has been a confirmed outbreak of crayfish plague in the River Barrow.

The disease only affects the crayfish species but is 100 percent fatal if contracted by the fish.

An outbreak was confirmed in the River Suir at Clonmel earlier this year [2017], and was branded as "extremely concerning" for the future of the species in Ireland.

A public meeting has been organised in Graignamanagh [county Kilkenny] for this coming Wednesday evening 20 Sep 2017] to discuss the issue.

[Crayfish fungal plague, fatal to many crayfish species, has affected many European countries. It is caused by a fungus _Aphanomyces astaci_, which was brought into Europe by the introduction of _Procambarus clarkii_, a freshwater crayfish species of Louisiana, USA, which is naturally infected by this pathogen, although it does not develop clinical disease. - Mod.PMB
