Ingestion of hoary alyssum (_Berteroa incana_) should be
investigated in any outbreak of fever, limb edema [swelling and
laminitis [hoof inflammation in a group of horses. Intoxication can
occur on pasture or with plant contamination in hay.
Hoary alyssum is a member of the mustard family (Cruciferae).The
toxic principle is undetermied. This plant grows throughout the
North Central US, with field cases described from the Midwest to
the East coast.
Reference: Geor, RJ et al. 1992. Toxicosis in horses after
ingestion of hoary alyssum. JAVMA 201(1) p 63-67.
