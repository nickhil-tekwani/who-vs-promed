[The epidemiologic investigation is of the utmost importance in
regard to the establishment of the source of the infection. Animal
health authorities around the world, who may have become complacent
about H5N1 in commercial poultry or in any aspect of its epidemiology
should take note of this outbreak. Moreover, a careful economic
impact study is, one hopes, being considered. - Mod.PC]
