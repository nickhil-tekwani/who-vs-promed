Olga Plotnikova, the Deputy Chief of the Sanitary Department of the
Orenburg Regional Office of the Russian (Health) Protection Agency
(Rospotrebnadzor), announced that 5 fatal cases of hemorragic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS) had occurred in the Orenburg region during
the autumn of 2005. Since the beginning of September, 239 cases of
HFRS had been diagnosed in Orenburg region by 18 Nov 2005, whereas
only 17 cases were recorded during the same period of 2004. This year
on average 5 HFRS patients per day had been admitted to the City
Infectious Diseases Hospital.
On Mon 28 Nov 2005, a special commission was convened by the Mayor of
Orenburg. The Assistant to the Mayor, Lyudmila Marchenko, emphasized
the need for implementation of rodent control measures in farmyards
and their surroundings. However, not all farmstead owners were
prepared to pay the 167 rouble cost [USD 5.80] from their own
resources. The commission recommended implementation of an
educational campaign to alert the general population to the problem.
If rodents are not controlled in farmsteads and their surroundings,
the situation could become catastrophic.
During the last 9 years [ecologists and virologists] have been
studying rodent populations in the Orenburg region and established
that between 6 and 33 percent were carriers of the virus responsible
for HFRS. Outbreaks of disease were associated with the onset of
colder weather, when mice sought refuge in human habitations. Medical
practitioners consider that expenditure of 167 roubles is a small
price to pay for protection of families from the scourge of HFRS.

[The number of HFRS cases in the Orenburg region does not appear to
have increased dramatically since the previous report from the region
on 9 Nov 2005. The outbreak may now be under some kind of control,
although the population are reluctant to allocate their own funds for
this purpose. - Mod.CP]
