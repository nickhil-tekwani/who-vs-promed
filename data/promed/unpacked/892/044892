About 50 crows were found dead in a park in Tokyo on Friday afternoon [24 Mar 2017], police said Saturday.

According to police, a woman walking her dog in Johoku Chuo Park, which is located in both Nerima and Itabashi wards [Tokyo], went to the park administration office to report that she had seen a crow die after eating what looked like a piece of bread. Park officials subsequently found about 50 crows lying dead within 40 meters of each other in the park, Fuji TV reported.

No bread or any other food scraps were found near the crows' bodies. Police said health officials will examine the contents of the birds' stomachs to find out if they were poisoned.

[Weather may have been an issue as sudden storms are known to cause some birds to panic flying into wires, poles, houses, and other objects resulting in their death.

Other agents possibly associated with this event include a water soluble potassium (K+) channel blocker known as 4-aminopyridine, or just 4-AP, or as its trade name in some countries as Avatrol. Avatrol is an avicide. Avitrol repels birds by poisoning a few individual members of a flock of birds, causing them to become hyperactive and to issue distress calls which alarms as well as signals other birds to leave the area. Only a small number of birds need to be affected to alarm the entire flock. Generally, after one alarming incident and exposure, birds will usually not return to treated areas. Avitrol is available as grain baits or as a powder concentrate. If a bird should be greedy and eat a lot of the grain bait, this avicide will produce death in birds. In this case 50 deaths seems a little high, but there are precedents of this number of birds dying.

Another possibility would be an organophosphate or carbamate insecticide. Birds are more sensitive to the effects of these toxins. These toxins cause inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes, which are involved in transmitting normal nerve impulses throughout the nervous system. This can paralyze the nervous system, and it may lead to death, most frequently from respiratory paralysis.

Hopefully there will be an investigation and some lab work to confirm what killed the birds. - Mod.TG
