Reliable sources have reported that during the past 2 weeks, 3 people have died as a consequence of a suspected virulent, flu-like virus infection. Three others were similarly affected and survived after resuscitation in the Infectious Diseases Department of the El Wadi Hospital. Medical sources have confirmed this report and further stated that the deceased were admitted to hospital in serious condition, with a dry cough, high fever, and difficulty in breathing, adding that the exact cause of death remains unknown.

The dead patients included one woman and were 49, 47 and 28 years of age living in Hassani Abdelkarim, El Oued, and Bayadha. Our source stated further that blood samples from the victims of "this strange virus" have been sent to the Pasteur Institute for further analysis.

The 3 surviving patients were between 40-58 years of age and originated from El Oued province.

[The information provided is not sufficient to identify the virus involved, if indeed these cases of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are caused by virus infection. The outcome of the diagnostic tests at the Algerian Pasteur Institute is awaited. The affected victims and patients appear to be unrelated and to originate from different communities, which suggests that they may be particularly vulnerable individuals affected by a relatively common respiratory virus.

According to the current WHO Global Influenza update: "Algeria, Israel, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Pakistan have noted increases in influenza activity. In the Northern Africa region, Tunisia also reported transmission increases. Algeria, The Islamic Republic of Iran, and Iraq reported mostly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09."

El Oued is located 400 miles southeast of Algiers (the capital city of Algeria), near the Tunisian border. The population of El Oued was 139 362 as of the 1998 census.
