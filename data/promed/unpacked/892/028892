The sale of contaminated cheese, mainly in the Hidalgo Market has
already generated 47 cases of brucellosis, also called "Malta fever"
in the state capital [Guanajuato], according to the head of the
Sanitary Jurisdiction No. 1, Rafael Sanchez Leyva.

This led to the seizure of approximately 800 kilograms [approx. 1765
lb] of cheese contaminated with the bacterium causing brucellosis and
a fine of over [MXN] 500 000 [approx. USD 34 000] to the producer
from a facility in Silao.

The seizure took place 2 weeks ago at the Hidalgo Market and the head
of the Sanitary Jurisdiction No. 1 assured that there were
approximately 800 kilograms of cheese, which have been confirmed as
contaminated [with _Brucella_].

Without specifying the name of the factory or its owner, the official
said that all merchandise was picked up and destroyed, and it was
fined [MXN] 590 000 [approx. USD 40 000]. [He added,] "the man from
the cheese factory deceived us, by pasteurizing 1000 liters of milk
and mixing it with 9000 liters of non-pasteurized milk. However the
law does not allow me to [reveal his], but the factory is now closed."

Apparently, the products were distributed in the municipalities of
Silao, Leon, Romita and capital, however, it is not known whether
there were [affected individuals] from consumption of contaminated
cheese in these towns.

Given this situation, Sanchez Leyva warned people not to consume milk
products of dubious source, because [the products] may not be
pasteurized and thus [they are at risk of] getting a disease, "do not
eat cheese that is not pasteurized and use well boiled milk."

[Brucellosis is just one of many infectious diseases that can be
spread through unpasteurized milk or dairy products. Others include
salmonellosis, listeriosis, campylobacteriosis, bovine tuberculosis,
and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_.
