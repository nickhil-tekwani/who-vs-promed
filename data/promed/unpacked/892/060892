Disparagement law in Idaho

Our state was one of those listed as having a disparagement law. I looked it
up. The law refers to perishable agricultural food products only and the
definition of disparagement is limited to "the publication to a third party
of a false factual statement and ... the defendant made the statement with
actual malice, that is, he knew that the statement was false or acted in
reckless disregard of its truth or falsity".
I don't think this law will interfere with our ability to give public health
warnings, but it was interesting to become aware of its existence.
