Health officials discover 2 new malaria cases in Palm Beach County
----------------------------
As health officials discovered 2 more cases of malaria in Palm Beach County
on Tuesday, flu-like symptoms were enough to prompt hospitals to
automatically test patients for the parasite that causes the disease.
Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the Palm Beach County Health Department, said
the 2 latest cases, a 17-year-old boy and a 48-year-old man, are unrelated
and not geographically close together, although they fall within a 3-mile
zone -- the distance mosquitoes can fly -- of the first 2 confirmed cases
in the Lake Worth area.
The onset of symptoms was 17 Aug 2003 for one and 19 Aug for the other,
O'Connor said. "We're still doing case histories and epidemiology studies
on all of the cases, and mapping them," O'Connor said. That many locally
acquired cases of a disease that is not normally present in the United
States is "highly unusual," said Dr. Carina Blackmore, an expert in
mosquito-borne diseases at the state Health Department. Blackmore said
there usually are a few cases each year in which people are infected with
malaria by mosquitoes that bite someone who brought it in from outside the
country. "But usually it's only one or two cases," she said. "I don't
remember hearing about 7."
Blood specimens from the malaria-infected people are being analyzed by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see how closely they
match each other, and to determine other characteristics of the disease,
she said.
The rising number of cases increases the possibility of a 2nd and 3rd wave
of malaria, said Dr. Don Krogstad, chairman of tropical medicine at Tulane
University's School of Public Health in New Orleans. That possibility has
some Palm Beach County residents trying to avoid mosquitoes. At John Prince
Park in Lake Worth, people were out early in the afternoon but said they
would be leaving before dark.
"It's a major concern," said Dana Scherer of Lake Worth, with her son,
Nick. "I have one special boy that I want to keep. He has asthma and can't
wear bug repellent. I even pick him up early from after-school care now
because of the malaria problem."
Area hospitals have been on alert for more cases, especially since Dr. Jean
Malecki, director of the Palm Beach County Health Department, issued a
public-health directive on Monday for them to be vigilant in testing for
malaria. Malecki disclosed the latest cases during a County Commission
meeting. She was at the meeting to testify about the benefits of adding
fluoride to drinking water but was asked about the malaria outbreak. The
entire county has been under a mosquito alert since 18 Aug 2003.
Malaria symptoms include fever that comes and goes, headache, bone pain and
chills, said Dr. Caswell J. Rumball, medical director of the emergency
department at JFK Medical Center, where 5 of the cases were diagnosed.
After consulting a few days ago with Dr. Larry Bush, JFK's infectious
disease specialist, Rumball said emergency department personnel are
screening all patients who come to the emergency department with flu-like
symptoms for malaria.
"We do [blood smears to check for malaria] on 100 percent of patients who
present with fever or history of fever, headache or history of exposure --
someone who comes in and says, 'I got bitten by a bunch of mosquitoes and
I'm worried.' We do it with anything even remotely suggestive [of malaria
symptoms,]" Rumball said. Farther north and west, Wellington Regional
Medical Center has held a series of training sessions on mosquito-borne
diseases for staff in the emergency department, and provides the same
information for staff throughout the hospital, said Cheryl Anders, hospital
spokeswoman.
At Palms West Hospital in western Palm Beach County, hospital personnel
have been on alert for mosquito-borne diseases, said Kim Overman, hospital
spokeswoman. "We have not had a case here yet, but we were the first
hospital last year to have a patient with West Nile virus, so we take it
very seriously," she said. "There's a lot of farmland out here. It's an
equestrian area, and a mosquito-prone area, so we're being very vigilant."
While hospitals are on alert, the 15 employees of the county's mosquito
control office have been working overtime to hunt, kill and collect the
insects across the county. "We've been spraying as much as we possibly
can," director Ed Bradford said. "Every single area where a malaria case
has turned up has been sprayed multiple times."
Since the case numbers began to rise, the Health Department has expanded
its automatic-call system -- which educates residents on mosquito risks and
bite prevention -- to include the whole county. It likely will take until
Monday to reach all 500 000 residential phone lines. The countywide
mosquito alert also applies to West Nile virus, which has been found in
birds throughout the county. There have been no known human cases of West
Nile in Palm Beach County so far in 2003, but both Broward and Miami-Dade
counties have reported the illness in humans.
Along with the county, the Health Department continues to distribute insect
repellent, particularly to homeless people camping in wooded areas, and
post mosquito alert signs at parks and recreation areas. Palm Beach County
schools are sending out letters informing parents about how to protect
their children from mosquito bites but are not cancelling any
school-related events that take place at sundown unless directed otherwise
by the Health Department, said school spokesman Nat Harrington.
Staff writers Scott Travis, Jordan Rodack and Anthony Man contributed to
this report.

[A total of 7 cases have now been diagnosed in the area. It looks like
there is a limited and local transmission going on. It is comforting that
the 2 new cases are close to Lake Worth. A survey on semi-immune immigrants
from _P. vivax_-endemic countries who may be asymptomatic carriers and thus
act as a reservoir is probably the best approach to identify the source.
Non-immunes will develop symptoms quickly and be treated before they can
contribute to transmission. - Mod.EP]
