The Hawai'i Department of Health (DOH) is investigating a handful of hepatitis A cases on O'ahu and Maui. Four of the cases are on O'ahu, and one is on Maui. DOH reports that the people were infected sometime between 28 Mar 2021 and 3 Jun 2021. Four people had to be hospitalized.

According to the state, all have a history of drug use, and 3 are homeless. In 2018, the state reported 4 hepatitis A cases. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice and diarrhea. The state reports the illness is usually mild but can lead to severe illness. It is usually spread through close personal contact or consuming contaminated food or water.

[Over the past few years (Hepatitis A - USA (02): CDC 20210611.8441221), a continued outbreak of hepatitis A has been occurring in many of the states of the USA. A total of 35 states (not including Hawai'i) have reported the outbreak, and it is still active in 26 states with a total of 39 529 cases, 24 062 (61%) requiring hospitalization and 374 deaths (case fatality rate 0.9%). Unlike hepatitis A cases in the developed world, which are generally associated with a contaminated food vehicle, cases related to poor living conditions, like these cases in Hawai'i, are linked to homelessness and substance abuse. Time will tell if additional cases occur in the USA's 50th state.

Hawai'i did have a large outbreak of foodborne hepatitis A in the summer of 2016. The outbreak, traced to frozen scallops imported from the Philippines and served raw at Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu and Kauai, sickened 284 adults. Onset dates of their illnesses range from 12 Jun 2016 through 16 Sep 2016. More than 70 of the victims had symptoms so severe that they required hospitalization. That scallops were implicated suggests that more than the adductor muscle was ingested (that is, the whole scallops, including the gastrointestinal tract) and that whatever was eaten was not cooked. If the whole scallop was not ingested, then contamination of the adductor muscle is likely to have occurred during processing from the other parts of the scallop or from a food handler or water source. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than that of oysters because they are active swimmers; scallops are in fact the only migratory bivalve. - Mod.LL
