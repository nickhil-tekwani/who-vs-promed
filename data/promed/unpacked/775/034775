Federal officials have opened an investigation into an outbreak of E. coli_ O157:H7 infections suspected to be linked to ground beef. Other than the fact there is an open investigation, no other published information is available from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The FSIS has not indicated what producers or what brands of ground beef might be involved. The agency also has not revealed how many people have been infected or what states are involved.

The FSIS outbreak investigation table has a column for "Outcomes & References", but the column for the new outbreak was blank as of 10 Dec 2021.

"During investigations, FSIS may respond by posting recalls of FSIS-regulated products linked to illness or by issuing public health alerts," according to the FSIS outbreak investigation website. "The Outcomes & References column includes links to recall notices, public health alerts, and after-action review reports, as well as CDC outbreak notices for selected multistate foodborne outbreaks, which provide additional information."

The CDC had not yet announced the outbreak. Consequently, the FSIS cannot yet post links to any CDC references regarding alerts.

[The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service has posted the investigation (https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/foodborne-illness-and-disease/outbreaks/outbreak-investigations-response), but no details are yet available regarding the product and its distribution and the number of cases.

Although this zoonotic _E. coli_ infection associated with the production of Shiga toxin can be acquired from ingestion of fresh produce contaminated with the organism, from exposure to recreational or municipal water and from direct or indirect exposure to petting zoos, the classical vehicle for transmission is from ground beef.

The original outbreak was reported in 1983; the report's citation and abstract follow:
Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al: Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983; 308(12): 681-5; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198303243081203

Abstract
--------
"We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P < 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of 3 sandwiches containing 3 ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat." - Mod.LL]
