COVID-19 (04) - Argentina: record increase in cases, low mortality rate

Explosion of infections: Argentina has the highest rate of new cases in the region, well above the rest of the countries
Argentina breaks records of daily infections with numbers that triple those of last year [2021] when it was believed to be going through the worst moment of the coronavirus pandemic. In Uruguay, the flood of tourists who landed in Punta del Este put the test centers in check and unleashed a wave of new cases that is growing exponentially. In Bolivia, the circulation of unvaccinated persons is restricted in an attempt to put cold cloths on the health crisis. And in Brazil, its main tourist city, Rio de Janeiro, saw infections increase by more than 6000% in the last 20 days.

Far from being benefited by the handicap of climate over the summer season, South America is going through the biggest contagion crisis since COVID-19 arrived in São Paulo, in February 2020, and spread throughout the region. And Argentina heads those records: It is the country with the most cases per million inhabitants (1311), well above the countries that follow.

In this way, considering the number of daily cases per one million people in Argentina, the infections registered every 24 hours almost double those of Uruguay, 2nd in the ranking, where that rate is 791.

Yesterday [7 Jan 2022], the government of Alberto Fernandez [Argentina] reported 109 608 infections in one day, thus reaching a cumulative total of 6 million infected in the country, from the measurements that began in March 2020, when patient zero was detected.

The day before, the National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology (Anmat) was forced to approve the sale in pharmacies of 4 self-test kits and the close contact tests were canceled due to the collapse of the test system, with very high percentages of positivity.

On the neighboring beaches of Punta del Este, the testing system was also saturated, given the number of tourists who requested swabs. Yesterday, Uruguay overcame the barrier of 5300 cases, a figure that is close to the 2nd maximum registered in a pandemic, in May 2020, when 5974 infections were reported, a month after the exceptional limit of 7289 infections was reached.

On 31 Dec 2021, the administration of Luis Lacalle Pou [Uruguay] reported 1725 daily cases, half of those currently recorded.

Despite the jump in the figures, the authorities ruled out new restrictions and indicated that they planned a "Very strong increase in cases, despite vaccination" given the expansion of the omicron variant.

"Actions are now focused on efforts to increase applications of 3rd doses, and vaccination in children, which begins in a week", they said to La Nación newspaper sources from the Uruguayan Ministry of Health.

Bolivia is the 3rd nation with the most infections per million inhabitants (604). But there the tests do not collapse. On the contrary, it is very expensive and difficult to access a PCR test (the only one with official validation), according to the newspaper El País days ago. President Luis Arce ordered that the inhabitants be required to be vaccinated or have a recent negative test if they want to carry out banking procedures, make purchases in supermarkets, or travel, and the measure catapulted the vaccination campaign, tripling the number of people who approach the vaccination centers on a daily basis, although the country remains far behind its South American peers when it comes to the immunity of its population.

With vaccination on the rise, Bolivia is still facing the peak of a new wave of cases with an epicenter in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the most populated city. The more than 10 000 infections reported yesterday [6 Jan 2022] are far from the peak reached in June of last year when the charts marked 7070 infections.

But, although the daily cases are more numerous than those registered in the previous waves, mortality has dropped. It went from a peak of 6% to 0.7%.

In Argentina, it is the same. The contagion threshold on Thursday [6 Jan 2022] was accompanied by 40 deaths: 1/10 of those that were reported on 30 Sep 2020, the day with the highest deaths from COVID-19 in the country.

Also in Brazil, despite the fact that vaccination is not particularly promoted by the government of Jair Bolsonaro, deaths are on the decline. Neither Wednesday nor Thursday [5,6 Jan 2022], in fact, fatalities were reported, even when contagions explode in Rio de Janeiro, one of the favorite beaches for travelers in the region.

The municipality of the beach town reported 18 infections on [12 Dec 2021]. On [1 Jan 2022], the number rose to 1238. In one week, from Christmas to New Year's [25 Dec 2021-1 Jan 2022], the increase in cases was 360%, and if considering the period of 20 days, the rise was 6778%, according to the calculation of O Globo.

The city had not had so many people infected with coronavirus on a daily basis since [30 Aug 2021], when the delta variant was still hitting. The progression of the disease is reflected in the test positivity rate, which went from 13% to 41% in the 1st days of the year.

The uncertainty is total regarding how the virus will continue to develop in each country, but South America does stand on no less certainty: it is, today, the region that leads the global vaccination campaign.

According to statistics from Our World in Data updated as of [5 Jan 2022], South America has a 76% of its population vaccinated with at least one dose and 64% with the complete scheme, above Europe --66% and 62% -- and the United States -- 74% and 62% --, a region and a country with greater advantages for the access and availability of vaccines.

[2] China: community spread

China saw its 1st omicron cases in the community, igniting a mass testing blitz in the northern city of Tianjin as the country strives to maintain its zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 in the face of more transmissible variants.

The 2 cases in the port city were confirmed as being omicron by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, after its local branch completed the genome sequencing, CCTV reported. The infections were from the same transmission chain but officials have yet to establish if the strain is the same as imported omicron cases reported earlier in Tianjin, according to the report.

China's commitment to its "COVID zero" policy has seen it restrict movements and implement mass testing and other measures in cities spread across the country. Further outbreaks raise the risk of new lockdown measures that could disrupt production and shipping in an economy already battling weak consumption and a property market slump.

Tianjin first reported the 2 cases late Saturday [8 Jan 2022] and neither of the people, one of whom is a child, have traveled outside of the city in the past 14 days. The government announced that it will start mass testing from 7 a.m. Sun [9 Jan 2022], in order to "effectively prevent the further spread of the omicron variant," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

China, which is set to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing next month [4-20 Feb 2022], has been determined to maintain COVID Zero even as cases spread and other countries adopt policies of living with the virus. The recent flareups, while small compared to international cases, are fueling the most protracted stretch of infections in China since the virus first emerged in Wuhan 2 years ago.

The southern technology hub of Shenzhen is discouraging people from leaving after reporting 2 infections, the eastern metropolis of Zhengzhou required all residents to be tested and Xi'an in the northwest has confined most of its population of 13 million to their homes since before Christmas. Tianjin Municipal Transportation Commission issued a ban on inter-provincial bus services from Sunday [9 Jan 2022], according to local media reports.

China reported 92 new local cases on Saturday [8 Jan 2022], which compares to 90 000 in New York state.

While cases have continued to crop up, until the weekend China hadn't seen local transmission of the omicron variant.

[3] Children
[A] Hospitalizations
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022 2:33 PM PT
Source: LA Times, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-01-07/hospitalizations-skyrocket-in-kids-too-young-for-COVID-shots


Hospitalizations for COVID-19 among US children under 5 soared in recent weeks to their highest level since the pandemic began, according to government data released Friday [7 Jan 2022] on the only age group not yet eligible for vaccination.

The worrisome trend underscores the need for older kids and adults to get their COVID-19 shots to help protect those around them, said Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With the highly contagious omicron variant spreading around the country, the hospitalization rate in these youngest kids has surged to more than 4 in 100 000 children, up from 2.5 per 100 000 in mid-December [2021].

The rate among children ages 5-17 is about 1 per 100 000, according to the CDC data, which are drawn from more than 250 hospitals in 14 states.

Overall, "pediatric hospitalizations are at their highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic," Walensky said.

She noted that just over 50% of children ages 12-18, and only 16% of those 5-11, are fully vaccinated.

The overall hospitalization rate among children and teens is still lower than that of any other age group. And they account for less than 5% of average new daily hospital admissions, according to the CDC.

Still, as of Tuesday [4 Jan 2022], the average number of under-18 patients admitted to the hospital per day with COVID-19 was 766 -- double the figure reported just 2 weeks ago.

The trend among the very young kids is being driven by high hospitalization rates in 5 states: Georgia, Connecticut, Tennessee, California, and Oregon, with the steepest increases in Georgia, the CDC said.

At a briefing, Walensky said the numbers include children hospitalized because of COVID-19 and those admitted for other reasons but found to have coronavirus infections.

The CDC also said the surge could be partially attributable to how COVID-19 hospitalizations in this age group are defined: a positive virus test within 14 days of hospitalization for any reason.

The severity of illness among children during the omicron wave seems lower than it was with the delta variant, said Seattle Children's Hospital critical care chief Dr John McGuire.

"Most of the COVID+ kids in the hospital are actually not here for COVID-19 disease," McGuire said in an email. "They are here for other issues but happen to have tested positive."

Many had hoped the new year might bring a vaccine for young children, but Pfizer announced last month that two doses didn't offer as much protection as hoped for in youngsters 2-4.

Pfizer's study has been updated to give everyone under 5 a 3rd dose, and results are expected in early spring [2022].

Also on Friday [7 Jan 2022], the CDC issued a report showing the Pfizer-BioNTech shots seem to protect older children who develop a serious but rare COVID-19-linked condition that involves inflammation of multiple organs.

Among 102 kids ages 12-18 who were hospitalized with the condition, none who had received 2 Pfizer shots at least 28 days earlier needed ventilators or other advanced life support. By contrast, 40% of unvaccinated children required such treatment.

The condition, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, causes symptoms that may include persistent fever, abdominal pain, and rashes. Most children recover, but 55 deaths have been reported.

A separate CDC report found that children who had COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as youngsters who had not had the virus. Scientists are investigating why but say the virus seems to attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

[B] COVID-19 and diabetes in children
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/health/kids-covid-diabetes-cdc.html


Children who have recovered from COVID-19 appear to be at significantly increased risk of developing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday [7 Jan 2022].

A heightened risk of diabetes has already been seen among adults who recovered from COVID, according to some studies. Researchers in Europe have reported an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes since the pandemic started.

But the CDC study is among the 1st to examine large insurance claim databases in the United States to estimate the prevalence of new diabetes diagnoses in children under age 18 who had COVID or were known to be infected with the coronavirus.

The study used 2 claim databases from US health plans to look at diabetes diagnoses made in youngsters under 18 over the course of a year or more, starting on 1 Mar 2020, comparing those who had COVID with those who did not.

The researchers found increases in diabetes in both data sets, though the relative rates were quite different: they found a 2.6-fold increase in new diabetes cases among children in one, and a smaller 30 percent increase in another.

"Even a 30 percent increase is a big increase in risk," said Sharon Saydah, a researcher at the CDC and lead author of the study. The differences likely result from different ways of classifying children as having COVID, she added.

Dr Saydah said it was not yet clear whether post-COVID type 2 diabetes would be a chronic condition in these children or a transient condition that resolves. (Type 1 diabetes is not reversible.) Most of the children were only followed for about 4.5 months.

The finding underscores the importance of vaccinating all eligible children against COVID, she added and using measures like masking and distancing, especially to protect the youngest, who cannot yet be vaccinated.

"It's really important for clinicians, pediatricians, and parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, so they can get their kids diagnosed," Dr Saydah said. Increased thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue are among the telltale symptoms.

She noted that weight gain and sedentary behavior, which have increased during the pandemic, are also risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

Many of the children in the study were only diagnosed after having an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication that occurs when the body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood sugar into cells to use for energy.

Dr Saydah and her colleagues did not distinguish between types of diabetes, including both type 1 and type 2 in their analysis. The increases were seen both among those who had been ill with COVID, and those who were asymptomatic but tested positive.

Another study, also released on Fri [7 Jan 2022] by the CDC, found that 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protected hospitalized youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18 against severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, which can develop 2-6 weeks after infection with the virus.

The study looked at 24 hospitals in 20 states between July and 9 Dec 2021, during the period when the delta variant was dominant. It concluded that vaccination had an efficacy rate of 91 percent against MIS-C, and noted that among 38 hospitalized patients aged 12-18 who required life support, all were unvaccinated.

In the past 24 hours, 26 countries including the USA (309 002), France (296 097), India (180 438), Italy (155 642), the UK (141 398), Australia (80 853), Argentina (73 319), Turkey (61 727), the Netherlands (32 484), Germany (30 812), Colombia (30 630), Philippines (28 572), Portugal (26 419), Canada (25 466), Brazil (24 382), Viet Nam (23 181), Ireland (21 384), Greece (18 592), Denmark (17 921), Israel (17 491), Russia (16 246), Peru (16 135), Mexico (11 599), Poland (11 107), and Austria (10 291), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3188 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 7 Jan 2022 to late 8 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 76 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 43 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 67.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 75.3% increase in daily reported cases and a 25.0% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1 845 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 307.88 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.50 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
