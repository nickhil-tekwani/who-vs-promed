Venezuela: Yellow Fever Alert in Mucujepe (Merida)
------------------------------------------------
Corposalud (the National Health Corporation) intensified yellow fever
immunization in the rural areas of Sucre and Alberto Adriani communities,
after the presence of the disease was confirmed in the
above-mentioned areas. The Epidemiology Service confirmed that a fatal
case was reported on 14 Aug 2004. 74 percent of the population has been
immunized.
Yesterday the district epidemiology officer of El Vigia, Dr. Isaac Funes,
confirmed that the 21-year-old patient, who died on 14 Aug 2004, is the 1st
suspected case of yellow fever in 2004.
"The patient lived at La Vega del Carano, an area belonging to Sucre
community. The patient was initially seen at Mucujepe outpatient clinic,
then he was referred to the El Vigia Hospital, and he finally was referred
to the Merida University Hospital", stated Dr. Funes.
The Epidemiology officer said that in response to this outbreak, intensive
immunization is being performed in the rural communities. He assured that
75 percent of the population has already been immunized, and only people in
urban areas need to be immunized in order to reach 100 percent coverage. It
is estimated that the population to be immunized is around 9000
individuals. "50 percent of people who come seeking medical care may be
symptomatic; this is the reason for the need to administer the vaccine.
Mobile units have been implemented in order to have full immunization
coverage".
Saida Colmenares de Arias, Regional Epidemiology Coordinator, stated that a
surveillance system had been initiated 15 days ago in the aforementioned
communities. All patients presenting with febrile illness and with febrile
and hemorrhagic illness are being followed up in order to establish
differential diagnoses for yellow fever, and leptospirosis, dengue,
hepatitis, and other conditions. Blood samples are also being taken,
suspected cases are being isolated, and epidemiological surveillance is
under way.
