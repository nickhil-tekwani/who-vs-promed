USDA Issues Another Recall in Connection with Listeria Outbreak
------------------------
A NJ company is recalling 200 000 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken and turkey
sold nationwide and possibly linked to a listeria outbreak that sickened 50
people and killed 7.
Jack Lambersky Poultry Company Inc., of Camden, NJ, is pulling precooked
turkey and chicken products made between 27 Jun 2002 and 3 Jul 2002. It
also has halted operations. Tests showed some of the meat contained a
listeria strain matching the one that infected people in 8 northeastern
states, according to the Agriculture Department. The meat was distributed
to retail stores and other institutions across the country. The company
does business as J.L. Foods Company Inc.
"Consumers should check their refrigerators and freezers for products
involved in this recall and return them to the point of purchase," Dr.
Garry L. McKee, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service,
said in a statement.
Officials at Jack Lambersky Poultry Company are continuing to compile
information about the recalled meat, said Kenneth Martin, the general
manager for the family-owned company.
USDA inspectors have been working with the CDC to find the cause of the
listeria outbreak that began in mid-July 2002. The investigation prompted
another meat plant, Wampler Foods in Franconia, PA, to recall 27 million
pounds of ready-to-eat poultry meat on 12 Oct 2002 -- the largest recall.
Afterward, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman directed inspection officials
to strengthen the listeria testing program. Watchdog groups and members of
Congress have been urging her to toughen food safety rules in light of the
large recall.

[At this point, with the finding of another potential source of the recent
listeriosis outbreak in the northeast USA, it has yet to be understood what
relationship there is between the 2 sources. Which came first, the turkey
or the Listeria? - Mod.LL]
