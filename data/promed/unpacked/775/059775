[1] Characterization of the blood disease bacterium of banana

The blood disease bacterium (BDB) affects banana and plantain in Indonesia,
and causes major decline of production in many places throughout the
country. A reddish brown discoloration of vascular tissues and fruits are
typical symptoms of the disease. The causal agent of blood disease was
originally named _Pseudomonas celebensis_, but the description is
inadequate by modern standards. The bacteria are believed to be closely
related to _Ralstonia solanacearum_, the causal agent of wilt disease on
various plants, including banana.
Dr Baharuddin and Tutik Kuswinanti, from the Agriculture Biotechnology
Laboratory of Research Center of Hasanudin University in Indonesia,
investigated characteristics of the BDB and also the relationship between
BDB and _R. solanacearum_. They have found that despite many similarities
between the 2 pathogens, these can be clearly distinguished by their host
range, nutritional characters, metabolic capability (Biolog system), fatty
acid profiles and serological properties.

-------------------------
The bacterial wilts of banana known as Moko disease, Bugtok disease and
blood disease are caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_ species
complex. _R. solanacearum_ is a heterogeneous species which has been
divided into 4 genetic groups known as phylotypes. Within the _R.
solanacearum_ species complex, strains that cause Moko and Bugtok diseases
belong to phylotype II. The blood disease bacterium, the cause of blood
disease, belongs to phylotype IV.
This study employs phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene
sequences to further assess the evolutionary relationships between strains
of _R. solanacearum_ causing Moko disease and Bugtok disease and the
relationship of the blood disease bacterium to other _R. solanacearum_
strains within phylotype IV of the _R. solanacearum_ species complex. These
analyses showed that _R. solanacearum_ Moko disease-causing strains are
polyphyletic, forming 4 related, but distinct, clusters of strains.
One of these clusters is a previously unrecognised group of _R.
solanacearum_ Moko disease-causing strains. It was also found that _R.
solanacearum_ strains that cause Bugtok disease are indistinguishable from
strains causing Moko disease in the Philippines. Phylogenetic analysis of
partial endoglucanase gene sequences of the strains of the blood disease
confirms a close relationship of these strains to _R. solanacearum_ strains
within phylotype IV of the _R. solanacearum_ species complex.

[_R. solanacearum_ is a Gram negative bacterium that invades the roots of
diverse plant hosts from the soil and aggressively colonises the xylem
vessels causing a lethal wilting disease. It was first reported as the
cause of wilt diseases at the end of the 19th century and is widely
distributed and an economically important plant pathogen. It affects more
than 200 plant species causing diseases such as brown rot of potato as well
as bacterial wilt of peanut, tomato, and aubergine. Races 1 and 2 occur
worldwide in tropical climates with race 2 attacking banana and plantain.
In Europe, race 3 is present and spreading. There are a number of further
races of lower economical significance. The bacteria are spread by
mechanical means, infected plant material and most probably insects.
A different type of banana bacterial wilt is caused by _Xanthomonas
campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ and has recently been reported to cause
problems in East Africa (see posts 20070507.1474 and 20070418.1277).
