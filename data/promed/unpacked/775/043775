The medical director of the Unzue Hospital, Fabian Galeano, confirmed yesterday [20 Dec 2014] that the death of a woman on Wed 10 Dec [2014] was due to [a] hantavirus [infection].

Given this situation, Galeano justified the announcement and said that he did so as the physician who attended the patient and as the person responsible for the health center [or the partido or department] 25 de Mayo, the place where she died [25 de Mayo is a county-level political unit in Buenos Aires province named in recognition of an historical event. - Mod.TY].

He reiterated that "the death of a 33 year old woman shook everyone with a rapidly progressive and complex clinical picture that occurred 9 days ago. But just yesterday [20 Dec 2014], we had confirmation of what led to her death as a case of [a] hantavirus [infection], a disease transmitted by mice."

Although the doctor said that "we have to be respectful of family members", revealing the diagnosis "serves to demystify some things that are circulating in the population; we are required to do something, since here they spoke [of things] from Ebola to having had the same disease as the daughter of P, things that make no sense," he stated. [The daughter of P was the 6 year old daughter of CPA and BV. She died after a 9 day illness of suspected legionnaires' disease. - Mod.TY]

"Moreover, we communicated in order to have the correct reading of the situation, because with what has happened, we have demonstrated that there is circulation of [a] hantavirus in the rodent population in 25 de Mayo.

"This is a disease that has no end in coming around... Precautionary measures must never be relaxed or pushed aside, because this is a disease [virus] that is transmitted exclusively by mice and does not have anything to do with rats or lauchas [small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_] that can be found in houses." Also, it is stated that "the mouse is infected with the virus but does not become ill, and [the virus] is eliminated in urine or fecal material. The point of this eliminated [material] is that, with the passage of time, the virus in the urine and fecal material dries, and the virus remains suspended in the environment."

What are the precautions? If we wish to clean a house, room or shed where we see that rodents are present and which has been closed up, take care to ventilate it, because the particles are in the air, favoring aerosolization of the virus-containing particles which can be inhaled via the respiratory system. This is the only way for hantavirus transmission to occur; there is no human to human transmission," he stated. [Andes hantavirus can be transmitted between individuals in very close contact. Hantaviruses can be transmitted to humans by bites of infected rodents that have virus in saliva. - Mod.TY]

He asked people to be careful when cutting forage, "especially on those days of high winds if cutting is down-wind, because this is another mechanism for aerosolization. Be careful when gathering fire wood; if so doing, keep it at a certain distance above the floor to avoid creating rodent nesting areas," the doctor said.

Also, he stated that, "today, the hantavirus[es] no longer [cause] rural disease; they have become urban and suburban, and I state this because I have attended hantavirus cases in La Plata of people who lived 40 blocks from downtown and had not had any extra-urban activity."

Galeano was clear in indicating that "there is circulation of [a] hantavirus in 25 de Mayo, and we must take precautions." Concerning symptoms, "they begin with signs of a virus [infection] such as malaise [and] headache. It is not easy to detect [the cause], but the best evidence one has includes epidemiological factors, attempting to collect data that permits us to know [whether the patient] had any risk factors in order to consider a hantavitus [infection]. Equally important, it is always good to consult with a physician early on." [It is curious that no mention is made of pulmonary symptoms that might lead health care providers to consider hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are essential to confirm that diagnosis. - Mod.TY]

[There have been several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province this year (2014), 2 of which have been fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The hantaviruses involved in the above and the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus is laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infection were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.

The Texas Department of State Health Services is reminding people to protect themselves from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but sometimes fatal illness, after a resident of the Golden Crescent region along the central Texas coast was diagnosed with HPS.

There have been 5 HPS cases reported in Texas in 2014. A total of 43 HPS cases have been confirmed in Texas since 1993, the 1st year the disease was detected. Of those, 14 were fatal.

Hantavirus[es] are carried by certain species of rats and mice that shed the virus in their urine, droppings and saliva. The virus can be transmitted to people by stirring up nesting materials or contaminated dust, allowing the virus to be breathed in by humans. Cases have been linked to cleaning out buildings where rodents live and working in dusty environments like ranches and oilfields.

DSHS recommends the following precautions:
- seal openings that may allow rats and mice to enter homes and workplaces.
- remove brush, woodpiles, trash and other items that may attract rats and mice;
- tightly close garbage cans, pet food containers and other food sources;
- wear protective gloves when handling dead mice and rats or cleaning up nesting areas, urine or droppings. Before cleaning up nests or droppings indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the area for at least 30 minutes;
- do not stir up nests by sweeping or vacuuming;
- dampen areas with dead rodents, nests, urine and droppings before cleanup with a 1:10 bleach solution or other disinfectant;
- if dust will be stirred up, DSHS recommends using goggles and a HEPA or N-95 mask.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fatigue, fever and muscle aches that may be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. If hantavirus is suspected, people should contact their health care provider immediately and mention any potential exposure to rodents, their nests or their waste.

[Cases of hantavirus infection occur sporadically in Texas, as indicated in the above report. Apparently, the above case of HPS is not fatal. With the beginning of winter, deer mice are likely to move into houses and outbuildings with the onset of cold weather. The precautions noted above are good ones to reduce the risk of exposure to Sin Nombre virus. Although infections are rare, including in Texas, HPS is a very serious disease, and the case fatality rate is relatively high, especially if medical attention is sought late in the course of the infection.

As noted in the report above, the rodent host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_; an image can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
