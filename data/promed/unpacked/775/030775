Anthrax on Turner ranch prompts road closure
--------------------------------------------
A 9-mile stretch of Spanish Creek Road has been closed at the request
of the Montana Department of Livestock (DOL) after an outbreak of
naturally-occurring anthrax that has killed approximately 80 domestic
bison on Ted Turner's Flying D Ranch.

Now, with the sick bison quarantined, there is minimal risk to
animals or people outside the closed-off area, DOL's Steve Merritt
said Monday [4 Aug 2008]. "We feel that it's really well confined,"
Merritt said, and the soil on Turner's ranch is being disinfected to
kill the bacteria. However, he predicted that more of Turner's bison
will likely fall ill. "I'm sure that there will be more animals that
succumb to the disease," Merritt said.

In conjunction with the road closure, the Spanish Creek Trail will
remain off limits, Marna Daley, Gallatin National Forest spokeswoman,
said Monday [4 Aug 2008]. "It looks like it will be a minimum of one
week, but maybe more," she said.

Anthrax may be spread from animals to humans, but a person must come
in close contact with an infected carcass to get sick, Merritt said.
"The easiest way to get infected," he said, "is through a cut in the skin."

Anthrax bacteria grows in soil and grass after periods of wet and
cool weather, according to the DOL. Signs of anthrax usually appear 3
to 7 days after spores are inhaled or swallowed and include labored
breathing, trembling and staggering. Once symptoms begin, animals
usually die within 2 days.

Antibiotics, such as penicillin, are effective to combat anthrax if
administered early enough. And a vaccination is available to prevent
future livestock deaths.

While this is the 1st reported anthrax outbreak in Gallatin County,
it's important that people remember anthrax is a naturally occurring
organism, he said. "Every once in awhile it pops up," Merritt said.
Montana has seen 2 other anthrax outbreaks since 2005, one in
Roosevelt County one another in Sheridan County, he said. They were
contained and did minimal damage.

[There were similar comments about not being concerned when the 1st
25 dead bison were announced. There are now 80 dead. The ranch has
some 18 000 acres and 3000 head of bison. In my experience death
rates of 10 percent are not unexpected and at this animal density
(one bison per 6 acres) it could easily go much higher; in west Texas
in 2001 we had death rates of 80 percent and higher on a fair number
of game ranches. This ranch has no handling facilities so vaccination
would have to be done by darting, as would any treatment of
incubating infections with long acting antibiotics. The bison are in
their breeding season with the bulls stressed as they try to collect
up cows for breeding, keep other bulls away, display in their dust
wallows, and eat little. So there is a lot of bunching going on.

Vegetative cycles of the pathogen in soil are oft claimed but very,
very rarely demonstrated. If you add blood to contaminated soil it
will grow for a week or so. It just doesn't suddenly appear from
nowhere. Spores manage to survive in alkaline steppe soils and may be
brought to the surface by rain (they are hydrophilic) or by earth
moving activities, such as discing pastures, clearing ditches,
bulldozing scrub, or cutting trenches, all in relation to old anthrax
graves. In spite of claims to the contrary there have probably been
anthrax cases in the past in Gallatin County. The state and ranch
authorities need to make sure these carcasses are efficiently burnt.

As I stated before, the neighbouring ranches need to get their stock
