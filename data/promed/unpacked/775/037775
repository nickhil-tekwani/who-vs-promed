The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed a case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in a Saskatchewan horse, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 24 Jul 2018. The affected horse underwent testing to satisfy a pre-entry requirement for a particular premises. Initial reports indicate the horse has traveled extensively within Saskatchewan for training and competition.

"On 20 July 2018, a positive EIA result was confirmed by the CFIA's national reference laboratory for a horse on a premises in the rural municipality of Great Bend, Saskatchewan," the EDCC said. "The horse had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian to satisfy a pre-entry requirement for a particular premises. Initial reports indicate that this horse has traveled extensively within the province for both work and competition. No clinical signs of disease were noted at the time of sampling.

"A CFIA investigation is underway and as per program policy, a quarantine has been placed on the infected animal and its on-premises contact animals," the EDCC continued. "The quarantine will remain until all disease response activities have been completed, including follow-up testing and ordering the destruction of positive cases. Trace-out activities may require the CFIA to undertake actions at additional premises as outlined in the current program policy."

EIA is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies and, more rarely, with use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel. Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease.

Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition, along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia. There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed positive for EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards [183 meters] away from other unaffected equids) for the rest of its life.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the unapparent, chronically infected carrier. This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show, or event, or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and, to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

"No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 meters) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used."

This is a sad disease for any horse, especially as there is no vaccine, but it is also hard on the owner. Such a nasty virus.
