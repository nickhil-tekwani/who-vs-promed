Tick-borne encephalitis increasing in Sweden, 2011

Summary
-------
Until August 2011, 161 cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) were
recorded in Sweden for 2011, leading to an incidence of 1.7 per 100
000 population. 50-59 year-olds (24 percent) were most affected; 55
percent of the cases were males. An increase in TBE in Sweden has
occurred in the last decade and might be explained by enlarged tick
populations, more contact between TBE virus infected ticks and humans,
and also by growing awareness of the disease. Climatic conditions may
have contributed to the increase.

Up to 25 Sep 2011, 204 patients have been diagnosed as tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) cases, indicating that 2011 may be a record year
for the number of TBE cases in Sweden.

Background
----------
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) belongs to the family
_Flaviviridae_, which includes a number of other important human
pathogens such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and
dengue viruses. TBEV is transmitted to man by ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_
and _I. persulcatus_) and is found in 3 subtypes; the European, the
Siberian and the Far Eastern subtypes. The European subtype is present
in Sweden, and the 1st clinical TBE case was recorded in 1954, and the
virus was isolated in 1959 [1,2]. In Sweden, as well as in other
countries around the Baltic sea, TBE is endemic in the coastal
regions, but cases also occur around lakes in southern Sweden and on
the Swedish west coast. In Norway and Denmark, TBEV was 1st described
as late as in 2006 [3].

Human infection with TBEV may cause a potentially serious neurological
disease. The vast majority of those who are infected will have mild or
no symptoms, while in patients with more marked clinical illness, high
fever and encephalitis may occur [4]. About 46 per cent of diagnosed
patients suffer permanent neurological sequelae. The case fatality
rate in Europe is less than 2 per cent [5].

Reliable laboratory diagnostics have been available since the mid
1950s, and the disease has been notifiable by reporting to the Swedish
Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) since 1969. TBE is
reported on the basis of clinical neurological symptoms and compulsory
laboratory confirmation. The number of cases was quite stable during
the 1960s and 1970s, but has increased from the mid-1980s.

Vaccination
-----------
Vaccination was introduced in Sweden in 1988. Three doses are needed
for protection [6]. Vaccination is not subsidised and is only
recommended for people living or spending time in "high risk areas,"
(mainly the coastal areas of the counties of Uppsala and Sodermanland,
the Stockholm archipelago, around the Malaren lake, and some local
foci around the Vanern and Vattern lakes). TBE vaccination is not
registered in Sweden, but the yearly number of sold doses
(approximately 500 000) indicates that the vaccine coverage is still
low. Only a few investigations on vaccine coverage have been
performed, suggesting a maximum of 30 percent vaccinees in Stockholm
county.

Increase in Swedish tick-borne encephalitis cases
--------------------------------
Between 1956 and 1984, the yearly number of TBE cases in Sweden ranged
from less than 10 to a maximum of 50. During the period from 1985 to
1999, the average number of yearly cases was 63. The number of
individuals infected by TBEV has increased during the last 11 years.
Until August 2011, 161 cases of TBE have been recorded in Sweden for
2011, leading to an incidence of 1.7 per 100 000 population for the
whole country. Since TBE is restricted to some parts of the country,
the incidences for the Sodermanland, Uppsala and Stockholm counties
are much higher, 9.29, 6.55 and 3.71, respectively. In August 2011,
only 83 cases were reported, which is more than during any other month
during the past 4 years. Up to 25 Sep 2011, a total of 204 cases of
TBE has already been reported for 2011, compared to a total of 174 for
the whole of 2010 (2009:210, 2008: 224). The age group comprising
50-59 year-olds was the most affected (24 percent), and 55 percent of
the cases were males. The age and sex-ratios were similar to previous
years.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
In 2011, Sweden has seen an increase in notification of TBE cases up
to 25 Sep 2011 that amounts to numbers amongst the highest recorded.
Normally, additional cases are also reported in October, indicating
that 2011 may be a record year concerning TBE in Sweden.

In our opinion, a potential explanation for the increase of TBE cases
in Sweden during the last years is a general increase of the tick
population (T Jaenson, personal communication, 26 Sep 2011), although
human behaviour and contact with wildlife could also have
contributed.

Factors that help tick populations thrive are, among others,
non-extreme temperatures, high humidity and the presence of snow cover
during the winter, which acts as insulation. The last decades'
increased mean annual temperature [7] may have provided more
favourable conditions for ticks. In particular, the last years' ample
snow cover, early springs with rapidly increasing temperatures as well
as the not too hot or dry summers may have been important positive
factors for tick survival and reproduction success [8,9]. However,
climatic factors alone may not be sufficient to contribute to an
increase of the tick-population. The density of the most important
blood sources, e.g. rodents, deer or hares, is also important.

Factors concerning human exposure to ticks may be favourable weather
and abundance of mushrooms or berries, which stimulate outdoor
activities. In recent years, springs have been warmer than before
[10], and the summers and autumns have been relatively warm, all of
which are likely to have increased human exposure to ticks.

In conclusion, we believe that weather is likely to have stimulated
both tick populations and human exposure, resulting in an increase in
human cases in 2011 in Sweden.

The increase in TBE in Sweden that has occurred in the past decade may
be a consequence of several factors, including enlarged tick
populations, more contact between TBE virus-infected ticks and humans,
growing awareness of the disease, and climatic conditions
paradoxically, such as increased winter snow cover.
