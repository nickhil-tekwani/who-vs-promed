Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Thailand
---------------------------------------------
Information received on (and refers up to) 6 Feb 2004 from Dr Yukol
Limlamthong, director general, Department of Livestock Development,
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
End of previous report period: 30 Jan 2004 (see Disease Information 2004;
17[6]: 27, 6 Feb ).
New outbreaks: a further 8 provinces have been affected.
Total number of birds destroyed (23 Jan to 5 Feb 2004): 26 427 548.
Diagnosis made using:
- haemagglutination inhibition test;
- agar gel precipitation test;
- virus isolation;
- intravenous pathogenicity index test.
Positive results, indicating highly pathogenic avian influenza virus type
A, subtype H5N1, closely related to human isolates from Vietnam, were
obtained between 31 Jan and 3 Feb 2004; 75 625 samples were tested, of
which 161 were positive.
Preliminary report on viruses AIV1/04 and AIV2/04, University of Hong Kong,
Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China:
"The gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of these 2 virus isolates
has been carried out for 7 gene segments: PB2; PB2; haemagglutinin (HA),
nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), non-structural gene
(NS). The sequencing for the PA gene is still awaited. The results indicate
that the 2 viruses AIV1/04 and AIV2/04 are very closely related to the
human virus isolates from Vietnam for all 7 gene segments. We have also
carried out antigenic analysis by the haemagglutination inhibition test using
a) polyclonal antisera to A/HK/156/97, A/Goose/HK/437.4/99,
A/Ck/HK/YU22/02, A/HK/213/03;
b) monoclonal antibodies CP24 and CP58.
The overall pattern of the haemagglutination inhibition test reactivity is
similar to that of 2 human Vietnam viruses."
Control measures during reporting period:
- stamping out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning.
Vaccination is prohibited.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza in China (People's Republic of)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 11 Feb 2004 (refers up to 10 Feb) from Dr Shen
Zhenzhao, director general, Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Health, Ministry
of Agriculture, Beijing:
End of previous report period: 4 Feb 2004 (see Disease Information 2004;
17[6]: 32, 6 Feb ).
To date, there have been altogether 38 outbreaks in 14 provinces
(autonomous regions or municipalities), of which 23 (table 1) have been
confirmed by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory as subtype
H5N1-caused highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the other 15 (see
Table 2) being suspected HPAI.
The cumulated number of diseased birds is 137 577, out of which 121 720
have died.
Control measures:
In accordance with the Law on Animal Epidemic Prevention, the local
governments in the above-mentioned places:
- have sealed off the infected areas;
- have culled all the poultry within a 3 km radius around the foci of
infection, and
- have imposed compulsory vaccination on the poultry within a 5 km radius
around the foci of infection.
Up to now, 2 287 000 have been culled.
Up to now, 5 484 500 poultry have been compulsorily vaccinated.
At present, the disease in the places mentioned below is under control.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: The map see URL
above] merely indicates the towns affected and the capitals of those
provinces where outbreaks have been confirmed or suspected. It does not
attempt to show the precise geographical location of the outbreaks within
the affected provinces.

[A quick peek at the maps referenced in these reports (see OIE website)
shows how widespread the outbreaks are in China and Thailand. In case
anyone thinks we have the outbreaks under control in poultry in Asia, these
data should provide ample caution and resolve and should stimulate the
allocation of adequate resources. Since last week, 8 new provinces have
been affected in Thailand and 15 new outbreaks in China. Other countries,
including Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia, which did not file OIE update
reports this week, are still experiencing new outbreaks -- see Avian
influenza - Eastern Asia (24) 20040213.0480. - Mod.PC]
