Please find below a summary of mortalities in rainbow trout fry which
may be related to melamine toxicity. I have not been able to find
anything in the literature on melamine in fish, so any comments from
subscribers would be very much welcomed.
A commercial hatchery experienced 2 events of mortalities in rainbow
trout fry. In both cases, triploid ova were imported from the United
States. The first batch was received in February and the second in
April of this year[2007]. Hatchout and swimup were normal. The fry
began eating without problems. The hatchery is fed by a borehole and
partial recirculation is used to control temperature. After hatchout,
the percentage water replacement was increased and by first feeding,
the system was on total flow through. The fry were moved to nursery
tanks approximately 2 weeks after hatch. Nursery tanks receive 70
percent borehole and 30 percent stream water. The stream water is 1st
use and there are no fish or potential sources of pollution above the
farm.
Mortalities began in one tank 11 days after the fish were moved to
the nursery. The other tanks were affected within 3 days of the 1st.
The fish were moved to ongrowing tanks approximately a month later,
where they are on 100 percent stream water. Mortalities continued
throughout, worsening whenever the fish were stressed or when feeding
was increased. Water temperatures were around 15 degrees C or 59
degrees F.
Mortalities tended to be fairly constant and low level, generally
under 1 percent per day. Cumulative mortalities eventually reached 40
percent. On the 4th day after mortalities 1st began, the fish were
treated with Chloramine T. This was repeated 2 days after they were
moved to ongrowing tanks. The treatment appeared to exacerbate the
mortalities. No other treatments were given.
The fish show few clinical signs before dying. They are very pale and
their heads, from about the level of the eyes forwards, appear
transparent. The abdomens tend to be slightly swollen and digestion
seems retarded, as fish retain feed in the gut for up to 2 days of
starvation.
Postmortem examination showed overall pallor, especially of the
liver. Wet preparations of gills, skin, cartilage and gut were
negative for parasites. Bacterial culture of kidney yielded no growth
and there was in any case nothing to suggest bacterial infection. In
February [2007], viral isolation was also attempted and nothing
found. Histological examination was unremarkable. A mild nephrosis
with some eosinophilic material in the renal tubules was seen. This
material was in the form of fragments or strands, not homogenous.
Mild enteritis was seen. The liver was very fatty. Bloodsmears showed
a fair number of red blood cells with nuclei that appeared to be
dividing.
The fish received the same feed throughout. On the 2nd occasion, the
feed was tested for melamine and a level of approximately 45 ppm was
found. Could this be responsible for the mortalities in these fry?
The feed also contains soya oilcake and full fat soya, but we have
been unable to obtain the percentage of these ingredients.

[Although this appears to be prima facie evidence of melamine
contamination, I would wonder if there was any cyanuric acid found in
the feed or in the kidneys. In limited work done in the US, it
appears it is the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid causing
mortality in monogastrics. - Mod.TG]
