Emergency report
Text of a fax received on 17 September 1998 from Dr J.M. Arnoldi, Deputy
Administrator, Veterinary Services, United States Department of
Agriculture,
Washington, DC:
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 16 September 1998.
Estimated date of first infection: 2 September 1998.
Location No. of outbreaks
Anne Arundel County,
State of Maryland 1
Ventura County,
State of California 1

Description of affected population:
- an imported 8 year-old Dutch warm-blooded stallion in show circuit
only
since importation, and
- an adult mare, 22 years old, used as a test mare at
a quarantined facility for diagnosing contagious equine metritis (CEM)
from
stallions being imported to the United States of America.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratory, Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: identification of Taylorella equigenitalis;
fluorescent antibody of culture isolate; biochemical characteristics.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: infected imported stallion.
B. Mode of spread: sexual transmission from an imported stallion to a
CEM-negative mare during importation testing.
C. Other epidemiological details: the mare had been in isolation with
another test mare since being bred to the imported stallion in May 1998.
The
infection of the stallion had not been detected during importation
testing,
and the transmission to test mare went undetected until the mare was
being
re-qualified as a test mare for testing a newly imported stallion.
Control measures during reporting period: quarantine movement control
and
other precautions at frontiers and inside the country. The infected mare
was
destroyed. The testing of susceptible mares continues. The imported
infected
stallion has not serviced artificially nor naturally since importation
and
is quarantined and being treated.

(2) Press Release from USDA, 17 Sep 1998
USDA PLANS TO RELIEVE GEORGIA HORSE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS
The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed today that Georgia is
approved
to receive certain mares and stallions imported into the United States
from
regions affected with contagious equine metritis, a serious venereal
disease
of horses.
APHIS published a direct final rule on July 27 notifying the public of
its
intent to allow these importations. No written adverse comments
regarding
the direct final rule were received.
"Georgia has agreed to comply with our regulations to further ensure the
imported horses' freedom from CEM," said Craig A. Reed, administrator
for
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's
marketing
and regulatory programs mission area.
APHIS' animal importation regulations require that mares and stallions
over
two years old imported for permanent entry into the United States from
regions where CEM exists be consigned to APHIS-approved states.
Georgia will enforce its state laws and regulations to control CEM by
requiring inspection, treatment, and testing of horses, in accordance
with
APHIS regulations.
Notice of this direct final rule is scheduled for publication in the
Sept.
18 Federal Register and becomes effective on Sept. 25.
