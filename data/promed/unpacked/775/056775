In the Bulgarian village of Trapishte, authorities are starting to vaccinate animals at a local farm, after an Anthrax outbreak was detected. So far, 7 sheep died of the infection. The owner of those animals was infected with Anthrax as well. He was treated at the Razgrad Hospital and is a lot better, according to Bulgarian language media reports.

Bulgaria's public health authorities now intend to have a total of 1700 animals vaccinated. They include 1200 sheep, 400 cows as well as 20 horses and donkeys.

Trapishte is located in North-Western Bulgaria, between Razgrad and Targovishte.

A physician working on the Anthrax case, Dr. Arif Attivov, told Bulgarian National Television (BNT), it would take 3 to 4 days to vaccinate the animals. He stated some inhabitants in the area were panicking, which was not necessary, since in this case humans could only be infected when they come in contact with the blood of infected animals. According to the doctor, the authorities have spread instructions in the area affected.

Movement to and from the farm, on which the Anthrax outbreak took place, is now prohibited. So is the slaughter of animals. These measures will remain in place, until the 14-day immunisation period is over. Apart from the ongoing vaccinations, the premises of the farm, its buildings and all equipment is being disinfected. The last Anthrax outbreak in that area took place some 50 years ago, in communist Bulgaria.

A bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_ causes Anthrax. Infections of humans can occur through the skin, by inhalation and injection, or intestinal. Anthrax can be fatal.

Anthrax in Bulgaria is truly sporadic with many years without reported cases. They had no outbreaks last year [2016], but in 2015 there were 6: separate sheep and cattle cases in farms in Varna; a single ovine outbreak in Dobric; 2 bovine outbreaks in Targoviste; and a single bovine outbreak in Velko Tarnovo. Before 2015 it was just the odd single outbreak with many years with no cases. In such a sporadic situation it is challenging to maintain a proper level of surveillance and persuade farmers to report unexpected deaths, which can then be checked out, and to get farmers to vaccinate their stock when they are some 5-10 km [3.1-6.2 miles] from any recent case. Optimistically this outbreak will show that the threat is still there. And if I were investigating this recent case I would try to find out if this Trapishte herd had any contacts, direct or indirect, with the 2015 herd in Targovishte. - Mod.MHJ
