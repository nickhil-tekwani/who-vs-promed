As of 22 Aug 2003, Ontario has 2 confirmed and 2 probable cases of EEE in
Ontario this summer. All 4 horses were from the Ottawa and Perth areas of
eastern Ontario. Since 1992, there have been sporadic EEE infections
reported in Ontario.
2 horses were diagnosed with EEE in 2001 and one in 2002, all in the
central part of the province. OMAF (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and
Food) has alerted veterinarians about the possible increase in EEE this
summer and fall. Human cases of EEE in Ontario are rare, and none has been
reported in the current outbreak.

[EEE is particularly prevalent in the southern parts of the US, but this
year the disease has also been making itself known in more northern
regions. ­ Mod.TG]
