[The official data above fall in line with the contents of posting 20170207.4822669, while adding the following significant information:

1. The identity of the causative agent has been established by Israel's Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) as FMDV serotype O. Genotyping of the virus will allow tracing back its origin and will be suggestive of the applicability of vaccines applied.

2. Information on the FMD situation in the Gaza strip, a Palestinian authority (PA) territory. According to (unofficial) information, the samples received from there at the KVI were derived from fattening calves in Rafah (adjacent to Egypt's Sinai peninsula, 12 km [7.5 mi] from Nir-Yitzhak; see map at http://tinyurl.com/hrf8fx5). An official notification from the PA authorities, with details, is anticipated.

3. Clinical signs described in the Nir-Yitzhak dairy operation. Subscribers are referred, in particular, to the recorded "drop in milk, drop in appetite." The affected dairy farm, as all large/industrial dairy operations in Israel, applies advanced technologies including computerized milking and feeding systems. This allows early detection of any changes in the milk production and/or feed consumption, phenomena which may be indicative of a developing problem, including a disease, during its earliest stages. The establishment of the "Start date" becomes feasible.

4. Numbers of clinical cases. Out of a total of 650 cattle, 79 (12.2 percent) showed clinical signs, of which 37 were milking cows and 42 were pregnant heifers. Information on their share in their respective age groups will allow assessment of the immunity in the herd, which may reflect a vaccine efficacy or vaccination performance issue. The date of the last vaccination of the herd is requested.

The FMDV strains known to have been circulating in Egypt during 2016 are, according to the data available at the Egypt page of WRLFMD, the following:
1. Serotype O, topotype EA-3, lineage unnamed
2. Serotype A, topotype AFRICA, lineage G-IV
3. Serotype SAT 2, topotype VII, lineage Alx-12
