Mystery Illness Hits Saudi Town
-------------------------------
A strange disease outbreak among students of a school in the Asyer area has
alarmed the citizens of Surat Obeid, as the cases have risen to 55 since
last Thursday [3 May 2001].
The medical authorities have come out with contradictory reports about the
source of the virus [see moderator comment below] that has caused the
disease. Some reports say [the illness] is meningitis, other doctors relate
the incident to a water tank, but the Ministry of Agriculture has rejected
all these theories.
Dr. Tariq Al Azraqi, head of the medical team following up [the cause of
the illness], in a press statement, confirmed that [a] virus has not yet
been detected. He added that samples of blood and saliva were obtained from
students for testing, but no dangerous cases [organisms?] had been found so
far.
"Cough and tonsil inflammation are the main symptoms, but there was no
alarming situation, as students were responding to medical treatment within
2 days," he said, adding that the ages of the patients were between 7 and
20 years. The Minister of Preventive Health, Dr. Yaagoub Al Maszro, has
reassured citizens that the disease was neither dangerous nor contagious,
and that no deaths have been reported nor did any cases require intensive
care. He blamed well water used in schools for the spread of disease.
