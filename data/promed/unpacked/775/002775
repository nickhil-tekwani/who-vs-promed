Mexico: 1st human rabies case in Jalisco in years
-------------------------------------------------
A 41-year-old man from El Salto, Jalisco died from rabies on [18 Apr 2022], the 1st such case reported in the state in years.

On 14 Apr 2022, the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) notified a case of rabies in a human in the state: a patient who in January [2022] suffered a bat bite on his right hand, which occurred in the municipality of Chapala.

He did not consult with a doctor until 9 Apr 2022 when he began feeling pain in the arm where he was bit.

On [13 Apr 2022], he was taken to the IMSS National Western Medical Center emergency room, where he was isolated and an anti-rabies vaccination scheme was started. Without presenting improvement, the patient died on [18 Apr 2022].

A sample was processed at the State Public Health Laboratory of Jalisco (LESP) and showed a positive result for rabies.

The health authorities of the state of Jalisco immediately proceeded to carry out surveillance and identification of risk contacts, as well as preventive treatment patient contacts.

In Jalisco, the last case of human rabies due to a dog bite occurred in 1995. From 1996 to 2021 there have been only 7 cases associated with wild animal species, the last case was in 2009 in a bovine.

DHEC confirms one horse exposed by rabid skunk in Greenville County
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) said a skunk found in Greenville County has tested positive for rabies.

The skunk was found near Pardo Road and Hogback Mountain Road in Landrum and was sent to a lab for testing on Wednesday [20 Apr 2022] according to DHEC. The skunk was confirmed to have rabies the following day [21 Apr 2022].

We're told 1 horse was exposed and will be quarantined as required in the South Carolina Control Act.

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility which comes with owning an animal," said Terri McCollister, DHEC's Rabies Program Team Leader in a news release. "It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, your pets, and your livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind."

If you believe you, your family members, or pets have come in contact with a skunk or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Greenville office.

Sick fox found along Washington Blvd tests positive for rabies
--------------------------------------------------------------
Arlington has another fox rabies case -- maybe 2.

A sick fox captured by animal control along Washington Blvd, between East Falls Church and Westover, has tested positive for rabies, according to an announcement from the Animal Welfare League of Arlington (AWLA). Another sick fox was seen on video, taken in the neighborhood surrounding Wakefield High School, but has not been located, AWLA said.

Those incidents follow AWLA's warning last week of a potentially rabid fox in the Arlingwood neighborhood, as well as a similar warning in early February [2022] after an aggressive fox attacked pets and, reportedly, at least 1 person in the Gulf Branch neighborhood.

AWLA, which handles animal control for Arlington County, said residents should remain vigilant, take precautions with pets, and contact the animal control office immediately if they see "any animal appearing sick, lethargic, disoriented, or aggressive."

More from AWLA, below:
Confirmed rabid fox in Highland Park neighborhood: on Wednesday [27 Apr 2022] in the afternoon Arlington County Animal Control received a call about a sick fox in the 6200 block of Washington Boulevard. The fox had neurological signs consistent with rabies, and was captured and removed by Animal Control after exposing a domestic pet. The fox was tested and came back clinically positive for rabies.

Additionally, Animal Control was recently provided footage of a potentially sick fox in the Claremont neighborhood. That footage was provided 4 days after the event, and therefore no fox has been located and no other sightings have occurred at this time. Rabies is a disease people and animals can catch from the bite or scratch of infected animals. It is fatal if medical care is not given promptly. If you, your child, or your pet may have come into contact with this fox or any wild animal, please call Arlington County Animal Control immediately. For after hours calls please stay on the line to speak with the answering service who will alert an officer.

Residents are encouraged to:
- Ensure pets are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccines.
- Keep dogs on a leash at all times and keep cats inside.
- Check backyards before letting pets or children outside and monitor them at all times.
- Do not approach or feed any wild animals.
- Feed pets inside.
- Remove wildlife attractants from yards, such as unsecured garbage cans, open containers of food, and compost.

Animal Control is also urging all residents in Arlington County to remain vigilant and if they see any animal that appears sick, lethargic, disoriented, or aggressive to stay away from the animal and call Animal Control immediately. If you come across a deceased rabies vector animal (including cats, dogs, foxes, raccoons, bats and groundhogs) in your yard or a public space please also contact Animal Control promptly and do not handle the animal.

[4] Missouri: bat, human exposure

Man hospitalized after 1st case of rabies in St. Louis County this year
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A rabid bat bit a man from west St. Louis County last week, marking the county's 1st confirmed rabies case this year [2022].

The man was sent to a local hospital for treatment after a bat bit his finger. According to the St. Louis County Public Health Department, the bat bit a man last Wednesday [27 Apr 2022] in Ballwin after the man tried to defend a bat being attacked by a bird.

Saint Louis County Animal Care and Control responded to the area and trapped the bat.

The Missouri Department of Health's Animal Care and Control division recently euthanized the bat and sent it to the Missouri Public Laboratory, which confirmed the bat carried rabies.

Rabies is a potentially fatal disease when contracted by humans. The patient received a rabies vaccination and a tetanus booster shot after he was bitten by the bat. He also received medication. [At this point I am hoping he received Post Exposure Prophylaxis for rabies bites. - Mod.TG]

The St. Louis County Public Health Department issued an advisory Monday [2 May 2022] with the following message:

The case should serve as a reminder to stay away from wild animals. In the event of accidental contact or exposure within a home, defined as animal in living quarters when occupants are not "awake or aware", seek treatment even if you are unsure about being bitten. Also, please supervise children in situations where they may come into contact with wildlife.

To report a bat bite, call the Saint Louis County Animal Care and Control.

[5] Alabama: dog, fox, human exposure

Alabama county has 2 cases of rabies in 1 week after dog, fox, attack residents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rabid dog has been reported in Autauga County, 1 week after reports of a rabid fox attacking a person with pets in the same area.

The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) said a dog bit a resident near County Road 81 and County Road 57, north of the Booth Community.

It is several miles west of the area where the fox attack was confirmed last week, near Wood Valley Ridge, between Prattville and the Interstate 65 interchange.

According to ADPH, the dog had been seen by homeowners occasionally, but was not tame enough to pet or capture. The dog bite occurred on the victim's porch steps, after the dog exhibited some aggression toward the residents as well as their pets. The dog was subsequently euthanized and tested, and the victim is seeking medical attention.

State Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Dee W Jones said the 2 incidents should serve as a "stern reminder all pets should be properly vaccinated against rabies, given the circumstances of 2 rabid animals now in the same general area."

Alabama state law requires dogs, cats and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccines are also available for horses and other livestock if recommended by a veterinarian.

Area residents are being advised to not allow pets to run loose, and to refrain from leaving uneaten pet food or scraps near residences. In addition, don't illegally feed or keep wildlife as pets, or approach wildlife or domestic animals acting in a strange or unusual manner. Children should avoid any stray or wild animal, regardless of its behavior.

The Autauga County rabies officer will be holding reduced fee vaccinations on Saturday [7 May 2022] at various locations throughout Autauga County. The fee for rabies vaccination is $12 per animal.

[Bites from bats can be quite bad. Bats can bite a sleeping individual without waking the person. If a bat should land, drop, or perch on you in any fashion, please seek medical care immediately. They can bite without you knowing it. There is a limited amount of time from bite to initiation of post exposure prophylaxis [PEP]. If too much time has passed since the exposure, the PEP may not be effective.

If you are bitten or scratched by any animal, please seek immediate medical attention, especially if the animal is wild or you have no history of the animal having been vaccinated.

Please vaccinate your livestock. Horses, cattle, sheep and goats can be exposed to rabies. Most frequently it occurs from a skunk. These furry little creatures wander through the pasture with an odd way of moving which attracts the attention of the nearby stock. The animal often puts its nose down to the creature and gets its nose bitten and thus the rabies virus moves to a new victim.

Rabies virus is deadly to animals. Rabid animals can inflict damage to the human body, such as a horse or cow charging or trampling a human, or a dog biting. Please vaccinate your animals, for your safety, for their safety. - Mod.TG
