Historically, veterinarians have reported finding parasites in the skeletal muscle of some horses with neuromuscular disease. One they've always written off as an incidental finding or not actually related to the neuromuscular disorder is the protozoan parasite _Sarcocystis fayeri_.

Monica Aleman, MVZ, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), School of Veterinary Medicine, believes, however, that there's more to it. She studied _S. fayeri_'s prevalence in horses with neuromuscular disease and presented her results at the 2018 American Association of Equine Practitioners Convention, held 1-5 Dec [2018] in San Francisco, California.

"At UC Davis, we've found large numbers of _S. fayeri_ in the skeletal muscle of diseased horses," she said. "There are also anecdotal reports of horses with lameness and stiffness (but no characteristic signs of incoordination or muscle wasting) responding to treatment with antiprotozoal drugs."

She said confirming _S. fayeri_ in horses' skeletal muscle is also important from a public health standpoint because it's toxic to humans consuming raw horse meat.

In her study, Aleman evaluated skeletal muscle samples from 392 equids treated for suspected neuromuscular disease at UC Davis from 2000 to 2014. She found that:
- 50 study horses had encysted _S. fayeri_ in their skeletal muscle;
- 35 of those 50 had concurrent neuromuscular disease;
- 51 (83.6 percent) of 61 muscle samples from those 35 affected horses contained encysted parasites;
- and 10 horses with _S. fayeri_ were treated with antiprotozoals (Marquis), and their clinical signs resolved within 15 days.

"This doesn't necessarily prove _S. fayeri_ causes disease, but it is worth considering and performing further investigation," said Aleman.

She said these findings indicate that _S. fayeri_ infection is significantly more prevalent in young adult horses (younger than 7) with neuromuscular disease than in healthy horses.

"Consider muscle biopsy in horses with neuromuscular disease of undetermined cause or the presence of clinical signs such as stiffness, muscle atrophy (wasting), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), weakness, gait abnormalities, myositis (tying-up), or myalgia (muscle pain)," she said.

In summary, said Aleman, neuromuscular disease might be associated with _S. fayeri_ infection in muscle because its presence in large numbers could affect muscle function.

[Dr Aleman and colleagues previously published a study of _Sarcocystis fayeri_; the abstract reads:
"Recent reports of _Sarcocystis fayeri_-induced toxicity in people consuming horse meat warrant investigation on the prevalence and molecular characterization of _Sarcocystis_ spp. infection in horses. Sarcocysts in skeletal muscle of horses have been commonly regarded as an incidental finding. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of sarcocysts in skeletal muscle of horses with neuromuscular disease. Our findings indicated that _S. fayeri_ infection was common in young mature horses with neuromuscular disease and could be associated with myopathic and neurogenic processes. The number of infected muscles and number of sarcocysts per muscle were significantly higher in diseased than in control horses. _S. fayeri_ was predominantly found in low oxidative highly glycolytic myofibers. This pathogen had a high glycolytic metabolism. Common clinical signs of disease included muscle atrophy, weakness with or without apparent muscle pain, gait deficits, and dysphagia in horses with involvement of the tongue and esophagus. Horses with myositis were lethargic, apparently painful, stiff, and reluctant to move. Similar to humans, sarcocystosis and cardiomyopathy can occur in horses. This study did not establish causality but supported a possible association (8.9% of cases) with disease. The assumption of _Sarcocysts_ spp. being an incidental finding in every case might be inaccurate."

While eating horse meat is not to everyone's taste, there have been cases of food poisoning reported from Japan from human consumption of infected raw horsemeat. See: "Control of toxicity of _Sarcocystis fayeri_ in horsemeat by freezing treatment and prevention of food poisoning caused by raw consumption of horsemeat," in Journal of the Food Hygienic Society of Japan (Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi) 2013; 54(3): 198-203 (in Japanese; abstract in English available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863364).

_Sarcocystis fayeri_ infection may well be an overlooked cause of neuromuscular disease in the horse, so these reports could open up new lines of research and treatment for horses. - Mod.TG.

ProMED has previously posted only rare reports of sarcocystosis, in sheep and humans (see postings listed, below). Fayer et al have published a recent review of human infections (Fayer R, Esposito DH, Dubey JP. Human infections with _Sarcocystis_ species. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2015 Apr;28(2):295-311. doi: 10.1128/CMR.00113-14), full text available at https://cmr.asm.org/content/28/2/295.long). According to this review, to date, humans have been found to be definitive hosts for only 2 of the more than 150 _Sarcocystis_ species found ubiquitously in nature: _S. hominis_ from beef and _S. suihominis_) from pork. For other accidentally ingested _Sarcocystis_ species, humans serve only as intermediate hosts, in whom intramuscular cysts cause myositis, in an aberrant parasitic life cycle process akin to trichinosis. - Mod.LXL]
