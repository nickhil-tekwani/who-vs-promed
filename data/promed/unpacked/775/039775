[1] Dried vobla
Date: Sat 11 Aug 2007

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6836531,00.html>

Future International Inc. of Rahway, NJ, is recalling packages of
dried "vobla" because the fish could be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_, which causes botulism, a potentially fatal
form of food poisoning. No illnesses have been reported to date,
according to the company. The recalled dried vobla was distributed
nationwide with the code No. 07/05/07. Consumers should return the
product to place of purchase for a full refund.
For more information, consumers can call the company at 732-388-6898.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. The
issue in this recall is not specifically mentioned but it may be the
size of the fish (see below).
Vobla (also spelt vobbla, wobla, or wobbla)
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vobla>) is a Russian food made of
fish, which has been salt dried (salt cured) for several weeks. It
is made from a fish that lives in the Caspian Sea. Vobla originated
in Russia, and is a common Russian meal or "snack" that goes well
with beer. - Mod.LL]

[2] Uneviscerated smoked mackerel
Date: Wed 7 Aug 2007

New York State consumers warned consumers not to eat "Blue Ocean
Brand Smoked Mackerel" sold by U Mart Supermarket, 56-02 31st Ave,
Woodside, because the product was processed uneviscerated.
The "Blue Ocean Brand Smoked Mackerel" were sold at the Woodside
store. The product was offered for sale frozen, in an un-coded,
wrapped foam tray. The product is distributed by Everlasting
Distributors, Inc., 15 Pulaski St. Bayonne, NJ.
The sale of this type of fish is prohibited under New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets regulations because
_Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in
the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated
processed fish has been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the
product. Consumers who have this product are advised not to eat it.

[The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Regulations Section 540.650 -- Uneviscerated Fish Products that
are Salt-cured, Dried, or Smoked (CPG 7108.17)
<http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg540-650.htm>:
Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several
outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous
in fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent
a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative
cell growth and toxin production.
Three outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses,
resulted from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and 1987.
Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also
known as "rybetz," "ribeyza," or "rostov." Kapchunka is an
uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may
not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as
cooking.
The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a
minimum of 25 days and then air dried at ambient temperature for 3 to
7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly
stored under refrigeration.
In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" was
implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh
is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh
mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels which may
be tightly sealed from one week to one year. In another, an ethnic
fish product called "moloha" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4
family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured
fish product similar to "faseikh." The preparation steps in the New
Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the "moloha"
could not be found.
Other salt-cured products, such as "bloaters," can also pose a public
health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated,
whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be
transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In
addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried,
pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The
referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a
well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated
with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.
The problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in
attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an
uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_.
Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried,
smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin
may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs
of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the
consumer.
Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery
products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned
foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as, control of
water activity, or pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The
control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the
product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening
toxin.
Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked
products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally
3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm). Typically, these products are
prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish
under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to
ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of
salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the
attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.
FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or
smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In
addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from
uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the
original product. Therefore, with the exception of small,
uneviscerated fish as described above, FDA considers uneviscerated
fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products
made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section
402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the
product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary
conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
These products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature,
refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or
modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]
