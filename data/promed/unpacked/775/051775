Rift Valley fever (FVR), an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is most commonly seen in certain animals such as cattle, bison, sheep, goats, and camels and that can also cause disease in human beings has been declared in Burundi since the end of April [2022]. The situation is still under control, but after a month there are cases in 8 provinces of the country, and if the epidemic were to spread further, the consequences would be dramatic. Livestock farming is an essential sector in Burundi, the crisis of which affects all other economic and social spheres, because it affects nutrition and general confidence. As economist Faustin Ndikumana notes, "In Burundi, a rural and densely populated country, the room for maneuver is reduced in terms of diversification of the economy, so if farming and nutrition are severely affected, as we fear, the situation will risk being dramatic, since even now, food inflation is a nightmare for families."

The following table, prepared by the Burundian newspaper "Iwacu," gives the reported cases of RVF in cattle in each of the 8 affected provinces as of 1 Jun 2022:

Province / Cases / Deaths
Ngozi / 169 / 47
Kirundo / 194 / 55
Muyinga / 83 / 6
Karusi / 25 / 1
Cibitoke / 5 / 3
Kayanza / 4 / 2
Bujumbura / 4 / 1
Makamba / 3 / 0
Total / 487 / 115
The most affected provinces, Kirundo, Muyinga, and Ngozi, are situated in the north.

The repercussions are not only in the livestock sector but involve entire communities: the butchers no longer have oxen to deal with, the milk traders of Bujumbura no longer sell the same quantity and fear they will not be able to pay the rents. Meanwhile, the price of meat is rising rapidly, and the only meat on the market is that coming from farms in the south of the country.

In Ngozi, to protect the population, the local authorities have ordered the burying of all cows that have died from this disease. This, however, is also a huge economic loss for farmers: in at least 2 cases there have been "exhumations" of cows, at night and in secret, in order to recover some meat to be put on the market. According to the chronicles, however, the authors have been discovered and, assures Martin Joseph Bucumi, administrator of Ngozi, "nobody ate that meat."

In various areas of Burundi there are increasingly difficult effects on an individual and community level: in the Siyoni market in Bujumbura, dedicated to the sale of meat, there have been no customers for days. "It's a desert; the butchers' stalls are almost empty," writes Iwacu. A further very significant observation is that, with the absence of meat, only the rich will be able to eat proteins, since they are the only ones who can afford to buy fish.

The Minister of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock, Déo Guide Rurema, recently dampened concerns, stating that, "For healthy livestock, the consumption of its meat is not prohibited; it is only necessary to cook the milk well and the meat." Understandably, however, it is forbidden to consume the meat of an infected animal and, continues the minister, his department is working to eradicate the disease.

According to Désiré Ntakirutimana, director of animal health at the Ministry responsible for breeding, "The vaccine is the only effective means to combat RVF." However, this is not an easy task, as around 1 million cattle and 3 million sheep would have to be vaccinated; therefore, the country needs at least 8 million doses, because more booster doses will be needed a few months after the 1st administration. Furthermore, considering that each single dose of vaccine has a price between BIF 1000-1200 [EUR 0.46-0.55; USD 0.49-0.59], the Burundian economy risks not being able to launch and complete the vaccination campaign, because, by multiplying the cost of each dose for the entire animal population, an overall expenditure of a few million euros is reached, which in the country with the lowest per-capita income in the world, is an enormous figure.

According to the epidemiologist Ntakarutimana, the strategy must be differentiated, 1st of all securing the most exposed places, such as slaughterhouses, where it must become mandatory to wear protective gloves and shoes, as well as to clean and wash hands well. Another recommended practice is to sleep in rooms protected by mosquito nets covered with insecticides, because these insects could be vectors of the virus, although to date there are no cases among the human population. Furthermore, Dr. Ntakarutimana invites us not to give credit to some fake news on social media in recent days, where rather shocking photos have circulated, passed off as images of infected veterinarians. "They are false; there is no veterinarian who has got this fever in Burundi," [he said].

The hope is that the Burundian authorities react promptly, otherwise the epidemic could become unmanageable: the RVF virus is more serious among cattle, camels, sheep, and goats, especially on younger sheep. In fact, the 1st warning sign is often the rising abortion rate among sheep herds.

Protecting them is equivalent to protecting humans and society as a whole, because they are fundamental animals for a large part of the African countries where the pathogen circulates. But taking care of it also means recovering a more balanced relationship with the ecosystem: a close correlation has been observed between outbreaks of RVF and periods of above-average rainfall, caused by the climatic changes of recent decades, where humidity causes mosquitoes to increase rapidly and the possibility that these transmit the virus.

[According to Burundi's immediate notification of its RVF event to the WOAH [formerly OIE], dated 3 Jun 2022 (ProMED post 20220605.8703685), no human cases have been confirmed in Burundi as of that point in time; the veterinary services were collaborating with the country's public health authorities to carry out surveillance.

The absence of human cases, yet to be confirmed by the named surveillance results, is unusual. As indicated in OIE's [WOAH's] RVF chapter of the Terrestrial Manual, "humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.
