5th FMD outbreak in 3 weeks discovered in south east Bulgaria
--------------------------------------------------------------
Domestic livestock infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] have
been discovered in a 5th village in south eastern Bulgaria in less
than 3 weeks.

Veterinary units of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency [BFSA] carrying
out routine inspections discovered on Monday [4 Apr 2011] cases of FMD
among domestic animals in the village of Bliznak, Malko Tarnovo
Municipality [Burgas region].

The village of Bliznak is located near the village of Granichar where
FMD was discovered recently some 10 km [6 mi] away from the border
with Turkey.

A total of 22 cows, 63 buffaloes, 145 sheep, 109 goats, and 12 pigs,
owned by a total of 9 people were found to be infected, and will be
put to death in the village, while the owners will be compensated.

After 12 years without FMD cases, in late December [2010] and
throughout February [2011], Bulgaria saw 3 outbreaks of FMD originally
brought into Bulgaria by a wild boar from Turkey [see comment]. After
several hundred domestic animals were destroyed and a number local and
EC-sanctioned measures were introduced, the authorities gained the
upper hand.

The 1st of the new FMD outbreaks was detected on 20 Mar 2011 in 3
more villages in the southeastern Bulgarian Strandzha mountain, a day
before the European Commission was expected to lift the measures,
imposed on the Burgas District.

The new outbreak was found at a private farm near the village of
Kirovo, close to the border with Turkey. In the following few days,
FMD was also found in sheep from various villages in the poor and
sparsely populated region -- Goliamo Bukovo, Fakia, and Momina Tsarkva
near the town of Sredets.

Last week [week of 28 Mar 2011] Bulgarian agriculture minister
Miroslav Naydenov announced in Parliament that the Borisov Cabinet is
going to go ahead with the plans to restore some of the Cold War era
fences along the Bulgarian-Turkish border in order to prevent wild
animals infected with FMD from trespassing into Bulgaria and infecting
the domestic livestock.

[Bliznak is situated in the north western part of the Malko Tarnovo
District/Municipality, which is outlined in blue on the maps in slides
3,4,7,8, and 12 of Bulgaria's presentation of 1-2 Mar 2011, available
at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/0102032011_fmd__bulgaria.pdf.

The newswire above mentions the detection of infection in "cows,
buffaloes, sheep, goats, and pigs." It would help to note which
species have been indeed affected and whether this was clinically
manifested or rather serologically detected.

This outbreak could have started earlier than the official date
provided (4 Jan 2011): according to the WRLFMD genotyping report, the
boar with typical foot lesions (age estimates not provided), was shot
in Kosti on 30 Dec 2010; see
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00002%20O%20Bulgaria%202010.pdf).

It remains to be debated if the 10 FMD foci in the Burgas province
since the end of December 2010, one in wild boar and 9 in domestic
animals, belong to 3 separate outbreaks or rather to one continuous
event. The attribution of the introduction of the virus to the wild
boar is also subject to discussion. Its possible role in the
distribution of the disease deserves further investigations. - Mod.AS
