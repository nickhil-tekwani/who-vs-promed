A 28-year-old agricultural worker, resident of a rural area and
worker in a receiving warehouse of a company in Longotoma, La Ligua
community of the Valparaiso region, was infected with [a]
hanta[virus]. He has had a progressive improvement in a local
hospital after having had fever and headache and being connected to
mechanical ventilation.

Teams from the Aconagua Office of the Regional Secretariat of the
Ministry of Health (SEREM), plus Epidemiology, Zoonoses, Promotion,
Food and Worker Health went to the place where the agricultural
worker was employed to carry out community education and a study of
contacts. In addition, they did an epidemiological and environmental
investigation and together with this issued recommendations to the
company to sanitize the warehouse according to their instructions.

The infected individual remained in the intensive care unit of the
Gustavo Fricke Hospital, but is now stable and will be moved to the
medical service of the Quillota Hospital on Monday [15 Mar 2010].

From 2001 up until the present, in the Valparaiso region, 12 positive
cases of hanta[virus infection] have been registered.
