Opisthorchis in Irtish and Ob rivers
------------------------------------
_Opisthorchis_ species have been discovered by veterinary and sanitary
physicians examining river water passing through the city of Murom in the
Vladimir region. Opisthorchiasis in humans may affect the liver, pancreas,
and gall bladder. In the past 6 years 23 human cases of opisthorchiasis
have been registered in the region. If not treated in the early stages,
opisthorchiasis may cause liver cirrhosis and increased risk of liver
cancer, but may be silent in children.
According to the state TV company "Vladimir," _Opisthorchis_ is widespread
in pools of the Irtish and Ob rivers, from which people eat raw fish. In
Tomsk, for example, 30 people out of every 100 000 are infected with
_Opisthorchis_. In order to prevent [infection with] _Opisthorchis_, fish
should be boiled for at least 20 minutes or should be salt-cured.

[Please see the moderator's comment in "Opisthorchiasis, human - Russia
(Chelyabinsk) 20030822.2118", in which the life cycle of the opisthorchis
fluke is described and prevention and treatment are discussed. This report
suggests that opisthorchis may be widespread in Russian river systems
[Benenson, 1995 (Control of communicable diseases manual, APHA), suggested
that 2 million in the former Soviet Union might be infected. - Mod.SH]. -
