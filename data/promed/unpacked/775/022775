Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is investigating an outbreak of mumps at 2 Guelph high schools, the 1st cases of the disease in the area since 2010.

Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the health unit, said there are 2 reported cases of mumps at 2 different Catholic high schools, Bishop Macdonell and Our Lady of Lourdes. "We haven't determined a link between the cases, and there are 4 suspected cases in total that we're investigating," Ferguson said on Thursday [28 May 2015].

People can protect themselves from getting mumps by getting the free vaccination, part of the measles, mumps rubella (MMR) childhood vaccine. Two doses are required.

Students at both schools who choose not to be vaccinated will be kept home from school for a minimum of 16 days or until the outbreak is over, Ferguson said. If a student who is missing a 2nd dose of the vaccine agrees to get it, they can return to school.

Ferguson said that keeping kids at home is not a measure that's taken lightly by the health unit. "We work with parents; we work with schools; we work with doctors to make sure kids are protected, but if there's an outbreak and they're not vaccinated, there's nothing we can do but remove them from school for their own protection," he said.

Tamara Nugent, director of education for the Wellington Catholic District School Board, said the number of kids that will be affected is shifting. "By the end of this week, I think we'll have a good sense of how many students there are," she said. "We know that it's very few. It's just a matter of records and making sure that the public health unit has those on file; that's often the case."

Nugent said the board is working with the public health unit to take all of the "preventative and precautionary measures" they can, such as encouraging kids to wash their hands and not share water bottles or musical instruments with mouthpieces.

Mumps is very contagious and can be spread by coughing, sneezing, kissing or using an object an infected person has recently used. Ferguson said it's unclear where the mumps outbreak started, but there are sporadic cases in Ontario, and the 1st case may have been brought into the area through travel.

The symptoms of mumps include fever, swollen glands, and headache. It's caused by a virus, and antibiotics cannot treat it, so doctors often let it run its course. Mumps used to be a rare disease but is now making somewhat of a comeback.

While people born before 1970 are supposed to have natural immunity to the mumps, those born in the 1980s and 1990s may have missed getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine, which was introduced in 1996.

[The Public health Agency of Canada (2014) states that: Outbreaks of mumps continue to occur in Canada, and the proportion of cases aged 20 years and older has increased. Complications such as orchitis and oophoritis are relatively frequent; permanent sequelae like deafness are rare. Mumps vaccine is available as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Mumps vaccine effectiveness has been estimated at 62-91 percent for one dose and 76-95 percent for 2 doses. Reactions to MMR and MMRV vaccine are generally mild and transient and include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, and rash.

Mumps-containing vaccine is recommended for routine immunization of children and for immunization of children and adolescents who missed mumps immunization on the routine schedule. Mumps-containing vaccine is recommended for susceptible adults born in 1970 or later. Adults born before 1970 can be presumed to have acquired natural immunity to mumps; however, susceptible health care workers, travellers, and military personnel should receive MMR vaccine, regardless of the year of birth. - Mod.CP
