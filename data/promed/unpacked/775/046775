Abstract
--------
Madariaga virus (MADV), also known as South American eastern equine encephalitis virus, has been identified in animals and humans in South and Central America, but not previously in Hispaniola or the northern Caribbean. MADV was isolated from virus cultures of plasma from an 8-year-old child in a school cohort in the Gressier/Leogane region of Haiti, who was seen in April 2015, with acute febrile illness (AFI). The virus was subsequently cultured from an additional 7 AFI case patients from this same cohort in February, April, and May 2016. Symptoms most closely resembled those seen with confirmed dengue virus infection. Sequence data were available for 4 isolates: all were within the same clade, with phylogenetic and molecular clock data suggesting recent introduction of the virus into Haiti from Panama sometime in the period from October 2012-January 2015. Our data document the movement of MADV into Haiti and raise questions about the potential for further spread in the Caribbean or North America.

Author summary
--------------
Madariaga virus (MADV) is the name given to what used to be called South American eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), based on recent studies suggesting that MADV is distinct genetically from the EEEV circulating in North America. Until now, MADV has been found primarily in animals in South and Central America, with a limited number of human cases reported (most of whom had encephalitis). Our group has been responsible for a series of studies assessing the etiology of acute febrile illness (AFI) among children in a school cohort in Haiti. Unexpectedly, in April 2015, we identified MADV on viral culture of plasma from a student with AFI in this cohort; an additional 7 cases were identified on culture of samples from children with AFI in this same cohort in February, April, and May 2016. On sequence analysis, all strains were very similar genetically, and appear to have come from a strain introduced into Haiti from Panama sometime in the period from October 2012- January 2015. Symptoms of children were similar to those seen with dengue; none had encephalitis. Our data indicate that this virus, which has the potential for causing serious illness, has been recently introduced into Haiti, and raises the possibility that it might move into other parts of the Caribbean or North America.

Introduction
------------
Madariaga virus (MADV), also known as South American eastern equine encephalitis virus, is an alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. Recent ecologic and genetic studies of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) have demonstrated clear separation between North and South American EEEV strains: North American EEEV cluster in a single genetic lineage (lineage I, in the system proposed by Arrigo et al. [1]), with South American EEEV strains, or MADV, clustering in EEEV lineages II, III, and IV. MADV can cause outbreaks in horses, and appears to infect a variety of mammals, including rats and bats, and possibly birds and reptiles [1-3]. However, less than a dozen human cases of MADV infection have been documented, and almost all were encephalitis cases seen as part of an outbreak in Panama in 2010 [3,4]. In population-based serologic surveys in Panama and the Peruvian Amazon, between 2 and 5% of the general population had evidence of prior infection [2,3,5], suggesting that mild or asymptomatic human infection is relatively common. In support of the latter hypothesis, we recently reported isolation of MADV from a child with acute febrile illness (AFI), but no evidence of encephalitis, during the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Venezuela [6]. The virus has not been previously recognized in Hispaniola or other parts of the northern Caribbean. We report here the apparent recent introduction of MADV into Haiti.

The presence of eastern equine encephalitis-related viruses in the neighboring Dominican Republic (DR) has been recognized for many years.

It would be interesting to have sequences from these early Dominican Republic EEE isolates to determine if they are, in reality Madariaga virus, if these isolates still exist. It would not be surprising if the Dominican Republic viruses are Madariaga, since Haiti and the DR share the same island. - Mod.TY]

A previous ProMED-mail post reports the occurrence of human infections with Madariaga virus in Panama and Venezuela (see Madariaga virus - Venezuela: (LA) 20180504.5783038). The report published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal (https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy225
https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciy225/4989390) states that, "Madariaga virus (MADV), an alphavirus in the eastern equine encephalitis antigenic complex, has only rarely been shown to cause human disease even with the known capacity to cause outbreaks in equine populations in Latin America. When human cases have been detected, until recently, most have been associated with severe neurological disease. However, a follow up study to an outbreak of MADV in Panama in 2010 revealed both mild cases, as well as evidence of asymptomatic infections. Additionally, seroprevalence studies in the Amazonia region of Peru showed MADV antibodies in up to 3 percent of the residents, suggesting that infection with this virus may not be uncommon even in the absence of reported disease. Blohm et al. (in the ProMED-mail post cited) describe a case of Madariaga fever causing only mild febrile illness in a child in Venezuela. With previous data (albeit limited) describing mild or asymptomatic infections with MADV, this case report provides one additional piece of evidence that these mild infections may indeed be much more common than neurological cases." - Mod.TY
