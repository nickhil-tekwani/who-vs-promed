Nipah virus claims 3 lives in Faridpur
--------------------------------------
Three members of a family in Bhanga upazila [sub district] of [Faridpur]
district [Dhaka division] died within a week after they contracted
encephalitis caused by Nipah virus. Faridpur civil surgeon Dr Bashirul
Islam stated that the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and
Research and National Influenza Centre, Bangladesh (IEDCR) yesterday [19
Jan 2010] confirmed the death of the 3 family members [as a result of Nipah
virus infection] following exposure to bat secretions [probably in
contaminated date juice].

The deceased were a 30 year old woman of Algi village under Bhanga upazila,
her 11 year old daughter, and 10 year old nephew. Family sources said the
woman was the wife of a fisherman and she died on 13 Jan 2010 after she had
a fever and headache. The same day her daughter was admitted to Bhanga
Health Complex with the same symptoms. Later she was transferred to
Faridpur Medical College Hospital where she died on 16 Jan 2010. Her nephew
also died of the same disease on 17 Jan 2010 at the Faridpur Medical
College Hospital. All the 3 had consumed raw date juice before they
contracted the disease, family sources added.

A special team from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) led by Faridpur civil surgeon Dr Bashirul
Islam visited the village on Saturday [16 Jan 2010] and collected blood
samples from the 3 victims. After examining the blood sample the IEDCR
authorities [confirmed] the disease as [Nipah virus-associated]
encephalitis, stated Dr Bashirul, adding that the disease originated from
raw date juice contaminated by bat [secretions].

Dr Bashirul advised that all residents of the district when collecting date
juice should cover the mouth of jars with nets so that bats cannot sink
their tongues into the jar. [According to the WHO fact sheet on Nipah virus
infection, freshly collected date palm juice should also be boiled and
fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. - Mod.CP]

While talking to The Daily Star, director of the IEDCR Prof Mahmudur Rahman
said this is the 1st incidence of death due to Nipah virus this year
[2010]. Last year [2009] encephalitis broke out in Rajbari and Manikganj
districts. But very few people died because of the government's early
detection programme. Under this programme regular surveillance has been in
place in Faridpur, Rajbari, and Madaripur since 2006.

A major outbreak took place in Faridpur in 2004 causing death to at least
17 people of Laxmipur village in Sadar upazila.

[Nipah virus first surfaced in Malaysia in 1998 with a mortality rate of 40
per cent. It reappeared in Bangladesh in February 2004, spreading across 6
districts of Bangladesh and claiming 17 human lives. A later outbreak in
the Faridpur district killed 18 of a total 30 cases -- a 60 per cent
mortality rate .

Nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic virus (a virus transmitted to humans
from animals). In infected people, Nipah virus causes severe illness
characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or respiratory
diseases. During the initial outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore, most
human infections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their
contaminated tissues. Transmission is thought to have occurred via
respiratory droplets, contact with throat or nasal secretions from the
pigs, or contact with the tissue of a sick animal. In the Bangladeshi and
India outbreaks, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date
palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was
the most likely source of infection. During the later outbreaks in
Bangladesh and India, Nipah virus spread directly from human to human
through close contact with people's secretions and excretions. In Siliguri,
India, transmission of the virus was also reported within a healthcare
setting, where 75 per cent of cases occurred among hospital staff or
visitors. From 2001 to 2008, around half of reported cases in Bangladesh
were due to human to human transmission. For further information interested
readers should consult the WHO fact sheet at
