The circulation of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues in Mayotte. The epidemiological situation as of 26 April 2019 [follows]:

In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018), samples collected by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions have identified 109 foci of sick animals (including 86 bovine animals). Animal foci are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island. Additional outbreaks have appeared since the end of March [2019] in the communes of Dembeni, as well as on Petite Terre.

The CHM [Mayotte Hospital Center] laboratory reported 126 human cases of RVF from the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS/[Alert and Health Management Unit]) of Mayotte.

After a steady decline in cases during the last 3 weeks of March [2019], a new increase has been observed since the beginning of April [2019]. Since the beginning of the health alert, human cases have remained mainly in the center and northwest of the island.

In this epidemic context, the prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS OI [The Indian Ocean Health Agency] and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF), reminds the importance of preventive measures against the disease [the preventive measures, addressing public health, were included in post 20190420.6433086].

[During the past week, 20-26 Apr 2019, 5 new RVF foci (outbreaks) in animals (domestic ruminants) have been added to the 104 foci accumulated until the end of the previous week (20190420.6433086).

The number of new weekly human cases is 4, added to the 122 patients counted until the end of the previous week. RVF in animals is, most likely, the source of human infection.

Mayotte's some 4000 farms keep 20 000 cattle and 15 000 small ruminants (2019 data, Ref. 1). A vaccination program is technically and economically feasible. Vaccination is expected to discontinue the ongoing circulation of the virus on the island, prevent animal suffering, economical losses, and a serious human disease.

The French delegation included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019 (Ref .1): "What about vaccination? -- To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU." Such authorization deserves early consideration. - Mod.AS
