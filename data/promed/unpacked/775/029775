There have been 52 cases of Ross River fever reported in the Barwon
South Western region so far this year [2011]. At the same time last
year, no cases of the virus had been reported in the area. Barwon
Health has said Ross River fever is not normally found this far south
and was generally confined to northern NSW and Queensland. Although
not life-threatening, it can cause a severe arthritis.

Health Department figures show this year's [2011] figures are even
more dramatic along the Murray River. The Loddon/Mallee region has
recorded 233 cases of the virus so far this year, compared to none for
the same time last year. Heath Department spokesman Bram Alexander
said the wet weather during the summer months had contributed greatly
to mosquito numbers. "The Grampians region has had 244 cases this
year, and the Loddon/Mallee 233, and they both have sections along the
Murray River," he said. "That is not inconsistent with having large
mosquito numbers. There have been big years in the past; 1993 was a
big year, and 1997 was another big year, and again the conditions have
allowed mosquito numbers to increase to the levels we have seen."

Residents along the Murray River were warned last month [February
2011] about another mosquito-borne disease, the deadly Murray Valley
encephalitis virus. [Murray Valley] encephalitis [virus infection] had
been detected in sentinel chickens, which are used to detect diseases
at Mildura, Robinvale, Kerang and Barmah. The death of a northwest
Victorian man in a Melbourne hospital last week remains a suspected
case of Murray Valley encephalitis [see ProMED-mail archive number
20110316.0841]. Mr Alexander said lab tests to detect MVE were
negative, but the man's death would remain a "suspected case" of the
illness. He said there had been no more cases in sentinel chickens.
There are 13 flocks of sentinel chickens along the Murray and in rural
areas of Victoria. They were introduced in 1974 after an encephalitis
outbreak.

[Ross River virus cases in Victoria have increased from 15 reported
on 15 Jan 2011 to 600 now.

This report provides more specific locations and numbers of cases
than the previous report. It provides no indication that the
transmission of Ross River virus is slowing, nor that mosquito
breeding sites are diminishing.
