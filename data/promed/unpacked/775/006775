ProMED Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each year, ProMED presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. Beginning in 2021, the ProMED team was encouraged to nominate, and then vote, to decide who should win the annual ProMED Award.

I am happy to announce that the ProMED team voted Dr Maria Jacobs as this year's winner. This is Maria's 2nd time winning the award in the past 4 years which shows the tremendous respect her ProMED colleagues have for her daily behind the scenes struggles to help make all of us better at what we do!

The person who nominated her wrote:

"[Maria] runs a wonderful editing team, ProMED cannot do without it. She knows exactly what to do, is always very courteous, helpful, and extremely reliable. She has been with us almost since we started. She is just there in the background and because of her everything runs smoothly. She deserves recognition."

Upon being informed of her win, Maria said, "I was happy to be nominated again but it is truly an honor that my colleagues have chosen to give me this award a 2nd time. ProMED has been an important part of my life for 15 years and I am glad to have contributed to its success."

Please join me in congratulating Maria on winning this year's ProMED award!
