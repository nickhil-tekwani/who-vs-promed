Regarding the moderator's comments, I am nearly certain that "Alaska
Native" refers to Alaskan Native Americans, not anyone born in Alaska. The
Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage serves the Native American
population and is a training center for medical students and residents from
the University of Washington in Seattle (I was a lucky medical student who
rotated there); it offers similar opportunities for such trainees from all
over the USA.

Alaska Native is the term used for indigenous peoples of Alaska. All others
are referred to as non-Native. In a survey of 466 _Helicobacter pylori_
isolates recovered from Alaska Natives with clinical symptoms, 26% had
E-test MIC values of >=1.0ug clarithromycin/ml, and 79.9% had MIC values
of >= 8.0ug metronidazole/ml.
In the article posted [on ProMED-mail Wed 27 Dec 2000, the broad statement
that "30-50% of Alaska Natives cured of the bug will be reinfected after 2
years," is misleading. The quotation was derived from one observation from
one Alaska Native village where 55% (5/9) of _H. pylori_- infected persons
were found to be breath test-positive 2 years following successful standard
triple therapy. While it appears that a high proportion of _H. pylori_
isolates recovered from Alaska Natives with clinical symptoms have elevated
MIC's to antibiotics commonly used to treat this infection, the overall
rate of _H. pylori_ reinfection in Alaska Natives and (non-Natives) is not
known, and is the subject of ongoing investigation.

[For those unfamiliar with Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs)
determined using the E-test, the procedure is based upon agar gel diffusion
of antibiotic from strips that have been impregnated with a gradient of
antimicrobial agent. The MIC is inferred by the point of intersection of an
elliptical zone of inhibition of bacterial growth with a scale printed on
the strip. The breath test for _H. pylori_ infection/colonization is based
upon production of urease enzyme by the organism, and release of
radio-labeled carbon dioxide split from urea. The clarifications from
subscribers and additional data are appreciated. - Mod.ES
