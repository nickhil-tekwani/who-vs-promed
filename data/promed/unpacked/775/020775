Management of the internally displaced persons [IDP] camp at Uhogua village in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State has raised alarm over outbreak of chickenpox [varicella] and scabies in the camp.

It said about 1000 children at the camp have been infected.

The affected children are now being quarantined at a corner of the camp.

Coordinator of the camp, Pastor Solomon Folunsho, told newsmen that the camp is in need of health workers and support from philanthropists and government to deal with the scale of infection.

Pastor Folunsho said facilities at the camp are overstretched as food has become a big challenge.

He said he spent NGN 40 000 [approximately USD 135] daily to buy diesel and petrol to provide water and electricity.

Pastor Folunsho called for support from government and the general public to help deal with the health challenges at the center.

He said the majority of IDPs have made strides in their educational pursuit and appealed for more assistance in the areas of writing materials and books.

[Scabies is a skin infestation cased by a mite (_Sarcoptes scabiei_). It is a typical infection under poor hygienic conditions and could indicate that also human louse (_Pediculus humanus_, _P. h. capitis_) could be present. Scabies mites do not transmit diseases but the intense itching results in sores which may become infected. If lice are also present it opens up for transmission of _Rickettsia_, _Bartonella_ and _Borrelia_ infections.

Chickenpox is an airborne, human-to-human transmitted disease with no zoonotic reservoir.

Scabies is controlled by improving hygiene, washing clothes and treating with either an ointment containing deltamethrin or with Ivermectin.

Chickenpox is difficult to control in a situation with many people living close together, and quarantine in a section of the camp, as described here, is probably the most effective measure. - Mod.EP
