_E. coli_ outbreak traced to child
----------------------------------
The _E. coli_ outbreak that sickened 15 youngsters attending an Edina
preschool was triggered by one of the students and not by apples from a
west metro orchard, Minnesota Health Department officials announced late
Wednesday afternoon.
Sophisticated DNA fingerprinting techniques traced the outbreak to a
youngster who had a diarrheal illness before visiting the apple orchard in
late September.
The youngsters, all of whom attend [the same preschool at a church
in Edina, developed _E. coli_ infections after visiting a west metro apple
orchard in late September.
Two of the youngsters have been hospitalized, one in Minneapolis and the
other in St. Paul. Both are in stable condition.
One of the youngsters has developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, a
potentially life-threatening condition that can cause kidney failure and
other serious complications. The other youngster underwent surgery to undo
a fold in the intestine triggered by severe diarrhea.
So far this year, 2 Minnesota youngsters have died of _E. coli_-induced
HUS.
Health Department investigators earlier ruled out the preschool as a source
of the infection and instead continued to focus on the apple orchard.
However, no one else who visited the orchard during that same period has
come down with the infection, and that puzzled the investigators.
But lab tests vindicated the orchard late Wednesday. Investigators believe
the infected preschooler passed the bacteria to other classmates at the
school and while on the field trip to the orchard, where they shared foods
and participated in joint activities.

apple orchard connection had proved false from Ruth M Goehle, MD. As
always, we appreciate rapid clarifications of outbreak reports. - Mod.ES
