[2] UN Security Council

The UN Security Council on Wednesday [9 Jul 2014] expressed its deep concerns at current health and terrorist threats in some of the West African countries, saying that these challenges should be properly addressed collectively by the international community.

The 15-nation UN body, in a statement issued to the press, said that it is deeply concerned at the current outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa and the threat posed by the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria and its neighboring countries of Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The council issued the statement after a briefing by the special representative of the UN secretary-general for West Africa, Said Djinnit.

"The Members of the Security Council also expressed their deep concern over the current outbreak of the Ebola virus in some countries in West Africa and conveyed to the international community the need to provide prompt assistance in order to prevent the spread of the virus," the statement said.

Doctors say the Ebola outbreak gripping West Africa could spread to neighbouring countries or even Europe. The epidemic is thought to have begun in Guinea in March [2014] before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Dr. John T. Richardson, head of the local NGO Feed the Future said at a press conference on Thursday [10 Jul 2014] that realizing the danger and fear the Ebola virus disease [EVD] continues to pose to the society, his organization with the help of several private organizations have decided to partner with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to fight EVD as well as assist victims of the deadly disease.

"EVD has invaded every section of the society and has become an emergency situation; therefore, everyone has to work collectively to fight it," said Richardson. He stated that in the fight against the disease, the local NGO will be involved with interacting with the victims and their families in the bid to bring relief. He also stated that his organization will be providing cell phones and free airtime to victims who have been in isolation while in contact with the virus.

Richardson had called on the media to educate citizens about the Ebola virus without creating fear, adding that the failure of the media to educate the people about this disease is also a failure of the media. During the press conference, several donations were made by several institutions to the local NGO in order to beef up its assistance programs. The Lebanese Community donated over 100 mattresses, cooking oil, and mineral water, while the National Port Authority (NPA) donated over 100 cartons of chlorides, tide soap, gloves, among other resources, while NASSCORP donated several bags of used clothes, toiletries, gloves and other items, while the friends of Benoni Urey donated over 100 phones and SIM cards.

[5] EVD will not spread overseas
Date: 10 Jul 2014
Source: Global News [excerpted, edited]
http://globalnews.ca/news/1443743/why-health-officials-say-the-ebola-epidemic-wont-spread-into-canada


While on "ground zero" of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders, Canadian doctor Tim Jagatic's team of doctors and nurses have been chased out of villages, his advice to stay away from deceased victims is brushed aside, and the survivors he's cured of Ebola are stigmatized by their community. "When the virus is being spread, there are ideas of witchcraft, of this being a government conspiracy. These types of ideas come forth before basic public health ideas," Jagatic told Global News.

Health officials, such as Jagatic, are facing an uphill climb as they tackle the globe's largest Ebola outbreak in history. It's the 1st time in 20 years the virus has been reported in West Africa. Now, cases have been reported in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. As of Sunday [6 Jul 2014], 844 cases -- including 518 deaths -- have been reported, according to the World Health Organization.

Canadian microbiologist and author Jason Tetro explained: "You're going to start feeling the symptoms, and it'll knock you down rapidly," he said. This is why the experts say it's unlikely the disease could migrate beyond West Africa. "There's very little likelihood someone will come into contact with a sick person and jet off somewhere, because the people who do come into contact with those infected are family members and health care workers," Tetro explained. Sick patients, right now, also tend to be in rural areas of Africa where locals aren't typically hopping onto planes for travel.

Even if a case made its way overseas, Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network, is confident that Canadian health officials have the safeguards in place to protect the public. Post-SARS [since the 2003 SARS epidemic], protocol for nurses, doctors and paramedics changed dramatically, and surveillance is now in place brokering intelligence on rising diseases that could pose a threat.

Patients are now screened for a fever, cough or trouble breathing. They're asked a critical, telling question: have they recently returned from another country? Frontline health care workers assessing them don masks, gowns, gloves and any other equipment that acts as a safeguard. Hospitals have better ventilation, single rooms, and plexiglass walls act as a barrier between emergency room front desks and sick patients. There's also compliance to advice doled out by health officials. Gardam remembers SARS: those who felt sick abided by recommendations to stay home; families avoided visiting their sick family members in hospital, and Ontarians were careful with hand washing and personal hygiene. But Gardam understands the hesitancy the public may have as an outbreak goes on. "People got frustrated and sick and tired of being told what to do," he said of the final stages of battling SARS.

The only glitch Gardam is worried about is if a case of EVD is overlooked by the 1st few healthcare workers who see a sick patient. EVD typically presents as a respiratory illness, basically pneumonia, and because it's so rare, some frontline healthcare providers may not immediately think of the disease. "No one has invented a system of identifying somebody with a potentially dangerous disease immediately. It always takes awhile," Gardam said.

Jagatic says that Doctors Without Borders managed to help dozens of sick patients in Guinea. He returned to West Africa on Sunday [6 Jul 2014], and he'll continue to work with quarantined patients, help with community outreach and education, and training local doctors.

Educating communities about how lethal Ebola is may be the pivotal turning point, Tetro said. "Unless we comply with proper hygiene and infection prevention and control measures, both in health care and the real world, this will keep coming around again," Tetro warned. "While we pray, the pathogens prey."

[6] Guinea: survivor interview

I survived Ebola, but villagers shunned me
----------------------------------
SS:
Five days after being hospitalized, [my father] passed away. After his death, the medical staff realized he had presented EVD symptoms and, as I had close contact with him, it meant that I was at risk. So they told me that I needed to be followed up for 21 days, and if ever I felt a small fever, I had to come to the health center. The countdown then started for me: after 9 days, I got a fever, and this persisted until the 11th day. Finally, I went to the treatment center, where I did an EVD test, which was positive.

Q. What were the symptoms? How did you feel while you were ill?

A. I 1st got a fever which persisted. My body temperature reached nearly 40 C [104 F]. After that, I had diarrhea, vomiting, dysentery, and hiccups [all symptoms of Ebola]. I went to the toilet several times a day, and I felt so tired and uncomfortable.

Q. How and where were you treated?

A. I received medical assistance at the Ebola treatment center, put in place at the health centre of Gueckedou. The medical staff provided me with oral medications and infusions. They also provided me with food. I suffered a lot in the beginning with diarrhoea and hiccups, but with the treatment, I started to feel better.

Q. What was the initial reaction in your home village after you recovered?

A. Joy for my family, because everyone thought that I would not survive this disease, as many others people had died. However, before the medical staff released me to go back to my family, they tested me 3 times to make sure that I really had recovered. Afterwards, they gave me a certificate of discharge. They also visited my family, the leaders, and elders of my community to inform them that I had recovered and I was no longer contagious. Despite this, I was stigmatized. Some people avoided me in the beginning, but now, over time, they have learned to accept me. Now they call me "anti-Ebola."

Q. You're now working with Red Cross volunteers in Guinea to raise awareness of the disease: what lessons are you passing on?

A. I am part of a team of Red Cross volunteers, visiting communities, raising awareness on how to prevent the spread of the disease. One of the messages I try to pass on to the communities is to go early to the health center when sufferers 1st feel symptoms. The treatment is free of charge. People there will give you food and clothes, and you can get a chance to survive.

Q. What's your message for the outside world about Ebola? How can they help?

A. Everyone should be mobilized. We need to educate people and increase the sensitization. This is the key to stop the dangerous Ebola virus disease. Many people have already died, that is why I participate in activities [to educate people]. I urge people to go to the isolation and treatment centres if they experience the earliest symptoms of the disease to increase their chance of being cured and surviving.

[The Canadian comments on the unlikelihood of EVD spreading overseas are worth noting.

The raising of the EVD epidemic in the UN Security Council, and the discussion about it in the current ECOWAS Summit, should help to bring the world's attention to the crisis caused by the disease.

The economic impact of the outbreak is being felt. The 3 EVD-affected countries are already among the poorest in Africa and can ill afford the impact of the epidemic on their commerce.

Providing cell phones for people stuck in isolation is a brilliant initiative by Liberia.

The last report above gives hope that the stigmatization of EVD survivors is ending. It is sensible to recruit survivors, who are now immune to re-infection, to work with EVD patients and suspected cases as well as spreading prevention messages. - Mod.JW
