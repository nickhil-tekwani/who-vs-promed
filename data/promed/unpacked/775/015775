Cholera sickness toll reaches 100 as first infection for Seoul reported
----------------------------------------
More reports of cholera over the weekend, including Seoul's first case,
brought the number of infections over the 100 mark, officials said
yesterday. The rate of infection, however, appears to be slowing, according
to the [Korean National Institute of Health (NIH).
The NIH said 8 more people have been confirmed as having cholera since
Saturday, bringing the total number of patients to 106.The new patients
include a 48-year-old man, who became the first Seoul resident to be
infected with cholera since late August, when the first outbreak was
reported. The man was confirmed to have contracted cholera at a restaurant
in Yeongcheon, North Gyeonsang Province, which has been blamed for most of
the infections. The NIH said there was also an additional 13 suspected
cases of cholera, bringing the total number of patients under medical
surveillance due to cholera symptoms to 52.
Since the beginning of this month, the NIH has collected feces and blood
samples of a total of 1252 people and have completed tests on 593 of them,
of which 106 were confirmed to be infected with cholera [bacilli. A NIH
official expected that the remaining tests are likely to reveal that
between 10 and 20 more people more are infected. "We believe we have
tracked down most of the infections associated with the restaurant in
Yeongcheon," said the official, implying the rate of infection is likely to
decrease.
The NIH said, however, it has confirmed 4 cases of secondary infections
through family members, as well as 4 cases in which patients are believed
to have contracted the disease through different channels than the
contaminated food at the Yeongcheon restaurant.
At present, cholera patients are concentrated in North Gyeongsang Province,
including 46 in Yeongcheon, 17 in Gyeongju, 7 in Gyeongsan, 3 in Pohang,
and 2 each in Yoengdeok and Seongju. Other locations that have been hit by
the infection include Daegu with 17, Busan with 3, and Gimpo, Gyeonggi
Province with 2.
