The [Sudan] Ministry of Health will launch a campaign against yellow fever in South, North, East, and Central Darfur states in addition to the White Nile, South and North Kordofan states, the Federal Minister of Health Bahr Idris Abu Garda announced on [Sun 30 Nov 2014].

He explained that the targeted regions have been selected according to epidemiological indicators, adding that the campaign will cover the whole country in the future.

Abu Garda expects that the armed factions in the targeted regions will allow access of vaccination to the citizens, adding that the accomplishment of the campaign will enhance cooperation between Sudan and international health organisations substantially.

Yellow fever, known historically as yellow jack or yellow plague, is an acute viral disease. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within 5 days. In some people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased.

The disease is caused by the yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of the female [_Aedes_] mosquito.

The total recorded cases of yellow fever in Greater Darfur hit 849 with a 20 per cent death toll [during an epidemic in 2012 -- see WHO Disease Outbreak News http://who.int/csr/don/2012_12_03/en as reported by ProMED post http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20130125.1513849. Mod.JW]

"Deaths caused by yellow fever in the region during the 2 recent decades have increased as a result of weakness of immunisation among residents of rural areas," said Abu Garda.

Representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Dr Naima al Qaseer said that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease, adding that yellow fever causes the death of 300 000 persons across the world annually.

[One wonders what the epidemiological indicators are to which the Minister of Heath refers. One can also not help but wonder if the yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign is a result of the undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic fever that have been occurring in several parts of the Sudan very recently. On 24 Oct 2014, 4 cases of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever were reported (see ProMED-mail archive no 20141028.2907268). The 5 Nov 2014 report indicated that there were 5 cases and an 11 Nov 2014 report indicated an increase to 25 cases (see ProMED-mail archive number 20141111.2946812). The most recent report indicated 30 cases including 19 fatalities in a different state in the same general area of Sudan. Cases have now been reported from South Darfur, West and North Kordofan, and most recently El Gezira.

Yellow fever is not new to the Sudan. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.

There was a large YF outbreak in the Darfur state in 2012-2013. In 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that over 840 people were infected with yellow fever in Darfur and that the epidemic affected 35 out of 64 localities in the region since September 2012.

ProMED-mail would be interested to know more about the epidemiological indicators that elicited the YF vaccination campaign, and if any YF cases have been confirmed in the country within the past 6 months. In any event, maintaining a high proportion of the country's population immune to YF is prudent, given the country's recent experience with the disease. - Mod.TY

Some online reports mistakenly wrote that the minister said there had been over 800 cases in the last 2 decades, when in fact that was the count for the last 2 years -- see WHO Disease Outbreak News http://who.int/csr/don/2012_12_03/en, also reported by ProMED in Yellow fever - Africa (06): Sudan (Darfur) 20130125.1513849.

Chad reported YF last year (2013) and there is an annual migration of nomads with their flocks & herds across the common border, so it is likely that YF occurs every year in that region spanning both countries. It is very important that vaccination go ahead in that strife-torn area.
