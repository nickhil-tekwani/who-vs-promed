Mysterious disease kills camels
-------------------------------
A mysterious disease is killing camels in large numbers and some of
these camels were prized ones which were raised and trained for
prestigious racing events, Al Sharq reported yesterday [18 May 2010]
quoting animal breeders.

"We don't know what disease it is, but it is killing our camels in
large numbers. An animal is dead within hours without showing any
signs of a disease," the daily quoted a camel breeder who owns a farm
as saying.

The breeder has urged the authorities to pay urgent attention and put
veterinarians in the field to keep a close track on the camels and
prevent the killer disease from spreading.

"For one of my camels which died, I was offered QR 50 000 [USD 13
741] barely a few days ago, but I refused to part with it," said the breeder.

[In 2007, mass camel mortality in neighbouring Saudi Arabia was
eventually found to have been caused by Salinomycin in fodder.
Salinomycin is an ionophoric coccidiostat which should not have been
included in camel feed.

Results of the current investigations, which -- while testing for
toxic substances, should also exclude potential infectious agents --
are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
