Influenza update - 384 (based on data up to 20 Dec 2020)
-------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
The current influenza surveillance data should be interpreted with caution as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has influenced to varying extents health seeking behaviours, staffing/routines in sentinel sites, as well as testing priorities and capacities in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.

Globally, despite continued or even increased testing for influenza in some countries, influenza activity remained at lower levels than expected for this time of the year.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained below inter-seasonal levels, though sporadic detections of influenza A and B viruses were reported in some countries.
- In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was reported at inter-seasonal level.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, no influenza detections were reported. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity, likely due to COVID-19, was elevated in some reporting countries.
- In tropical South America, there were no influenza detections in this reporting period.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported in Western Africa.
- In Southern Asia, sporadic influenza detections were reported in India.
- In South East Asia, influenza detections of predominately influenza A(H3N2) continued to be reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and Viet Nam.
Worldwide, influenza B detections accounted for the majority of the very low numbers of detections reported.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 75 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 7-20 Dec 2020 (data as of 2021-01-04 04:42:38 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 188 383 specimens during that period. A total of 379 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 141 (37.2%) were typed as influenza A and 238 (62.8%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 8 (13.6%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 51 (86.4%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, one (1.5%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 64 (98.5%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO encourages countries to continue routine influenza surveillance, test samples from influenza surveillance sites for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses where resources are available, and report epidemiological and laboratory information in a timely manner to established regional and global platforms.

Updated considerations for addressing disruptions in the influenza sentinel surveillance and extending to include COVID-19 wherever possible are available in the interim guidance: "Maintaining surveillance of influenza and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 - adapting Global Influenza surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and sentinel systems during the COVID-19 pandemic." Updated algorithms for testing of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 for surveillance are also included.

[It is important to enhance testing of the samples or a subset thereof for both SARS-CoV2 and influenza, as the influenza season is well underway, and seasonal surges are seen in most of the northern hemisphere around this time. The feasible and sustainable option could be to strengthen influenza testing in the sentinel surveillance networks in various countries so that disease transmission can be somewhat tracked and monitored. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Antiviral Drug Approved for Postexposure Flu Prevention
Date: 5 Jan 2021

The approved indication for baloxavir marboxil has been expanded to include postexposure influenza prevention for patients 12 years or older.

Marketed as Xofluza, the drug was approved in 2018 for patients 12 years or older with symptoms of uncomplicated influenza for 48 hours or less. The expanded indication allows its use after an individual has been in contact with someone who has the flu. Initially available only as a tablet, the drug now is formulated in granules that can be mixed in water.

The expanded indication "will provide an important option to help prevent influenza just in time for a flu season that is anticipated to be unlike any other because it will coincide with the coronavirus pandemic," Debra Birnkrant, MD, director of the FDA's Division of Antiviral Products, said in a statement.

Baloxavir marboxil was evaluated as postexposure prophylaxis in a phase 3 trial in Japan involving 607 participants 12 years or older who lived for 48 hours or longer with someone who had the flu. The participants had flu symptoms for 48 hours or less. Among the participants who were randomized to the treatment group, 1% developed laboratory-confirmed flu compared with 13% of participants in the placebo group.

Common adverse events associated with baloxavir marboxil include diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea, sinusitis, and headache. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur in patients who take the drug. It shouldn't be taken with dairy products, laxatives, or antacids.

[XOFLUZA (baloxavir marboxil) is an antiviral PA endonuclease inhibitor. Baloxavir marboxil helps to shorten the time that flu symptoms such as a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle or joint aches, tiredness, headache, fever, and chills last and may shorten the recovery time by 1-2 days.

Baloxavir was approved by the FDA in 2018 as a single dose daily treatment of acute uncomplicated flu within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing flu-related complications, and for post-exposure prophylaxis of flu in people 12 years and older. CDC does not recommend use of baloxavir in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, outpatients with complicated or progressive illness, severely immuno-suppressed people, or hospitalized patients because of the lack of information on use of baloxavir for these groups to date [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/baloxavir-marboxil.htm].

This expanded indication will allow its use after an individual has been in contact with someone who has a confirmed influenza infection. - Mod.UBA]
