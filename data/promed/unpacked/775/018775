Jury still out on vaccination policy to combat foot and mouth disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Brussels: The case for a vaccination policy as part of contingency planning
for future foot and mouth disease outbreaks is worth considering, but more
work on vaccines is needed, and the jury is still out on how effective such
a policy would be, a panel of leading animal health experts told the
Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease [chaired by Redondo Jimenez]
yesterday.
The crucial stumbling block was, the experts agreed, that there was still
no commercially available foolproof means of distinguishing between
vaccinated and infected animals. Several days are needed for immunity to
take effect. Vaccinated animals could, in theory, be carriers of FMD and
pass on the infection, although Dr Yves Leforban, from the Food and
Agriculture Organisation in Rome, thought that this possibility had been
over-stated.
Professor Fred Brown, an eminent virologist, called for the vaccines to be
perfected and evaluated. Dr Kris De Clercq, from the Belgian Ministry of
Public Health, advocated the development of mass virological screening as a
means of avoiding mass culling in future.The use of preventive vaccination
in Europe had reduced the numbers of outbreaks from hundreds of thousands
in the 1960s to a couple of thousand in the 1980s and 1990s but it had not
eradicated the disease. The policy was abandoned in 1991 for trade reasons
as importing countries were unwilling to take the political risk of
accepting imports of meat and dairy produce from vaccinated animals. Dr J
Pearson, from the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) stressed,
however, that OIE rules did not actually ban the exporting of products from
vaccinated animals. All the experts were adamant that there was no danger
to human health from consuming products from vaccinated animals.
Vaccination as part of an overall strategy to control a future outbreak
was, the panel said, a highly complex issue. Careful decisions would have
to be taken on the method of vaccination to be used, since each method --
e.g. suppressive vaccination, blanket vaccination, ring vaccination around
a source of infection or buffer vaccination to provide a protection zone --
had its advantages and disadvantages. Responding to questions from MEPs, Dr
Alex Donaldson, Head of Pirbright Laboratory at the Pirbright Institute for
Animal Health in England, said adequate stocks of vaccine would not have
been available at the beginning of the UK outbreak. Dr Tony Little,
Vice-President of the British Veterinary Association, pointed to
restrictions of livestock movements as the cornerstone of the UK's new
policy on controlling infectious animal diseases and highlighted illegal
meat imports as a key source of infection.
