Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University's (Virginia Tech)
equine medical center [in Leesburg, VA] and one farm in northern
Virginia are under a state-ordered quarantine because of a suspected
infection of the neurological form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1),
officials said Wed 21 Feb 2007.
The quarantines will restrict movement of horses at the Leesburg
center and the affected farm and is intended to limit the spread of
the disease.
EHV-1, one of several strains of the equine herpesvirus, is a highly
contagious disease that can affect the respiratory system. It is
spread from infected horses through nasal fluids and bodily
secretions. Symptoms include fever, coughing, nasal discharge, loss
of balance, urinary retention, and recumbency.
EHV-1 poses no known health threat to humans, the Virginia Department
of Agriculture said in statement.
The quarantine was based on 3 suspected cases of EHV-1 at the
Leesburg center. One of the animals is "strongly suspected" of having
EHV-1, Elaine Lidholm of the agriculture department said.
"Based on the clinical signs and one positive test from the 1st horse
with neurological signs, we are treating this as an infection with
EHV-1," said Dr. Nat White, director of the Marion duPont Scott
Equine Medical Center," and added "the health and safety of our
patients is our 1st priority."
Hospital officials expect the quarantine to last anywhere from 14 to 28 days.
Two horses that had contact with the infected Leesburg animals are at
a rehabilitation center in Maryland. "We're working with the Maryland
Department of Agriculture," Lidholm said.
The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center is owned by Virginia
Tech and operated as one of 3 campuses that comprise the
Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine.

[Equine herpesvirus is contagious and animals may be affected with a
neurological disease that may result in the animal being euthanized.
Consequently, this is of great concern to the clinic and they seem to
be taking precautions. - Mod.TG]
