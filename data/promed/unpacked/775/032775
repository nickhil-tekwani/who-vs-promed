Dengue fever is on the rise in the central and northern localities,
reports the Ministry of Health.

In Da Nang, about 600 people have been stricken with the
mosquito-borne disease so far this year [2010], 10 times higher than
for the 1st 3 months of last year [2009].

Almost 100 incidents of the disease had been reported in Ha Noi with
one fatality in Tan Minh Commune, Soc Son District, said the
Preventive Medicine Centre's Disease Control Department director, Le
Duc Tuyen. The centre was planning to prevent any spread of the
disease in communes, clinics, and schools through a cleanup of the
environment, and raising public awareness about the threat, the director said.

But [the Administration of Preventive Medicine and Environment, the
Ministry of Health] said that although 7300 incidents of dengue fever
were confirmed throughout Viet Nam to March [2010], the figure was 28
per cent less than for the same 3 months of last year [2009]. At
least 3 of those infected had died.

Clinical symptoms of the disease had changed, and patients needed to
have their blood tested to confirm infection, explained Da Nang
Preventive Health Centre director Ton That Thanh.

The national target programme for the prevention of dengue fever from
2006 to 2010 had been re-launched this year [2010], said the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology's Insect and Animal Department
head, Tran Vu Phong. Its focus would be to improve the skills of all
medical workers.

Stagnant water enables the mosquitoes to reproduce and develop and is
a major reason for the spread of the disease; people are encouraged
to clean around their dwellings and spray mosquito killer.

Viet Nam. - Mod.TY]

[According to the newswire above, there have been 7300 cases and 3
deaths of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) reported
in Viet Nam during 2010. As the period from May to October is the
rainy season in Viet Nam, it is likely that the number of dengue
cases will continue to rise in coming months.

As of 23 Nov 2009, more than 77 000 dengue fever cases were
identified in 33 out of 63 provinces and cities during January to
October 2009, with the number of cases increasing by 7.3 per cent
year-on-year and the number of deaths falling by over 11 per cent
(see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (18) 20091123.4018).

Summaries of the number of reported cases of dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) in the Western Pacific region by country
are available from WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific
(WHO/WPRO) at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>. As
per this report, there were 57 102 cases and 44 deaths of DF/DHF
reported in Viet Nam during 2009.

The Minister of Health, Hodhoaer Inzouddine, announced on Thursday
[25 Mar 2010] in a press conference in Moroni that 6 dengue cases
have been discovered in the Comoros. According to Dr. Goda, dengue is
dangerous only in its hematologic [sic; hemorrhagic] form. Dengue is
a viral disease known in the Comoros since the epidemic of 1948.
Following an increase in fevers recently in the Comoros, Hodhoaer
Inzouddine has sent blood samples to the Institute Pasteur
[laboratories] in Antananarivo, Madagascar for analysis.

Examination results of the tests of 17 blood samples were provided by
the Minister of Health at a press briefing on 25 Mar [2010]. The
results for the 17 samples indicate "6 cases confirmed positive for
dengue and 9 negatives, plus the 2 in which the tests cannot yet say
what it is exactly," said Hodhoaer Inzouddine.

Health authorities are now moving to review the data in order to give
an initial assessment of the disease and whether the archipelago is
actually subject to a dengue epidemic or [infection by the]
chikungunya [virus].

The Ministry of Health asked the Comoros population to protect
themselves against mosquitoes that are responsible for transmission
of the disease [virus] through the use of [insecticide] impregnated
mosquito [bed] nets. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health invites
people with symptoms such as fever and fatigue to go immediately to
the health center closest to their homes. It is inadvisable to use
drugs based on aspirin because of the risk onset of the hemorrhagic
form of the disease.

[This article did not specify the [dengue virus] serotypes
responsible for this epidemic. Dengue can be caused by 4 types of the
virus (1,2,3,4) and has been the cause of major epidemics. Population
growth, uncontrolled urbanization, natural disasters and
impoverishment are involved. The disease has a significant economic
impact for some countries. In all cases, a fast and accurate viral
diagnosis is useful to confirm etiology for both the management of
patients and for public health surveillance systems in order to
launch the alert and strengthen the capacity of the anti-vector
fight. No specific treatment or vaccines are available today, but
several multidisciplinary studies are underway. The only existing
measure is mosquito control in the areas of concern.

"Today, the mosquito is scattered throughout the entire city, which
intensifies the proliferation of the mosquito," said the city
Secretary of Health, Odilio Rodriguez. To date, dengue is now treated
as an epidemic in Santos, with 911 cases registered.

Dengue cases in the state of Sao Paulo have fallen 52 percent in
March [2010] compared to the previous month. According to the Sao
Paulo state Secretariat of Health, 8076 cases of the disease were
registered in the past month [March 2010] and 16 869 in February
2010. In January 2010, there were 9377 cases.

Ribeirao Preto was the municipality with the greatest number of
cases, followed by Sao Jose do Rio Preto, with 3414, Guaruja, with
2979, Sao Vicente, with 1877 and Aractuba, with 1667.

The Secretariat stated that the rains, together with elevated
temperatures, favored the proliferation of the disease [mosquito
vectors of the virus]. Because of this, he repeated the importance of
help by the population in the control of reproduction of the mosquito vector.

Among the actions carried out by the Secretariat to counter the
advance of the disease are the use of insecticides in 172
municipalities and advice and technical support in another 122 cities.

On this Thursday [1 Apr 2010], the Secretariat of Health of Ribeirao
Preto released an updated bulletin with the dengue cases in the city.
Living through the worst [dengue] epidemic in its history, the
municipality has now registered 7894 cases in 2010, 1897 more than
the 5997 registered in 2006, then the worst year for the disease. The
month of March 2010 has emerged as the champion for cases in the
history of Ribeirao Preto. With nearly 6000 cases (5932), the 31 days
of the month [of March 2010] overran the [capacity of] basic health
units and caused the population to worry even more about the problem.

According to the Division of Epidemiological Surveillance, the daily
mean number of confirmed cases reached 87.7. The municipal government
continues with various measures to contain the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, the vector of the disease [virus]. The greatest [public]
appeal is that people eliminate mosquito breeding sites and observe
sites of [mosquito breeding] risk, especially on rainy days.

[It is a pathetic effort in vain, like wanting to cover the sun with
a sieve, that in regions immersed in major epidemics, such as
Ribeirao Preto and Santos, the health authorities are playing with
words and numbers. Dengue is a serious public health problem in Sao
Paulo and in the rest of the country, and no breakthrough has
occurred with respect to its control, which reminds me of the
economist who drowned in a river whose average depth was 50 cm [17

Praia Grande is the 5th city of Baixada Santista to declare a dengue
epidemic [Baixada Santista is an official metropolitan area on the
coast of Sao Paulo state originally centered around the port city of
Santos. Its administrative center is Santos. - Mod.TY]. Now there are
379 confirmed cases of the disease in the city. Most of the patients
are between 20 and 59 years of age. Confirmation was given this
Wednesday [24 Mar 2010] by the Mayor, Roberto Francisco dos Santos.

Santos, Sao Vicente, Cubatao and Guaruja now have joined this
[epidemic] situation. The number of confirmed [dengue] cases in the
region is greater than 5000.

During a news conference, the mayor of Praia Grande announced some
actions to try to contain the disease. One is the suspension of all
surgical procedures in hospitals. The measure goes into effect from
this Wednesday [31 Mar 2010]. The city also reserved 20 beds in the
Irma Dulce Hospital for hospitalization of [dengue] patients.

Also, laboratory tests (serology) to detect the occurrence of the
disease are suspended. All patients who come to health units with the
basic symptoms of the disease, such as fever, nausea, headache and
generalized pain, will be treated as though they have dengue.

In Praia Grande, the problem has especially hit the neighborhoods of
Vila Tupy, Vila Caicara and Jardim Real. Many of these residences,
said the mayor, have swimming pools. "Quiet water becomes an
attraction for the vector mosquito. Because of this, they are making
contact with the Public Ministry. The 1st step is a conversation with
the Public Prosecutor and 2nd with the prefecture Judiciary
Department and with the city council to create a law to fine these
people. We are also preparing a considerable joint effort by Easter,
especially in neighborhoods that have vacation homes."

Before Praia Grande, last Thursday [25 Mar 2010] it was the turn of
the Municipality of San Vicente to officially recognize that the City
is facing a dengue epidemic. The latest data of Epidemiological
Surveillance indicate that the municipality had up to then 1844
confirmed cases of the disease. There were another 252 suspected
cases of the infection. Guaruja city was the 1st to officially
announce its 5th [dengue] epidemic since 1997. The announcement was
made on 12 Mar [2010], when the city then had 962 confirmed cases of
the disease. Santos was the 2nd city to confirm the scenario [of a
dengue outbreak]. With the results announced by the Instituto Adolfo
Lutz last Friday [26 Mar 2010], the city has surpassed the level
maintained for an outbreak situation: 163 confirmed cases per 100 000
population. As of last Friday, the municipality now had a total of
680 cases. On Wednesday afternoon [24 Mar 2010], Cubatao also
officially took on [the position] of an epidemic state. In just 4
days, the number of cases jumped from 162 to 189, according to the
figures announced by that municipality on Thursday [25 Mar 2010]. The
city awaits the confirmation of another 422 cases of the disease.
Bertioga had its 1st dengue death last Friday [26 Mar 2010]. With 147
confirmed cases and 65 blood tests awaiting results, the city is now
working at an epidemic rhythm, although technically, it is not at
that stage. If this [a dengue outbreak] is confirmed, it will be the
1st time in the history of the city. Since the beginning of the year
[2010], the disease has caused the deaths of 20 people in the Baixada
Santista. The deaths have been registered in Bertioga (1), Guaruja
(7), Santos (7) and Sao Vicente (5).

The number of dengue cases registered in the country up to 6 Mar
[2010] exceeds by 95 237 the total verified for the same period of
last year [2009]. According to the Ministry of Health, notifications
increased from 131 872 in the 1st 9 weeks of 2009 to 227 109 in the
same period of 2010. Of this total, 86.5 percent of the occurrences
were verified in the same states that registered the greatest number
of [dengue] cases last year [2009]: Rondonia, Mato Grosso do Sul,
Acre, Mato Grosso, Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, where this year
[2010] 184 574 cases were registered. But, according to the Ministry
[of Health] up to 6 Mar of this year [2010], there was a decrease of
23 percent in fatalities and 81.2 percent in severe cases in
comparison with the 1st 9 weeks of last year [2009]. According to
data published by the unit, more than 1/3rd (35.4 percent) of
[dengue] notifications this year are concentrated in 6
municipalities: Campo Grande, (19 417 cases), Goiania (28 445), Rio
Branco (10 368), Belo Horizonte (9143), Porto Velho (5656) and
Aparecida de Goiania (GO), with 5027.

At the beginning of 2009, Minas Gerais had a [dengue] incidence of 99
cases per 100 000 population, but this year [2010], the incidence
increased to 243.2. The Ministry of Health considers the incidence of
dengue in Sao Paulo low in relation to other states, because the
proportion recorded this year is 28.7 cases per 100 000 population,
although there have been increased reports in relation to last year [2009].

In the entire country, the cases of dengue with complications and DHF
sum to 394 in the 1st 9 weeks of 2010, compared to 2097 registered in
the same period of last year [2009]. The number of deaths dropped
from 85 in 2009 to 65 in 2010, in the 1st 9 weeks of each of these
years. Records of deaths and severe cases can suffer changes, the
ministry said, once the tests are subject to laboratory investigation.

The Ministry of Health attributed the increase in cases this year
[2010] to an increase in temperatures and of rain in the whole
country. Another factor noted was the increased circulation of dengue
virus serotype 1 (DEN-1), present with greater intensity in the
decade of the 90s, which returned to spread in some states at the end
of last year [2009]. Also circulating in the country are serotypes
DEN-2 and DEN-3 viruses. When a person contracts dengue from one of
these virus types, according to the Ministry of Health, he or she is
immune to just that one and could be newly infected by [dengue virus
of] another serotype. And when a patient is infected more than once
[with heterologous dengue viruses], the risk of developing more
serious infection is increased.

According to his office, the [Health] Minister, Jose Gomes, sent a
warning to governors of northeastern states and the mayors of the
capitals recommending intensified action to eliminate mosquito
breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_. He urged state and local
executives to join with other sectors that can help control the disease.

<http://www.diariolarepublica.com.ar/notix/noticia.php?i=167229>


In recent hours, the Ministry of Public Health confirmed 4 more cases
with symptoms suspicious [of dengue], and the number at the
provincial level climbed to 21. People with [dengue] symptoms were
detected in different neighborhoods of the capital, where an
[epidemiological] blockade was carried out with corresponding public
awareness campaigns.

Another of the conclusions that could be reached by Public Health
with the new suspicious cases is that the virus that circulates in
the province is [dengue virus] type 1, which is milder [The statement
that the DENV-1 virus currently circulating is less virulent is pure
speculation at this point. - Mod.TY]. Currently, the serological
samples from the potentially infected individuals are being tested at
the Instituto Maiztegui, in Buenos Aires province [The report
indicates that one case is likely imported from Paraguay, but 3
others had no recent travel history.].

Confronting this situation, the Office of the Director of
Epidemiology carried out visits to the homes of the patients to
gather epidemiological data, and to deliver [mosquito] repellents to
the families and alert them to the need to get a medical consultation
early in case of the appearance of symptoms compatible with the
disease. Moreover, fumigation was carried out in their houses and
neighboring homes in a radius of 9 blocks (according to the vector
blockade protocol), [done] together with municipal personnel for each
one of the cases.

Also, searches for febrile individuals were carried out in the entire
health cordoned [area], detecting retrospectively 3 suspected cases,
from which samples were taken in the field for [submission to] the
laboratory. All were negative [for dengue]. During these searches,
activities for [public] awareness and sensitivity about the disease
were carried out by health agents under coordination by CAPS [primary
health care centers] and physicians of the Office of Epidemiology and
family medicine belonging to the Hospital Escuela [Teaching
Hospital]. And an entomological survey was carried out with field
samples taken by municipal sanitary agents.

In the current situation, the circulation of [dengue] virus serotype
1 has been confirmed by the national reference laboratory "Julio
Maiztegui". Up to the present and since the notification of the 1st
case in the San Martin Neighborhood, 21 cases have been registered,
of which 16 are from the capital, 4 from Empedrado and one from
Esquina. Most of the cases are in San Martin.

Health authorities in Paraguay are worried about the number of people
with dengue in the country. With this concern, they insist today [1
Apr 2010] on preventive work to avoid this disease [virus] that is
transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. Through some press
media, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare stated the
importance of destroying the breeding sites of this vector.

They are alert about the possible spread of the epidemic after Holy
[Easter] Week, since may people customarily travel from the interior
of the country to the [international] borders and abroad.

Just in the capital, the Hospital Central of the Instituto de
Prevision Social registered more than 340 suspected dengue cases and
79 confirmed [cases].

In respect to this, the Epidemiology Department of the hospital
institution insists that the preventive measures for the disease must
be increased maximally.

In the country, the total number of confirmed dengue cases, from
November of last year [2009] up to March of this year [2010],
increased to 2511.
