WHO Director-General's opening remarks at media briefing
--------------------------------------------------------
In the Americas, which accounts for more than half of [monkeypox] reported cases, several countries continue to see increasing numbers of infections, although it is encouraging to see a sustained downward trend in Canada.

Some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, are also seeing a clear slowing of the outbreak, demonstrating the effectiveness of public health interventions and community engagement to track infections and prevent transmission.

These signs confirm what we have said consistently since the beginning: that with the right measures, this is an outbreak that can be stopped.

And in regions that do not have animal-to-human transmission, this is a virus that can be eliminated.

But it won't just happen. Eliminating monkeypox needs 3 things: the evidence that it's possible, which we are now beginning to see; political will and commitment; and the implementation of public health measures in the communities that need them most.

We might be "living with COVID-19" for the foreseeable future. But we don't have to live with monkeypox.

WHO will continue to support all countries to stop this outbreak and eliminate this virus.

[4] Sweden: persistent virus DNA
Date: October 2022
Source: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [abridged, edited]
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1107_article


ref: Pettke A, Fil√©n F, Widgren K, et al. Ten-week follow-up of monkeypox case-patient, Sweden, 2022. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
A previously healthy male patient had detectable monkeypox virus DNA in saliva 76 days after laboratory confirmation of infection. A comprehensive characterization of viral kinetics and a detailed follow-up indicated a declining risk for transmission during the weeks after monkeypox symptoms appeared.

Conclusions
-----------
This report highlights several aspects of monkeypox as an emerging infectious disease. 1st, the case manifested as a single genital lesion accompanied by enlarged local lymph nodes, leading to lymph node rupture. The appearance of localized genital lesions was consistent with recent reports from other countries in Europe and clearly demonstrated an alternative clinical manifestation of the strain of MPXV associated with the 2022 multinational outbreak, causing localized lesions rather than the classic generalized rash or vesicles spread over the body. Lymph node rupture is an unusual manifestation.

Second, we presented viral kinetics in different sample materials over time and show that, despite the localized lesion in this patient, viral DNA could also be found in urine, blood, and the respiratory tract. So far, this type of data has been published for a few cases within the current multinational outbreak, connected to sexual transmission of MPXV, but this finding is consistent with previous reports from classical monkeypox imported from Africa. The persistent detection of MPXV DNA in samples from semen and the respiratory tract in this case could have implications for transmissibility. Prolonged infectivity of bodily fluids such as semen has been described for viral infections like Zika and Ebola. However, knowledge gaps include whether a positive PCR result indicates the presence of live virus.

Third, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the Western Africa clade of monkeypox, which has been associated with lower mortality rates than the Central Africa clade. Consistent with this classification, the case-patient described had noncritical illness. Furthermore, the sequence showed a high degree of similarity to recently published MPXV sequences from Portugal and other countries.

Within the context of the emerging outbreak of monkeypox, we present comprehensive clinical and microbiologic data with long follow-up times revealing persistent PCR positivity. Previous reports have provided PCR data from single timepoints or short follow-up periods of <8 days. Moreover, we present a strategy for adequate sequencing, highlighting a fast but accurate bioinformatics analysis, combining long reads and short reads, that achieves a near-complete genome assembly (Appendix). This analysis will enable other researchers to reliably classify viruses' phylogenetic relationships, which will lead to rapid and accurate epidemiologic case tracing and phylogenetic network analyses at a relatively low cost.

[The authors of this report raise an epidemiologically critical question: did the presence of viral DNA indicate that infectious virus was present and in quantities sufficient to accomplish transmission? Perhaps this study will prompt future studies that will answer this question. Determining the time of isolation for infected individuals may turn on the answer to that question. - Mod.TY]
