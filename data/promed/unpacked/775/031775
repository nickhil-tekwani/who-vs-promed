A further 7 cases of African swine fever (ASF) have been confirmed in wild boar in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, Germany's federal agriculture ministry said on Monday [21 Sep 2020].

The new cases follow 13 others confirmed in wild boar, not farm animals, the ministry said. The new discoveries bring the total confirmed cases to 20 since the 1st one on 10 Sep 2020.

[A map showing the locations of the "outbreaks" (sites where infected wild boar carcasses were found), the boundaries of declared restriction zones, and the measures applied in them, have been published in the official website of the Brandenburg state, at https://msgiv.brandenburg.de/msgiv/de/themen/verbraucherschutz/veterinaerwesen/tierseuchen/afrikanische-schweinepest/.

The indicated restriction zones are:
1. Core zone (within the orange boundary line); at least 3 km (1.2 mi) from where the infected wild boar carcass was found. The core zone currently has a circumference of around 60 km (37 mi) and encloses an area of around 150 square km (60 sq mi). It is fenced in with mobile electric pasture fences. Entering the forest and open countryside is prohibited (exceptions granted in individual cases).

2. Endangered zone (within the violet boundary line); radius of around 20 to 25 km (12.4 to 15.5 mi) around the locations where the infected wild boar carcasses were found. Separate requirements apply to hunters, pig farmers, and the general public.

3. Buffer zone (within the green boundary line). The measures applicable in the buffer zone are addressed separately to hunters and pig farmers.

Every wild boar found dead must be reported to the veterinary office, stating where it was found (GPS data). The identification, sampling, recovery, and safe disposal are to be carried out exclusively by trained and authorized personnel (obligation to notify fallen game). - Mod.AS
