Unknown disease kills 3 children in Sylhet Division
---------------------------------------------------
At least 3 children died of a mysterious disease in Jointapur upazila
[sub district] on Wednesday and Thursday [30, 31 Dec 2009], and 7 more
children were also afflicted with the disease. The outbreak of the
disease has scared the people of the upazila. [Administratively there
are 6 divisions in Bangladesh, subdivided into 64 districts (zila).
The zilas are each further subdivided into upazilas (sub districts) -
Mod.CP]

The deceased were identified as a 10-year-old boy, a 2-month old boy
both of Bandharhati village, and a10-month-old girl of Gordona village
in Jointapur upazila.

Family sources said the 10-year-old boy was admitted to the Upazila
Heath Complex with diarrhoea and respiratory problems on Wednesday [30
Dec 2009]. He died at the hospital after some time.

The 2 10-month-old children died at Sylhet Osmani Medical College
Hospital (SOMCH) on Thursday [31 Dec 2009]. The others being attacked
by the unknown disease are being treated at the SOMCH.

Dr Jannatun Noor, medical officer of local health complex, said the
patients become unconscious due to diarrhoea and respiratory problems.
"Respiratory problem with diarrhoea is quite unusual," she said.

[The description of the undiagnosed illness is too brief to allow a
definitive assessment, but the combination of respiratory problems,
diarrhoea, and young age in the case of the deceased children is
suggestive of (severe) measles virus infection. Information on the
vaccination status of the local population and an account of the
symptoms of the hospitalised children would be welcomed.
