Pig disease spreads again
-------------------------
The blue ear pig disease has spread to 3 newly-hit central provinces,
raising the total number of provinces affected by the disease to 10, a
health agency announced on Monday [14 Jul 2008]. More than 3500 infected
pigs must be destroyed in the 3 provinces of Quang Tri, Binh Dinh, and Phu
Yen, the Animal Health Department said.

Local health agencies said more than 3400 pigs were infected with blue ear
disease, also known as the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS), in Quang Tri alone. But the real number is surely higher as Hai
Lang district residents had already sold thousands of their infected pigs
to the market 2-3 weeks before local heath departments discovered the outbreak.

Nguyen Chi Phi, a representative from the Dien Khanh Cooperative, a
farmer's co-op in Hai Lang District, said thousands of pigs from the
cooperative's 400 household farms had begun suffering from high fevers,
appetite loss, and bleeding about a month ago. Some of them died and were
buried while others were sold for sick pig prices between VND 12 000 (USD
0.7) and VND 20 000 (USD 1.2) per kilogram, he said.

Le Quang Minh, head of Don Que Village, said he had reported the disease to
the Hai Lang District Health Animal Department and suggested that infected
pigs be destroyed shortly after the symptoms begin. But Dao Van An, the
department's head, said the pigs had pasteurellosis and that this was a
"normal" disease.

The district's animal health agencies only announced the outbreak last
Sunday [13 Jul 2008] after the National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology confirmed the presence of the Lelystad virus in local pigs.
The institute had been sent samples from infected pigs by the district
department. The government gives farmers VND 25 000 (USD 1.5) per kilogram
in compensation for the pigs that must be destroyed due to the virus.

In the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, which supplies pigs to
neighboring Ho Chi Minh City and Dong Nai Province, the disease is still a
problem. While the disease is spreading to more areas, many pig dealers
have persuaded farmers to sell infected pigs to them at VND 27 000 per
kilogram, slightly higher than the government compensation.

They also spread rumors that in order to receive the support, pig breeders
have to pay disinfectant costs, said the Ba Ria-Vung Tau Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development. The provincial department has required
district-level People's Committees to strictly inspect local
slaughterhouses for infected animals.

The blue ear pig disease causes appetite loss, high fever, premature birth,
miscarriage, respiratory problems, and death in extreme cases. The 10
affected provinces are, from north to south, Lao Cai, Quang Ninh, Quang
Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Vinh Long, Soc
Trang and Bac Lieu. [See map at:

[Following the recent PRRS outbreaks, the Vietnamese Ministry of
Agriculture has issued regulations on the control and prevention of PRRS.
The regulations focus on the control and prevention of PRRS, stressing on
the supervision and early discovery of the epidemic, and a tightened
control of slaughtering and transportation of pigs and pork products. They
are applicable to all State agencies, Vietnamese and foreign individuals
and organisations, specialising in the raising, slaughtering and
transportation of pigs on the Vietnamese territories. (Source

On 23 Feb 2008, Viet Nam submitted to the OIE its 4th and final report on
PRRS, including a map showing the country-wide disseminated outbreaks; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6831>
and posting 20080507.1562. According to the report, "the event is unlikely
to be contained and is now considered to be endemic. No more follow-up
reports will be made, but instead, information about this disease will be
included in the future six-monthly reports." - Mod.AS]
