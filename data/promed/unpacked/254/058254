Statement by USDA Chief Veterinarian John Clifford
-----------------------------------------------
"DNA test results have confirmed that we have identified the source
herd of the animal determined last week [4th week June 2005] to be
positive for BSE. Based on information we have received from the
owner, the cow was born and raised in a herd in Texas and was
approximately 12 years old. It was sent to a 3D/4D pet food plant in
Texas and was selected for sampling on arrival.

The source herd is now under a hold order as we identify animals of
interest within the herd. Consistent with OIE guidelines, animals of
interest would include any other animals that were born the same year
as this animal, as well as any born the year before and the year
after. If the age of the animal cannot be pinpointed, then we may
expand our inquiry to include all animals in this herd before the
feed ban went into place in 1997. We are also interested in any of
this animal's offspring that were born in the last 2 years.

Experience worldwide has shown that it is highly unusual to find BSE
in more than one animal in a herd or in an affected animal's
offspring. Nevertheless, all animals of interest will be tested for
BSE.

We are also working with the Food and Drug Administration in an
effort to determine the feed history in this herd. Given the animal's
age, we believe it was most likely infected by consuming feed prior
to the implementation of the ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban of 1997.

I emphasize that this animal did not enter the human food chain. The
plant at which this animal was sampled is a 3D/4D pet food plant that
does not handle animals for human consumption and, in this case, did
not use the animal in the production of pet food. The animal remains
were incinerated.

The testing and traceback efforts may yield further information as to
how this animal became infected. The safety of our food supply is not
in question. I am very confident that our interlocking safeguards are
effective, and this case is evidence of that. USDA bans
non-ambulatory cattle from the food supply. USDA bans animal parts
that could carry BSE from the food supply. USDA bans slaughter
techniques that could introduce BSE into the food supply. These
safeguards ensure that American beef is among the safest in the
world."
