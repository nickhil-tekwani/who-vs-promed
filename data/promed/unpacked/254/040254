A 15-year old boy suspected to be suffering from Japanese
encephalitis [virus] infection has been admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit of Shija Hospital and Research Institute. According to
information received from the hospital, the patient is a resident of
Lilong Arapti and he was admitted to the hospital on 28 Jun [2011]. To
confirm the case, samples have been sent for test outside Manipur.

Meanwhile, a team of officials from the State Health Department today
visited the hospital and collected a relevant report on the case.

On the other hand, taking serious note over the admission of a
patient suffering from a suspected case of Japanese encephalitis [JE]
and in view of the onset of the rainy season, the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare as well as the Director of the National Vector
Borne Control Programme has reportedly issued necessary instructions
to the Health Department to take the necessary precautionary measures
against outbreaks of vector borne diseases.

[The report does not provide any indication of the basis for
suspecting JE virus infection in this case. However, India is endemic
for JE virus and this is the beginning of the transmission season. No
mention is made regarding the JE virus vaccination status of this
youth, nor specifically if there were plans to carry out vaccination
in this area as part of the precautionary measures called for by the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. ProMED would appreciate
receiving additional information with laboratory results as it becomes
available.
