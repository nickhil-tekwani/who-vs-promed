18 children die of hand-foot-mouth disease in China
---------------------------------------------------
Hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] has claimed the lives of 18 Chinese
children so far this year [2009], as the disease has spread across
the country, the Ministry of Health said Friday [27 Mar 2009]. The
ministry recorded 41 846 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in 30
provinces and regions, excluding Tibet, in the past 3 months,
ministry spokesman Deng Haihua said.

About 94 percent of the patients were children under 5 years old, 75
percent were affected by the virus EV71 [enterovirus 71], and 94
suffered severe symptoms, Deng told a press conference in Beijing. He
said the number of the hand-foot-mouth cases was still increasing,
and would reach its peak from May to July [2009].

The disease had spread to a wider area, mainly in rural areas, Deng
said, adding that a fifth of the cases reported this year [2009] were
in Henan and Shandong provinces.

[This statement from the Chinese Ministry of Health confirms the
extent and severity of the outbreak of hand foot & mouth disease in
China, and identifies enterovirus 71 as the predominant agent
involved. Enteroviruses infecting humans are found worldwide and
humans are the only known natural hosts. Young children are most
susceptible to infection. In less developed areas, children may
become infected during early infancy, while in more socio-economically
advanced areas, 1st infection may not occur until adolescence. Males
more often develop clinically recognizable diseases than females.
Transmission is usually faeco-oral, or by the respiratory route
when there is an associated respiratory illness.

Enterovirus 71 (family _Picornaviridae_, genus _Enterovirus_, species
_Human enterovirus A_) was first isolated in 1969. Since then it has
been associated with sporadic outbreaks in various parts of the
world, including China, Brazil, Europe, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan,
and the USA. Enterovirus 71 infection may present itself much like
other enterovirus infections, with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic
to the presentation of rashes, diarrhea, colds, meningitis,
encephalitis, hand foot & mouth disease, myocarditis, or some
combination of these syndromes. On the other hand, enterovirus 71 may
cause many unusual syndromes such as acute flaccid paralysis (similar
to paralytic poliomyelitis), bulbar and brain encephalitis,
Guillain-Barre syndrome, and rapidly fatal pulmonary edema and
hemorrhage.

The epidemiological pattern varies by geographical region and
climate, but the incidence of infection is higher in the summer and
autumn months in temperate climates, while remaining prevalent
year-round in tropical climates (for more information see
