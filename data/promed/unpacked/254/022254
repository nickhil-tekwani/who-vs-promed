China tainted pork makes 70 sick
--------------------------------
At least 70 people have fallen ill in China after eating pork
products contaminated with an illegal animal feed additive, state
media report.

The victims were treated for stomachache and diarrhea in Guangdong
province, according to the China Daily. Three people remain in
hospital.

The tainted pig organs contained the drug clenbuterol, which is used
to prevent animals gaining fat.

It is the latest in a series of food poisoning cases in China.

Officials in the southern province are quoted as saying 3 people have
been detained on suspicion of involvement in raising and selling the
contaminated pigs.

The pork was brought last week [week of 16 Feb 2009] from markets in
Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, and came from farms
in the neighboring Hunan province, according to the report.

Clenbuterol is banned as a food additive because it can be fatal for
humans. The drug is given to treat asthma and has been used illegally
by athletes to build muscle.

The BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai says it seems a lack of proper
safety enforcement has again allowed contaminated pork into China's
food chain.

In 2006, more than 300 people fell ill in Shanghai after eating pig
meat or organs that had been contaminated in a similar fashion.

Meanwhile, milk contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine
was last year [2008] blamed for the death of 6 children and making
some 300 000 sick.

Two people were sentenced to death for their involvement in the
contamination. The former boss of the dairy at the centre of the milk
scandal was imprisoned for life.

Our correspondent says ensuring food safety is difficult in a country
where many small-scale operations are struggling to deal with rising
costs and tempted to cut corners.

[Clenbuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug with some anabolic
effects. It appears to redirect metabolism from fat to muscle. The
drug is approved for veterinary use as a bronchodilator in horses. In
humans, it is used as a weight loss drug. When the drug is used in
animals and humans ingest liver or muscle containing the drug, they
may experience an increase in heart rate, nervousness, headache,
muscular tremor, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills,
typically resolving within 2 to 6 days. As a result of such
consequences in humans, the United States and Europe actively monitor
urine and tissue samples from livestock for the presence of
clenbuterol.

Clearly the government is interested in getting to the root of the
problem, as evidenced by 3 people being detained. However, this
article does not indicate any type of tracking mechanism regarding
animals entering the human food chain.

Of note, a similar incident occurred in Hong Kong in 1998 involving 9
people eating pork lungs found to have concentrations of clenbuterol
ranging between one and 24 micrograms per kilogram (see ProMED-mail
