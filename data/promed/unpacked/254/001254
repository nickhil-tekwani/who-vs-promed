Small pox reported in Bududa camps
--------------------------------
Four children in Internally Displaced People's camps in Bududa
District, reportedly suffering from small pox, have been taken to
Bukigai and Bulucheke Health Centres III and II, respectively.

Ms Kevin Nabutuwa, Uganda Red Cross' regional programme officer for
eastern Uganda, said last evening that the infections were registered
on Monday and Tuesday.

Spread contained
"These are cases in the IDP camps but the spread has been contained,"
she said by phone.

In Kampala, Dr Richard Nduhuura, the state minister for Health
(general duties), said he is "unaware" of the outbreak of the disease
that scientists say can kill three out of every 10 infected persons.

He referred this newspaper to the acting Director General of Health
Services, Dr Kenya Mugisha, who was unavailable for comment

Information posted on the World Health Organisation website indicates
that small pox, an ancient communicable disease infamous for killing
Queen Mary II of England, is transmitted mainly through infected
aerosols and air droplets.

"The frequency of infection is highest after face-to-face contact
with a patient," says WHO. Symptoms include fever, headache, and
back/abdominal pangs. Survivors usually remain with deep-pitted scars
(pockmarks), most prominently on the face.

[Natural infection with smallpox (Variola major) having been
eliminated, our past experience with these types of reports usually
reveals an outbreak of chickenpox, molluscum, or rarely true pox
virus infections such as monkeypox Of course, the possibility of
intentional or accidental release of variola is always of extreme
concern. More information is urgently requested from those with
firsthand knowledge of the situation.
