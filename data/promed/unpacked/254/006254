Pet owners have been warned about a disease which has killed 16 dogs in the past year. Posters are being placed in the Hampshire after 9 cases in the area, with another 7 dogs being affected in other parts of the country including Cornwall, Surrey, Worcestershire, and County Durham.

The symptoms suffered by the dogs are lesions on the lower legs followed by kidney failure between 2 and 7 days later.

Vet David Walker said that the deaths have similarities to a disease called Alabama rot, which was 1st reported in the United States in the 1980s [see commentary]. He said the cause of this disease is toxins from the _E. coli_ bacteria, but this had not yet been traced in the UK.

Mr Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists in Hursley, near Winchester, told the BBC: "The owners are taking dogs to the vets, then the signs of kidney failure develop 2 to 7 days later. The advice I would give to the pet-owning general public is if you see a wound on your dog's leg, where you might ordinarily leave that for 12 to 24 hours, the advice would be to take your dog to the vet. Most vets are now aware of the condition, so seek early veterinary attention."

A Forestry Commission spokesman said that the cause of the deaths had not yet been confirmed and added that signs had been put up to advise dog owners to look out for the symptoms.

He said: "There have been a few as yet unexplained incidents in the New Forest, and the Forestry Commission is working closely with vets and putting up notices to inform the public. Owners should always keep their dogs under close control and be aware of anything they may pick up, chew, or eat in a woodland area. If their dog becomes ill, they should contact a vet as soon as possible with as much information as they can."

The sign states: "Between December 2012 and April 2013, a spate of dog deaths in the New Forest prompted an investigation into the mystery dog illness. A further 6 cases were also confirmed outside of the New Forest around the UK. Despite extensive testing, the exact underlying cause remains unknown. Unfortunately, a further 2 cases have been confirmed in January 2014, one dog having been walked in this area. Dog owners are advised to look out for wounds or lesions on the limbs or face of their dog which will not heal. Affected dogs then go on to develop signs of severe depression, loss of appetite, and vomiting, quickly accompanied by acute injury to the kidneys. The reported cases represent an extremely small proportion of the many hundreds of dogs that are exercised in the New Forest every day, and it is likely that this syndrome is extremely rare."

["Alabama rot," mentioned above as resembling the New Forest syndrome in dogs, was coined in the US as "idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy of greyhounds," a "potentially fatal disease of unknown etiology that affects the skin and kidneys of racing- and training-age Greyhounds." (Ref. 1). The 3 main, typical findings were:
1. characteristic, well-demarcated cutaneous ulcers of the extremities,
2. thrombocytopenia (higher than 200 000 plateletddl) and
3. acute renal insufficiency (BUN higher than 40 mg/dl, serum creatinine higher than 2.0 mg/dl).

It was later suggested (Ref. 2) that the syndrome could have been attributed to Shiga toxin ("racing greyhounds are fed raw meat from rendering plants which commonly contains pathogenic _E. coli_").

It is yet to be investigated whether there is any relevance between the recorded US observations in greyhounds and the syndrome recently reported from New Forest.

Another syndrome in UK canines, "seasonal canine illness (SCI)," has been reportedly occurring between August and November, mainly in woodlands in Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, and Suffolk, in recent years. SCI affected dogs of any size, shape, or sex, causing them to become very ill, very quickly after being walked in woodlands. The most common clinical signs were sickness, diarrhoea, and lethargy. Investigation of SCI has been undertaken by the Animal Health Trust (AHT) since September 2010. Additional information (updated October 2013) is available at http://www.aht.org.uk/cms-display/seasonal_illness.html.

Any new information on the newly recognised syndrome resembling "idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy" in the UK, will be appreciated.
