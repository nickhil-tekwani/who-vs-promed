Affected population: Feline living with a person with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, analysed as part of research carried out within projects funded by the National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, under the aegis of the MINCyT-Agencia-CONICET Coronavirus Unit. This project carries out the diagnosis of pets living with people affected with COVID-19. These samples were particularly analysed by the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of La Plata.

Outbreak location 2: City of Santiago del Estero. House 2, Capital, Santiago Del Estero
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Oct 2020
Outbreak status: resolved 16 Nov 2020

Affected population: These samples were taken as part of research conducted within projects funded by the National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, under the aegis of the Coronavirus Unit of MINCyT-Agencia-CONICET. This project carries out the diagnosis of pets living with people affected by COVID 19. These samples were particularly analysed by the Centre for Molecular and Metabolic Analysis, the provincial reference laboratory for respiratory viruses and COVID-19 of the Ministry of Health in Santiago del Estero. Samples were taken from animals in 3 houses in the provincial capital where people were diagnosed positive for COVID-19. The outbreaks are not linked to each other. House 2: one dog positive to SARS-CoV-2 detection living with 2 other dogs.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Probably contact with human case
Epidemiological comments: Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were taken, and serum was collected. Of the 7 animals tested, 6 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 using the qRT-PCR test for the ORF, RdRP, E, and N genes using the commercial kit GeneFinder COVID-19 PLUSRealAmp Kit, which amplifies the genomic regions corresponding to the E, RdRP, and N genes using BioRad's CFX-96 Real Time thermocycler equipment. Three animals showed symptoms: a cat from Santiago del Estero (weakening and anorexia for 12-24 hours), a cat from La Plata (sneezing and nasal secretions), and one of the dogs from Santiago del Estero (conjunctivitis, cough, dyspnea, and weakening). The rest of the animals were asymptomatic.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 reports being in contact with companion or other animals.

"If a decision is made, as a result of a risk assessment, to test a companion animal which has had close contact with a person/owner infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal, and/or fecal/rectal samples. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of specimens from the environment or by humans.

"Animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be kept away from unexposed susceptible animals and contact with those animals should be avoided."
