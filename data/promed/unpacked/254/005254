The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported a new hantavirus case in a male in his 40s with no travel history.

The case was bitten by a rat on 25 Jul [2021] and returned home after seeking medical treatment on the same day. On 26 Jul [2021], he saw a doctor again and was admitted to the hospital with a fever.

The diagnosis of hantavirus was confirmed. The case has since been discharged from the hospital.

According to statistics from the Department of Disease Control, as of 12 Aug this year [2021], there have been 8 cases of hantavirus syndrome in Taiwan -- 4 cases in Kaohsiung City and 1 case each in Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taichung City, and Changhua County -- which is higher than the same period from 2017 to 2020 (0, 1, 1, and 7 cases, respectively).

According to the Department of Disease Control and Prevention, hantavirus hemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic disease. Humans are at risk of infection if they breathe in or come into contact with dust and objects contaminated with mouse feces and urine, or are bitten by rodents carrying the virus. The post-incubation period is several days to 2 months. The main symptoms are sudden and persistent fever, conjunctival congestion, weakness, back pain, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, etc. Bleeding symptoms appear on the 3rd to 6th day, followed by proteinuria, hypotension or oliguria; some patients will experience shock or mild nephropathy and may progress to acute renal failure. The condition can be improved after treatment.

[This case is somewhat unusual in that transmission occurred by rodent bite and the bitten man was hospitalized with a fever the following day. As noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there have been 0-7 cases per year recently. The case above brings this year's (2021) total to 8 cases.

The hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rodent identified. However, the rat bite leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rat involved was a brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in Asia. People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur via rat bite as apparently occurred in the above case.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
