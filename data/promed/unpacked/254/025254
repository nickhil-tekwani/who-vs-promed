ABC Action News has confirmed that there was a death in Sarasota County [from _Vibrio vulnificus_]. The Sarasota Health Department apologized for not reporting it sooner.

New warnings issued [Mon 28 Jul 2014], surrounding a bacterium found in the ocean that has already killed several people in Florida. It is called _Vibrio vulnificus_, a cousin of the bacterium that causes cholera and it thrives in warm saltwater. "Since it is naturally found in warm marine waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to _V. vulnificus_ through direct contact with seawater," the Florida Department of Health said in a statement.

The Florida Department of Health reports 32 people have contracted the bacteria and 10 have died from the strain. In 2013, 41 people were infected and 11 died. Florida isn't the only state to report _V. vulnificus_ infections. Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi have also recorded cases.

"It's quite discouraging because the beach is one of the more popular hobbies in Florida," said Tracy Brown of West Palm Beach. Brown, who was enjoying a day at the beach with her daughter, had not really heard about the _Vibrio_ bacterium. She was stunned to hear someone could become sick by simply entering the water. "The last thing you want to think about is going to the beach and leaving with something you least expect," said Brown.

Florida Department of Health experts said anyone with a compromised immune system or anyone with an open cut should not go into the water. Those who do jump into the ocean should wash off before heading home. "It's definitely something to take serious, but there are a number of other bacteria, that you could run into," said Tim O'Connor, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health.

O'Connor said the state is closely monitoring the _Vibrio_ bacteria. So far, he said the situation is not severe. "It's definitely something we need to be more wary of especially if it's going to affect us sooner than later, it needs to be known," said Brown.

The deadly bacterium can also be contracted from consuming raw seafood like oysters.

The owner of the local Cod and Cappers Fish Market, is all too familiar with the impact that _Vibrio_ can have on someone, he survived it. "It was like you were on fire. Like a burn-blister from a fire. It was weeks before I could walk on that leg," he said. On a scuba diving trip to the Bahamas, he contracted the infection through a blister on his left foot. "You could just watch the red, blistery skin just grow and expand and move up your leg," he said.

But he also sells an item at his market that the state health department warns is a leading cause of contracting the _Vibrio_ bacteria, raw oysters. "If we eat raw foods, there's always a risk, absolutely there's a risk," he said. He posts warning all over his store and suggests people who are worried should buy oysters from cooler climates to the north. The state health department said it is monitoring the situation and is telling consumers to cook their oysters before eating the shellfish.

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
