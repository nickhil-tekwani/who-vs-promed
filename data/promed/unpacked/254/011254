[This becomes the 3rd country in Southern Africa to report RVF in animals,
with only South Africa reporting human cases. It is not entirely surprising
that the cases are occurring just across the border from the North West
Province of South Africa, where there have been cases during the recent
outbreak. For the location of the outbreak see the map on the OIE WAHID
website referenced above or Healthmap <http://healthmap.org/r/01Cj>.

The chances of disease spread will be reduced with the onset of winter. The
epidemic is winding down in South Africa, with the last case in the latest
OIE WAHID update report being given a date of onset of 9 Jun 2010. The
current Botswana report also highlights the difference between the number
of animals susceptible in an extensive grazing system, which are given in
the report as the number of susceptible animals -- that is, 300 cattle, 400
goats, and 120 sheep and the number of animals directly associated with the
herd whose animals are showing clinical signs -- that is, abortion. The
affected herd only numbers 9 cattle and 4 goats but in this extensive
system, the clinical herd must share grazing pastures with a large number
of susceptible cattle, sheep and goats. - Mod.PC]
