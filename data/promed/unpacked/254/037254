The Sea squirt, _Halocynthia rorentzi_, is commercially cultured in the
southern coast of Korea. Due to an unidentified disease, large numbers of
sea squirts in the farming areas died this summer and the industry is now
in bad shape. Water temperature during last summer was abnormally high due
to the El Nino. The dying sea squirts usually exhibited thinning of the
skin and the meat become quite soft and dissolving.
We do not know the agents involved in this disease and anybody has any
information on Sea Squirt disease, please help us.
