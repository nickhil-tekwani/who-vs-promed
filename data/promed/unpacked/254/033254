The press service of the regional Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] says that an outbreak of avian influenza has been detected in the Remontnensky district of Rostovskaya oblast [Rostov region].

"The genome of the influenza A virus of the H5 subtype has been identified in samples collected on 17 Nov 2017 from carcasses of chickens found in an unauthorized landfill, located 1.5 km (1 mile) north east of the village of Remontnoye," the agency explains. "Currently, export of poultry from the affected region has been banned. Road blocks and 2 veterinary and police posts have been placed at the exits from the village," the press service of the Veterinary Department of the region adds.

A map showing the location of the village of Remontnoye, in the extreme south east of Remontnensky district, Rostov region, is available at https://goo.gl/maps/jgCNdP65GZS2.

Most likely, the virus strain involved is HPAI H5N8. This may be assumed from Russia's most recent follow-up report, no 22, submitted to the OIE on 23 Oct 2017, informing about a new outbreak of HPAI H5N8 within the event which started in Russia in December 2016. The new outbreak started on 20 Oct 2017, in the village of Chertkovskaya, Morozovsky district, Rostov region. For the full report, accompanied by an interactive map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=25084.

The report includes the following epidemiological comments: "The comparative analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequence of the H gene fragment revealed that the isolates belong to an Asian genetic lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza (lineage A/Gs/Guangdong/96, Clade 2.3.4.4.). Based on the H gene fragment the avian influenza A virus (H5) sequences were isolated in several RF [Russian Federation] Subjects in 2016-2017. And the avian influenza A virus (H5) sequences were isolated in South East Asia in 2013-2014, as well as in Europe and Iran in 2017."

No new HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were recorded in Russia between 18 May and 3 Aug 2017, when the virus renewed its activity, initially in the Moskovskaya oblast (Moscow region). The next new outbreak is the one mentioned above, in the village of Morozovsky. All reports since December 2016 and a cumulative map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000025084_20171023_173832.pdf. - Mod.AS]
