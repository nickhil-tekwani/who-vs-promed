First Report of Soybean Stem Canker Caused by _Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var.

-----------------------------------
First Report of Soybean Stem Canker Caused by _Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var.
_caulivora_ in Argentina. R. N. Pioli, Fitopatologia; E. N. Morandi,
Fisiologia Vegetal; and V. Bisaro, Estadistica, Facultad de Ciencias
Agrarias, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, P.O. Box 14, 2123 Zavalla, Santa
Fe, Argentina. Plant Dis. D-2000-1026-01N, 2000 (on-line). Accepted for
publication 3 October 2000.
A soybean stem canker (SSC) outbreak caused by _Diaporthe phaseolorum_
(Cooke & Ellis) Sacc. var. _meridionalis_ Fernandez [DPM] was reported in
Santa Fe, Argentina, in 1997 (3). In 1999 an isolate, which was
morphologically distinct from DPM, was obtained from stems of field-grown
soybean plants exhibiting SSC symptoms, at Oliveros, Santa Fe, Argentina
(Lat. 32 degrees 33 minutes S, Lon. 60 degrees 51 minutes W). Disease
incidence was 76% in the field where samples were collected.
The pathogen was isolated in darkness at 25 degrees C on potato-glucose
agar acidified with 0.2% lactic acid (3). The isolate produced white
colonies with compact and tufted mycelium that changed to yellow and light
tan with age. Stromata and pycnidia were not produced. After 35 days in
culture, clustered perithecia were frequently observed on stem segments.
[50] asci, [5] from each of 10 perithecia, and bicellular, biguttulated
ascospores were measured. Ascus mean length was 26.9 plus/minus 2.5
micrometers and width was 5.3 plus/minus 0.5 micrometers; ascospore mean
length was 8.3 plus/minus 0.6 micrometers and width was 2.6 plus/minus 0.1
micrometers. Based on these features, the new isolate was classified as _D.
phaseolorum_ var. _caulivora_ Athou & Caldwell [DPC] (1).
To further compare the new isolate with previous[ly] identified ones, a
principal component analysis (PCA, SAS Systems) was performed using 7
isolates of DPM, 3 isolates of _D. phaseolorum_var. _sojae_ [DPS], and 2
isolates of _Phomopsis longicolla_ [PL]. 17 morphological characters, all
related with the color and texture of colonies, presence and shape of the
pycnidia and conidia, presence and type of stromata and perithecia, and
length of asci, were compared. According to the PCA analysis, the principal
characters that discriminated SSC producing isolates (DPM and DPC) from
non-SSC producing ones (DPS and PL) were the development of perithecia (r =
0.98) and low frequency stromata (r = 0.98) in DPM and DPC isolates. The
principal components that discriminated SSC producing isolates were the
more compact and tufted aspect of mycelia (r = 0.95) and the shorter length
of asci (r = 0.83) in DPC compared with DPM.
Pathogenicity trials were performed under greenhouse conditions by
inoculating DPC mycelia in hypocotyls of soybean seedlings by the toothpick
method (2). Typical SSC symptoms were observed on susceptible plants and
the pathogen was re-isolated and identified from stem portions of the first
internode above the inoculation point. Pathogenicity trials were repeated
twice with similar results. This is the first report of DPC in Argentina
and, as far as we know, in all of South America.

[The taxonomy of these species appears to be complex. Further work by
Zhang and colleagues at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
Istituto Sperimentale per la Patologia Vegetale, Rome, and the USDA, ARS,
Urbana, IL indicate that PL is an individual species, DPC and DPM are
varieties of _D. phaseolorum_, and that DPS is either [a mixture of ]
several varieties of _D. phaseolorum_ or possibly several distinct species.
A consortium of 8 research teams from principal soybean producing countries
(Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Italy, USA) reported
in 1997 that the major soybean diseases in 1994 were those induced by a
nematode (_Heterodora glycines_) followed by soybean stem canker
(_Diaporthe_ spp. and PL), brown spot (_Septoria glycines_) and charcoal
rot (_Macrophomina phaseolina_). The total yield loss due to disease during
1994 in these countries was 14.99 million metric tons, valued at $3.31
billion.
