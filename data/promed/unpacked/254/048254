A 29-year old Indonesian woman has died of bird flu, bringing the
death toll from the virus in the southeast Asian country to 103, the
health ministry said on Monday [4 Feb 2008]. The woman, from
Tangerang, west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, died on Saturday
[2 Feb 2008] after being treated at the city's Persahabatan hospital
for about a week, ministry spokeswoman Lily Sulistyowati said in a
statement. The woman's neighbours kept chickens, but the source of
the infection remained unclear, she said.

The woman is the 8th person to die of bird flu in Indonesia this year
[2008]. Some experts say the flare-up is caused by a number factors
such as damp weather and poor sanitation during the rainy season.
"Fowl remain the source of bird flu infections," the spokeswoman said.

The ministry also said that a 38-year-old woman from western Jakarta
had tested positive for bird flu. She was being treated at
Persahabatan and had been put on a ventilator, the statement said.
Her case brought the number of bird flu cases in the country to 126.
Of these, 103 people have died, making Indonesia the country with the
highest death toll from the disease.

Contact with sick fowl is the most common way of contracting bird
flu, endemic in bird populations in most of Indonesia.
