[1] Africa: increased 2nd wave cases
[A] 30% rise in COVID cases during 2nd wave

Africa experienced a 30% rise in infections in its 2nd wave of coronavirus last year [2020] but implemented fewer public health measures than in the 1st [wave], research showed on Thursday [25 Mar 2021]. Writing in The Lancet medical journal, researchers said the loosening of public health measures such as distancing and intermittent lockdowns probably contributed to higher death tolls during the 2nd wave.

The study looked at COVID-19 case, death, recovery and test data carried out across all 55 African Union member states between 14 Feb 2020 and 31 Dec 2020. Using publicly available data, it also analysed health control measures such as school closures and travel restrictions.

At the end of 2020, the continent had reported nearly 2.8 million COVID-19 cases -- 3% of the global total -- and just over 65 000 deaths. Daily new cases during the 1st wave numbered 18 273. During the 2nd wave this figure stood at 27 790 -- a 30% rise. Among the 38 nations that experienced a pronounced 2nd wave and for which control measures were available, the study found that almost half had fewer measures in place compared with the 1st [wave].

"This 1st comprehensive analysis of the pandemic in Africa provides greater insights into the impacts of COVID-19 on the continent as a whole, and within its diverse regions," said Dr. Justin Maeda, from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). "Better understanding of the challenges posed at national, regional, and continental levels are essential for informing ongoing efforts to tackle current outbreaks and future waves of infections."

The researchers said it was highly likely new variants had contributed to higher caseloads across the continent's 2nd wave. The highest incidences of cases per 100 000 population were recorded in Cape Verde (1973), South Africa (1819), Libya (1526), Morocco (1200), and Tunisia (1191), the study showed.

And while African COVID-19 cases were not overall more deadly than the global average, this varied greatly between nations. Of the 53 countries that reported more than 100 virus cases, one-third had case fatality ratios -- the proportion of deaths compared with total cases -- higher than the global average of 2.2%.

"These insights reveal a need to improve testing capacity and reinvigorate public health campaigns," said John Nkengasong, a study author and virologist who is also director of Africa CDC.

Summary
------
Background: Although the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed more slowly in Africa than the rest of the world, by December 2020, the 2nd wave appeared to be much more aggressive with many more cases. To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa.

Methods: We did a cross-sectional analysis between 14 Feb and 31 Dec 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place.

Findings: As of 31 Dec 2020, African countries had reported 2  763  421 COVID-19 cases and 65  602 deaths, accounting for 3.4% of the 82  312  150 cases and 3.6% of the 1  798  994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82.6% (2  283  613) of reported cases. Eighteen countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2.2%), and 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended 10 to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the 1st wave in Africa in July 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18  273. As of 31 Dec 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their 2nd wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23  790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. A total of 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had 5 or more stringent public health and social measures in place by 15 Apr 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of 31 Dec 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month.

Interpretation: Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe 2nd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the 1st [wave] and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

Discussion: ...We want to highlight the need to measure the effect of COVID-19 intervention measures on other communicable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, which are prevalent in many countries across Africa. Having a holistic, data-driven understanding of the situation across, as well as within, the continent is imperative for preventing transmission, severe illness, and death from COVID-19; informing vaccination and other intervention strategies; and minimising the social and economic harms associated with the pandemic.

[2] Yemen: state of emergency

Yemen's internationally recognised government declared a health emergency in areas under its control, as infections in a 2nd wave of a coronavirus epidemic surge, Reuters reported. Yemen's 6-year war has restricted testing and reporting of COVID-19, but numbers of confirmed cases have risen rapidly since mid-February [2021] after levelling off from September [2020] to just a couple a day.

Yemen's emergency coronavirus committee reported 98 confirmed and 168 suspected infections on Monday [22 Mar 2021]. Aid group Oxfam said yesterday [23 Mar 2021] the 2nd wave was pushing the country to a tipping point as it edges closer to famine and intensifying fighting displaces more people.

"The figures indicate a sharp rise in the number of people being admitted to healthcare facilities with severe symptoms as these are the only people who are tested," Oxfam said. "With little testing, we can't quantify the true scale of the problem, but we do know that COVID is accelerating fast. I'm hearing daily of ... people who have died of COVID-like symptoms without receiving medical attention," Oxfam's Yemen Director Muhsin Siddiquey said.

This comes as the Transportation Minister of the Houthi-controlled administration in Yemen, Zakaria Al-Shami, died on Sunday [21 Mar 2021] of complications of coronavirus infection, 2 Yemeni officials said. Al-Shami was treated in a hospital in the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, along with Prime Minister Abdulaziz Bin Habtour from the same administration and other officials who have also been infected, they said.

Yemen is divided between the government currently based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital Sanaa in the north.

Yemen's government, which does not expect to receive its 1st batch of 2.3 million vaccine doses -- through the global COVAX scheme -- until the end of March [2021], has reported more than 3500 coronavirus infections and 770 deaths so far. Houthi authorities, who control most large urban centres, have played down the spread of coronavirus in their territory and provide no figures.

[In Yemen, 3.5 million people have been displaced; 2 million Yemeni children are starving.

"As the Yemeni civilian population is already suffering in an enormous man-made humanitarian crisis, the COVID-19 crisis has added a new stress to a health system which has already been shattered by war. Under-resourced and buffeted by years of conflict, it is inadequately prepared to care for COVID-19 patients and contain the spread of the virus. Nonetheless, the pandemic has been only one of Yemenis' many health concerns.

"Prior to COVID-19, several other notable disease outbreaks, including cholera, diphtheria, measles and dengue fever, were reported in Yemen. Cholera alone has affected nearly every Yemeni family in some way, with almost 2 million suspected cases since 2016.

"Yet, more than half of Yemen's health facilities are closed or partially functioning. Since 2015, parties to the conflict have targeted not only medical facilities but also medical personnel, as health workers have been threatened, injured, abducted, detained and killed.

"Consequently, many medical professionals have fled Yemen, further damaging the healthcare response. The Houthis have severely hampered and diverted international aid in areas under their control. Parties to the conflict have also possibly used starvation as a weapon of war, further weakening Yemenis' health. In 2017, the UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien called Yemen the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II.

"In light of these serial abuses, the pandemic adds a new layer of misery for Yemenis whose mental and physical health and access to healthcare infrastructure has already been severely depleted. The country's 1st confirmed case [was] recorded on 10 Apr 2020.

"Despite...the country's limited testing capacity, as of 26 Sep 2020 the number of confirmed cases in Yemen had reached 2034, with 588 associated deaths. It is impossible to know the actual numbers" (Source: https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/14/war-and-covid-19-yemen).]

[3] Schools: 3-foot rule and variants
Date: Thu 25 Mar 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/experts-3-foot-rule-schools-problematic-light-covid-variants


Late last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued updated guidance on school reopening, saying that 3 feet [1 m], not 6 feet [2 m], of physical distancing between students was sufficient in most elementary schools -- regardless of the level of community spread of COVID-19.

At the same time that CDC officials were updating school policy, they were also warning that B117, a variant strain 50% more transmissible than the wild-type virus, would likely become the dominant strain in the United States by April [2021]. In some states, such as Florida and California, the variant, which was first detected in the United Kingdom, already accounts for 25% of cases.

Now several experts are concerned that schools may be opening during an inflection point in the pandemic and are being misguided about how to do so.

Across America almost all schools closed in March and April of 2020 as the pandemic entered its 1st wave and peaked in places like New York City. A barrier to reopening in the fall, especially in crowded, urban school districts, was that classrooms could not accommodate students with the CDC-recommended 6 feet [2 m] of physical distancing.

The CDC said mounting evidence shows little difference in school transmission rates when students are separated by 3 or 6 feet [1 or 2 m], and it points to mounting research on student mental health, physical health, and even parental job security that shows that in-person instruction is superior for most American children and families.

"It's a balance," said Ruth Lynfield, MD, Minnesota state epidemiologist. Minnesota, along with Michigan and North Carolina, has seen school-related B117 outbreaks spread into the community in recent weeks.

"We are in a race to vaccinate as variants spread, and currently kids and their parents are not vaccinated, so communities need to work that much harder to make in-person school happen," Lynfield said. "That means wearing masks, and not gathering with other families outside of school."

Lynfield said she is seeing B117 cases increase yet at the same time sees hope via vaccination. "But we could have another surge," she said. "And nobody wants that."

Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News, is worried B117 will lead to a different level of transmission than the country has seen before. "We're already seeing substantial transmission," said Osterholm, who had supported the opening of K-8 schools given the dynamics of the wild-type virus.

Osterholm said the CDC recommendations were based on data done when only the original, wild-type virus was circulating, not B117. "What little science supports 3 vs 6 feet [1 vs 2 m] goes out the window here. Is 6 feet [2 m] even safe?" he said.

In Europe, where schools have been opened since the fall, some countries have now had to close doors in light of the spread of the B117 variant. Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany have all confirmed B117 outbreaks in schools.

But data on B117 and children are limited and conflicting, as the variant was only first identified in the United Kingdom in December [2020]. Non-peer-reviewed studies have shown children under 18 make up a larger share of UK B117 cases.

Other studies have shown that those younger than 20 years were overrepresented in initial analyses of B117 cases in the United Kingdom, and the [variant] simply has a higher attack rate among all age-groups.

According to Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, it's still true that children as a whole are largely clinically less affected by all types of COVID-19. In the Netherlands, children and young adults are overrepresented in the current increase in cases, which could mean B117 is more transmissible among children.

"It seems that children infected with B117 are more often symptomatic," Koopmans said, noting her comments were based on a study that has not yet been published, which was based on small numbers. "That could also translate into more transmission."

She said conducting in-person school is now done more cautiously in the Netherlands, with recommended low-threshold testing. "This virus is hard to stop, and that is even more so for the more transmissible variants. So it remains important to respect the rules, stay home when sick, get tested, avoid crowds, and respect physical distancing," she said.

Muge Cevik, MD, MSc, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St. Andrews, has tracked B177 in the United Kingdom. She said the strain is more transmissible in all age-groups and cautioned against an overemphasis on children and the threat of schools.

"There was an early speculation that kids might be more affected, but this has not been supported by further data," Cevik said. "In reality, a more transmissible variant means we may have more infections in all age-groups, and these variants will be amplifying where the burden already exists, such as nursing homes, prisons, shelters, and meat packing plants."

"I suspect B117 will be the main circulating variant across the world very soon, as it is more transmissible and out-competes other variants," Cevik said.

When CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, introduced the 3-feet guidelines, she cited a study recently published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. That paper showed similar spread of the virus in Massachusetts schools that implemented masking and 3 feet [1 m] of physical separation, compared with masking and 6 feet [2 m].

"The paper is asking the wrong question," said Lisa Brosseau, ScD, a research consultant with CIDRAP. "Does 3 feet [1 m] or 6 feet [2 m] matter when kids are in a classroom for 6 hours?"

Moreover, the recommendation still ignores aerosol transmission of the virus, said Donald Milton, MD, DrPH, MOH, of the University of Maryland in College Park. "The concept of 3 feet [1 m] or 6 feet [2 m] is based on droplet spray in the 1st place," Milton said. "If we were only talking about spray-borne transmission, that distance is important. But that's not what's happening at this point."

The Massachusetts study, according to Milton and Brosseau, also fails to address the real-world challenges schools present to infection control. "The elephant in the room is lunch," Milton said. "We know a high-risk activity is dining. People can't eat with a mask on. I don't see people talking about that in the context of schools."

The CDC's current guidelines suggest 6 feet [2 m] of distancing should be maintained when students are not wearing masks.

Brosseau said though the Massachusetts study, and thus the CDC guidelines, focuses on face-covering policies, not enough attention is given to the ventilation systems in school districts. "If those with less than 3 feet [1 m] policies also improved their ventilation, that would dilute the impact -- so to speak -- of more people closer together. I suspect none of the districts made any ventilation changes, but that would have been an appropriate variable to include in their models," Brosseau said.

Kim Prather, PhD, of the University of California San Diego, has been helping San Diego Unified, one of the biggest school districts in California, plan for its reopening on 12 Apr 2021. She said she is encouraging schools to maintain 6 feet [2 m] of distance.

"If you tell kids 3 feet [1 m], it becomes 1 foot [0.3 m]," Prather said. "And what worked for schools in the fall will only get harder with the variant."

All of the experts agreed that [safely] opening schools must be a top priority, but one that cannot be addressed properly until the CDC acknowledges what it knows -- and doesn't know -- about the virus. Until then, Prather is recommending that schools invest in ventilation, HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters, and close-fitting masks for kids. She advised San Diego Unified to ban children who are not wearing masks from coming indoors, and recommended lunch be served al fresco for the time being.

"The chance of things calming down right now are so close with vaccines," she said. "And the variant can't take off unless you give it the opportunities."

[The CDC recently released an updated Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools to facilitate decision-making regarding opening and safety measures (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/indicators.html).

"If community transmission is high, students and staff are more likely to come to school while infectious, and COVID-19 can spread more easily in schools. The association between COVID-19 incidence and transmission in school settings and levels of community transmission underscores the importance of controlling disease spread in the community to protect teachers, staff, and students in schools."

"K-12 schools should be the last settings to close after all other mitigation measures in the community have been employed, and the 1st to reopen when they can do so safely. This implies that schools should be prioritized for reopening and remaining open for in-person instruction over nonessential businesses and activities."

"To enable schools to open and remain open, it is important to adopt and consistently implement actions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2...in schools and in the community."

[4] Remdesivir: recovery in hospitalized COVID patients
Date: Thu 25 Mar 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/study-remdesivir-speeds-recovery-hospitalized-covid-patients


The antiviral drug remdesivir (Veklury) was associated with faster clinical improvement in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a multicenter comparative-effectiveness study published yesterday [24 Mar 2021] in JAMA Network Open. The retrospective study, conducted by Johns Hopkins University researchers, involved 2299 COVID-19 patients receiving care in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore and Washington, DC area from 4 Mar 2020 to 29 Aug 2020. About 15% received remdesivir (342) as part of their treatment, of which 285 were matched with controls for primary statistical analysis.

Clinical improvement was defined as release from the hospital without worsening of World Health [Organization] (WHO) severity score during hospitalization or within 28 days after the start of remdesivir or maximum follow-up. Median time from hospitalization to treatment initiation was 1.1 days. Most patients in the remdesivir group (88.6%) were given 5 days of treatment.

Of the 570 matched patients, 82.8% of those given remdesivir and 74.7% of controls clinically improved after a median of 5 days and 7 days, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.47). Remdesivir recipients who breathed ambient air or received oxygen via nasal cannula reached clinical improvement after a median of 5 days compared with 6 days in controls (aHR, 1.41).

Likewise, severely ill patients needing more intense respiratory support achieved clinical improvement after a median of 8 days versus 9 days in controls (aHR, 1.59).

Rates of death by 28 days were not significantly different between the 2 groups in a time-to-death analysis, at 7.7% in remdesivir recipients and 14.0% among controls (aHR, 0.70). Median time to death was 8.6 days for patients receiving remdesivir and 8.2 days in controls.

A little more than half (53.8%, 184) of those who received remdesivir also received corticosteroids, while the remaining 158 were given only remdesivir. The combination of remdesivir and corticosteroids was not linked to a decreased 28-day death rate (aHR, 1.94).

Of the 33 patients who stopped remdesivir before 5 days, 9 did so because of adverse events such as increased liver enzymes or bilirubin, kidney failure of unknown cause, nausea, rapid heartbeat, nosebleeds, or itching of the neck and mouth.

Median age in the remdesivir group was 60 years, 55.3% were men, and 80.7% were of a non-White race or ethnicity. Among the matched controls, 20.7% were White, 33.3% were Black, and 34.4% were Latin American.

The researchers noted that clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir have produced mixed results to date and haven't looked at the effect of the administration of remdesivir with other drugs or included enough Black or Latin American patients. "Because underrepresented minority groups have shouldered a disproportionate burden during the COVID-19 pandemic but have not been widely represented in clinical trials, our results provide important evidence that receipt of remdesivir is associated with decreased time to clinical improvement in these populations," they said.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 12 and older on 22 Oct 2020, based largely on results from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, while the WHO recommended against its use, based on the results of the larger Solidarity Trial. "Although the results of Solidarity likely indicate that remdesivir alone does not have a robust mortality benefit for patients with COVID-19, remdesivir may still have an important role to play in reducing duration and severity of illness, both important outcomes when hospitals are overwhelmed with patients having COVID-19," the researchers wrote.

The authors concluded that their findings suggest that remdesivir was tied to a substantial reduction in the time to recovery among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. "These results provide further evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing the duration of COVID-19 illness, that a 5-day treatment course may be sufficient, and that patients with milder disease likely benefit most," they said.

[Remdesivir (Veklury) has been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration since 1 May 2020. It is indicated for treatment of COVID-19 disease in hospitalized adults and children aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg (88 lb).

The safety and efficacy of combination therapy of remdesivir with corticosteroids have not been rigorously studied in clinical trials; however, there are theoretical reasons that the combination therapy may be beneficial in some patients with severe COVID-19.

Recent relevant study: https://academic.oup.com/jac/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jac /dkab093/6184581

The above study raises important new questions: If recovery time is reduced in response to therapy, should remdesivir be prescribed for less severe/mild cases as well? And how soon is soon enough? Should co-therapy with other medication, such as oral or injectable steroids, also be considered? Clearly more therapeutic and trial-based data at various levels of disease severity could be helpful. - Mod.UBA]
