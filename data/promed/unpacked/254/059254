Plum seedlings produced at the Institute of Fruit Research in Cacak [Morava district] are infected by [a well] known and most dangerous viral disease of plums. This is indicated by some growers from Cacak region to whom sharka (plum pox) did a lot of damage, and they will have to destroy infected seedlings.

A source, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he bought seedlings from the institute because it was a state-renowned institution where he was told the plums are healthy. He later found out that the [seedling] production process is controlled, but the seedlings [may still be] infected with virus.

"They do not warn you that there is the possibility that the seedlings are infected," he said. He bought the seedlings last year [2012], but the sharka symptoms are not visible [until] spring. "I noticed that there was a problem with [the seedling] plums only recently. The institute confirmed it [and also] phytosanitary inspectors and a laboratory in Cacak. The Ministry of Agriculture ordered me to destroy all 50 infected plants," he said.

He said the problem is not only in material damage but that sharka is transferred to the healthy trees, and there is no cure for it. This virus is the main reason domestic plums [of the variety] "pozegaca" [have been] exterminated.

"We are following all legal procedures; the work is controlled by phytosanitary inspection, and all plants have a declaration," said the director of the institute, Dr Svetlana Paunovic. Who is going to compensate for the damage to the growers, Paunovic did not say.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa and the Americas but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants.

Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into several strains according to their serological and molecular properties, and some strains do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools) and grafting, as well as with infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. Resistant cultivars are available for several types of stone fruits, including plum.

Several strains of PPV were confirmed to be present in Serbia's neighbour Montenegro in 2007 (ProMED-mail post 20070903.2893). Given the high risk of sharka in the region and that, as indicated in the report above, molecular diagnostic methods for PPV are available in Serbia, it is surprising that a PPV certification scheme for stone fruit seedlings does not appear to be in place in the country.
