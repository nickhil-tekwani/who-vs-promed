4. It turns out that Katwa & Butembo aren't the only #Ebola transmission hot spots where vaccination efforts were suspended for multiple days recently. Vuhovi, Kalunguta, Masereka & Lubero -- south of Butembo, on the road to Goma -- went 5 days without any vaccination.

5. This week's @WHOAFRO weekly outbreak bulletin shows something quite worrisome. It feels like this outbreak is both deepening in intensity & expanding geographically in North Kivu & Ituri. Regarding the former: All 18 health areas in Katwa have had cases in the past 3 weeks.

6. And 11 health zones have had #Ebola cases in the past 3 days, @WHOAFRO reports.

7. In terms of expanding reach, the @WHOAFRO report says 17 of the 21 health zones that have had #Ebola cases in this outbreak have had cases in the past 3 weeks. A month ago, it was 11/21. In January 2019, it was 8/19. And places where spread was stopped have resumed transmission.

Release of a new miraculous baby from Katwa CTE
- A 42-day old baby was discharged from the Katwa CTE on Sat 11 May 2019. [D] was admitted to the CTE with her mother on 11 Apr 2019 when she was only 12 days old. Her mother, who arrived in a state of advanced coma, died at CTE the next day. D was collected on 12 Apr 2019 and was positive. After 30 days of treatment with mAb 114, D was cured. She survived thanks to the work of the health staff and the nannies who took turns at her bedside 24 hours a day but also because she was taken care of as soon as she became ill. Nannies are men and women cured of Ebola, and, therefore, immune to the virus, who care for sick children and babies during their hospitalization.

Medical care in Butembo and Katwa:
Since the departure of the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) NGO from the Butembo and Katwa health zones following the deterioration of the security situation in February 2019, the management of the 2 Ebola treatment centers (CTE) in the city of Butembo has been taken over by the Ministry of Health in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF since March 2019.

- Since this transfer of management, many changes have been made to the medical care of patients with Ebola. These changes include:

1. Increasing the number of health providers in CTEs. The new managers continued to work with MSF-trained caregivers, but they also recruited more care providers to ensure better individual follow-up for each patient. Moreover, from now on, the whole of the medical staff is Congolese and has been recruited locally.

2. Improvement of the nutritional care of patients, which increases their chance of survival.

3. Creation of a team dedicated exclusively to admissions to reduce waiting time for admission.

4. Involvement of the family from the beginning of the treatment of patients with the support of psychologists.

- 2 months after this management transfer, it was important to conduct an analysis to assess the quality of medical care for Ebola patients. The main conclusions of this analysis are:

1. The average duration of hospitalization in the CTEs has been reduced, allowing more patients to be treated for the same duration. At Butembo CTE, the average duration of hospitalization decreased from 9 to 4 days. And at the Katwa CTE, the average length of stay [went from] 7 to 5 days.

2. There was a reduction in the intra-CTE lethality rate and an increase in the survival rate. Without taking into account those who died less than 48 hours after admission to the CTE, the case-fatality rate for confirmed patients decreased from 43.4% to 31.1% in the Butembo CTE and from 43.2% to 33.8% at Katwa CTE. As a corollary, Butembo's CTE survival rate increased from 56.6% to 68.9%. At the Katwa CTE, the survival rate increased from 56.8% to 66.2%.

- These data come from the patient database compiled by the Ministry of Health and partners involved in medical care. These data are encouraging, as they prove that local health workers are now able to properly care for Ebola patients. It is a great success to congratulate and encourage.

Decentralized operational approach
--------------------
The Ministry of Health invited MSF to present their "decentralized operational approach" project at a strategic meeting in Kinshasa on Thu 9 May 2019. In summary, the MSF project is organized around 3 axes:

OPTION 1: If the patients accept it, they will be treated in the CTE which remain the reference places for the management of confirmed Ebola patients and who guarantee the best survival rate.

OPTION 2: If patients do not wish to visit an CTE, they may go to a local health center or hospital that would be prepared to accommodate them.

OPTION 3: If patients do not wish to visit a CTE or a health center, they could be cared for at home with the support of the patient and the family with training in reduction of transmission with equipment, "personal protection light," and symptomatic treatment with supervision (if possible).

- Many questions, suggestions and concerns were shared by the Ministry of Health and the technical and financial partners present at this meeting. These questions include:
- How to ensure team safety in such a decentralized approach?
- How to ensure strict adherence to prevention measures at the community health center level and at home?
- What to answer to patients who would like to be cared for in traditional healer centers that are very popular?
- How will families manage contaminated biological fluids for home treatment?
- Can daily support for health centers or families be done remotely when response teams are unable to move about the city due to a security incident?

- MSF was also asked to draw lessons learned from Beni and Mangina where the decentralized approach in the hospitals was used early in the response, prior to the construction of the CTEs. In both areas, this decentralized approach has led to a high rate of nosocomial infections and a high level of contamination among health care workers. A workshop will be organized in the coming weeks with the actors in the field to evaluate the relevance, the feasibility and the acceptability of this approach. Community dialogues will also be organized to involve communities in the choice of response strategies to use.

It appears that the MoH also has recognized the need for policy changes, including some of those Huster suggested. However, there are serious considerations that must be evaluated, such as those raised above, e.g., treatment of infected wastes generated in homes of patients so that household members do not become infected, assurance that proper protective equipment will be worn to prevent infection of care takers, and many more. A decentralized local approach on the surface seems superior to the formal treatment centers in this situation, which is so much more complex than in past outbreaks because of the deep distrust of authorities. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 15 May 2019. Ebola outbreak grows by 19 as WHO notes "stop and go" response
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/ebola-outbreak-grows-19-who-notes-stop-and-go-response

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) ministry of health recorded 19 new cases of Ebola today 15 May 2019 in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Eleven new deaths were also recorded.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 1739, including 1147 deaths. A total of 332 suspected cases are still under investigation. Six of the newly recorded deaths occurred in the community, raising the risk of further transmission.

In a situation update published yesterday [14 May 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) described the recent spike in cases as part of a "stop and go" pattern that's come to define this outbreak.

"Particularly in Butembo and Katwa, response has been reduced to a "stop and go" pattern, where a day or 2 of activity is followed by a day or 2 of suspended or limited activity," the WHO said. "Meanwhile, security measures have been strengthened at many healthcare facilities to aid the resumption of critical healthcare services."

In the 3-week period between 22 Apr and 12 May 2019, 343 confirmed cases were reported, with 30% in Katwa, 13% each in Mandima and Mabalako, and 12% in Butembo. These hotspots have been the epicenter of virus activity since January 2019.

The overall case-fatality ratio for this outbreak is 66%. Of the confirmed cases with known age and sex, 56% are female and 29% are children under the age of 18. The number of healthcare workers infected remains 101 (6% of total cases).

The WHO also released new details about a case contact from Beni who traveled to Kampala, Uganda on 5 May 2019, when he was on his 7th day of follow-up surveillance.

As of 8 May 2019, the man was safely returned to Beni where he will remain until contact tracing is complete. So far, he does not have any symptoms of Ebola.

A total of 14 459 case contacts are currently under surveillance as of 12 May 2019, the WHO said, with follow-up rates of around 84%.

The WHO also confirmed vaccination efforts were halted for 5 days recently in Butembo, Katwa, Kalunguta, Vuhovi, Lubero and Masereka health zones following the uprising of motorcycle taxis, which blocked roads, but has resumed in Butembo and Katwa, and continues in Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima.

Today [15 May 2019], the DRC confirmed 116 233 people have been vaccinated with Merck's VSV-EBOV since August 2019.

A feature of this outbreak has been the continued attacks on health care and response workers, which is part of a rising global trend, according to the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition 2018 report.

Last year [2018], 167 health workers died in conflict settings across the globe, and at least 710 were injured in more than 900 targeted attacks, up from 701 attacks reported in 2017.
The report is based on data collected from the WHO and the United Nations, and was published today [15 May 2019] in the British Medical Journal.

Ron Klain, the United States Ebola czar during the West African outbreak, said yesterday [14 May 2019] at the Pandemic and Biosecurity Forum in Washington, DC, that the WHO's response is inadequate in this type of violent setting.

"If the biggest problems we have right now in the DRC are security, instability, the attacks on health care workers, the attacks on responders, the community resistance -- and that community resistance is violent and dangerous -- the WHO has no capacity to respond to that," Klain said, according to a news story on Devex, a global development media platform.

Klain has suggested a "white-helmeted security battalion" be employed to protect health workers.

The WHO also concluded its situation report in a somber tone, acknowledging the difficulty of the outbreak.

"The continued increase in the number of new EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is worrying, as there appears to be no end in sight to the difficult security situation, complicated by the challenging political environment," the WHO said.

- Wed 15 May 2019. Terrifying Ebola epidemic out of control in DRC, say experts
The Guardian [excerpted, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/terrifying-ebola-epidemic-out-of-control-in-drc-say-experts

Excerpts:
An Ebola epidemic in a conflict-riven region of Democratic Republic of Congo is out of control and could become as serious as the outbreak that devastated 3 countries in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, experts and aid chiefs have warned.

Returning from a visit to his teams in the region, David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, called for a "reset" in the response. "The situation is far more dangerous than the statistic of 1000 deaths, itself the 2nd largest in history, suggests, and the suspension of key services threatens to create a lethal inflection point in the trajectory of the disease," he said. "The danger is that the number of cases spirals out of control, despite a proven vaccine and treatment."

IRC teams, who have had 3 triage units in health centres burned down, have warned that the situation in North Kivu is increasingly volatile and is making progress against the disease impossible.

Those on the frontline in North Kivu fear no end is in sight. Whitney Elmer, a country director for Mercy Corps, one of the humanitarian NGOs working on preventing the spread, said there had been "a drastic change in the security situation", which was causing a big rise in the number of cases.

Elmer said there had been about 400 cases over the past month -- the highest figure for that time period since the outbreak began -- and the number of new cases was increasing at a much higher rate than seen previously.

Frontline workers say there has not been enough community involvement and that bringing in armed police and especially cancelling elections in the region have provoked hostility and suspicion. "The overall strategy has been to go full force to do things as quickly as possible," said Elmer. She added that it was vital that local people and organisations were included in decision-making.

Medecins Sans Frontiers, whose volunteer doctors have been at the forefront of every Ebola outbreak, agreed that the failure to engage communities had been a disaster.

"We are very concerned, and the signs around the outbreak response are not good right now," said Kate White, one of its emergency managers.

New cases should be picked up by routine surveillance and testing the contacts of people who fall ill. "But what we see right now is that the majority of confirmed cases are coming through community deaths. It's a very worrying sign," she said. "It means communities are not aware or not active participants in the response. People die in their communities and they have the ability to transmit the virus to as many people as possible."

She said agencies needed to have the local people actively working against Ebola. "Anything else is a band-aid solution."
WHO recently announced an expansion of the vaccination guidelines and the introduction of a 2nd vaccine to try to protect people.

Experimental drugs have also been given to 700 people, although nobody yet knows how successful they have been. But unless it is possible to reach affected communities with vaccines and drugs, the new technologies are useless.

"The tragedy is that we have the technical means to stop Ebola, but until all parties halt attacks on the response, it will be very difficult to end this outbreak," Dr Tedros tweeted on Fri 10 May 2019.

- Sun 13 May 2019
Europa [abridged, edited]
http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-2475_en.htm

The EU is stepping up humanitarian support with an additional Euro 5 million [USD 5.6 million] as the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to experience its biggest Ebola outbreak to date. The confirmed death toll of the epidemic now stands at over 1000 people. With today's [13 May 2019] announcement, total EU funding to tackle the disease in the country amounts to Euro 17 million [USD 19 million] since 2018.

Christos Stylianides, Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and EU Ebola Coordinator said: "The EU is committed to continue helping partners and the authorities fight Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo for as long as it takes. Since the outbreak last year [2018], the EU has provided funding, experts, medical evacuation equipment, our humanitarian flight service, and helped neighbouring countries. We are also supporting the health sector in the country and the development of Ebola vaccines and treatments. Yet the disease remains a serious threat, and all must be done to curb the epidemic. Aid workers must also be free to do their lifesaving job without the threat of violence."

The EU funding announced today [13 May 2019] supports the World Health Organisation as well as other partners to ensure access to health care and infection and prevention measures, working with local communities to promote understanding, acceptance and support of the response, and social protection and nutritional support to survivors and their families.

The Ebola response in the country has had to face a number of serious and continuous challenges, including high population mobility, weak health structures and poor community acceptance of the contagion prevention measures. On top of these is the ongoing conflict in the affected areas, the violent attacks perpetrated on Ebola treatment centres and response teams.

Background
------
In response to the outbreak, the EU provides financial support to humanitarian partners involved in various actions in the Ebola response. EU humanitarian health experts in the Democratic Republic of Congo are involved in the coordination of the response and are in daily contact with health authorities, the World Health Organisation and operational partners. Furthermore, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control sent an epidemiologist to Butembo, the 2nd epicentre of the outbreak, between November and December 2018 to provide further technical and specialised support and is closely following the development of the outbreak.

The EU's Humanitarian Air Service, ECHO flight, regularly transports personnel, supplies and equipment to various Ebola-affected areas. It has operated so far over 80 flights.

The EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated twice in relation to the outbreak, upon request of World Health Organisation. Norway, which is a participating state in the Mechanism, dispatched a specialised team to the Democratic Republic of Congo to give training to health workers on the use of high-tech isolation units that it had given to support the Ebola response for use in specific medical evacuation cases. Upon a second request by the World Health Organisation, Norway provided 3 additional isolation units, and is offering further training sessions on their operation. The EU co-finances 85% of the transport costs involved for this assistance deployed through the Mechanism. The EU has also financially supported Ebola vaccine development and research on Ebola treatments and diagnostic tests.

In addition to the emergency response, the EU is implementing a development cooperation programme to support the health sector. Outside the DRC, EU humanitarian funds have also been helping in the reinforcement of preparedness and prevention measures in neighbouring countries to avoid a spillover of the outbreak.

- Mon 13 May 2019. Political games hinder efforts to end Ebola outbreak in Congo
Reuters from WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/political-games-hinder-efforts-to-end-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-who-idUSKCN1SJ256

Attempts to end the 2nd worst Ebola outbreak on record are being hampered by "political games" and distrust of outsiders in 2 towns in Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior World Health Organization official said on Mon 13 May 2019.

The epidemic has moved through northeastern Congo, killing 1117 people since mid-2018. A rapid international response with an effective vaccine has managed to stop the spread in a string of towns, including Beni, Kyondo, Komanda, Tchomia, Mabalako, Mandima and Kayna, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said.

But in 2 towns, Butembo and Katwa, there has been persistent infection and reinfection, Ryan he told an audience at Geneva's Graduate Institute.

"They see (DRC capital) Kinshasa as being as far away as New York. Anyone from more than 5 miles down the road, or maybe sometimes 500 meters, is an outsider," he said.

"They are very distrusting of outside influence. And certainly, getting this community on board has been a challenge, and missteps have been made along the way in doing that."

Ryan added that there were "myriad" Mai-Mai militia groups, with at least 21 around Butembo and Katwa alone, some leaning toward criminal activity and many being manipulated by political causes.

"There is a lot of political gaming going on in this part of the world -- government and opposition and others -- and this needs to stop," Ryan said.

Community engagement strategy involved health workers visiting a village in advance of vaccination, but by the time they went back the next morning or afternoon, youth groups or others were often there to intercept them.

"It's not the family who are rejecting, it's other elements in the community who have been organized to respond to the "outsiders," be they government or NGOs or others, and that has caused a lot of flashpoints with the teams."

Ryan said the problem was totally different from attacks on health facilities by armed insurgents, who had used "heavy arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and other stuff," which he said had horrified local inhabitants.

To try to improve access for health workers, there had been discussions with Congo's president and opposition leaders, as well as the bishop of Butembo, imams and tribal chiefs who wield political influence. But a truly "all society approach" was needed, "or this situation will get even worse", Ryan said.

- 13 May 2019. WHO warning
Business Insider [abridged, edited]
https://www.businessinsider.com/who-says-attacks-make-it-impossible-to-contain-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-2019-5

The WHO is giving an ominous warning about Ebola as health teams trying to contain an outbreak come under attack.

The World Health Organization warned Fri [10 May 2019] that it may not be possible to contain Ebola to the 2 affected provinces in eastern Congo if violent attacks on health teams continue.

The ominous statement comes amid escalating violence 9 months after the outbreak began, crippling efforts to identify suspected cases in the community and vaccinate those most at risk. Earlier this week, Mai-Mai militia fighters attacked the town of Butembo at the epicenter of the crisis.

The update also noted that a burial team had been "violently attacked" after they interred an Ebola victim in the town of Katwa. The corpses of victims are highly contagious, requiring special precautions to ensure the disease is not transmitted at funerals.

Nearly 5 days of Ebola response activities were halted in Butembo and surrounding areas recently because of the insecurity, WHO said.

"The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline health care workers," it said. "Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this (Ebola) outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces."

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, has met with health workers in the regional capital of Goma this week. Some fear it could take another year to get the disease under control, he said.

"There is a real concern to make sure it doesn't spread to Goma," he said. "And so this is, I think, a more dangerous situation than is widely recognized outside the country."

The outbreak, which has killed 1074 people, marks the 1st time that Ebola has struck inside a conflict zone. Eastern Congo has suffered decades of violence perpetrated by warring rebel groups and militias awash in arms.

The affected area, though, is also close to Congo's borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and health officials in both countries have been preparing in case someone sick with Ebola should bring the disease across international borders.

WHO and others have previously said that the risk of that happening was low. The difficulties in accessing some of the hardest hit areas in Congo, though, means that health workers are struggling to isolate the sick, and track down and isolate their caregivers and family members.

About half of those dying remained in their homes instead of seeking treatment at Ebola health centers, giving the virus an opportunity to spread to those in physical contact with victims.

Amid the rising number of cases, WHO said that an advisory group was now recommending that those at high risk of contracting Ebola be given a vaccine dose of 0.5mL of vaccine instead of 1mL. The group is proposing that the vaccine be given more widely, including to those living in communities where there have been recent Ebola cases.

In addition to the risks posed by militias, there also has been widespread community mistrust in eastern Congo, a byproduct of years of conflict and grievances with the government.

WHO said it was aiming to have the of majority vaccine teams comprised of local health workers by the end of the month in an effort to reduce tensions.
