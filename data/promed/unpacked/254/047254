A warning is going out to hunters in New Jersey after an outbreak of
a rare, deadly virus affecting the area deer population.
An outbreak of Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) in wild
white-tailed deer, caused by an RNA virus transmitted by biting
midges, began in the last week of August and 1st week of September 2007.
According to animal wildlife officials, 15 deer were reportedly found
north of Amwell Road, west of Millstone in Hillsborough Township,
Somerset County. On 12 Sep 2007, 8 deer were discovered in Royce
Brook. Twelve deer deaths were reported along the Manatico River
drainage in Cumberland County and 6 dead deer were found in a nearby
drainage of Mud Creek North of Union Lake in Pittsgrove Township.
When a deer is bitten by an infected midge, the virus causes blood
clots and damage to the linings of the blood vessels, causing leakage
of serum and hemorrhages. Deer who do survive the infection may
develop ridges or bands on the hooves, and, in more severe chronic
cases, they may slough the hooves and develop secondary infections,
becoming lame and emaciated.
The Office of Wildlife Health and Forensics [OFWHF] and deer project
personnel are investigating the findings.
Any deer with no apparent wounds found dead in or near water should
be suspect EHD cases, and the OFWHF should be notified by calling 908-735-6398.

State wildlife officials have confirmed a localized outbreak of a
common white-tailed deer virus in southeastern Highland County's
Brush Creek Township.
Suspect cases have been reported in the southeastern Ohio counties of
Athens, Hocking, Pike, Washington, Muskingum, Perry, Morgan, Gallia,
Monroe, Ross, Belmont and Jackson.
Ohio Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory
in Reynoldsburg confirmed the deer had epizootic hemorrhagic disease
(EHD). State animal health officials stress EHD occurs annually in
deer herds across North America and is not related to Chronic Wasting Disease.
White-tailed deer contract EHD from the bite of gnats, which live
near water. The onset of cold weather suppresses the disease, as
frosts drive the gnats into winter inactivity.
The disease is not spread from deer to deer or from deer to humans.
Once infected, deer show signs within 5 to 10 days.
Infected deer initially lose appetite and fear of humans, grow
progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, and become
unconscious. Many deer die within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms.
"Gnats can also spread EHD among cattle and sheep, and outbreaks may
happen at the same time as deer are being impacted. However, this is
not a case of the disease spreading from deer to livestock or vice
versa, but is an indication that the biting gnats are present in
large enough numbers to spread the disease," said Mark Hemming,
Wildlife Management Supervisor.
State wildlife officials stress to those planning to hunt in the
Highland County area or any of the suspected counties this fall that
although this disease does not affect humans or impact the safety of
consumed deer, hunters should report deer that appear to be sick or
diseased to their local wildlife officer. Deer that appear unhealthy
should never be taken for human food.
According to the University of Georgia's annual Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, EHD is the most common ailment
affecting deer in the Eastern United States. Outbreaks of the disease
have occurred in Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia this year [2007]. The most recent Ohio
outbreaks occurred in 2003 in Clermont and Brown counties.
The disease is common in portions of the northern Great Plains and
the Southeastern United States. It was 1st identified in 1955 in New Jersey.
White-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep and pronghorn
antelope are susceptible to the disease.

An outbreak of an acute, infectious virus that kills white-tailed
deer has been detected in Illinois, the state Departments of
Agriculture and Natural Resources reported.
Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease, an often-fatal virus that causes high
fever and severe internal bleeding, has been confirmed in captive
deer herds in Franklin and Randolph counties. It also is the
suspected cause of death in wild deer in at least 28 counties
throughout central and southern Illinois.
"One farm, in particular, has been devastated," said Dr. Colleen
O'Keefe, IDOA division manager of Food Safety and Animal Protection.
"The farm, located in Franklin County, has lost 16 of its 20 deer."
EHD poses no risk to humans, according to Dr. O'Keefe. Other wild
ruminants also are susceptible, including elk, mule deer, pronghorn
antelope and bighorn sheep. Domestic animals, such as livestock, may
become infected, but rarely exhibit signs of the disease or develop
serious illness.
EHD is spread by biting midges or by gnats. The midges transmit the
virus from infected to uninfected animals as they feed. There
currently is neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment for the disease.
"The only viable way to control the virus is to control the insect
population," Dr. O'Keefe said. "Short of spraying for insects,
there's nothing much a landowner can do to prevent the disease, other
than wait for cold weather."
EHD outbreaks typically begin in late summer or early fall and end
with an insect-killing frost. The deaths this year [2007] were 1st
reported in late August 2007. Officials believe the dry summer in
central and southern Illinois, where the cases are concentrated, has
contributed to the current outbreak.
"When shallow ponds and creek beds dry up, conditions are good for
hatches of disease-carrying insects," said Dr. Paul Shelton, Illinois
Department of Natural Resources Forest Wildlife Program manager.
"Then, as summer progresses, deer tend to become more concentrated
around watering holes, facilitating the spread of the disease."
EHD was 1st identified in 1955 when several hundred white-tailed deer
died in both Michigan and New Jersey. Since then, cases have been
documented throughout much of the United States and southern Canada.
The last significant outbreak in Illinois occurred in 2004, although
a few cases normally are observed in any given year.
Symptoms develop about 7 days after exposure to the virus and include
loss of appetite, excessive salivation, muscle weakness, lameness,
depression and a rapid pulse and respiration rate. In very acute
cases of the disease, animals enter a "shock-like" state, become
prostrate and die within 8 to 36 hours after the onset of signs.
Farmers with ill deer should not assume the animals are infected with
EHD, even if they are exhibiting classic symptoms. A veterinarian
should be called to give the deer a check-up. If the animal dies, the
Illinois Department of Agriculture's animal disease laboratories in
Centralia and Galesburg will perform a post-mortem exam to determine
the cause of death. The fee for this exam ranges from USD 40 to 100,
depending upon the level of testing that is required.
Landowners or hunters who witness a deer exhibiting signs of EHD,
especially near a creek or pond, can assist agency efforts to monitor
the extent of the disease by reporting it to IDNR Deer Project
Manager Tom Micetich at (309) 543-3316, ext. 231.

[EHD can and does spread to other animals, including bovines (see
ProMED-mail post 20070905.2922 and 20070928.3208).
Clinical signs in cattle of anorexia, decrease in rumination and milk
production, salivation and nasal discharge, weakness, and erosions on
the tongue may be present. Not all clinical signs may be present at
once but clearly should cause someone to have foot and mouth disease
on the rule out list.
In deer, these sudden deaths may also cause one to put anthrax on
their rule out list. Clearly, it is important to stay vigilant and to
know what disease caused the animal's deaths. - Mod.TG]
