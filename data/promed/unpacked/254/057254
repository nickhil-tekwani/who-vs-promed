HANTAVIRUSES, MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS: RELEVANT? (02)

In the posting "Hantaviruses, movement of animals: relevant? [archive
970930144432 I said "Complete cross-susceptibility studies have not been
done but the molecular data being accrued by Brian Hjelle, Stu Nichol and
many others indicate that hantaviruses are associated with a single (or,
perhaps 2-3 closed related) rodent species."
Hal Nash and Jack Woodall pointed out the error. What I meant to say and
should have said is "Complete cross-susceptibility studies have not been
done but the molecular data being accrued by Brian Hjelle, Stu Nichol and
many others indicate that each hantavirus is associated with a single (or,
perhaps 2-3 closed related) rodent species." The difference is critical.
Interestingly, the family trees of the rodents can almost be superimposed
on the family trees of the viruses, suggesting co evolution.
Sorry about the mistake.
