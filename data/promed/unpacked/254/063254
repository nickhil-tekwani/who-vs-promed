At least 18 cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infection have recently been detected in Afghanistan, taking this year's [2018] total cases to 267 compared to 244 cases last year.

The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) in the family Nairoviridae. The disease was first characterized in Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever.

The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common.

Dr Shah Wali Marufi, in charge of preventing communicable diseases in the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), told Pajhwok Afghan News that Congo virus cases increased each year during Eidul Adha [Eid al-Adha, "Festival of Sacrifice"] days when people sacrifice animals.

He said so far 18 CCHF infection cases have been detected since the 1st day of Eidul Adha (21 Aug 2018), raising the number of the virus cases to 267 this year.

Most of the CCHF cases were detected in Kabul and western Herat province, Marufi said, without providing more details.

According to MoPH, 33 percent of those infected with the Congo virus this year [2018] were women and the rest men including butchers, shepherds, cooks, and others.

The ministry says 32 of the patients have died. The 1st case of the disease in Afghanistan was found in 2013.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread tick-borne viral infection and one of the most rapidly emerging viral hemorrhagic fevers in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Humans are infected by tick bites or through close contact with infected animals or humans. CCHF begins with a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms which may progress to severe bleeding and be fatal if not treated.

"The disease is known to be endemic in Afghanistan, particularly in the bordering areas with Iran and Pakistan where the movement of nomads with their animals is concentrated. Up to 50 human cases of the disease are reported every year on average. The disease is endemic in other countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of WHO including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates.

"Afghanistan has experienced an overall increasing trend of CCHF since April 2017. There has been a significant surge in reported cases of the disease during the first six months of 2018. During 2018, the most affected province has been Herat where the highest number of CCHF cases has been reported. Herat Province shares a long boarder with Iran; it has the biggest animal market in the country. Huge cross -border movement of the animals occur in this province, as well as within the province."

Increased interaction between humans and livestock is particularly high in the wake of special events like Eidul Adha thereby increasing the risk for new cases. There are no vaccine prophylaxis or therapeutic interventions available at present.

Therefore, appropriate containment measures should be undertaken to address the ongoing upsurge in cases of CCHF in Afghanistan:
- enhanced surveillance of CCHF among humans and animals;
- strengthening of laboratory diagnosis;
- case management and effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures;
- effective coordination between human and animal health sectors, and other relevant stakeholders.

There is also need for an effective community mobilization and sensitization programme that should involve the community and religious leaders. A multi sectoral approach is needed to address key intervention components to ensure effective prevention and control of the disease.

"Going forward, a better understanding of CCHF epidemiology is needed for development of a long term prevention and control strategy. The country requires a comprehensive prevention and control programme that should address human as well as animal and tick populations."
