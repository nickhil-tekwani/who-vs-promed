[1] Cholera - Kenya (Nyanza)

Public Health and Sanitation's Dr James Nyikal says inadequate
treatment of water in the area is to blame for the regular cholera
outbreaks. Speaking after holding a consultative meeting with
stakeholders at the New Nyanza General Hospital in Kisumu, Nyikal
said over 219 cases of cholera have been reported so far in Kisumu
with 3 fatalities.

He noted that the cross-contamination of shallow water wells in the
informal settlements where pit latrines are common have put the
residents at a greater risk. Increased pollution of Lake Victoria by
rivers that drain effluent from the changaa [illegal alcoholic drink
popular in Kenya, distilled from grains like maize and sorghum] dens
and fish cooking points into the lake are also factors that have
contributed to the increased outbreaks of the disease, Nyikal said.

"Another worrying issue is the fact that the sewerage treatment
system in Nyalenda has collapsed, leading to the draining of raw
sewage into the lake," he said.

4 people have died following a cholera outbreak in Barberton. A
Mpumalanga Health Department spokesperson said yesterday [30 Jun
2008], "We discovered the outbreak of cholera on 29 May 2008. Since
then the confirmed number of cholera patients who received medical
treatment has risen to 27. The number of deaths is at 4."

Spokesperson Mpho Gabashane said currently there were 10 patients at
Barberton Hospital and one had been confirmed with cholera. "We are
awaiting test results for the other 9."

Gabashane said the department had instructed its teams to heighten
their surveillance and health promotion. "We are also on a daily
basis testing all sources of water in the area and, up to this point,
all tap water is considered safe for human consumption."

The department had not identified cholera in local streams. "We urge
all the people to use safe tap water and, in cases where they may not
have access, to boil their water at least for 3 minutes or add a
teaspoon of bleach."

Over the past 2 weeks, 6 persons have died due to an outbreak of
diarrhea in a remote village in Jumla district. The epidemic has
badly hit wards no. 1 and 2 of Gadhichaur VDC (village development
community), which lies at a 7-hour trek from district headquarters
Khalanga, affecting more than 100 villagers.

Most of those who have died are children as little as 6 months to 9
years. However, Gadhichaur sub health post doesn't even have basic
medicines to distribute among the villagers suffering with the
disease.

Dysentery has gripped Khandbari and adjoining villages in
Sankhuwasabha district. More than 2000 people have been suffering
from the disease for a week. With villagers having no alternative but
to consume polluted water, the disease has spread in Wana, Syabun,
Dhupu, Matsepokhari VDCs, and Khandbari municipality.

The number of patients suffering from dysentery has been increasing
every day, the Khandbari-based District Hospital said, adding that
over 2000 villagers in Khandbari and adjoining areas are suffering
from the disease. "More than 50 dysentery patients visit the hospital
daily," acting district public health officer Dr Rudra Prasad
Marasini said. The number of patients has been increasing, as
villagers continue to consume polluted water, he added.

[5] Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab)

Rawalpindi General Hospital (RGH) received another 8 suspected
patients with cholera within the past 3 days, which has strengthened
further doubts of health experts regarding the outbreak of the
infection. Of the recently suspected cases, 5 belong to Rawalpindi
while 3 others belong to Chakwal, Gujar Khan, and Attock that
according to health professionals hints that the infection might be
epidemic in nature.

"We have sent stool samples of all the recently suspected 8 cases of
cholera to National Institute of Health, Islamabad for confirmatory
tests," said RGH acting chief Dr Fiaz Ahmed Khan while talking to
'The News' Monday [30 Jun 2008]. Meanwhile, the RGH has received
confirmatory reports of 7 other suspected cases of the disease from
the NIH that has tested 2 more cases positive. The total number of
cholera cases so far confirmed at the RGH is 16.

To date, a total of 48 patients have been suspected of cholera since
5 Jun 2008. Of the 48 suspects, the NIH has tested 16 positive and 22
negative. The RGH has yet to receive confirmation reports of the 10
remaining cases.

According to hospital administration, all cases of cholera including
suspected and confirmed ones that have consulted RGH so far range
between the ages of 8 months and 13 years. At present 5 suspected
patients of cholera are undergoing treatment at the RGH, while all
confirmed patients of the infection have been discharged.

[6] Cholera - India (Delhi)

With sporadic rains hitting the capital in 2008, the number of
cholera cases is also rising. So far, the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi (MCD) has reported 374 cases from all over Delhi. "The
situation is not as bad as 2007. By this time in 2007, 1091 cases had
been registered with us, which definitely called for worry," says Dr
NK Yadav, medical health officer (MHO), MCD.

"Cholera is like any other water-borne disease, it calls for drinking
safe and purified drinking water. Especially in this season, one
should keep away from cut fruits sold on the road sides as infection
starts right there," says Dr Bir Singh, professor of community
medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Dr Singh
advises that people stick to home cooked food and boiled water. Even
when eating fruits at home, one should wash them several times before
consuming them.

[7] Cholera - Indonesia (West Papua)

New reports from Human Rights and Church sources in West Papua state
that 85 people have died in a cholera outbreak over the past 3 months
(April-June 2008) in the adjacent Nabire and Paniai regencies of West
Papua.

Previous reports by Indonesian authorities in early June 2008 stated
17 people had died. At that time health authorities disputed figures
from West Papuan Human Rights workers that there had actually been 34
fatalities if cases in the villages were counted.

The Papua Health Office was reported in the Jakarta Post (4 Jun 2008)
as identifying an "Ogawa-type _Vibrio cholerae_ infection" following
tests in Jayapura.

This cholera epidemic was first reported in Paniai in early April
2008 at Ekemanida village. It has spread to nearby villages at Kamuu
and North Kamuu Districts. The villages where the disease was
reported are Ekemanida, Idakotu, Dogimani/Idadagi, Makidimi/Egebutu,
Ekimani/Nuwa, Denemani/Apagogi, Kimupugi, Dikiyouwo, Duntek, Boduda,
Deiyai, Goodide, Idakebo, Mogou, and Dogimani.

In March and April 2006, in the highland regencies of Jayawijaya and
Yahukimo, 178 and 33 indigenous West Papuans respectively died
reportedly from cholera.
