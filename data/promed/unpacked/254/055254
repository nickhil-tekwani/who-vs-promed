A girl died of bird flu in an Indonesian village that has been hard hit by
the disease, officials said on Thu [17 Aug 2006], as they awaited test
results for another child who fell ill in the same area.
The death of the [9-year-old girl] raised the country's toll from H5N1
virus infection to 46 and sparked an investigation by the Health Ministry
amid fears of a possible new cluster. The 9-year-old died early this week,
one day after being admitted to a hospital in West Java province, and
laboratory test results confirmed on Thu that she had the disease, said
senior health official Nyoman Kandun.
Bird flu has killed at least 140 people worldwide since it began ravaging
Asian poultry stocks in late 2003, with Indonesia tallying the highest
number of human deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Most
people have been infected after coming into contact with infected birds,
but experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that spreads easily
among humans, potentially sparking a pandemic.
Health officials were looking closely at the girl's village, Cikelet, West
Java, 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of the capital Jakarta. There
have been 7 confirmed or suspected bird flu deaths or illnesses in the
hamlet. The girl's neighbor was sickened by the H5N1 virus [as was his]
cousin, and 3 others died before tests could be taken.
Officials said on Thu [17 Aug 2006] they were awaiting lab results for a
[female] child who was hospitalized Wednesday in West Java's capital of
Bandung, where she was given the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, said Eka Sony, a
health official. "She is recovering," he said. "We are waiting for the test
results to return."
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said she was confident those infected
in Cikelet had come into contact with chickens -- scores of which have died
in recent weeks. But she said authorities would carry out tests to make
sure the virus was not passed from person to person, since there have been
so many suspected or confirmed cases there.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 27
-----------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 17 Aug 2006, The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed
the country's 58th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The case occurred in a 9-year-old girl from a remote village in
Garut district, West Java Province. She developed symptoms on 1 Aug 2006,
was hospitalized on 14 Aug, and died on 15 Aug 2006. Recent chicken deaths
were reported in her household.
Three hamlets within the village are currently under investigation. An
additional case [the 57th confirmed case] from the village, but from
another hamlet, was confirmed by the Ministry of Health on 14 Aug. This
17-year-old male developed symptoms on 26 Jul and is now recovering.
Another death from severe respiratory disease occurred on 5 Aug 2006 in a
20-year-old neighbour, who is also now known to be a cousin. As no samples
were taken for testing, the cause of his illness remains uncertain. Based
on epidemiological and clinical findings, however, infection with the H5N1
virus is strongly suspected. As both young men developed symptoms on the
same day (26 Jul), epidemiologists assume that they acquired their
infection from a shared environmental source. The currently recognized
incubation period for H5N1 infection of 2 to 8 days makes human-human
transmission between the 2 highly improbable.
Teams from local health authorities, the Ministry of Health, and WHO are
currently in the 3 hamlets investigating these cases and assessing the
overall situation. Team members include experts in animal health. Recent
die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the village, and all 3
cases described above had documented exposure to diseased chickens.
Heightened awareness in the hamlets, supported by the presence of
well-equipped teams, has led to the presentation of additional persons for
medical evaluation. Specimens have been taken and tests are being
conducted. Rumours of additional deaths from respiratory disease in the
hamlets in late July and early August 2006 are also being investigated.
Although the village is remote and access by road is difficult, good
communications from the field have been established with the Ministry of
Health and WHO.
Of the 58 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 45 have been fatal.

In previous press reports from Indonesia, the "hamlets" were described as
neighboring "villages" in the Garut district of West Java, whereas the WHO
report downgrades these villages to the status of hamlets within the same
village. This reclassification notwithstanding, the WHO epidemiologists
have discounted the existence of a cluster of cases arising as a
consequence of human-to-human transmission of infection on the basis of
synchrony in the appearance of symptoms. - Mod.CP]

The Ministry of Public Health on Tue 15 Aug 2006 confirmed that only 2
people have died from bird flu in Thailand [so far in 2006] and said lab
tests on 2 suspected cases [established] that they did not have the deadly
avian flu virus.
Sansanee Nakpong, government deputy spokesperson, said the Minister of
Public Health informed the cabinet meeting here on Tue 15 Aug that Thailand
has officially recorded only 2 bird flu deaths since early this year. Ms.
Sansanee said the Ministry of Public Health would take 2 patients thought
of having suffered from the virus off the country's suspect list as results
from their lab tests against bird flu were negative.
"Until now, only 2 people have been confirmed as bird flu deaths during the
ongoing outbreak. One was in Phichit and the other was from Uthai Thani,"
she told reporters after the cabinet meeting. The Ministry has initiated
surveillance to monitor for bird flu in chickens and in humans nationwide
since the beginning of this year and has so far put over 3600 people under
a health quarantine after the recent reemergence of the deadly H5N1 strain
of bird flu virus in many provinces across the country.
According to Public Health Minister Pinij Jarusombat, a 66-year-old woman
and a 24-year-old man were reportedly admitted to hospitals for flu-like
symptoms, but doctors put them on suspect list for bird flu even though
they did not have a contact with dead chickens before their illnesses [see:
Avian influenza, human (117): Asia 20060812.2261. - Mod.CP].
He said laboratory tests and lung X-rays on the 2 patients showed they did
not have bird flu, but other viral infections. He said doctors were
convinced the woman was infected with human influenza virus type A, while
further tests would be conducted on the male patient to determine what
virus or bacteria sickened him.
The minister withdrew a team of epidemiologists and a rapid mobile lab unit
from northeastern Nakhon Phanom province after the bird flu outbreak there
was contained. The team would be stationed in Khon Kaen province, said the
minister. "This year, we have had outbreaks of human [seasonal] flu, bird
flu and dengue fever all at the same time. Our health officials have worked
very hard," he said. Thailand has reported 24 000 dengue fever cases [so
far in 2006], said the minister, about 1000 more than [in 2005]. "To
diagnose these diseases correctly, health officials have to realise what
viruses are around," he said.

[Therefore the number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza in
Thailand remains 24 with 16 deaths. As of 17 Aug 2006 the single confirmed
case in Indonesia raises the global total of human cases to 239 including
140 fatalities
