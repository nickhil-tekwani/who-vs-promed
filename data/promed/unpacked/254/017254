Anthrax Outbreaks in Bangladesh, 2009-2010

Abstract
--------
During August 2009-October 2010, a multidisciplinary team investigated 14 outbreaks of animal and human anthrax in Bangladesh to identify the etiology, pathway of transmission, and social, behavioral, and cultural factors that led to these outbreaks. The team identified 140 animal cases of anthrax and 273 human cases of cutaneous anthrax. 91 percent of persons in whom cutaneous anthrax developed had history of butchering sick animals, handling raw meat, contact with animal skin, or were present at slaughtering sites. Each year, _Bacillus anthracis_ of identical genotypes were isolated from animal and human cases. Inadequate livestock vaccination coverage, lack of awareness of the risk of anthrax transmission from animal to humans, social norms and poverty contributed to these outbreaks. Addressing these challenges and adopting a joint animal and human health approach could contribute to detecting and preventing such outbreaks in the future.

Bangladesh anthrax outbreaks are probably caused by contaminated livestock feed

Summary
-------
In Bangladesh from 1 Jul to 30 Sep 2010 there were 104 animal cases of anthrax and 607 associated human cases. This investigation was conducted in Sirajganj district in December 2010, on 8 farms where animal cases had occurred. _Bacillus anthracis_ was recovered from soil samples and turbinate bones on 6 farms.

Canonical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis showed that all the isolates belonged to the major lineage A, sublineage A.Br.001/002 of China and South East Asia while a multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) with 15 VNTRs demonstrated 3 unique genotypes. The single nucleotide repeat (SNR) analyses showed 2 SNR types in 97 out of 99 isolates; nevertheless, due to its higher discriminatory power the presence of 2 isolates with different SNR-type polymorphisms were detected within 2 MLVA genotypes. The epidemic occurred during the monsoon season, a time of extensive flooding, suggesting that the source was contaminated feed, not grazing, which is supported by the genetic variance.

[The full article for item [1] is available on line. It is a thorough overview of what happened.

Item [2] is a paper covering a 2-week in-country investigation by Antonio [A. Fasanella] and me when it was immediately clear that the epidemic must have followed upon the feeding on contaminated livestock feed. It had occurred during the previous monsoon when essentially all the paddy-fields and grazing were deeply covered by water. The result was that all livestock were housed and handfed. A subsequent analysis of feed samples from the 2011 outbreaks confirmed that feed contamination occurs. Anyone wanting to read the full script should contact me for a copy or download one from the journal. - Mod.MHJ]
