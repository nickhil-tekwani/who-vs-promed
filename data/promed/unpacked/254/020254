WHITE NOSE SYNDROME, BATS - USA (11)

Apparently malnutrition is one part of the development of the
disease, such that energy-depleted bats are coming out of hibernation
in winter to hunt for insects.

Would there be any use in populating the bat caves with harmless
insects cultured for the purpose? Wax-worm moths pre-sterilized with
gamma irradiation would be one possibility. Bait producers could be a
plentiful source of breeding stock. One might even dust the insects
with antibiotic powder if one knew what pathogens are afoot or a-wing.

[Whether the apparent fungus involved in white nose syndrome causes
malnutrition or whether it results in higher metabolism that causes
the rapid burning of stored fat is not well understood.

Dr. Baker's proposal sounds reasonable on the face of it, but I am
uncertain as to whether bat behavior would allow the bats to eat the
worms or whether prey must be in flight for the bats to consume them. - Mod.TG]
