A Northland dry stock farm has tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_, the first confirmed infection in the region. Biosecurity New Zealand said on Thursday [30 Aug 2018] that a property in Northland had tested positive for the cattle disease, taking the number of infected properties nationwide to 37.

The infected property was a dry stock beef farm. It was identified through the tracing of animal movements from other infected farms and was now under a "restricted place" notice. Restricted place notices mean a property is effectively in quarantine lockdown, with no movement of animals or other risk goods on and off the farm.

Biosecurity New Zealand would not name the farm, but neighbours who shared a boundary with the infected property had been notified. However, the risk to neighbouring farms was "very low."

Infected cattle on the property would be culled as part of the government's NZD 886 million [USD 587 million] attempt to eradicate the disease. Biosecurity New Zealand was planning a public meeting for next week [1st week of September 2018] in Northland, and further details would be announced in the next few days.

Federated Farmers Northland president John Blackwell said although the confirmation was not unexpected, it was disappointing the disease had reached the region. "This particular property had closed up shop a while ago and was having further testing so we knew this could be coming," he said. "We'd hoped it wouldn't get this far north but it just goes to show that it's not just a disease of the south," he said.

The welfare of the farmer involved was now the primary concern, Blackwell said. "Rural Support Trust are involved but it's also important farmers look out for other farmers and support each other. There's no point pointing fingers because farmers get this through no fault of their own," he said.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ was detected for the first time in New Zealand in July last year [2017]. The bacterial disease is harmless to humans and not transmitted through milk or meat but can cause untreatable mastitis, abortion and arthritis in cattle. Of the currently infected properties, 8 are in the North Island and 29 in the South Island, 18 of those in Canterbury.

[The Northland Region is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions. New Zealanders often call it the Far North, or, because of its mild climate, the Winterless North. The main population centre is the city of Whangarei and the largest town is Kerikeri https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is on the north of the northern island. This disease now seems to have reached almost the entire country, as cases are found on both islands. - Mod.TG
