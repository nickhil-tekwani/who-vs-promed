Measles kills 197 people in Malawi since January
------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak has killed 197 people in Malawi since the start of
this year [2010], the highest number recorded in Malawi in the last
decade, a senior health ministry official said Sunday [15 Aug 2010].
A total of 54 people died during the last outbreak of the viral
disease in this southern African country in 2000.

"About 77 000 people have been infected and 197, mostly children,
have died in the last 7 months," Dr. Storn Kabuluzi, director of
preventive health services at the department of health, told Reuters.
Measles is an infectious disease characterized by a high temperature
and red spots all over the body.

Large and deadly outbreaks of measles in 30 African countries
threaten to reverse gains made against the viral disease in the past
2 decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in May [2010].
More than 1100 deaths from measles have been reported among 64 000
known cases in Africa over the last year, it said. Chad, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe have had the largest outbreaks.

[A previous report from Malawi on 17 Jun 2010 listed about 12 000
case of measles and 70 deaths. Over the past 2 months these figures
have nearly quadrupled to 77 000 cases and 197 deaths. These
statistics confirm the WHO warning that despite the low cost and
effectiveness of the vaccine the gains made in measles control over
the past 2 decades in Africa are now in jeopardy.

In May 2010 the total for the whole of the African continent was 64
00 cases and 1100 deaths, a case-fatality rate higher than that
currently observed in Malawi.
