-- as in France. In fact, the institute is situated on Insel Riems,
an island in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Germany, to which

RFI: Bluetongue situation Germany
----------------------------------
I'd like to comment on the recent postings on the testing of sentinel
animals in Germany.
I have tried to get clarification on the issue of the German SCoFCAH
[Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health] presentation and
as far as I have learned the blood samples stated as samples of
sentinel animals in 2007 include actually the results of the blood
sampling campaign to source the sentinel animals. Thus, the 31
positive animals have been tested during routine screening and are
not indicative of recent virus activity.
From the sentinel animals earmarked [negative] as a result of the
sampling campaign so far, to my knowledge no animal has tested
positive for BTV [bluetongue virus]. The 2 "positive" sentinel
animals are the result of a mix up of eartag numbers on the holdings.
As sentinel animals have been [stationed] on holdings with known
disease history, sampling a wrong animal is likely to yield a positive result.

[This (informal) information, for which Sabine Zentis is gratefully
acknowledged, is one step further in unravelling the saga of the
sentinel bovines from North Rhine Westphalia.
Bluetongue sentinels, in an affected area, might be preferably sought
among young (less than 4 months) bovines, born November-December 2006.
We are still waiting for 1st hand, official information about the
current BTV situation in the affected regions: culicoides activity,
virus presence, or preferably, absence.... - Mod.AS].
