There has been an anthrax outbreak in Mutare and Vumba with confirmed cases at Leopard Rock and Zimbabwe Prisons & Correctional Service (ZPCS)'s Mutare Prison Farm which has been forced to temporarily close its abattoir. SPCA's Lynne James confirmed that all the animals at the ZPCS farm have been vaccinated band their horses are under quarantine until [10 Mar 2019].

Leopard Rock also has a suspected case of this disease.

"We also have plenty cattle wander all over Vumba roads currently as well as a large number of baboons and I am sure that all of this makes management of the disease all the more difficult and urgent," Sue Fenwick, a Vumba resident, said.

[The affected area of Mutare, Vumba, and Leopard Rock is on the eastern border of Manicaland with Mozambique.; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_physio-2002.jpg and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/01/Mutare.html. It is south east of Harare.

It is uncertain what has been affected where, but it would seem that there have been 3 outbreaks (Mutare & Mutare Prison Farm, Vumba) and maybe a wildlife case at Leopard Rock which is a wildlife park area with many tourist hotels.

In 2015 there was a similar outbreak in Chipinge to the immediate south of this area; see 8 Jan 2015 Anthrax - Zimbabwe: (MA) human, bovine 20150108.3079887. There is a background of repeated outbreaks in Manicaland. - Mod.MHJ
