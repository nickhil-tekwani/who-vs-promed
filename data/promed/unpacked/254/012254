Cameroon: Transmission of Simian Foamy Virus from Primates in the Wild
---------------------------------------------------
Simian foamy virus (SFV) is endemic in the gorillas and monkeys that
villagers in Cameroon hunt for bushmeat. SFV is endemic in African
apes and monkeys, although so far there is no evidence that it does
them -- or human beings -- any harm. But virologists are alarmed by
the presence of the virus in human beings, because human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to have crossed over from
apes through consumption of bushmeat at least 2 decades before it
became pandemic. [Simian foamy virus is a retrovirus now classified
in the genus _Spumavirus_ of the family _Retroviridae_, which
contrary to statements in the "Times" article, is phylogenetically
quite distinct from the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. -
Mod.CP]
A joint US and Cameroonian team led by Nathan Wolfe found that SFV
was infecting people in Cameroon from at least 3 different hosts:
gorillas and 2 monkey species, mandrills and guenons. Like HIV, SFV
is a retrovirus, a type that is particularly worrying because it can
inject its own genetic material into the DNA of the cells that it
infects, making it impossible to eradicate. "Our study is the first
to demonstrate that these retroviruses are actively crossing into
people," Dr Wolfe said. "It is in all our interests to put into
place economic alternatives to help people move away from hunting and
eating these animals. In addition to preserving endangered species,
such development efforts will reduce the risk that ongoing
cross-species transmission of retroviruses and other pathogens could
spark future epidemics similar to HIV."
Dr Wolfe and his colleagues examined blood samples in different parts
of Cameroon from almost 1100 people who were taking part in an
HIV-prevention programme. All said that they had had some contact
with monkey and ape blood through hunting and butchering them.
Antibodies to SFV were found in 10 people, 1 percent of the sample,
showing that they had been exposed to SFV. More detailed analysis of
samples from 3 people confirmed the presence of the DNA of the simian
virus, and the team reports in The Lancet [see below] that it was
able to match the viral DNA to that found in gorillas, mandrills, and
guenons. Mandrills are the largest of the monkeys, while the closest
match among the guenons was with a monkey called Dr Brazza's guenon,
which can weigh up to 7 kg (15.4 lb).
Each of the 3 people came from different villages in the lowland
forest of southern Cameroon, an area where there are many different
species of primates and the place where HIV is believed to have first
jumped from monkeys into man. One of the 3, a 45-year-old man, said
that he butchered and ate monkey, chimpanzee, and gorilla and
regularly hunted them using guns, bows, and wire snares. The other 2,
a 48-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man, told similar stories. None
appeared unwell. In the past, zoo keepers and those who look after
monkeys have occasionally been infected with SFV, but there has never
been any evidence that this has led to disease. But the fact that
such infections are occurring regularly, from a range of hosts,
raises the risk of another HIV epidemic in the making.
SFV is so-called because [unlike other retroviruses] it causes cells
to clump together [form syncytia] and look, on a slide, like foamy
bubbles. [Similar foamy viruses of other species were initially
called syncytium-forming viruses, and found as occasional
contaminants of primary cell cultures. - Mod.CP] SFV has been called
"a virus in search of a disease" and has been tentatively linked to
several diseases but without any real evidence. In 1998, Walid
Heneine and colleagues at the US Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta tested the blood of 231 lab workers who handled
monkeys and found that 4 had become infected with SFV. [Evidence of
SFV infection included seropositivity, proviral DNA detection, and
isolation of syncytium-producing virus. - Mod.CP] Dr Heneine, who
also took part in the new research, said that one man had been
infected for 20 years and another for 9 without apparent damage. "Any
time you find a transfer of a retrovirus it raises a lot of concern,"
he said. "But despite long durations of infections, they are still
very healthy and there is no history of disease."
In a commentary in The Lancet, Martine Peeters, of the Institute of
Research for Development in Montpellier, France, said it was not
impossible that foamy viruses might cause disease in human beings
after a long incubation period. She said the next step was to see if
human-to-human transmission was occurring in Africa, whether there
were clusters of infection, and whether infection could be linked to
any disease. Dr Peeters said: "Human infection with simian
retroviruses, which have a long incubation period, might spread
unrecognised for several years and lead to a disease epidemic."

[Spumaviruses (foamy viruses) are complex retroviruses which are
widespread in many species of mammals. Spumaviruses are harboured by
domestic cats, cattle, and other animals in close contact with
humans, but have not been associated so far with any disease state in
any host. These viruses appear to be ubiquitous in all nonhuman
primates, but only to be present in humans as rare zoonotic
transmissions as described in the above report. The replication of
foamy viruses differs from the standard retrovirus pattern in several
important respects, and this sets the spumaviruses apart from the
more familiar oncogenic and immunodeficiency retroviruses. In
particular, there are 2 transcription start sites in the genome, the
polymerase (transcriptase) protein is expressed from a spliced
subgenomic mRNA, and reverse-transcribed DNA is present in large
amount in the extracellular virion. Infection of natural hosts by
spumaviruses leads to a lifelong persistent infection, without any
evidence of pathology. In general there is no epidemiological
evidence of spumavirus pathogenicity in natural, experimental, or
zoonotic infections. This should be kept in mind to put the research
described in the Lancet paper in its proper context.
The Lancet paper (Volume 363, Number 9413, 932-37, Sat 20 Mar 2004),
on which the Times newspaper article is based, is entitled:

The Abstract is as follows:
"Hunting and butchering of wild non-human primates infected with
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is thought to have sparked the
HIV pandemic. Although SIV and other primate retroviruses infect
laboratory workers and zoo workers, zoonotic retrovirus transmission
has not been documented in natural settings.
We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central
Africa. We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral
blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in
Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to
obtain evidence of retrovirus infection.
Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus
endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living
in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and
body fluids of wild non-human primates. 10 (1 percent) of 1099
individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these
individuals revealed 3 geographically-independent human SFV
infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human
primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (_Cercopithecus neglectus_),
mandrill (_Mandrillus sphinx_), and gorilla (_Gorilla gorilla_), 2 of
which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with
SIV.
Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human
populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are
currently infected with SFV. Contact with non-human primates, such as
happens during hunting and butchering, can play a part in the
emergence of human retroviruses, and the reduction of primate
bushmeat hunting has the potential to decrease the frequency of
disease emergence."
Other human populations have been screened for evidence of natural
spumavirus infection with no positive outcome. This investigation has
succeeded by targeting individuals reporting contact with non-human
primates in the wild. However, whether cross-species transmission
(either by contact with primates in the wild or consumption of
bushmeat) will alter the apathogenic nature of spumavirus infection
remains an open question. - Mod.CP]
