Central Ohio health officials added another case of _E. coli_ O157:H7
illness yesterday [23 Jun 2008], bringing the tally for the outbreak
in Delaware, Fairfield, and Franklin counties to 16. Of these, 11
have been genetically matched, meaning they are probably from a
common source.

Central Ohio's _E. coli_ outbreak has been linked to one case each in
Seneca and Lucas counties and to cases in Michigan, where health
officials have implicated ground beef but haven't nailed down a
specific source. Federal health and agriculture officials are
involved in the investigation.

Kristopher Weiss, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Health said 2
food samples have been sent to the Ohio Department of Agriculture for
testing, but results were not expected today [24 Jun 2008].

Michigan health investigators still hope to have an answer by
midweek, said James McCurtis, spokesman for that state's Department
of Community Health.

Cases were first reported in early June 2008. The bacteria have
sickened everyone from preschoolers to the elderly. Several people
have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been linked to this
outbreak.

[At this point, the source of the outbreak strain of _E. coli_
O157:H7 is unclear. The classical vehicle is uncooked ground beef
and, especially given the summer when more barbeques occur, would be
high on any suspect food list. It is also clear that salad
ingredients such as lettuce or spinach can be involved in large
outbreaks of the pathogen.

There are 88 counties in Ohio and the ones mentioned can be found on a map at

Specifically, Franklin, Delaware, and Fairfield counties are
clustered together in central Ohio. - Mod.LL]
