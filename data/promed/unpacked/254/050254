While the EU veterinary experts failed to muster the necessary majority to
approve an EU Commission plan to end the 30-month-old trade blockade, it is
now almost certain that a deal will be done when the matter is passed to EU
agricultural ministers meeting on November 23. Under complex EU voting
procedures, today's vote of the vets was deemed insufficient - although
eight of the experts were in favour of lifting the ban with only five
against and two abstentions.
For the ban to be ended immediately a bigger "qualified majority" of the
vets was needed. But when the issue is voted on by the farm ministers later
this month an end to the ban will be approved on the basis of today's vote.
This is because at ministerial level eight members states will be required
to actively oppose lifting the ban. The vote of the vets signals that such
a scale of opposition is not in prospects.
EU Commission officials refuse to reveal how the 15 veterinary experts -
one from each member state - had voted today [see below for another
version. - MHJ, although it is known that Germany was one of the five
opposing an end to the ban.
If, as expected, the farm ministers approve an end to the ban it will mean
the resumption of all British beef exports from England, Scotland and Wales
and an inevitable fight to restore lucrative exports markets which have
been lost since the trade was banned by the Commission in response to
consumer fears over the British outbreak of BSE. British government
officials will be using the next few weeks to muster support among wavering
member states in a bid to win the largest possible support to remove the
ban.
The block on beef exports to Northern Ireland was lifted last March, thanks
to the province's sophisticated computerised monitoring system which
convinced Brussels that the spread of BSE has been contained there. The
export ban on older beef remains in place in England, Wales and Scotland.
However, the proposal which now goes to the vote on November 23 will allow
the resumption of exports of beef and beef products from animals born after
August 1 1996 - the date when the original ban on feeding meat and bonemeal
to livestock first came into effect.
As virtually all beef for exports comes from young animals born since that
date, the Commission's proposals, when approved by the agriculture
ministers, will effectively mean the end of the devastating global embargo
on British beef which was imposed on March 27 1996.
The countries which voted against lifting the ban were Germany, France,
Spain, Italy and Austria. Luxembourg and Holland abstained. But the
veterinary experts from Britain, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Sweden,
Finland, Belgium and Denmark supported a return to normal beef export
trade. That voting breakdown is likely to be reflected in the separate vote
of EU farm ministers - giving Britain the necessary support to end the ban.
