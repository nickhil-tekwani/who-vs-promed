South Carolina has confirmed its 1st instances of Asian soybean rust
in 3 counties: Dorchester, Hampton and Orangeburg. Rust has also been
confirmed in DeKalb County, Alabama; Stewart and Sumter counties in
Georgia; the parishes of East Carroll, West Carroll, Tensas,
Tangipahoa, St. John and East Baton Rouge in Louisiana; and Carroll,
Grenada and Webster counties in Mississippi. Rust was also confirmed
in San Luis Potosi, Tamui, Mexico over the weekend.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is caused by the fungus _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_. It can cause premature defoliation with yield losses of
up to 70 percent reported on farms in Asia. It is widespread in Asia
and Africa, but data are lacking on its establishment in Europe.
Besides soybean, a number of other species of _Fabaceae_, for example
kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), can also be affected and can serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Spores are spread by wind over long distances.
Fungicides may be used in disease management, and partially resistant
soybean lines are available. However, new fungal strains with
increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging. A
less-virulent related species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in South
America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms.

ASR was introduced into the USA in 2004 and was reported for the 1st
time in Mexico in 2005. It over-winters in southern regions, and
spores are being carried northwards every season. The disease spreads
locally from the initial focus of infection, and several epidemic
cycles may occur in one growing season. By the end of 2007, ASR had
been reported as far north as Canada.
