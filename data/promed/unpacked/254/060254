DISEASE REPORT, ANIMALS - ETHIOPIA: SOUTH (02)

I am writing in response to the article "Ethiopia: Extended dry
season in Borena zone, 29 Feb 2008," posted on your ProMED site
[Posted by ProMED-mail on 3 Mar 2008, copied from ReliefWeb, an
on-line gateway to information on humanitarian emergencies and
disasters, administered by the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). - Mod.AS].

Indeed, it is true that drought has affected Borena zone, and the
government of Ethiopia in collaboration with its partners
(international organizations and NGOs) has been doing all its best to
alleviate the problem. So far, the restocking plan proposed by the
government and the stakeholders is not being supported by some of the
affected livestock owners due the fact that the supply of water and
feed to the animals could show a positive result, and, therefore, the
farmers preferred to keep their animals rather than to sell them.
This doesn't mean that the problem in the area was not alarming.

What worried me is that the terminology (bloody diarrhea) mentioned
along with the disease types -- to quote what was posted:
"...reported cases of livestock diseases including anthrax, black
leg, bloody diarrhea and FMD" -- is very confusing and misleading to
the broad reader of this article. Firstly, bloody diarrhea is not a
disease; it doesn't have a specific causative agent. It can be due to
infectious or non-infectious agents, including intoxication.
Therefore, posters of the article should have consulted the right
people (professionals), be it their own or those of the government.
Secondly, whatever concern may have existed, verification of the
issue should come first before rushing to post something out of one's
professional knowledge.

My 2nd point: The moderator posted: "It will be of importance to
obtain information on the presence or, hopefully, absence of Rift
Valley fever (RVF) in the described region." For this apparently
genuine concern, I wish to make clear to the readers that the
Ethiopian government, following last year's [2007] RVF outbreak both
in Kenya and the Sudan, has been assessing the borders and has
collected epidemiologically important numbers of samples and produced
diagnoses using internationally recognized diagnostic tools. So far,
there is no indication confirming the presence of RVF in the country.

[Dr Gebreegziabher's observations, and in particular the reassuring
information on RVF surveillance leading us to conclude its current
absence, are much appreciated. Obtaining firsthand information from
official professional sources is one of ProMED-mail's main
objectives; many thanks.

As to the comments on the epidemiological data distributed by
WebRelief, for subscribers' convenience, we hereby copy ProMED-mail's
commentary as included in the original discussed posting
20080302.0853:

"The above description of the animal health situation in Ethiopia is
rather superficial and blurred. Obviously, poor nutritional
conditions seriously affect animal resistance to infectious as well
as non-infectious disease agents; increased animal movement and
nomadic wandering in search of feed and pasture have their own
deleterious effects, particularly related to infectious diseases. A
map of Ethiopia is included in the report.

The term "bloody diarrhea" is not specific; there are various
etiologies related to the appearance of hemorrhagic enteritis in
cattle and small ruminants, such as bacterial, parasitological (e.g.
helminths), protozoal, viral and nutritional-related.
Clostridia-related toxins may play their role as well. Rinderpest
should be excluded.

FMD is endemic in Ethiopia. According to the data of the World
reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, UK, the most recent FMDV
serotypes identified in Ethiopia were O (2007), C (1983), A (2007),
SAT2 (2007) and SAT1 (2007). For further details, including
sequencing results, subscribers are referred to
