Sindh government on [Wed 21 Dec 2016] has finally identified that _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is responsible for spreading chikungunya virus in Karachi.

The provincial government has said that the disease would be declared epidemic after confirmation from World Health Organization (WHO).

_Aedes aegypti_, the yellow fever mosquito, is a mosquito that can also cause [transmit] dengue fever and Zika fever [viruses], etc.

On the other hand, another 700 people were admitted to Saudabad Hospital in 24 hours over complaints with chikungunya virus in Karachi's Malir. Sources told that the disease has been spread to adjoining areas of Malir including Korangi, Madina Colony, Liaquat Market, and Khokhrapar.

Doctors are only relying on paracetamol tablets as a cure to the disease that paralyses hands and feet with severe fever and pain in joints.

The medical staff said that the report of the affectees is likely to be received on [Thu 22 Dec 2016] while the patients stated that they need to buy medicines and syringes from medical stores due to inadequate facilities in the hospital.

[Interestingly, previous reports in the popular press indicated that Karachi had 30 000 cases of a "mystery disease". A 19 Dec 2016 report (http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/366034-Mysterious-disease-affects-30000-people-in-Karach) stated that, "Sindh Health Minister Dr Sikandar Mandhro on [Mon 19 Dec 2016] has declared emergency in Malir after outbreak of mysterious disease that caught more than 30 000 patients in one month. According to sources, health minister visited Saudabad hospital and said that identification of virus would take time however, blood samples have been dispatched to laboratory. 'Officially, the disease hasn't been diagnosed as yet but the experts believe it could be chikungunya virus, considering the symptoms', he added."

A later report (20 Dec 2016; https://www.geo.tv/latest/124324-No-case-of-Chikungunya-virus-in-Pakistan-WHO) stated, "No case of chikungunya virus has been confirmed in Pakistan till date. Any information circulating with regard to confirmation of any case is incorrect and misleading, informs a joint statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health [in Islamabad, Sun 18 Dec 2016]. The statement has been issued in view of unconfirmed reports about the presence of chikungunya virus in Karachi, Sindh, especially in the areas of Malir."

These reports illustrate 2 important points: first, that a large outbreak like this one can cause public panic, so cautions statements are prudent to calm the public; and 2nd, timely laboratory confirmation is essential to know which pathogen is causing the disease. Although samples from 30 000 patients would place a heavy workload on the laboratory a smaller sample size could be tested. Curiously, there are no statements indicating what the Karachi health authorities plan to do to reduce transmission through vector control. It also seems odd that there is reluctance to declare this an epidemic, given the 30 000 cases in one month's time. Although chikungunya virus infections are seldom fatal, they can cause prolonged incapacitation due to severe arthralgia that can persist for weeks or months. If the 30 000 cases are, in fact, due to chikungunya virus infections, the health authorities may have to deal with a large number of incapacitated patients over the coming year (2017).

In an 18 Dec 2016 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161218.4706486) concerning this outbreak, Mod.UBA commented, "However, the report also states that the suspected cases are based on clinical picture and not on laboratory confirmation. A laboratory testing facility is currently available at the national public health laboratory at National Institute of Health, Islamabad.

"The most common symptoms of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported from neighboring countries like India and Nepal and other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. According to WHO information, Pakistan is also among countries having documented endemic or epidemic chikungunya disease (http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/arbo-viral/other_arboviral_chikungunya/en/)."
