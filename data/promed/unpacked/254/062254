Rust could overwinter in Florida, Gulf Coast states
---------------------------------------------------
As federal and Louisiana plant disease experts flood to the scene of the
1st confirmed case of Asian soybean rust in the United States, university
experts offer insight on how quickly the fungus might spread to soybeans in
other areas of the US.
Soybean rust could easily move from the southern states to the Midwest
during the next growing season if conditions are favorable, says Ray
Martyn, a Purdue University plant pathologist who was part of a team of
researchers that plotted the potential rate for spread of the disease in
the US for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
According to Martyn, if it is found in 1 location, it is likely that it is
also on other nearby spots not yet detected. Moreover, if it is not
controlled in Louisiana, then it could be a problem for Indiana farmers
next summer.
A look at the long term normal temperatures for the area affected by rust
in South America shows the disease could overwinter down to latitude 30
degrees south, according to a 2004 research report by S Pivonia and XB
Yang, Iowa State University plant pathologists. In the US, the possible
overwintering zone is up to about latitude 28-29 degrees north in Florida
and in the western Gulf of Mexico coastal regions, the researchers said in
the report.
To overwinter, the disease would need to infect one or more of 40 known
hosts for the disease. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), a common weed, is one of
them. Others include yellow sweet clover (_Melilotus officinalis_), winter
vetch (_Vicia villosa_) and blue lupine (_Lupinus angustifolius_). All are
cultivated as winter forage and silage crops in the south.
"If a plant stays moderately green all winter and it's a host for the
disease, then soybean rust could overwinter in the extreme southern parts
of the United States," Martyn said. "In the event that _P. pachyrhizi_
[Asian soybean rust] becomes well established around the Caribbean/Gulf of
Mexico basin, aerial transport of soybean rust spores into the continental
interior of North America is likely to occur each spring." Even if soybean
rust is established in this country, it also needs humidity and moderate
temperatures in order to spread, Martyn adds. In addition, the disease
prefers cooler weather. Greg Shaner, Purdue plant pathologist, says the
spring and summer southerly breezes could easily transport soybean rust
spores from state to state as the growing season progresses.
"Studies of soybean rust in China and Brazil can provide some insight into
what we can expect, but our climate and growing conditions are not the same
as in those countries," Shaner said. "For instance, China doesn't have the
strong jet stream winds that travel our continent. Those winds can
transport spores quite readily."
Martyn and Shaner say even if soybean rust stays in the US, the problem
could vary greatly from year to year. "It is unlikely to overwinter in
Indiana, so it would have to move up from the south each year," Martyn
said. "If southern farmers have good control measures and a growing season
turns out to be hot and dry, then you would not expect to have a widespread
soybean rust problem that year."

[Surveys within the past few days have confirmed that _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_ [Pr], the fungus that causes soybean rust, was detected in
research plots at Louisiana State University and on farms near Natchez,
Mississippi. Research by S Pivonia and XB Yang, Iowa State University,
Department of Plant Pathology, Ames, Iowa has shown that, globally, soybean
production regions can be divided into 2 types: type 1 areas, where the
disease can survive year-round on suitable hosts, and type 2 areas, where
disease occurrence depends on an external source of inoculum after long
distance dispersal from a source area. Most regions where SR is known to
occur are in areas of type 1. After soybean rust enters the United States,
the fungus is likely to overwinter in parts of Florida and southern Texas.
Major soybean production regions in the United States and central Argentina
are, like Central China, type 2 areas.
