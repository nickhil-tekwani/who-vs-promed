I am a nutritionist working with the fur industry in North America. As
carnivors, most of the diet consists of animal by-products. In areas such as
Atlantic Canada, a significant portion of the diet will consist of fish
waste and related by-products. Over the past few years, as some of the
Provinces have resumed the seal hunt, some seal meat and seal by-prooducts
are finding their way into the farm raised mink and fox food chain.
Last year and this year as these products have become more available, we
have seen an increase in foot rot and related staph infections [in mink and
foxes]. Many of these have been typed as _Staph-intermedius_. This is a
common bacterium that has to date only affected animals with imparred immune
response.
What's odd are the characteristic leg swelling and foot infections common to
almost all the producers [animals] that are feeding seal products. Do you
know of any reason? It's been suggested that because _Staph-intermedius_ is
a common bacterium, that it is likley [to be] a secondary infection to a
primary virus or anerobe. I have been told that there is a common infection
to sealers called "seal finger", presumably an infection due to a cut and
causing the loss of the finger. I have also been told that some seal
populations are plagued with venereal disease that these symptoms resemble.
I'm looking for direction, contacts and more information .... can you be of
any help?
