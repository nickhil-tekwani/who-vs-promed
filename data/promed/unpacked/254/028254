Further comment on vesicular exanthema of swine
-----------------------------------------------
Comments previously posted [see: ProMED-mail post archived as Vesivirus,
bovine - USA (Oregon) (03) 20020302.3661 regarding the moderator's
correctness in stating "that the disease named vesicular exanthema of swine
has not recurred in swine" need further consideration.
Three virus isolates designated "indistinguishable from vesicular exanthema
of swine virus" were recovered from a commercial swine herd exhibiting
classic signs of the disease vesicular exanthema of swine (VES) -- that is,
limping pigs with foot lesions 2 decades after the last officially reported
outbreaks. The herd was antibody positive for the disease and the virus
produced classic VES in experimentally exposed swine. The entire herd was
destroyed because the swine tested positive for a second reportable
disease, brucellosis (Smith AW, Boyt PM. J Zoo Wildlf Med 1990; 21: 2-23).
This incident was reported as an outbreak of brucellosis not as a
recurrence of VES, although VES was apparent clinically and confirmed by
laboratory testing.
One should not let nuances involving historic events centering on
regulatory decisions detract from the considerable relevance of the current
peer-reviewed publication (Smith AW, et al. JAVMA 2002; 220: 455-8) cited
in the press coverage posted to ProMED-mail on 16 Feb 2002 [see:
"Vesivirus, bovine - USA (Oregon) 20020218.3581". Concern for the
emergence of these vesiviruses of oceanic origin as versatile
_Caliciviridae_ pathogens should be kept uppermost. They have implications
for agriculture, regulatory matters, water quality,
ecoterrorism/bioterrorism, food safety/seafood safety, animal health, and
human health. I would agree with the moderator that, in light of current
knowledge, the "Foreign Animal Disease Agent" designation for this virus
group should be revisited.
