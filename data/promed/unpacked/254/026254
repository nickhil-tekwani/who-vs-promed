Transmission of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ by the feces of Triatomine bugs
-----------------------------------------------
In the post "Trypanosomiasis, tigers - Pakistan (02) 20060425.1206" it was
stated that "in South America, trypanosomiasis caused by _T.cruzi_ is
transmitted by the bite of triatomine bugs, such as _Triatoma infestans_".
This disease is not transmitted by the bite of triatomine bugs but by their
infectious feces.

[Dr Gekeler is of course right, and we thank him for this correction. I am
afraid that, being under considerable pressure to correct a very large
manuscript for a publishing firm with a very short deadline, I hurried my
comments! So, Mea culpa.
In fact, the bugs secrete a liquid or semi-liquid feces while feeding on a
host, such as humans, which may be contaminated with the metacyclic forms
of _T. cruzi_ derived from a previous blood-meal. Infection occurs when
people rub or scratch the feces into skin abrasions or in the puncture left
by the bug's bite, or when feces get rubbed into the eyes or other mucous
membranes. - Mod.MS]
