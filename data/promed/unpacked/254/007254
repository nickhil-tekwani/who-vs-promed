Dr. Fran√ßois Desbiens, Regional Directorate of Health (PRSP) of the National Capital reported on Friday [14 Sep 2012], 3 new cases of legionellosis. The total is now 180 cases, including 13 deaths. The new cases are people whose symptoms began before or shortly after the disinfection of cooling towers. Therefore, the PRSP considers that the outbreak is still under control. The authorities continue to assert that the source of contamination is a cooling tower.

Dr. Desbiens recalled that the analysis results of cultures and withdrawals would be made public in mid-October [2012], because of the time required to perform the tests in the laboratory.

Although several hypotheses have been advanced in recent days, the DRSP refuses to formally identify the source of contamination. Medical authorities are, however, able to conclude that the measures taken will eliminate it.

"If you have a source that grows _Legionella_, the droplets fall close by. I did not close the case around the Museum of Fine Arts. Then, the assumptions that I heard last week cannot explain the dispersion of cases in that area. Since intervening exclusively on cooling towers, we have not had any more cases, " said Dr. Desbiens.

[For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (02): (Scotland) 20120605.1156972.

In the previous ProMED-mail post of this outbreak in Quebec City (Legionellosis - Canada (06): (QC) fatal, L. pneumophila 20120909.1287573), there were a total of 176 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including 11 fatalities. Now, there are a total of 180 cases, including 13 fatalities. The new cases are said to be people whose symptoms began before or shortly after the disinfection of cooling towers, which has suggested to the Quebec authorities that the outbreak may be over.

We were told in the prior ProMED-mail post on this outbreak that specimens from 9 patients have grown _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1; all 9 organisms have the same genotype, which suggested there is a common source for at least these 9 patients.

The authorities are said to suspect the source might be cooling towers of air-conditioning systems in large buildings in the downtown area of Quebec City, which have been cleaned, in expanding circles, since the 1st report in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Canada: (Quebec) fatal, cooling tower susp. 20120805.1228680. For a map showing these "contamination zones", see: http://www.rrsss03.gouv.qc.ca/images/Perimetres_interventions_001.png.

However, we are not told where the cases are located in relation to the cooling towers. The effect of wind speed and direction on _Legionella_ -contaminated plumes from these cooling towers may influence the distribution of cases.

We are still awaiting the results of cultures and genotyping of isolates from perhaps additional patients and cooling towers. A common source can be identified if the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates match.
