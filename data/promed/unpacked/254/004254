_Legionella_ causes 17 deaths in Pas-de-Calais
--------------------------------------------
The legionellosis epidemic, which struck Pas-de-Calais (France) and
affected a total of 86 people and caused 17 deaths, was confirmed by the
prefecture of the department. "17 people died, 3 are still hospitalized,
and 66 recovered", specified the official statement of the prefecture.
The previous assessment, published by the authorities, reported 13 deaths.
The new results from the National Center of Reference obliged authorities
to include the 4 new fatalities.
The Noroxo factory situated in Harnes was identified only source of the
epidemic of _Legionella_ [infection] which struck the department between
Nov 2003 and Jan 2004.
Comments of submitter: This new report fails to clarify whether or not the
additional fatalities contracted the same strain that was previously
identified with the Noroxo Cooling Towers and the waste water treatment
plant. If not related, it is noted that only 23 cases [1] representing a
mere 26.7 percent were positively matched to the strain found in the Noxoro
factory. The balance (the majority, 63 cases) were not linked. This
outbreak was particularly unusual because it occured during the winter
months and covered a wide geographic area [2].
