Health officials are currently screening illegal immigrants for malaria
after the outbreak of the potentially fatal disease was confirmed on the
Exuma islands, a sandy chain of islands southeast of Nassau. Malaria has
not been endemic in the Bahamas and apart from what are termed "sporadic"
cases by the health ministry, almost all cases have been imported into the
country.
The Exuma islands harbour reclusive holiday retreats belonging to wealthy
Europeans, Canadians and Americans and it was here that a dozen cases of
the disease have been confirmed.
According to health officials 3 of the patients were Haitians, one was
Uruguayan, and the rest were all believed to be Bahamians. It is the first
known occurrence of the disease in the Bahamas in recent times. The spectre
could very well damage tourism for Exuma and the whole of the country and
is a worrying time for the local population which depends heavily on income
from tourism. It is a particular concern because the malaria appears to be
'home grown' and the first victim did not contract the disease outside the
country. The Ministry of Health is concerned enough to take extra
precautions to try and eradicate the rogue mosquito or mosquitoes with a
special spraying programme planned for Exuma and the continued spraying of
other areas of the country. The spraying will be mostly done at night when
mosquitoes are usually at their busiest.
The rainy season has just begun in the area and it is the most active time
for mosquitoes. The _Culex_ and the _Aedes_ species of mosquito are the
types usually found in the Bahamas and are unable to transmit malaria.
Dr. Merceline Dahl-Regis, the government's chief medical officer, has
identified the strain of malaria on the Exumas as _Plasmodium falciparum_,
which is also known as "malignant" or "cerebral" malaria, and causes the
most severe and potentially fatal symptoms in humans.
The Ministry of Health said that, because malaria is endemic to Haiti,
teams have been screening areas in the Bahamas where Haitians live. The
Minister of Health, Dr Bernard Nottage says "extensive fogging" will be
carried out near the airport at Exuma, around all natural ponds and other
areas where there are large collections of water. Officials have also been
screening immigrants held at Nassau's Carmichael Road detention center for
the disease, since it holds many Haitian deportees awaiting repatriation.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising Americans
to take anti-malaria drugs as a preventative measure if traveling to the
Exuma islands but is not issuing a travel alert for the entire Bahamas
chain of islands.
Of the dozen people stricken, 5 were taken to Princess Margaret Hospital in
Nassau and have already been discharged after responding well to
chloroquine treatment. The situation has been further complicated by an
increase in resistance to the drugs normally used to combat the parasite
that causes the disease and it will take time to tell if that is the case
in the Bahamas.

A Virginian is among 16 people who have been sickened by a malaria outbreak
in the Bahamas. Bahamian officials say they will spray areas around the
island chain's capital and in the southern island of Great Exuma to contain
the outbreak. No deaths have been reported from the mosquito-borne illness.
Virginia Department of Health spokeswoman Shannon Marshall says the
department receives an average of 56 reports of malaria cases per year,
usually from Virginians who have traveled abroad. Bahamian authorities plan
to spray Great Exuma and New Providence this week. The CDC says people who
plan to travel to the Bahamas should consult their doctors beforehand and
consider taking anti-malarial medications.

[Fom the CDC website (<http://www.cdc.gov>):
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently received
official reports of 14 confirmed malaria cases in Great Exuma, Bahamas, an
area where malaria transmission does not normally occur and for which
antimalarial drugs have not previously been recommended. Thirteen cases
occurred in residents of the Bahamas, and an additional malaria infection
was confirmed in a U.S. citizen who traveled to Great Exuma in early May
2006. All these confirmed infections were caused by _Plasmodium
falciparum_. Most of the patients reported no recent travel to
malaria-endemic areas, but some of the Bahamas residents may have recently
traveled from Haiti, where _P. falciparum_ is endemic. At this time, CDC is
recommending chloroquine as an antimalarial medication for travelers to
Great Exuma. This recommendation is expected to be temporary and does not
apply to other islands of the Bahamas. The Bahamas are considered to have
been free of malaria in historic times along with the Azores, Bermuda and
St Pierre Miquelon islands. The theory that the present chain of
transmission starts with _P.falciparum_-infected immigrants from Haiti
seems plausible, and the infections demonstrate that _Anopheles_
mosquitoes, capable of transmitting malaria are found on the Bahamas. If 16
people have been infected, it seems to indicate that one than just one
gametocyte carrier is involved. If so, in addition to aerial spraying to
control the outbreak, a systematic survey of blood films from immigrants
from _P. falciparum_-endemic areas who have arrived within the past 3 weeks
to the Bahamas, and treatment of such patients, may help to stop the
outbreak." - Mod.EP]
