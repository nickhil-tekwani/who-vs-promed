The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has reported that an additional horse returned a positive test for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) at the Fair Grounds Race Course, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The EDCC said that on [3 Jan 2017], a horse in Barn 47 spiked a fever and tested PCR negative for EHV-1 on blood sample, but positive for non-neuropathogenic EHV-1 on nasal samples.

"The horse had recently undergone a throat surgery and had a history of EIPH (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) but no neurological signs were present," the EDCC said. "The horse has been placed in isolation and Barn 47 has been placed under official quarantine with twice-daily monitoring of temperatures and enhanced biosecurity. To date there are 4 barns under quarantine and 4 horses in isolation quarantine," the EDCC said.

Meanwhile, racetracks and state officials from around the country have begun implementing movement restrictions on horses that have recently been at the track.

On [3 Dec 2016] ES "Rusty" Ford, equine programs manager for the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office, said in a written statement that "Published reports, confirmed by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture, state that the entire backside is under an order of quarantine, with movement of equine onto or off the grounds restricted. With these restrictions in place, no horses will be departing Fair Grounds en route to Kentucky.

"Additionally, and until we have a more defined status of the continuing outbreak, we are directing that horses which have resided or been on the grounds of a Louisiana track or training center since [10 Dec 2016] should not be permitted entry onto a Kentucky track until they have been off the grounds for a minimum of 30 days," Ford's statement said. "In addition, these horses must meet all health requirements that remain in place to qualify each individual horse's entry onto a Kentucky track."

Likewise, Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino, in New Mexico, issued a statement [4 Jan 2018] indicating that the track, "working in conjunction with the New Mexico State Racing Commission, is now restricting horses from Louisiana following the EHV-1 outbreak at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, Louisiana. No horses that have been in Louisiana for the last 30 days will be permitted on the grounds until further notice." Sunland Park General Manager Rick Baugh said, "The physical welfare, safety, and well-being of our horses is paramount."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Even though the entire stabling area at Fair Grounds Race Course is under a restricted-movement quarantine for multiple outbreaks of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), when a 5th horse tested positive for the non-neurogenic type of EHV-1 on [3 Jan 2017], the animal was allowed to be shipped off the backstretch to an attending veterinarian's private farm, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Agriculture & Forestry (LDAF) confirmed [Wed 4 Jan 2017].

A Fair Grounds press release sent out on Tuesday evening [3 Jan 2017] described that infected horse as a [SA] trainee housed in barn 47. Attempts to reach [SA] for an update on the horse's condition and an explanation as to why it left the grounds were unsuccessful early Wednesday evening [4 Jan 2017].

When the TDN [Thoroughbred Daily News] asked the LDAF why an exception was made to the "no horses in or out" protocol, Veronica Mosgrove, the LDAF press secretary, wrote in an email, "This situation is fluid. Since the horse was being treated for another condition, the LDAF allowed moving the horse to the attending veterinarian's private isolation facility. I'm told this is a case by case situation. After consulting with the USDA Veterinary Services, the LDAF allowed the move....The attending veterinarian will be enforcing the mandated protocols and biosecurity measures."

Although Mosgrove did not detail the separate condition that the horse was being treated for, a national Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) outbreak alert dated [4 Jan 2017] reported that "a horse in barn 47 spiked a fever and was tested PCR negative for EHV-1 on blood sample and positive for EHV-1 non-neuropathogenic or wild type strain on nasal samples. The horse had recently undergone a throat surgery and had a history of EIPH but no neurological signs were present."

According to the EDCC, there are now 4 individual Fair Grounds barns under quarantine (Barns 14, 36, 47, and the receiving barn), plus 4 horses that have been individually moved to "isolation" quarantine. So in essence, there are restricted barns on the property in addition to the "no horses in or out of the backstretch" quarantine.

"Due to the nature of the receiving barn where day riders are required to check in, the Fair Grounds is now under movement restrictions with no horses allowed to enter or leave," the EDCC reported on [Tue 3 Jan 2017]. "Racing will continue at the track. Movement restrictions are also in place at Delta Downs in Vinton, Louisiana, due to the day racers that visit both tracks. Racing will continue at Delta Downs also."

In March 2016, a similar outbreak of EHV-1 touched off a 17-day quarantine of nearly 500 horses at Payson Park Thoroughbred Training Center in Florida. Other outbreaks in 2016 resulted in backstretch quarantines of varying durations at Sunland Park in New Mexico, Parx in Pennsylvania, and Fonner Park in Nebraska. In attempts to safeguard the transmission of EHV-1, other racing jurisdictions have swiftly mandated safeguards against the transmission of the disease by placing restrictions on ship-ins.

On [Wed 4 Jan 2017], the EDCC reported that "the Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian is directing that no horse that has resided or been on a Louisiana race track or training center since [10 Dec 2016], shall be allowed entry onto a Kentucky racetrack at this time. Any horse that has been in these environments must come with certification that they have been removed a minimum of 30 days to qualify for entry onto a Kentucky racetrack in addition to their meeting standard health requirements."

On [Mon 2 Jan 2017], xc [Hot Springs, Arkansas] announced that "no horses that have been in Louisiana in the last 30 days will be permitted on the grounds" until further notice. "We are being overly cautious because our main concern is for the safety and well-being of the more than 1200 horses already stabled on our grounds," said David Longinotti, Oaklawn's director of racing.

The Delta Downs overnight for [12 Jan 2017] included a notice that read, in part, "Assuming that no cases of EHV-1 are identified at Delta Downs, we plan to lift the quarantine and resume normal activities on [Mon 9 Jan 2017]. Starting on that date, Delta Downs will require a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) and proof of vaccination for the EHV-1, for any horse that enters our premises. This inspection must be conducted within 48 hours prior to the horse's arrival. This requirement will remain in place until further notice."

Delta Downs also announced that a pair of USD 100 000 stakes races originally scheduled for this Friday and Saturday [6 and 7 Jan 2017], the Azalea and Pelican S, will be rescheduled for [13 and 14 Jan 2017], respectively, because of EHV-1 shipping restrictions that would have resulted in too many scratches.
