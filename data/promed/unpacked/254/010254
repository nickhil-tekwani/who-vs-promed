The number of confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF) has risen with 6
new cases and is now at 22 cases, including 6 deaths, according to
Ministry figures, with 11 cases in San Pedro, 9 in Laurelty, and 2 in
other areas. Another 12 suspected cases are being investigated.

In Paraguay, authorities have been working to reduce mosquito
populations by fumigating in areas with higher risk of transmission,
and to eliminate breeding sites for the mosquitoes, which can carry
both yellow fever and dengue. Ministry officials are advising
residents to cover water storage tanks, empty and upend any unused
containers, and clean up any discarded plastic food containers, used
automobile tires and other items that can collect small pools of
rainwater where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. Studies have found
high infestation indexes in some areas, and people are being
encouraged to collaborate in cleaning up their properties to reduce
the risk of yellow fever and dengue transmission.
