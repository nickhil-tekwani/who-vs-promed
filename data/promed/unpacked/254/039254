AEDES ALBOPICTUS, 1995 - HONDURAS: UPDATE

The 1995 report of _Ae. albopictus_ in Honduras by ProMED does
not constitute an official report, and I do not know the source of this
information. The government has repeatedly informed me that this
species does not occur in Honduras.

[Our source was the national press, quoting official sources: The daily La
Nacion, Costa Rica, 14 Dec 1995: "Public health authorities confirmed
yesterday (13 Dec 1995) the presence of this mosquito in traps in Honduras,
close to the Guatemalan border."
Probably what happened is that Honduras was able to eradicate _Ae.
albopictus_ in the border area. We are grateful to Dr Jorge Arias for
pointing out that the mosquito did not become established there. We are
commenting on this to ensure that future users of the ProMED archive are
made aware that there are no _Ae. albopictus_ in Honduras. - Mod.EP/JW]
