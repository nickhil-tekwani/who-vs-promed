The first laboratory-confirmed imported case of a hantavirus infection in South Africa was recorded in May 2021. The case involved a 37 year old South African businessman, living and working in Crikvenica, Croatia. He had been ill prior to a return visit to South Africa, and was hospitalised in Johannesburg with acute febrile illness and renal dysfunction. He presented with moderate thrombocytopenia, a normal white cell count and marginally raised liver enzyme levels. Other symptoms included pulmonary oedema, cardiomegaly and blurred vision.

Before developing illness, the patient visited horse stables located in a rural area in Croatia. The presence of rodents in such an area can be anticipated. Hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) was suspected given his clinical presentation and epidemiological history; another visitor to the stables was confirmed with hantavirus infection, which contributed to the suspicion of the disease in this patient.

A serum sample (taken day 10 post-onset of symptoms) was submitted to the NICD for investigation. The hantavirus RT-PCR tested negative, but serological screening using an Old World hantavirus panel indicated reactivity for anti-IgG and anti-IgM. An earlier collected sample was sourced and a positive hantavirus RT-PCR result was obtained. Subsequent sequencing analysis indicated Puumala virus (PUUV) as the causative agent of the patient's disease.

Croatia is endemic for HFRS associated with 2 different hantaviruses, namely PUUV and Dobrava virus (DOBV). Humans are exposed to hantavirus through contact with aerosolised urine, droppings, saliva or nesting materials of infected rodents, which are the natural reservoir hosts. Transmission occurs through contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) or broken skin. Human behaviour plays a role in infection, with activities related to forestry, farming or outdoor activities considered risk factors. Hantaviruses are not readily transmissible from human-to-human, but infection prevention control measures are appropriate to avoid possible nosocomial transmission. There is no specific prophylaxis or therapy for HFRS, and symptomatic treatment is provided. Increases in HFRS diagnosis in Europe in the last decade, warrant its consideration as a differential diagnosis, especially in travelers with suggestive clinical symptoms.

[Hantavirus infections acquired in Croatia have been reported previously. As posted earlier, HFRS was 1st recognized in Croatia in 1952 (Radosevic Z, Mohacek I. Acta Med Scand 1954; 149: 221-8). In the spring of 1967, a cluster of 14 cases of HFRS occurred in the Plitvice Lakes [National Park] area (Vesenjak-Hirjan J, Borcic B. Lijec Vjesn 1986; 108: 197-9). In 1989, there was an outbreak of 14 cases of HFRS in soldiers near Velika Gorica (Anon. 1993), and in 1991 an outbreak occurred in Novska County, a newly recognized HFRS-endemic area (Borcic B, et al. Croatian Med J. 1996; 37: 115-8). In 1995, we recorded the largest HFRS epidemic in Croatia to date (over 120 patients; Markotic A, et al. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 269-70; Kuzman I, et al. Lijec Vjesn 1997; 119: 311-5; Markotic A, et al. J Med Virol. 2002; 66: 542-1) (see Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome - Croatia 20020522.4296).

Although sequence analysis indicated that the virus involved in the above case is PUUV, when cases of HFRS occur it is prudent to test to rule out Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) in areas where the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) host occurs. It has worldwide distribution. SEOV HFRS cases are underreported.

The bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) is the principle vertebrate host for Puumala virus, and the yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_) is the principal vertebrate host for Dobrava-Belgrade virus. - Mod.TY
