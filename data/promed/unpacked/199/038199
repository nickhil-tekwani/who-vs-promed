---------------------------------------------------------------
Rates of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the Czech Republic are similar to those reported by Austria during the 1970's. (1,2) (see the graph http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/TBECzech.png [3]).

Following the institution of mass vaccination by Austria in 1981, TBE rates decreased to levels experienced in neighboring countries. Enhanced administration of TBE vaccine might also prove effective for the Czech Republic.

[Although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and cases occur yearly there, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remained low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high, perhaps increasing in recent years, in the Czech Republic. The graph cited above is striking and illustrates trends over several years.

Dr Berger's suggestion that routine TBE vaccination would likely reduce TBE cases in the Czech Republic and the risk of infection for individuals engaged in outdoor recreational activities where the tick vectors of the virus are active should be noted. - Mod.TY
