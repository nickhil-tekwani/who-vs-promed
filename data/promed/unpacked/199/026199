Sudden Deaths in Veraguas
--------------------------
Authorities of Health declare a state of alert
Sudden deaths in the province of Veraguas have forced the Health
authorities to declare a state of alert in that region not knowing the
cause of death of a 40 year old man and 26 year old woman, [while] awaiting
the results of biochemical tests on autopsy specimens that were sent to the
Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] in Atlanta [Georgia], the
United States.
The Director General of Health, Doctor Esteban Morales, said that "We have
kept [autopsy] tissues and have alerted the health authorities where the
deaths occurred, to be on the alert for the possibility that other similar
cases occur."
The latest in scientific resources have been applied in order to make a
precise diagnosis of the cases, after Morales emphasized that "one of the
few things that are to do is to take tissues from the [autopsy specimens]
and send them to the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] in
Atlanta [Georgia], the United States."
The Health authorities first suspected that they had 2 new cases of
hantavirus [infection] by the symptoms presented by the cases.
Nevertheless, after the autopsy examinations were completed, it was
verified that neither of the patients died from diseases such as AIDS,
Hantavirus [infection] or Dengue [hemorrhagic fever], or other viral illnesses.
According to the autopsy examinations, the patients had a decrease in
platelets, problems with respiratory insufficiency and hemorrhages in
several organs, as well as systemic failure and a congested heart.
"We believe that we are dealing with an autoimmune disease that is not
infectious [in origin], but that it has to do with the same organism
[constitution] of the affected people", stated Morales.

PANAMA DECLARES "MAXIMUM ALERT" DUE TO MYSTERIOUS DEATHS
---------------------------------------------------------
Panama City, Dec 14, 2000 (EFE via COMTEX) -- Panamanian health officials
declared a state of "maximum alert" following the deaths of 2 people at the
hands of a mysterious illness, senior health official Esteban Lopez said.
Officials have not been able to determine what caused the 2 deaths a week
ago in Veraguas province, located some 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of
the capital.
Autopsies performed on the 2 victims, a 40-year-old man and a 26-year-old
woman, have determined that they had hemorrhaging in several organs, a
decrease in platelets, and heart failure. Officials ruled out AIDS,
Hantavirus [infections], dengue and other viral infections, and have yet to
determine the cause of the illness.

[The symptom list presented in the article below suggests a disease with a
hemorrhagic syndrome, associated with thrombocytopenia, respiratory
distress and congestive heart failure. The differential diagnosis should
include the hemorrhagic viral diseases seen in the region which according
to the news articles have already been ruled out by the Panamanian Health
authorities. According to GIDEON, the differential diagnosis includes 69
infectious processes including bacterial septicemia, typhoid and enteric
fever, hantavirus respiratory distress syndrome, invasive fungal infection,
infectious endocarditis, AIDS, tuberculosis, American trypanosomiasis,
visceral leishmaniasis, rat bite fever and dengue fever among others. One
assumes that most of these diagnoses have been investigated and have
already been ruled out. More information on the clinical course of the
patients as well as the final diagnoses would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
