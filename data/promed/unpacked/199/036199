The Commissioner of Health, Akwa Ibom State, Dr. Dominic Ukpong has said that a total of 18 cases of monkey pox have been reported in the state, and one is confirmed. Ikpong disclosed this on Friday [25 Oct 2019] in a press briefing following the outbreak of monkey pox disease in Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of the state.

He said that results of 5 cases were still being awaited and that the 18 cases all reside within 3 communities of Ikot Akpaden, Ikot Enin and Ndon in Mkpat Enin LGA.

The commissioner said that since the outbreak of the disease, his ministry through its public health department had activated its infectious control procedure to prevent the epidemic and confine it to the affected local government.

He added that Akwa Ibom was at risk of contracting new cases because the disease was present in the neighbouring states.

According to him: "In Nigeria, as at 24 Oct [2019], 93 suspected cases have been reported, 43 confirmed, only one death reported, and that was in Lagos state. Affected states are Lagos, Bayelsa, Delta, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Enugu and Anambra states, with a total number of 93 cases in the country; 59% are from 2 states: Delta, (28%), and Lagos (26%). Since the beginning of the outbreak in 2017, 176 confirmed cases were reported and 9 deaths before the outbreak of this year [2019].

Monkey pox is a rare viral zoonotic infection, that is an infection transmitted from animals to humans, that occurs sporadically, primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical forests. It is caused by monkey pox viruses, which also cause smallpox and cow pox. [Incorrect: smallpox and cowpox are related but separate viruses. - Mod.TY]. Case fatality in the outbreak has been between 1-10%, with most deaths occurring in younger age groups."

He advised the people to avoid contact with animals that could harbour the virus, including sick or dead animals, in areas where monkey pox cases had occurred.

He also called on the people to avoid contact with any material that had been in contact with a sick animal, and to isolate potentially infected animals from other animals.

[Sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2019), with one case previously reported in Akwa Ibom state. Now, there is an outbreak in the state, apparently with 18 new cases reported, one of which is confirmed.

There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is low. - Mod.TY
