The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has posted a map showing as of 1 Mar [2019] which states have confirmed cases to date for 2018 of the polio-like disease acute flaccid myelitis [AFM]. The latest CDC update on AFM shows 2 confirmed cases -- one in North Carolina and one in Utah -- out of 15 reports of patients under investigation so far in 2019. The Utah case is new since CDC's previous update on 15 Feb [2019].

The update also shows that there have been 223 confirmed cases of AFM in 41 states among a total of 374 reports of patients under investigation for 2018. [It also] shows New Hampshire with its 1st confirmed case of AFM for 2018, an update from the CDC report of 15 Feb [2019]. Massachusetts has 4 confirmed cases for 2018 to date.

According to CDC, most of the 2018 reports of patients under investigation have been classified, but says it is, along with state and local health departments, still investigating some of them. CDC said it is not aware of any deaths in confirmed AFM cases with illness onsets in 2018 or 2019 but has "learned of deaths in cases confirmed in previous years". It is asking health departments to send information about every death of an AFM case to CDC.

The syndrome, which is commonest in children, is considered rare but can result in paralysis. It affects the nervous system, resulting in muscle weakness, but often manifests as a respiratory infection, is difficult to diagnosis and treat, and has no identified single common pathogen to date.

States with no confirmed cases to date in 2018 include Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia as well as the District of Columbia. States with the highest number of cases in 2018 include Texas (29), Colorado (16), California (14), and Ohio (14). The new data mean there have been 551 confirmed cases of AFM in 48 states and the District of Columbia since 2014. The case counts represent only those cases for which information has been sent to and confirmed by CDC.

The year 2018 has the highest number of confirmed cases in the most states since CDC began tracking the disease as a result of 120 AFM cases reported to it from 34 states between August through December 2014. The spike in cases in August and October during 2018 were also the highest to date for those months. There were 22 confirmed cases of AFM in 17 states in 2015; 149 in 39 states and the District of Columbia in 2016; and 35 confirmed cases in 16 states in 2017, according to CDC.

Due to a decline in reports of patients under investigation for AFM, CDC said it will now update cases monthly rather than twice-monthly. CDC has noted that many patients with AFM develop symptoms between August and October, when many viruses begin to circulate, and the number of confirmed cases seems to increase every other year.

[With the high number of cases reported in 2018 and now 2019, CDC is enhancing AFM surveillance through collection of data at the national level by encouraging healthcare providers to recognize and report to their health departments all patients whom they suspect may have AFM; health departments are being asked to send this information to CDC to help us understand AFM activity nationwide.

CDC is also conducting enhanced surveillance for AFM by initiating a study at 7 pediatric hospitals across a geographically diverse area of the United States. These hospitals are also conducting surveillance for acute respiratory and gastrointestinal illness and collecting samples for viral testing. Enhancing AFM surveillance at these hospitals will allow a comparison of AFM case counts with current circulating respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses in these locations (see https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/afm-surveillance.html). - Mod.UBA
