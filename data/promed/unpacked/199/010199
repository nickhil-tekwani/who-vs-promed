The Anhui Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission in a 3 Mar 2015 briefing said the city has added one case of H7N9 [avian influenza]. The patient is male, 50 years old, currently residing in Chaohu City. He was exposed to live poultry before the onset of disease. On 2 Mar 2015, he was diagnosed with H7N9 flu and admitted with serious illness to Hefei hospital for treatment.

[2] China (Guangdong): avian influenza H7N9

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [3 Mar 2015] closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Guangdong notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the GDHFPC, the female patient, aged 36, in Chaozhou was hospitalised for management in a critical condition.

To date, 594 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the mainland health authorities in Guangdong (179 cases), Zhejiang (156 cases), Jiangsu (70 cases), Fujian (58 cases), Shanghai (45 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Anhui (21 cases), Xinjiang (10 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Shandong (6 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

[Training of medical staff in prevention and control, characteristics of H7N9 viruses, and clinical manifestations is taking place in Anhui and Guangdong provinces.

The CHP also has been posting the following message:
"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. Health surveillance measures have been implemented at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers, and the DH also conducts temperature checks by handheld devices. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

"Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry and other stakeholders are ongoing.

"Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

"The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
* Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
* If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients."

New H7N9 cases are reported almost daily in Guangdong, especially. The measures above, while important, do not get at the root of the problem, which is infected birds. The problem is that commercial poultry farmers are not interested in paying to vaccinate their flocks if the birds are not dying (low pathogenic avian influenza, LPAI), and Egyptian peasants can't afford to pay to vaccinate their rooftop flocks against H5N1. It will take support from the governments of the affected countries to wage an affordable and effective vaccination campaign to control infection in the birds, and consequently humans. A One Health approach (that is, a combined effort from agriculture and heath ministries) is likely to be the most efficient means to address this problem before it becomes a global crisis.
