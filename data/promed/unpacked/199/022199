Three Utah State Prison inmates remained hospitalized in critical
condition after they and 9 other prisoners were sickened by botulism
from a batch of prison-brewed alcohol.

The dozen men fell ill starting 2 Oct 2011 with symptoms that included
nausea, vomiting, facial paralysis, and blurry vision after drinking a
concoction commonly referred to as pruno or jailhouse hooch. As of Fri
7 Oct 2011, 5 of 8 men hospitalized were returned to the general
population, said Steve Gehrke, a department of corrections spokesman.

All 8 hospitalized prisoners required doses of the botulinum antitoxin
from the national supply maintained by the CDC, said Nicholas Rupp, a
spokesman for the Salt Lake Valley Health Department. The other 4
became ill, but not sick enough to be hospitalized.

The men apparently brewed the contraband alcohol in a plastic bag by
combining food hoarded from prison meals, including potatoes, oranges,
apples, and pineapples, and allowing them to ferment over days. They
squeezed the air out of the bag, creating the anaerobic conditions
ripe for allowing the neurotoxin produced by the _Clostridium
botulinum_ bacteria to replicate.

"It didn't sound appetizing, based on the description of the odor,"
spokesman Rupp said.

[Overall, the severity of foodborne botulism can vary based on the
amount of toxin ingested as well as the toxin type. In adults
(http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/21.full), botulism
results in pulmonary complications in 81 percent of patients, with
ventilatory failure in a 1/3 of cases. For foodborne botulism,
severity of disease seems to be associated with toxin type. Intubation
is required for 67 percent of patients with type A botulism, 52
percent with type B botulism, and 39 percent with type E botulism.
Although the neurotoxin type has not been stated, a non-A type may be
suspected based on only 3 of 12 individuals requiring ventilatory
support. - Mod.LL]
