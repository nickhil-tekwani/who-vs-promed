Re: Influenza (21): update -- a comment
----------------------------------
As a veterinarian, it has long intrigued me why bulletins like this are put out more or less stand-alone for public health "risk assessment" and "response" purposes and I often ask how useful they are, as stand-alones, for facilitating genuinely proactive response.

Most major risks factors associated with introduction, spread and establishment of infectious/transmissible diseases can be boiled down to relationships between:
- host (susceptibility and population dynamics)
- disease prevalence (including presence and absence)
- disease (or disease agent) distribution
- geospatial and temporal movements (or dynamics) of hosts and disease
agents.

If we have the capacity to put out weekly reports relating to regional and global disease prevalence and distribution, why don't we also have the capacity to put out associated weekly reports of (susceptible) host geospatial movements as they relate to disease prevalence and distribution? The 'movement' related dynamics were, I think, a really major missing data link in the last flu pandemic. Absence of that type of data and, possibly, a level of consideration of those 'movement' dynamics may have constrained the effectiveness of response inputs (particularly proactive forms of response) as well as resulted in an awful lot of cost-ineffective reactive esponsiveness.

To give an example, how useful were destination-based countermeasures alone for preventing, retarding or delaying disease spread and could or would pre-movement/pre-departure countermeasures have been more effective either
alone or in coordinated conjunction with post-arrival measures?

[[The ProMED-mail influenza updates are intended to be a distillation of current knowledge of the epidemiology of influenza virus infection in the human population, which may be useful and of interest to proportion of our readers. These updates cannot be comprehensive in view of the extent and diversity of the surveillance data available at any one time. Because of the global nature of the epidemiology human influenza virus infection, the interpretation of surveillance data to some extent is biased by the location of the observer. - Mod.CP]
