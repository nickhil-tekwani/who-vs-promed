An elderly man in Cheshire has died following an outbreak of salmonella
food poisoning. The unusual strain of the [organism], _Salmonella
enteritidis_ [also called _Salmonella enterica_ serotype _enteritidis_
-Mod.LL] PT [phage type]14b, has been blamed for making more than 150
people in London and Cheshire ill since early September 2002.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) believe the source for the outbreaks could
have been a bakery in Nantwich, Cheshire, and a second bakery in Lambeth,
south London. But the agency has said it is still continuing its
investigations.
A spokesman for the FSA said both businesses were cooperating fully with
the agency's investigations. The FSA said the Cheshire bakery was using
ordinary eggs in products that were not cooked but had now stopped this
practice. Salmonella in samples from the London patisserie had indicated a
risk of cross-contamination which the FSA say was caused by not following
"good practice". Both businesses supplied products to a number of outlets
in their region.
Dr Roger Skinner, head of the FSA's microbiological safety division, said:
"Over 150 people have been taken ill and one person has died. It is
possible there is a link between these cases and the use or handling of
eggs. Food businesses need to remember that they should use pasteurised
egg in their raw or lightly cooked products. They could be putting people
at risk if they do not follow that advice. It is important to remember
that the salmonella bug can be easily killed if eggs are properly cooked
before use."

Outbreak of _Salmonella enteritidis_ PT 14b in the United Kingdom - update
--------------------------------
Since 26 Sep 2002 134 confirmed cases of _Salmonella enteritidis_ PT 14b
(not known to be linked with foreign travel) have been reported to the
Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
in England (PHLS CDSC) by the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP)
(1,2). The earliest onset is 3 Sep 2002 and the latest onset date reported
so far is 1 Oct 2002; 8 people are known to have been admitted to hospital.
In addition to an outbreak in London and southeast England, an outbreak has
now been reported in northwest England. Plasmid analysis, carried out on a
selection of isolates from patients considered to be part of the outbreak,
shows that the strains are identical to each other and to the type strain.
Included in this are a number of isolates from cases in London, the
southeast and the northwest. Strains acquired in Greece and Portugal are
clearly different from the outbreak strain. Further molecular typing is in
progress.
A national case-control study is underway and food and environmental
investigations are continuing. An urgent enquiry was sent out by Enter-net
(<http://www.phls.org.uk/inter/enter-net/menu.htm>) on 2 Oct 2002, and 2
countries have reported cases occurring within the same time frame, which
are not travel-associated. The questionnaire being used in the United
Kingdom is being used to investigate these cases.
CDSC would be grateful to hear urgently of any other local outbreaks of _S.
enteritidis_ phage type 14b. Please contact Dr Sarah O'Brien (+44 20 8200
6868 ext. 4422) or Dr Bob Adak (+44 20 8200 6868 ext. 4551).
