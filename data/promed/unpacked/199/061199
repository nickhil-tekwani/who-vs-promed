Egypt: 34th human case of H5N1 avian influenza; background
-----------------------------------------------
A 15-year-old Egyptian girl has tested positive for bird flu, the
official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported on Sunday [8 Apr
2007], becoming the 34th human case in the country and the 1st in the
capital. A Health Ministry spokesman identified the girl as from
Cairo's Shubra district, MENA reported. The girl was admitted to
hospital on Thursday [5 Apr 2007] suffering from a high fever and is
now being treated with Tamiflu and is in stable condition, the agency
said. She contracted the virus after coming into contact with
infected birds, MENA quoted the Ministry spokesman as saying.

Egypt has the highest number of confirmed human bird flu cases
outside Asia, and 13 Egyptians have died of bird flu since it 1st
surfaced in the country's poultry a year ago. Most of those who fell
ill were reported to have had contact with sick or dead household
birds, mainly in northern Egypt.
