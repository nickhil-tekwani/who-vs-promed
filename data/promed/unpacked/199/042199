Residents [of Westminster, Worcester county] are being urged to take precautions against mosquito bites, after the discovery of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in a 5 year old horse here pushed the town's EEE risk to "critical", the Department of Public Health announced [Thu 16 Oct 2014].

It was the 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) infection detected in a mammal this year [2014]. The horse had to be euthanized because of the severity of her illness.

The EEE risk level in the surrounding towns of Fitchburg, Leominster, Princeton, Hubbardston, Gardner, and Ashburnham will be raised to high. Although these risk levels come with a recommendation to reschedule evening outdoor events, the weather will generally be cool enough that mosquito activity will be minimal, DPH said.

"Infected mosquitoes continue to be present in our environment and will be around until the first hard frost," DPH state public health veterinarian Dr Catherine Brown stated: "Although mosquitoes are much less active when temperatures are below 60 deg F [15.5 deg F], the detection of EEE in a mammal should remind residents to take precautions when outdoors. Use insect repellant, cover up exposed skin, and avoid outdoor activities at dusk and night time, when mosquitoes are at their most active."

There have been no human cases EEE so far this year [2014]. There have been 4 human cases of West Nile virus WNV. Last year, there was one case of EEE acquired by a Massachusetts resident.

EEE is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a serious disease in all ages and can even cause death. People have an important role to play in protecting themselves and their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes, DPH said.

The DPH's tips on avoiding mosquito bites:
- Apply insect repellent when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)], or IR3535 according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 per cent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years of age.
- Be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning.
- Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home:
- Drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or discarding items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.
- Install or repair screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having tightly-fitting screens on all of your windows and doors.

Protect your animals:
Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools -- especially after heavy rains. Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE. If an animal is diagnosed with WNV or EEE, owners are required to report to DAR, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795 and to the Department of Public Health (DPH) by calling 617-983-6800.

More information, including all WNV and EEE positive results, can be found on the Arbovirus Surveillance Information web page at http://www.mass.gov/dph/mosquito or by calling the DPH Epidemiology Program at 617-983-6800.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health on [Fri 17 Oct 2014] announced the 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in a mammal this year [2014]. The infection was found in a 5 year old horse from Westminster, a town located in Worcester County. The horse was euthanized because of the severity of its illness. This finding raises the EEE risk level to critical in Westminster and to high in neighboring towns.

A deer with the disease (EEE) was found in Freetown [Bristol County] in August [2014]. The risk level is considered high in Freetown and moderate in neighboring communities.

Mosquito activity generally slows when the temperature is below 60 deg F [15.5 deg F], but the risk of the diseases remains until the 1st frost.

There have been no human cases EEE this year [2014]. There have been 4 human cases of West Nile virus - another mosquitoborne infection. Last year, there was one human case of EEE in Massachusetts.

[The best protection is to vaccinate your horse, use sprays for flies and mosquitoes that are approved for horses, and clean up any standing water where mosquitoes can breed. But first and foremost is to vaccinate your horse.

We don't hear of too many deer with EEE. I wonder why they tested it for that particular disease? - Mod.TG
