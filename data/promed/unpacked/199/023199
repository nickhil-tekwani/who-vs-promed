meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is optional whether or
not state health departments report these cases to CDC. [Further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever
can be found on the CDC website at the URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN fever,
WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the national electronic
surveillance system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West
Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2007
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary
cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing county-level wild birds,
sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary cases, and mosquito
surveillance data are published each week on the collaborative USGS (US

An Aiken man tested positive for West Nile virus, making him South
Carolina's 1st confirmed case in a human this year [2007], the state
Department of Health and Environmental Control announced on Tuesday [31 Jul
2007].
The man, identified only as older than 60, contracted a form so mild that
he never showed symptoms, agency spokeswoman Clair Boatwright said.
Routine tests of donated blood indicated he had the disease, Boatwright said.

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency Thursday [2
Aug 2007] in 3 California counties hit hard by the mosquitoborne West Nile
virus, which has killed 4 people this year and appears to be spreading at a
rapid clip. The emergency declaration applies to Kern, Colusa and San
Joaquin counties and will provide up to USD 1.35 million to help combat the
spread of the virus, Schwarzenegger said.
West Nile [virus] so far this year [2007] has infected 3 times more people
than it did in the same period in 2006, he said.
The disease's epicenter thus far is Kern County, which has logged 2/3rds of
the state's 56 West Nile cases this year [2007].
More than 55 000 acres of urban neighborhoods north of the American River
were scheduled to be sprayed.
