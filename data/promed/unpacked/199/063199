Krasnoyarsk, a large city in southern Siberia, has registered an outbreak
of typhoid fever, chief of the city health authority Viktor Tutynin told
Itar-Tass on Friday.
Tutynin said 13 people have been hospitalised, but three have left the
hospital without authorization. All of the patients came to Krasnoyarsk
from Tajikistan and were residing temporarily in the Zheleznodorozhny
district.
At first only three of them contacted doctors for help, later another 13
infected persons were identified. The city's epidemiological centre is
analyzing their contacts with local inhabitants to curtail the spread of
the disease.
The city epidemiological authority has called on Krasnoyarsk Governor
Alexander Lebed to help finance further preventive measures against typhoid
fever, as the city budget does not have enough money, Tutynin said.
