[1] Liberia: further investigation of new case
Date: Thu 26 Nov 2015

Just weeks after Liberia was declared Ebola free, the newest case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) revealed worrying problems with remaining EVD-free.

Looking for treatment, the index patient of this latest chain of transmission "traveled in a car from a crowded clinic with his father and 4 other people. He was weak and bleeding from the mouth. Finally, [the patient] was seen at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. The JFK facility is the largest public hospital in Liberia. Upon entry to the facility, his father claimed he had been cut during an accident. He did not have a fever. None of the health-care triage workers suspected EVD. He was unable to walk. His father pushed him in a wheelchair to the trauma ward, where a nurse in every-day scrubs and latex gloves examined the inside of his bleeding mouth. Finding no source of bleeding, she sent him to the children's emergency ward. It was 2 days later when he tested positive for EVD. He was immediately sent to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU). He died 3 days later.

There are several steps where his treatment failed both [the patient] and West Africa, contributing to his death and the creation of a new chain of transmission:
- While obviously very ill, he traveled by car with 4 other people to a crowded clinic and JFK Medical Center, increasing the chance of EVD transmission to the vehicle's occupants and the medical care facilities he visited.
- Once in the facility, his father inaccurately described the source of the bleeding as being due to being cut during an accident. According to Dr. Mosoka Fallah, "There should be a high level of suspicion because 90 percent of the patients lie."
- The medical staff who worked on him did not wear appropriate equipment for evaluating and treating a patient with EVD.
- According to Dr. Fallah, the leader of the outbreak response who traced most of the cases through Monrovia and Liberia during the height of the outbreak, his treating staff at medical facilities relied too much on his lack of fever as an indication of possible EVD infection.

On the other hand, Dr. Francis Kateh, the chief medical officer and acting head of the Incidence Management System that manages Ebola cases, denied there had been a breach of protocol. "No one would walk around with full [personal protective equipment] in this climate."

According to Dr. Kateh, 9 health-care-worker contacts are quarantined, and 152 contacts have been identified. Of the 152 contacts, 18 are avoiding the contact tracers.

The children's emergency ward at the hospital has been decontaminated and is closed. The patients have been discharged home to observation. The nurse who examined NG in the trauma is quarantined, but that ward has not been decontaminated. His 8-year-old brother and his father contracted EVD, but remain in stable condition, as do his mother and 2 younger siblings. All are receiving Zmapp. His family home has been decontaminated.

What is so troublesome about the case is that what should have been obvious warning signs were not investigated for critical days.

On Mon 23 Nov 2015, scientists from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) arrived in Liberia to do genetic sequencing tests to determine whether the new infections are linked to a previous chain of transmission. Concerns remain about basic infection prevention and control in health clinics and hospitals in Liberia.

According to Aitor Sanchez-Lacomba, the director of the International Rescue Committee in Liberia "While 'post-Ebola' planning has focused on long-term aspirations, the very gaps in basic infection control that facilitated the epidemic's growth in the 1st place have still not been addressed. These include having water, sanitation, and basic equipment at facilities; ongoing community surveillance; and triage procedures adapted not only for Ebola, but other epidemic diseases."

Liberia's 2 small outbreaks bring into question concerns about the World Health Organization (WHO)'s "Ebola-free" classification after 42 days without a case.

Dr. Fallah said NG's mother "may have been a survivor," something investigators are following as a possible explanation for the latest outbreak.

A recent report by the Environmental Foundation for Africa investigated how potential threats of virus diseases, like EVD, will grow as humans continue to encroach on local wildlife. A comprehensive study into this issue will soon begin.

26 Nov 2015 Gambia: Japan, Gambia to sign USD 95 000 Ebola prevention project
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511261708.html
[On 27 Nov 2015, Takashi Kitahara (the Ambassador of Japan based in Senegal) and Honorable Omar Sey, Minister of Health and Social Welfare, will issue a grant contract funding USD 95 000 for a project to affect the "reinforcement of prevention and control of febrile illnesses." The funding will go to the purchase of 3 Japanese thermography units.

In addition, at a separate ceremony, funding was announced for another project, the Support to National Ebola Prevention and Preparedness in The Gambia, planned and implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) through Japanese financial contributions. The grant is for a total of about USD 1.6 million.]

25 Nov 2015 USA: Another American Ebola survivor had eye problems
http://www.livescience.com/52902-ebola-survivor-eye-problems-sacra.html
[Dr. Richard Sacra, while caring for pregnant women in Liberia during the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, contracted EVD. He was evacuated to a United States (US) hospital in September 2014 and was declared Ebola-free about 1 month later.

After approximately 2 weeks following discharge from the hospital, he reported vision loss, pain, redness and sensitivity to light in his left eye. Examination revealed slight swelling of the cornea, and white blood cells in the vitreous fluid of the eye. He was 1st given a topical corticosteroid, but as Dr. Sacra's vision worsened, he was given prednisone, an oral corticosteroid. Within one week, his vision improved. By 15 Mar 2015 Dr. Sacra had 20-20 vision.

27 Nov 2015 USA: U.S. soldiers quarantined in Italy after returning from aiding Ebola patients
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/troops-ebola-italy_n_6054708.html?utm_hp_ref=tw
[According to CBS News and CNN on Monday (27 Nov 2015), American troops returning after helping Ebola efforts in Liberia have been placed in isolation in Italy. A Pentagon spokesperson later confirmed about 12 military personnel have been isolated "out of an abundance of caution." The isolated soldiers are being held in Vicenza, Italy, the home of a US Army Garrison. The soldiers being monitored include Major General Darryl Williams who was the commander of the US Army in Africa. The soldiers were met by Carabinieri (national Italian Military Corps) in full hazmat suits. If the policy remains in effect, everyone returning from Liberia -- several hundred -- will be placed in isolation for 21 days; 30 are expected to arrive today (27 Nov 2015). According to Defense Department spokesperson Mark Wright, "None of these individuals have shown any symptoms of exposure." The Pentagon declined to describe the isolation as a quarantine. Instead, Wright terms it a "controlled monitoring." The soldiers are not allowed to return to the US until the 21-day period is over.]

27 Nov 2015: West Africa: cannot recover from Ebola epidemic on its own - senior UN health official
http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/west-africa-cannot-recover-ebola-epidemic-its-own-senior-un-health-official
[According to Peter Graaff, the United Nations Regional Inter-Agency Coordinator on Ebola, the 3 West African countries [Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone] most affected by Ebola virus disease (EVD) are unable to overcome EVD's overwhelming impact on their own. Mr. Graff stressed the reality of the regional epidemic not yet being over. "The 1st reported case in 77 days shows that, even when you are able to break the chain of transmission, there is a chance of the disease coming back," which, he said, is "largely due to a persistence of the virus in survivors." The recent cases in Liberia reinforce the importance of vigorous surveillance measures to ensure rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in unaffected areas, Mr. Graff said.]

25 Nov 2015 (published online): Ebola: lessons learned and future challenges for Europe
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00361-8
[Summary. The Ebola virus epidemic has topped media and political agendas for months; several countries in West Africa have faced the worst Ebola epidemic in history. At the beginning of the disease outbreak, European Union (EU) policies were notably absent regarding how to respond to the crisis. Although the epidemic is now receding from public view, this crisis has undoubtedly changed the European public perception of Ebola virus disease, which is no longer regarded as a bizarre entity confined in some unknown corner in Africa. Policy makers and researchers in Europe now have an opportunity to consider the lessons learned. In this Personal View, we discuss the EU's response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Unfortunately, although ample resources and opportunities for humanitarian and medical action existed, the EU did not use them to promote a rapid and well-coordinated response to the Ebola crisis. Lessons learned from this crisis should be used to improve the role of the EU in similar situations in the future, ensuring that European aid can be effectively deployed to set up an improved emergency response system and support the establishment of sustainable health-care services in West Africa.]

Vaccine

26 Nov 2015 Liberia: 4 MDs, 2 health workers take Ebola vaccine
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511261248.html
[Health-care workers at 3 health-care centers working in the latest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia (See [1]) have been recommended by the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) to receive VSV vaccination for protection against contracting EVD. There are at least 1700 doses of the vaccine available for health-care workers who are working at the health-care centers addressing the new outbreak in Liberia: Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA 2) Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU), Duport Road Health Center and John F. Kennedy Medical Center. 14 members of the 15-year-old EVD-positive deceased index-patient's ("NG") family (2 of whom have been diagnosed EVD-positive) have been admitted to the Eternal Love Winning Africa Ebola Treatment Unit (ELWA 2).]
