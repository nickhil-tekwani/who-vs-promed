LASSA SEROPREVALENCE: REQUEST FOR INFO
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
[see: Lassa fever, imported - Germany ex W.Africa: alert 20000113122224]
Date: Fri, 14 Jan 2000 10:45:50 -0600
From: Hause, David W LTC GLWACH <David.Hause@CEN.AMEDD.ARMY.MIL>

ProMED-mail reports Lassa as often running a mild course [see ref. above],
and the Robert Koch Institute refers to 90 to 95% of the cases being mild
or inapparent, but without references
(<http://yellow-fever.rki.de/INFEKT/STECKBRF/LASSA.HTM> - in German).
The (US) National Library of Medicine search engine
(<http://igm.nlm.nih.gov/>) does
not report any when searched against the topics ("lassa fever" OR "lassa
virus" OR "LCM-Lassa Complex Viruses") AND "seroepidemiologic studies".
Does anyone have a citation for seroprevalence studies?
