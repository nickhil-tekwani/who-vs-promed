A total of 7 people have been admitted to Longisa County Referral Hospital in Bomet in serious condition after feasting on meat from a cow suspected to have been infected with anthrax. At least 100 others have been treated and discharged in the incident which occurred in Chepalungu Constituency. However, the county chief officer in charge of medical services, Dr Bernard Sowek, said the 7 victims still in hospital were in stable condition and were out of danger.

Dr Sowek said the patients were taken to Chebunyo Dispensary on [Wed 29 Nov 2017] morning but after diagnosis, it was discovered that they needed specialised treatment and were referred to Longisa Hospital in Bomet East Constituency. "The patients are in stable condition since they were rushed to hospital early enough for treatment," Dr Sowek said.

All the patients are said to have fallen ill after their neighbour [butchered] a cow that had suddenly died, and invited them for a feast. "The report we have is that a neighbour had called for a feast after their cow died without any symptoms of illness on [Tue 28 Nov 2017] evening and...some of those who ate developed abdominal pains," Dr Sowek stated.

Local health workers have pitched tent in the village, sensitising locals on the dangers of feasting on uninspected meat. Medical Health Executive, Dr Joseph Sitonik, said the scene where the carcass was slaughtered had been disinfected and that the area was immediately cordoned off.

Dr Sitonik said the skin of the dead cow which was sold by the owner at Chebunyo trading centre was yet to be found and there was a likelihood that more people might be infected if they fed on the skin.

[Bomet County is in southwest Kenya in what was once the Rift Valley Province; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomet_County

Since around 2005 there has been an increase in reports of bovine, sheep and goat, swine, and human anthrax in Kenya. I suspect that this is due not to more disease but a better awareness of it and increased reporting and laboratory confirmation. Unfortunately this is not always backed up by better field data as all too often the number of outbreaks matches the number of cases, a situation typical of reporting based only on diagnostic data and the number of samples submitted. It is not unusual with anthrax to have multiple animals dead with the disease in the index outbreak; multiple deaths in double digits are unfortunately not uncommon with ovine anthrax. Under-reporting in anthrax is common. This is worse when reporting is primarily based on human cases and livestock cases are essentially ignored by the bureaucracy. The cost of this under-reporting is that veterinary service headquarters are unaware of the real cost and don't assign a proper policy and budget. Anthrax is a disease that is most cost effectively prevented, instead of just being retroactive, known outbreak by known outbreak.

The old Rift Valley Province has more than its share of outbreaks, with 3 already in the 1st 6 months of this year [2017]. In 2016 there were 19 bovine outbreaks and 2 small-ruminant outbreaks; 2015 8 bovine and one small-ruminant outbreaks; and in 2014 9 bovine outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ
