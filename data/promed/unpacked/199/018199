Regarding: Equine Herpesvirus USA, MI
-----------------------------------------
Information in this posting seems based on an incomplete understanding of
the pathogenesis and epidemiology of EHV. The posting states that 2 horses
have been euthanized after testing for EHV. The number of cases in which
EHV is "deadly to horses" is in fact quite low, and a high percentage of
horses would be positive using standard serological tests. Further details
would be helpful, as it would be unnecessary to euthanize on the basis of a
positive test alone. Severe manifestations of neurological disease would be
a possible justification. Clarification is clearly needed.

[We do not have information at the present time regarding the reasons for
euthanasia of the affected horses. Most likely it was because of severe
neurological manifestations. - Mod.TG]

Infection with equine herpesvirus is very common in the equine population,
and most animals have neutralizing antibodies. Latent infection also occurs
in at least 70 percent of horses; recrudescence and shedding from these
animals, and repeated infections during the horses life, are common. The
precise reasons why the nervous form of equine herpesvirus is so rare are
not known, but include host and virus factors.
Much current research is focused on sequence differences between paralytic
and non-paralytic viruses. Older horses are more commonly affected with the
nervous form; this has been related to the usual presence of very high
levels of circulating antibody and a circulating viremia at the onset of
nervous disease.

[Equine herpes virus-1 causes an immune-mediated vasculitis. The resulting
infection in the brain and spinal cord is believed to be secondary to the
vasculitis. The neurological form of the disease may precede or follow the
rhinopneumonitis or abortion aspect associated with this virus. - Mod.TG]
