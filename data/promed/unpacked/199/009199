[Since Aujeszky's disease is an economically important disease in the
swine industry and many countries worldwide have either succeeded in
or are close to finishing eradication programs, an outbreak of the
disease is notable. Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies,
results in CNS signs, high mortality in young pigs, respiratory
disease in adults, and abortion in pregnant sows or birth to weak
piglets.

According to the OIE WAHID database, France did not report this
disease between 2005 and 2009 where France reported its presence but
without quantitative data. Spain on the other hand, reported
significant numbers of outbreaks starting in 2005 with over 500
outbreaks that year and in 2006. Spain continued to report outbreaks
in 2007 and 2008 but without good quantitative data. There were
approximately 280 outbreaks reported to the OIE WAHID database in
2009. Importantly in this regard, the French outbreaks lays just
north of the Spanish border as can be seen on the map appended to the
OIE report referenced above or at
