2002/174 Mango decline in Oman
Decline disorders have been observed in nearly all mango-growing
regions of the world. The main causes mentioned in the literature are
fungal complexes associated with nutritional deficiencies. In Oman,
the disease does not seem to be associated with a single known
pathogen, but it causes tree mortality at all ages.
There are indications that the disease is associated with a breakdown
of defence mechanisms, probably induced by phytoplasma (detected in
diseased trees by nested-PCR amplification) and associated with high
gummosis, leading to subsequent infestation by other pests in twigs,
trunks, and roots. Neither fungicides nor insecticides are effective
in controlling the disease.
Approximately 20 000 mango trees were killed in 2001, and the disease
has spread to all mango-growing areas of the country. A strategy is
being prepared combining sanitation measures and suitable measures
taken at given times to avoid the rapid decline and death of trees.
Mango decline has also been observed in United Arab Emirates.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is the most economically important fruit
in the Anacardiaceae, which also include cashew and pistachio. India,
China, Mexico, and Thailand are major producers, but the crop is
grown in many tropical areas. Mango decline is considered by some
scientists as a disorder and by others as a disease. Mango decline
includes several diseases: blight, canker, gummosis, twig blight, tip
die-back, and stem bleeding. Several fungal species (_Colletotrichum
gleosporioides_, _Dothiorella_ spp. and _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_).
The bacterium _Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae_ causes apical
necrosis on mango in southern Europe, and its symptoms are similar
to some of those associated with decline. More research is needed to
define the various causes of mango decline.
