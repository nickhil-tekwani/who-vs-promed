The posting on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) risks above from FAO is welcomed and
perhaps long overdue. As stated by moderator MHJ there has been a death of
much needed official updates to put transmission risks in a proper
epidemiological perspective I would like to comment on the risks to Iraq
(here emphasized by FAO) and other countries in the peninsula as well as
other countries indirectly linked to this area by a large human
multi-directional traffic
From what is known, the threat to Iraq of RVF transmission from Saudi
Arabia seems remote when compared to other countries in the Gulf at risk,
namely the countries of the Gulf Co-Operation Council (GCC)-Bahrain, Oman,
Qatar, Kuwait and Yemen. Saudi Arabia shares borders with ALL these
countries- borders that are free of military tensions. It also shares
borders with Jordan in the northeast.
The risk of transmission of the RVFV from infected animals across the
border from Northern Saudi Arabia to susceptible ones in Iraq seems remote
because of the present militarized nature of that area since the Gulf War.
Recent Iraqi incursions reported by the Kingdom are reminders of this
reality. A trans-border movement of (infected) animals thus seems highly
remote. Nor would the government here really allow for such an occurrence.
We should note the great distance between the northern borders of Saudi
Arabia with Iraq and the Southwestern province where the RVF outbreak was
focused. Though spread is possible by illegal movements of animals from
affected areas into known RVF free areas, there would be little or no
economic rationale for livestock owners to move their animals that far
north. The illegal movement of animals out of known outbreak areas (also
for FMD control) is often reported in the newspapers here. The only
possibility here would be if the UN-monitored sanctions limiting trade with
Iraq, exempts livestock shipment from Saudi Arabia for humanitarian
purposes. This would have to be confirmed.
However possible transmission routes to Iraq could include pilgrims
returning home from Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages to Makka in the Southwestern
region. It is possible they [the pilgrims get infected there and are
viremic enough to infect biting mosquitoes and other potential unevaluated
hematophagous vectors at the borders, where the travelers may stay for some
time due to border formalities on their return journey, usually by the
road. Although no such thing is known to have been officially reported
since the last Hajj about 5 months ago. Such insects may then inoculate the
susceptible animals there as warned by FAO and amplify the disease. But the
chances are very narrow of such occurring. Epidemiological evaluation of
the natural and modified ecology of these areas should provide better
insights.
Infected persons may also release infective aerosols. The citizens of the
GCC have more access to Saudi Arabia for tourism and economic activities
and thus may be more prone to RVF incursion. There is a substantial
increase in traffic from these countries into Saudi Arabia, especially by
land usually in 4-wheel drives, during the summer for the Umrah [lesser
pilgrimage to Makka as well as for tourism. The durability of the 4-wheel
drives often allows the visitors to penetrate into much of Saudi as they
would like.
Places of interest are the cooler areas of the Asir region, which has its
own RVF-compatible ecology and did record cases during the outbreak. Dubai
also serves as a point of re-exportation of goods (including livestock)
into Saudi Arabia.
The large number of expatriates here may also make introduction to places
like India with competent potential vectors a possibility. India has the
largest number of expatriates in the region with Filipinos and Pakistanis
contributing a large portion of skilled and unskilled labor. It would
require infected and perhaps asymptomatic vacationing workers with adequate
viremia to inoculate their local vector fauna.
For transmission to occur the infective virus must replicate in these
vectors and be disseminated. The first known documented screening of
returning pilgrims in the Middle East was by Israel in the early eighties
after antibodies where detected in Swiss soldiers serving on UN assignment
in the Sinai area in 1979. The threat has also been there from incoming
refugees into the peninsula from Somalia for RVF and other diseases as well.
While it is usual to incriminate mosquitoes, the roles of other possible
vectors and reservoirs here and elsewhere should not be swept away. The
prevalence of phlebotomine flies in these areas is well documented and one
is yet to know whether laboratory demonstrated transmission of RVF by these
flies [1 can or does occur in the field. Phlebotomine flies are abundant
in this region and carry other viruses and pathogens in the region
It is hoped that the blood collection would include candidate hosts and
reservoirs in the area. Gazelles, some of which are threatened species, and
wild rodents as well as commensal rats should be considered. RVFV activity
has been detected in _Rattus rattus_ in RVF endemic regions in Senegal and
Egypt. [2,3
However their possible roles in RVF epidemiology is yet to be fully
characterized. FAO studies may also be expanded to include investigations
on the vector competence of the native mosquitoes and other candidate
vectors.
The role of the camel and its milk should also be examined. More studies
are needed as this animal plays a major role in the bedoiun's life. The
camel was incriminated as a source of CCHF [Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic
Fever) carrying Hyalomma ticks in the CCHF outbreak in Makka in 1990 [4
though virus isolation attempts were then unsuccessful.
Camels imported from Sudan had been incriminated for the 1997 RVF epidemic
in Egypt.[5 RVF antibodies have been detected in camels in Sudan, Egypt,
Nigeria and Kenya [6,7,8,9,10 The FAO should also use its position to
encourage countries in the Gulf to have active surveillance programs as
well to share necessary information in a timely manner It is hoped this
will be discussed at the forthcoming STVM/WDA conference in Pilanesberg,
South Africa next week where I will present a paper on RVF transmission.
