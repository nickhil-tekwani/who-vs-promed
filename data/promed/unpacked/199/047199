Hospital Ward Reserved for Isolation of Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever Cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public Health Minister Professor Sam Ongeri yesterday issued an Ebola
hemorrhagic fever alert following the death [on Mon 9 Apr 2001 of a female
police recruit at Kiganjo Police Training College in Nyeri. Professor
Ongeri said that following the death of the 24-year-old recruit at the
Nyeri College on Monday, a team from the Ministry and the Kenya Medical
Research Institute had been dispatched to the district to investigate the
death and obtain epidemiological data on the case. He said that the team
has already reserved a ward at Kiganjo to isolate any further suspected
hemorrhagic fever cases.
The Minister said that the female police recruit hailed from the Motigan
sub-location of the Matumbo location, in Siaya District. He added that the
woman had joined the College on Sat 17 Feb 2001 and had since remained
there. She fell ill on Sat 31 Mar 2001 and developed symptoms of [an
Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever, including shivering, vomiting, and weakness.
[Prior to her death she started bleeding from all open parts of her body
and vomited blood.
