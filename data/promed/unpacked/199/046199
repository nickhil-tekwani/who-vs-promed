Tests have confirmed rabies in 10 more Formosan ferret-badgers, bringing the number of confirmed infections in wild animals to 63 since the deadly disease resurfaced in Taiwan in mid-July [2013], authorities said on Friday [9 Aug 2013]. The newly discovered infections come from Taichung City and Nantou County in central Taiwan and Tainan and Chiayi County in the south, said the Central Epidemic Command Center for Rabies. Aside from one Asian house shrew, the rest of the 63 confirmed cases have all been wild Formosan ferret-badgers, the center said. A total of 194 wild carnivorous animals had been tested for the disease as of 8 Aug 2013. The outbreak has been found across 33 districts of 8 counties and cities in central, southern, and eastern Taiwan.

Also on Friday [9 Aug 2013], protestors outside the Council of Agriculture (COA) demanded measures to reduce the number of stray dogs being euthanized at animal shelters since pet abandonment spiked on rabies fears. Huang Kuo-ching, head of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, responded by saying that his agency is working both to raise shelter capacity and to encourage adoption of the strays. There are 6335 dogs being housed in shelters around Taiwan, which have a maximum capacity of 7000 animals, he said. There are plans to expand that capacity up to 9740, he said. The council will also begin an awareness campaign to inform the public that all shelter dogs receive immunization against rabies, he said. That campaign could raise the number of stray dog adoptions, which totalled 985 nationwide over the past 9 days, he added.

Huang meanwhile rejected a proposal by animal rights activists that stray dogs be spayed or neutered and released once vaccinated, explaining that rabies vaccinations must be administered every year, and it may prove impossible to round up each dog again once they have been let loose.

[The number of confirmed cases of rabies virus-infected Formosan ferret-badgers continues to rise. Infected animals have now been recorded in 33 districts of 8 counties and cities in central, southern, and eastern Taiwan. The newspaper report is accompanied by a photograph of a dead ferret-badger.

It is not clear in these reports from Taiwan how many animals have been killed in the surveillance procedure (and were not visibly rabid) and how many of the animals had died as a result of their infection. A more precise analysis would be appreciated.

So far there have been no confirmed canine or human cases, and the Taiwanese authorities seem to be adopting a sensible approach to control of the stray dog population.
