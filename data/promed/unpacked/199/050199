Independent journalist Alejandro Tur Valladares said, "this month [April 2013] there were 16 positive cases of cholera in the municipality of Palmira [Cienfuegos Province]. This information was provided by the Provincial Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology. These 16 cases are in the Gustavo Aldereguia Lima provincial hospital, and there are other cases that are to be confirmed but are isolated in a polytechnic school of the municipality."

Tur Valladares said a government official he knows, and who requested anonymity, told him that "over the weekend [27-28 Apr 2013] they learned that more than 50 cases had tested positive from a rapid test, and confirmation from other tests that have been sent to the Pedro Kouri Institute is awaited."

The journalist said that "it appears that this outbreak originated from infected people who traveled from the eastern provinces for a funeral in Palmira and disseminated the disease. The municipality of Palmira has no water service or sewerage and without a doubt this has favored the spread of the epidemic."

[Cases and deaths from cholera continue to be reported by non-government sources. Most of the cases appear to be occurring in the eastern provinces of Holguin, Guantanamo, and Granma, although some have occurred in the western capital of Havana. Granma province is the site of the original cluster of cases beginning in June 2012.

As far as this moderator is aware, this is the 1st (albeit unofficial) report of cholera in the more centrally located Cienfuegos province.
