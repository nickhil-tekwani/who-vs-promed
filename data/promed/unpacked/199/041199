[This surveillance report includes cumulative test results compiled by
USDA-APHIS up to 11 Aug 2001, and some additional reports.
As of 11 Aug 2001, the totals of West Nile virus-positive test results were
as follows: equine cases 23 (up from 17 on 6 Aug 2001), human cases 3 (up
from 2), wild birds 638 (up from 392), sentinel chickens 4 (up from 1) and
mosquito pools 130 (up from 95). There have been no reports of West Nile
virus-infected mammals other than horses and humans.
Now that the USGS cumulative surveillance maps are being rapidly and
continuously updated, future ProMED-mail surveillance reports will be
limited to tabulated cumulative reports such as those issued by USDA-APHIS.
The appearance of West Nile virus in new locations, in humans, and in new
hosts will be posted separately (for USGS maps, see:

Findings of West Nile Virus Reported from 1 Jan through 11 Aug 2001
------------------------------------------------------
Equine Results
There have been 23 confirmed clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection detected in horses. All the horses were from 5 counties in
northern Florida: Duval (Jacksonville, 1), Jefferson (Greenville, 2;
Monticello, 10; unknown, 2), Leon (Tallahassee, 2), Madison (Greenville, 1;
unknown, 1), and Taylor (Perry, 2; Shady Grove, 2). A total of 7 (or 30
percent) of the 23 horses died or were euthanatized. All 23 horses were
positive on IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) and a
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) performed on serum samples at
the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. The
only 3 horses from which brain tissues were available also tested positive
at the NVSL on reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction
(RT-nPCR) performed on those tissues.

Human Results
There have been 3 confirmed human cases of WNV illness, the latest in a
73-year-old woman from Richmond County (Staten Island), New York. This is
the first reported human case of WNV infection in New York this year. Her
onset of illness was 26 July. None of the 3 ill persons has died.

Wild Bird Results
There have been 638 wild birds reported as positive for WNV in 11 states
plus the District of Columbia. New Jersey has reported the most positive
birds (249). Florida, Georgia, and Ohio have reported WNV-positive birds
for the first time ever in 2001. [Since 11 Aug, a WNV-positive blue jay has
been found in Louisiana. - Mod.CP

Sentinel Chickens
So far, 4 sentinel chickens have been reported as WNV-positive. The most
recent 3 were from Monmouth County, New Jersey. Blood collected from the
chickens on 19 Jul 2001 had WNV antibodies. These 3 are the first sentinel
birds in the northeast United States reported to be found positive for WNV
in 2001.

Mosquito Pools
A total of 130 mosquito pools have been reported as WNV positive from 5
States (Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island) in 2001.
New Jersey has reported the most positive pools (101). Overall, species
found include _Culex pipiens_, _Culex restuans_, _Culex salinarius_,
_Ochlerotatus canadensis_, _Ochlerotatus cantator_, _Ochlerotatus
japonicus_, _Anopheles punctipennis_, _Coquillettidia perturbans_, and
_Aedes_ spp.

Distribution
A total of 72 counties in 11 States and the District of Columbia have had
confirmed findings of WNV in a mosquito, bird, horse, or human, since 1 Jan
2001: Connecticut (3), District of Columbia, Florida (7), Georgia (16),
Maryland (3), Massachusetts (5), New Jersey (19), New York (11), Ohio (1),
Pennsylvania (1), Rhode Island (4), and Virginia (2);
69 counties plus the District of Columbia have detected at least one
positive bird; 47 counties in 8 States have reported 2 or more confirmed
findings of WNV-positive birds: Connecticut (Fairfield, Hartford, New
Haven), Florida (Jefferson, Leon, Madison, Taylor, Wakulla), Georgia
(Berrien, Brooks, Charlton, Clinch, Echols, Fulton, Lanier, Lowndes, Ware),
Maryland (Baltimore City, Baltimore), Massachusetts (Essex, Middlesex,
Plymouth), New Jersey (Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Essex,
Gloucester, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Salem,
Somerset, Union), New York (Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Richmond,
Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester), and Rhode Island (Kent, Washington);
22 counties in 5 States have had at least one wild bird and at least one
mosquito pool reported as positive: Connecticut (Fairfield, New Haven),
Maryland (Baltimore City), New Jersey (Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington,
Camden, Cape May, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic,
Salem, Union), New York (Bronx, Nassau, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk), and
Rhode Island (Newport).
The USDA report concludes with a detailed breakdown of the figures by
county and species in the case of mosquitoes. There have been no reports of
West Nile virus-positive mammals, other than horses and humans.

WNV-positive Bird Count Now 18
------------------------------
As of 15 Aug 2001, the [Connecticut State Mosquito Management Program
today announced
new test results for West Nile virus (WNV) infection in birds and
mosquitoes. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has
isolated WNV from a pool of _Culex restuans_ (a bird-biting mosquito)
collected on 6 Aug 2001 from Erna Avenue in Milford. CAES has also isolated
WNV from a pool of _Culex pipiens_ (primarily a bird-biting mosquito)
collected on 7 Aug 2001 from a trap on Beacon Point in Stratford. This is
the first pool of mosquitoes to test positive for WNV in Milford this year
and the second pool to test positive in Stratford.
The state also reported today that 6 additional crows had tested positive
for WNV. The crows were from: Fairfield 足 1, Stratford 足 2, Milford 足 2,
and Stamford 足1. This brings the total number of birds that have tested
positive for WNV in Connecticut to 18. The 2 Stratford crows are the first
to test positive there this year. The crow in Fairfield was found on 5 Aug
2001. The crow in Stamford was found on 5 Aug 2001. The crows from
Stratford were collected on 30 Jul 2001 and the crows from Milford were
collected on 13 and 31 Jul 2001.
