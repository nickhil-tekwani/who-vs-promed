An outbreak of avian influenza has led to the culling of 170 000 chickens in a laying flock in the neighbourhood of Balabancik, district Mudanya, province of Bursa.

The Bursa Food, Agriculture and Livestock Directorate announced that following the report on chicken mortality on an egg-production farm in Balabancik, Mudanya district, last week, a visit was paid to the farm. About 6000 birds out of 123 000 died within 5 days. On 29 May 2015, 6 dead chickens were sent to the Pendik Veterinary Institute. A protection zone of 3 km radius around BalabancÄ±k was declared. In other locations, the disease has not yet been confirmed. The Istanbul Pendik Veterinary Institute has confirmed the suspicion that this is an outbreak of HPAI H5N1.

A surveillance area of 10 km radius has been established. There are suspicions of infection also in the Osmangazi district. About 90 people are involved in the control activities; there are strict animal movements restrictions in markets.

Bursa has become Turkey's 4th HPAI H5N1-infected province since the start of the epizootic, which is reportedly limited, so far, to western Turkey. It started in Kastamonu (24 Apr 2015), followed by the provinces of Balikesir (28 Apr 2015) and Manisa (14 May 2015). The 3 reported outbreaks are presented in the interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17641. Turkey's policy is one of stamping out.

5 follow-up reports have already been submitted to the OIE, the last on 29 May 2015. The reported total outbreak statistics, as of 29 May 2015, have been summarised by the OIE as follows:

Total outbreaks = 3 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 2 048 083 / 2 048 083 / 322 / 2 047 761 / 0

Genotyping of the strain involved is expected to assist the assessment of its pathogenicity to humans. During the 2005 H5N1 outbreak in Turkey, 12 human cases were reported (4 deaths) in the Eastern parts of the country; it was suggested that children were infected when engaged in collecting the eggs. According to WHO's data, the most recent symptom onset date (or hospital admission) in Turkey was dated 5 Jan 2006.

On 2 Jun 2015, Turkey's minister of health Mehmet Muezzinoglu reassured the public that it was safe to consume eggs and poultry.
"We are entering a period where the avian flu will no longer be an issue as the weather gets warmer," he said, adding that the Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Livestock had taken all necessary measures to prevent the virus from spreading, including imposing quarantines at some farms.

The outbreak in Bursa has yet to be reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS
