We are pleased to announce the 1st edition of "Infectious diseases of
concern to captive and free-ranging animals in North America," as
coordinated by the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV):

Napier JE, Gamble KC (editors). Infectious diseases of concern to
captive and free-ranging animals in North America, 1st edition. Yulee,
Florida: Infectious Disease Committee, American Association of Zoo
Veterinarians, 2011. 374 pp.

With our sister organizations, AAZV's Infectious Disease Committee
coordinated active participation with many other organizations to
complete concise fact sheets on a total of 160 diseases and the
reportable diseases for the 50 United States, Canada, and Mexico.
Membership of the following organizations was represented by 107
authors and 196 reviewers:

American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV)
American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians (AAWV)
Association of Avian Veterinarians (AAV)
Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians (ARAV)
Canadian Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians (CAZWV)
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
International Association of Aquatic Animal Medicine (IAAAM)
Mexican Association of Conservation Medicine (MACM)
National Animal Disease Center (NADC)
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL)
United States Department of Agriculture - Animal, Plant and Health
Inspection Services (USDA-APHIS)
United States Department of Agriculture - Animal Research Services
(USDA-ARS)
United States Geological Service (USGS)
Wildlife Disease Association (WDA)

...and additional contributions were provided by 31 colleges and
universities as well as private practitioners and institutions.

This project was designed as a starting reference point for
information needed on infectious diseases which affect zoo and wild
animal species housed or free-ranging in North America. It is
complementary to a similar volume (in its 4th edition) developed for
infectious diseases which affected zoo and wild animal species housed
or free-ranging in Europe. Although these documents were
peer-reviewed, often by a topic expert, they are not intended to be
used as an exclusive information source, but rather this manual should
be used like any other textbook.

It is available as free access on the homepage of AAZV
