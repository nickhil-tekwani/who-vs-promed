The European Commission and the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL)
for Avian Influenza in Weybridge have published the results of the
surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds carried out in the EU
over the past 10 months. The extensive epidemiological data were
presented today [31 May 2006] at the FAO/OIE International Scientific
Conference on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, which is taking place
in Rome this week.
Although final figures are still being collected for February-May
2006, it is estimated that around 60 000 wild birds were tested for
avian influenza in the EU during that period. This, combined with the
39 000 wild birds tested between July 2005-January 2006, means that
almost 100 000 tests for the H5N1 virus have been carried out on wild
birds over the past 10 months. Since February 2006, over 700 wild
birds across 13 Member States have been found to be infected with the
H5N1 "Asian strain" of avian influenza. However, a positive decline
in the incidence of the disease in wild birds in Europe has also been
noted over the past weeks.
Between February 2006 and 21 May 2006, 741 cases of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (most of them confirmed as H5N1) have been detected
in wild birds in 13 Member States -- Greece, Italy, Slovenia,
Hungary, Austria, Germany, France, Slovakia, Sweden, Poland, Denmark,
Czech Republic and UK. There have been only 4 outbreaks of H5N1 avian
influenza in poultry in the EU, and all of these were swiftly
eradicated following detection. No human case of the H5N1 virus has
occurred in the EU.
There is considerable variation in the number of cases of highly
pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, ranging from 326 in Germany
to 1 in the UK. The peak in terms of the number of cases in wild
birds was reached in March with 362 cases (compared to 200 in
February), with cases declining to 162 in April and 17 in May. The
most commonly affected wild birds have been swans, [465] representing
62.8 percent of the total, followed by [121] ducks (16.3 percent),
[33] geese (4.5 percent), [29] birds of prey (3.9 percent) and [93]
others (13 percent).
Following the major geographical spread of the H5N1 avian influenza
virus from South-East Asia in 2005, the EU has intensified its
programmes for the surveillance and early detection of avian
influenza, both in wild birds and poultry. Almost 2.9 million Euros
has been made available by the Commission to co-finance Member
States' surveillance programmes for the period July 2005-December
2006. Guidelines on enhanced surveillance for avian influenza in wild
birds were also issued by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain
and Animal Health. The intensified surveillance has enabled the
Commission and Member States to gain a clearer view of the avian
influenza situation in the EU, and to rapidly detect and respond to
any outbreaks.

[This Rome conference will generate a number of interesting papers.
Taking the above data at face value, the prevalence of infected wild
birds was 741/39 000 or 1.9 percent. Some have suggested that swans
are victims, not contributors to the spread of H5N1. If so, the wild
bird infection prevalence then falls below 1 percent. - Mod.MHJ]

Muntilan, Indonesia:
When chickens began dying at his local market, Darmanto gratefully
collected them from vendors, chopped them up and tossed the raw meat
to his pet catfish.
He never wore gloves, and remembers smoking a cigarette with a bloody
hand as he watched hundreds of fish greedily gobble up the scrawny
black carcasses.
The thought of bird flu never crossed Darmanto's mind, it couldn't.
He had never heard of it until he himself became ill, hospitalised
with a burning 41 C fever [105.8 F], a racing heart and a tightness
in his chest that left him struggling to breathe.
Indonesia has the second-highest number of human deaths from the H5N1
virus (32) and has come under fire for failing to slow the spread of
the virus where others, like Vietnam, have succeeded thanks largely
to strong political will and vaccination campaigns.
It has so far refused to carry out mass culls of poultry in all
infected areas, one of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's
most basic containment guidelines, saying it cannot afford to
compensate farmers.
Bio-security measures are virtually nonexistent and, as Darmanto's
case illustrates, there is a lack of awareness about bird flu in the
densely populated countryside, home to hundreds of millions of
backyard chickens.
"If I had known about bird flu, I would have done a lot of things
differently, I would have taken precautions to protect myself and my
family," said the father of 2, who does not understand even today how
he could get sick from dead chicken, or how he survived.
Darmanto, 46, attributes his good fortune to "traditional herbal
medicine, a strong spirit, and the will to live."
