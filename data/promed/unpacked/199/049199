New Rochelle Crow Tests Positive for West Nile Virus
-----------------------------------------------------
The Westchester County Department of Health today received notification
from the New York State Health Department's Wadsworth laboratory, that a
crow from New Rochelle has tested positive for West Nile virus. The dead
crow was submitted for testing on 22 Jun 2000. This is the first
confirmation of West Nile virus in a bird in Westchester County this year.
No [virus-positive mosquitoes or human cases of West Nile virus infection
have been detected in the County. In addition, one bird from Pound Ridge
that was submitted on 20 Jun 2000 for testing had a suspicious [?result,
according to the New York State Health Department. Further testing of this
bird needs to be done before it can be said whether it had West Nile virus.
The State Health Department will be conducting further testing on that bird
next week.
"This finding is not totally unexpected, in light of the fact that dead
birds with West Nile virus have been reported from Rockland County and from
Bergen County, New Jersey," said Dr. Lipsman. "Westchester County has been
preparing for this eventuality for months. We have our systems in place
already. Under Operation Mosquito S.T.I.N.G. (Stop The Insects Next
Generation), we have applied larvicide (to kill immature mosquitoes) to
catch basins countywide and have been collecting mosquitoes and dead birds
for testing. Upon hearing about this finding, we dispatched health
department teams to determine if additional larvicide is required."
"Because West Nile virus is showing signs of reappearing this year, it is
important that residents take precautions against being bitten by
mosquitoes and help eliminate standing water.
Additionally, Westchester County has been working closely with the State,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners to
proceed with its plan to prevent human cases of West Nile virus illness,"
continued Dr. Lipsman.
The Health Department is encouraging residents to report dead birds through
the West Nile virus Hotline at (914) 637-2420. Health Department staff will
be collecting reports throughout the weekend. Depending on the species and
condition of the birds, the Health Department will be collecting and
testing some of these birds. Not all birds will be collected, but the
information about where the birds are being found is very helpful to the
Health Department. A dead bird does not represent a health risk to anyone.
It cannot transmit West Nile Virus to people or pets.
At this time, there is no indication that spraying for adult mosquitoes is
needed. The Westchester County Department of Health will continue to
monitor the test results from mosquitoes, birds and sentinel chickens, and
take appropriate actions.
A wealth of information on West Nile virus can be found on the Health
Department's website <http://www.westchestergov.com/health> and on the West
Nile Virus Hotline, which can be reached by calling (914) 637-2420.

[The nature of the confirmatory tests referred to in this report is unclear
and needs clarification, particularly in view of continuing doubt over the
cause of death of the bird (species?) found earlier at Pound Ridge. This
report, if based on virus isolation, will provide further evidence
indicating over-wintering of West Nile virus in mosquitos in the New York
region and its onward transmission to susceptible birds. - Mod CP.
