There continues to be a sizeable number of outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza in various avian species in Italy. Data for individual
outbreaks in January and February is provided in the latest OIE report and
depicts the severity of the situation. In January, there were 198
outbreaks involving 5 932 622 birds. The most affected regions were
Lombardia and Veneto. In February, the rate of new outbreaks slowed to 79
involving 1 777 777 birds. Lombardia and Veneto continue to be the hardest
hit areas.
The reason the number of birds involved is so large has to do with a whole
flock slaughter policy. Once a flock is infected with a High Pathogenicity
Avian Influenza Virus, the most effective means of control is slaughter of
the whole flock.
