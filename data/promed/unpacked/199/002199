For those of our readers not familiar with immunization program
issues and discussions (not wanting to use the word "controversy" in
this case), I thought it was important to elaborate a bit further on
some of the issues pertaining to pertussis vaccination and this
current outbreak in the UK.
As mentioned in prior postings on the changing epidemiology of
pertussis, the issue of waning immunity as a contributing factor for
continuation of transmission of the disease is very much a topic of
discussion and study, given the concerns about vaccination against
pertussis in older age groups (1,2). With the release of the
acellular vaccine, studies are now showing the safety of
administration of this vaccine in older age groups. Other studies
are being directed towards addressing the probable need to implement
pertussis boosters in older age groups (3).
While waning immunity has been documented, there are conflicting
reports in the literature of the duration of immunity following
primary immunization schedules. Many of these studies have measured
pertussis antibody levels by number of years following last pertussis
dose (either primary series or after booster doses). One questions
why we have not seen more outbreaks of pertussis in school-aged
children in the developing world, where primary immunization with 3
doses of vaccine is the norm for the majority of the population.
(One may argue that there probably is a significant problem, but
diagnosis of the disease in older children is less frequent, and
therefore reporting via disease surveillance systems is suboptimal to
identify this problem.)
A note of caution on the interpretation of studies measuring duration
of immunity. A 1997 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
report on the use of the acellular pertussis vaccine stated: "It
should be mentioned that findings of efficacy studies have not
demonstrated a direct correlation between antibody responses and
protection against pertussis disease. However, antibody studies are
useful to compare immune responses elicited by a single vaccine under
different conditions or in different studies. Thus, efficacy studies
are required to measure clinical protection conferred by each
pertussis vaccine."
With respect to the outbreak in England, according to the newswire
reports, only one of 87 students was not vaccinated. Assuming that
the unvaccinated child was one of the 23 reported cases, the
estimated vaccine efficacy in this outbreak would be 74 percent,
somewhat decreased from a reported vaccine efficacy of approximately
80 percent following 3 doses of the whole-cell vaccine.
In a recent MMWR article on the trends in pertussis in the USA, the
authors noted that the pertussis incidence continues to increase in
infants too young to receive 3 doses of pertussis-containing vaccine
and in adolescents and adults (4). There was also reference to an
observed vaccine efficacy of 77-90 percent previously estimated using
the screening method (surveillance data) for whole-cell vaccine
during 1992--1994, comparing it to an observed vaccine efficacy of 88
percent in 1998/1999. This observed efficacy range for the
whole-cell pertussis vaccine is not far off from the estimated
vaccine efficacy in this current outbreak.
Of additional mention is a study on an outbreak in the Netherlands in
1996, which noted a probable decrease in vaccine efficacy among the
1- to 4-year-old population. (The term "probable" is being used, as
there was the question of possible increased reporting of cases that
was never fully resolved.) In this case, it was postulated that
there may have been changes in the pertussis organism in circulation
(8,9).
Hence, one might question the actual etiology of this current
outbreak of pertussis in a highly immunized population. Is it a
warning that a primary series of 3 doses of pertussis vaccine can
result in a vaccine efficacy that is too low to impact on disease
transmission? Is it a wake-up call for the need to further adjust
immunization schedules so that all children in primary schools in the
UK receive at least 4 doses of pertussis vaccine (3 doses DPT, and 1
booster DaPT), thus highlighting the need for catchup boosters for
children attending school prior to the addition of the school entry
dose in the office immunization schedule in the UK? Or could we be
detecting the presence of a changing organism, as postulated in the
Dutch experience?
Lest we fall victim to becoming a listserve on immunization
practices, this thread is now cut. - Mod.MPP
