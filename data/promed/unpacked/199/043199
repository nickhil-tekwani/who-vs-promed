UN health officials report in Cameroon a total of 9 presumptive cases of yellow fever, including 3 deaths (case fatality rate 33%), tested positive by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at the Centre Pasteur in Cameroun (CPC) through 9 Aug this year [2021].

These cases originated from 6 different regions with a total of 9 health districts (HDs) affected: Adamaoua region (Ngaoundere rural HD), Far North region (Maga, Mogode, Yagoua HD), Littoral region (Yabassi HD), North region (Guider, Garoua 1 HD), North-West region (Bamenda HD), and Centre region (Eseka HD).

Cameroon is among the countries classified as high risk for yellow fever according to the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics Global Strategy (EYE strategy) with a history of yellow fever outbreaks (1930s-2013).

The low vaccination coverage poses a risk of rapid spread of yellow fever in Cameroon. Coverage shows a suboptimal national immunization coverage for yellow fever vaccine of 57%. Only 35% of districts achieved 80% routine immunization coverage in 2018, 27% in 2019, and 28% in 2020.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that spreads through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death.

There are no medications to treat or cure yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccine is the best protection against this disease.

[Although Cameroon is classified as a country at high risk of yellow fever (YF), the reports of YF coming from that country have been sporadic. The low rate of YF vaccination in the country is of serious concern. The above report does not mention plans for a vaccination campaign to increase vaccination coverage. The occurrence of YF in 6 different regions and 9 health districts indicates that transmission of the virus is geographically widespread with the real risk of an outbreak initiated in any of these localities if prompt action is not taken. - Mod.TY
