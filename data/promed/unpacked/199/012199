At an environmental seminar held in the Kenyan lakeside town of Kisumu last
week it was reported that chemical fishing has been detected in some
landing bays around Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda. The practice, which poses a major hazard to consumers and the lake
environment, involves spraying chemicals into the lake to intoxicate the
fish so that they are easier to catch.
The chairman of the Uganda Fisheries and Fish Conservation Association, Mr
Kamuturaki Seremos, said Ugandan law enforcement officers are making
greater use of the Environmental Pollution Act, which gives the courts
powers to punish people who use chemicals to harvest fish. The Act was
recently revised to impose stiffer penalties on those caught committing the
offence. More than 30 people have in recent months been sentenced to jail
terms of seven years or fined Ush5 million for using chemicals to poison
fish.
Mr. Seremos said his Association had formed task forces from the national
level to the beach level to monitor the use of chemicals in the lake. "A
lot still needs to be done, however, especially with the recent EU ban on
fish from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, due to poor handling of
fish," said Mr Seremos. He said although many artisanal fishermen turn to
the use of chemicals because they cannot afford fishing tackle, there was
need for campaigns to educate them on the long term costs of lake pollution.
Last month, Uganda's Minister of State for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr.
Kazimbira Muyingo, called for a clamp-down on chemical fishing in all three
East African countries, saying it poses a serious health hazard to lakeside
populations and the lake's ecology.
The poisoning mainly affects the tilapia species which lives in the shallow
water near the shores. Only a small percentage of the deep water Nile Perch
is affected.
In Kenya, several fishermen have been arrested by fisheries scouts under
suspicion of using chemicals to harvest fish but their cases are still
pending in various law courts. The assistant director of fisheries for
Western Kenya, Mr. Mathias Wafula, told The East African that despite
efforts to check chemical fishing on the Kenyan side of the lake, the
practice was still rampant.
He said the use of a chemical known locally as "Ambush" was first reported
in Busia in March this year, in Siaya district in April, and has now spread
to Kisumu district. Investigations had established that "Ambush" had
originated from Uganda and Wafula called for coordination among the three
users of the lake to stop the practice.
Tanzanian environmentalists attending the Kisumu seminar said isolated
cases of chemical fishing on their side of the lake had been reported.
The Kisumu seminar was co-sponsored by Earth Greenery Activities Japan
(EGAJ) and the Kisumu-based non-governmental organisation OSIENALA (Friends
of the Lake) and brought together environmentalists and medial
practitioners from Japan and the East Africa region.

[Interestingly this Ugandan paper claimed that the "Ugandan government has
made great strides in its fight against chemical fishing in Lake Victoria,
but Kenya still has a long way to go." Obviously, this opinion may be valid
or it may depend on where your feet are. Can anyone tell us what
constitutes "Ambush"? - Mod.MHJ
