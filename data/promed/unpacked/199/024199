Abstract
--------
Nipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the _Paramyxoviridae_ family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, _Pteropus_ spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in 2 of 4 treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.

Introduction [abridged]
-----------------------
Nipah virus causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans (1). The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India, involving 23 cases and 21 deaths (2), again stressed the urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics or even pandemics (3). Very few antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Nipah virus disease.

Discussion [abridged]
---------------------
Although histologic evidence of meningoencephalitis was seen in one of 4 remdesivir-treated animals, remdesivir is distributed to the brain upon intravenous administration (15), and thus, remdesivir treatment may be reinitiated in cases of late-onset or relapse Nipah virus encephalitis. Intravenous remdesivir treatment was administered to a patient with acute Ebola virus meningitis that developed 9 months after the initial discharge (16), and a similar approach could potentially be used in late-onset or relapse encephalitis cases of Nipah virus infection. Remdesivir is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Liberia and Guinea to determine whether it can affect the persistent Ebola virus shedding in semen of Ebola male survivors (17). Likewise, treating survivors of Nipah virus infection with remdesivir could be considered to aid in completely clearing the virus, thereby preventing future relapses. If our finding of differential neutralizing antibody responses in persistently infected animals versus animals that apparently cleared the virus can be confirmed in human Nipah virus survivors, then a cohort of patients that may benefit from remdesivir treatment may be determined using a standard serological assay.

[The results of this limited experiment indicate that further tests are justified and needed. The authors point out that the treatment was administered relatively soon (1 day) after infection was initiated. It will be important to know how long into the infection, drug administration will be effective. Seeking medical attention and treatment very early in the course of an infection may not be practical in the field and limit usefulness of the drug. However, because the virus can be transmitted from infected to susceptible individuals, prophylactic treatment of contacts may be effective. The authors point out that the drug may be useful to prevent relapse encephalitis among survivors of the infection. Nipah virus infections occur almost every year in Bangladesh and practical and effective treatment is needed. Results of further studies are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY
