Rural carbuncle [Anthrax] status in Argentina 2020
--------------------------------------------------

Summary
1. Assessment area of rural carbuncle in the province of Buenos Aires (1977-2020): for this period, the 63 samples assessed were negative for isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_. The historical percentage distribution of carbuncle was 10%; out of 4508 samples assessed, 466 (10%) of them turned out to be positive for _Bacillus anthracis_.

2. Alert zone and response, district of Azul (2004-2020): since 2013, there have been no bovine carbuncle outbreaks or any cases reported in humans. There is a historical record of 67 bovine carbuncle outbreaks, which resulted in 22 human alerts and 21 veterinary alerts. From the beginning up to 2020, 3 604 169 bovines have been simultaneously vaccinated for foot and mouth disease and carbuncle.

3. Isolations in other veterinary diagnostic labs (2006-2020): 5 veterinary diagnostic labs of the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa processed a total of 103 samples, with the isolation of 13 strains of _Bacillus anthracis_, 10 coming from the province of Rio Negro, 1 from the province of Buenos Aires, and 2 from the province of La Pampa. The annual percentage distribution of carbuncle was 13%, and this proves an endemic persistence of bovine carbuncle in these 3 provinces of Argentina.

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in carbuncle outbreaks: during 2020, 2 bovine carbuncle sporadic outbreaks were reported in the districts of Pehuajo and Adolfo Alsina (Carhue).

5. Production of anti-carbuncle vaccine for veterinary use: the health authority approved 29 495 040 doses that were elaborated by 7 labs of biological products. If compared to 2019, 3 430 240 more doses were produced, which shows a marked increase in the production of this vital strategic input.

6. Mandatory simultaneous bovine vaccination: (a) alert zone and response (district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires): in 2020, 422 445 of the susceptible bovines (72%) were vaccinated; (b) province of Buenos Aires: a total of 11 443 500 bovines were vaccinated of a susceptible population of 12 073 900 bovines. This vaccination is mandatory as provided for in law no. 6703 and resolution no. 115-2014, the provisions of which prevent the movement in case of absence of vaccination, thus proving the commitment of cattle breeders and the efforts of veterinaries. (c) province of Santa Fe: it was not possible to obtain self-proving information on this sanitary event.

7. Cases of human carbuncle countrywide: due to the changes made to the National Surveillance Comprehensive Bulletin issued by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) since 2018, in which "human carbuncle cases" are no longer reported, it is not possible to provide such valuable information in a cattle-breeding country with more than 50 million bovines and the zoonosis conditions of this disease. In the 2009-2018 period, 23 cases of carbuncle were reported (including a fatal case in 2014) in the province of Santa Fe.

Conclusions
(a) There are still isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ in items of systematized assessment (3-4), thus showing the endemic nature of bovine carbuncle.

(b) The province of Rio Negro reported bovine carbuncle outbreaks. The provincial authorities reacted when required and generated an alert zone and response, and they convened all public health sectors involved.

(c) The monitored areas of bovine vaccination, alert zone and response - district of Azul and the province of Buenos Aires, showed progress in the objectives set. Enforcement of law no. 6703/61-regulatory decree no. 66/63 and resolution no. 115/14, which imposed restrictions on movements of cattle NOT vaccinated, within the provincial territory.

(d) The production of vaccines kept on increasing in the last 3 years, going from 21 million to over 29 million, and thus creating hopeful prospects.

(e) It is necessary to avoid the negligence shared by cattle breeders and health authorities in order to optimize animal health as part of the solution in control of carbuncle.

[They are working very hard in Argentina to get this disease fully controlled and eradicated. During 2020, there were just 2 bovine sporadic anthrax outbreaks reported in the districts of Pehuajo and Adolfo Alsina (Carhue). It is absent from humans. The disease has become truly sporadic, and a common history is a failure to wholly or completely vaccinate the herds. When the owners fail to vaccinate or leave out a bunch, it becomes public knowledge when the latter come down with anthrax.

This brings back memories of the problems in the US Dakotas, which are now effectively clear of this disease despite the procrastinators. Our thanks to Ramon for his annual report, and he has our full support for his hard work. - Mod.MHJ
