A potential _E. coli_ outbreak that's plagued Northeast Tennessee
since mid-May 2011 has sickened 2 more people, bringing the total
number of confirmed cases in the 8-county Northeast Tennessee region
so far in 2011 to 15. On Fri 17 Jun 2011 the Northeast Tennessee
Regional Health Office announced that it confirmed the presence of the
potentially fatal infection in 2 people who started showing symptoms
of a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ infection on 7 and 9 Jun 2011.
One is from Sullivan County, said Health Office Director David
Kirshke.

"We are working on all of these cases," Kirshke said, adding that his
office is trying to find out whether these 2 new cases are in any way
related to a series of 11 other confirmed cases that hit the region
between 15 May and 2 Jun 2011. "But so far we have not found a common
link between them."

On 5 Jun 2011, a 2-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother from
Dryden, VA, were rushed to the Johnson City Medical Center's Pediatric
Intensive Care Unit after they developed an _E. coli_ infection. The
girl died at the hospital that day while her brother was sent to
another hospital for further treatment and later released. Kirshke
said his staff is diligently working with the Virginia Department of
Health to figure out if there is any connection between these 2
children and the 13 Northeast Tennessee residents with confirmed
cases.

Even though no common links have been found, the health officer said
he is treating the situation like an outbreak because the dates these
symptoms started showing up are in such a small period of time. He
hopes test results from the 2 new cases that are due back next week
will help his office solve the puzzle.

Clusters of _E. coli_ infection reported in Eastern Tennessee could
be the "new normal" as non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC)
take their place beside O157, making outbreaks all that more difficult
to sort out. "It is very confusing," said Tennessee's State
Epidemiologist, Dr. Tim F. Jones on Mon 13 Jun 2011, as he explained
that in addition to 3 O157:H7 cases, 2 cases of _E. coli_ O103 and 1
of O169 have been confirmed in the eastern end of the state. Tennessee
is being assisted by the CDC in investigating a total of 11 cases of
_E. coli_ infection.

Dr. Jones said further complicating the investigation is the fact
that in the DNA "fingerprinting" by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis,
none of the PFGE patterns are the same for any of the _E. coli_
strains. PFGE patterns of bacteria isolated from the people who are
ill are often used to link cases to a common source.

Jones said the lab-test results have left Tennessee health officials
with a difficult investigation, trying to determine common foods and
activities for victims. At this point, he said, sources of
contamination could be anything from exposure to petting farm animals
or swallowing water from the wrong swimming hole.

After health officials confirmed they were dealing with STEC
bacteria, 2 western Virginia siblings turned up in Tennessee hospitals
on 5 Jun 2011 with illnesses caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7. The
2-year-old girl died, while her 5-year-old brother recovered after
being treated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Knoxville, TN.

But Jones said there appears to be no connection between those 2
cases from western Virginia and the 11 eastern Tennessee cases, not
even the O157 cases in Tennessee.

[The genetic differences between each of the strains suggest that the
association between cases is their closeness in time only, rather than
being epidemiologically connected. No definite vehicle or vehicles
have been yet elucidated although summertime is hamburger time and
undercooked ground beef may well play a role here. - Mod.LL]
