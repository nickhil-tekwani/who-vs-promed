Foot and Mouth Disease: contained in Brazil, outbreak in Ecuador.
-----------------------------------------------
Argentina lifted the ban on meat imports from 15 Brazilian states,
which was imposed 23 Jun 2004 following the outbreak of a foot and
mouth disease (FMD) case in the northern state of Para.
"Imports are allowed from all those states that have been recognized
as free of FMD with vaccination by the Paris based International
Organization of Epizooties" (OIE), said a spokesperson from SENASA,
the Argentine office that monitors sanitary and quality conditions of
food.
Reports from the Brazilian government indicate that the states
involved have adopted the necessary measures to ensure the condition
of free of FMD with vaccination. The list includes the states of
Bahia, Espirito Santo, Goias, Matto Grosso, Matto Grosso do Sul,
Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio do Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
Catarina, Sao Paulo, Sergipe, Tocantins, Rondonia, and the Federal
District of Brasilia. The outbreak in the state of Para was at a pork
farm.
In related news, Ecuadorian sanitary authorities have admitted they
are considering establishing an emergency area in the interior of the
country, after 2 cases tested positive for FMD and 3 others are
waiting for further testing.
Santo Domingo de los Colorados, where the positive cases have been
reported, is subtropical and one of Ecuador's main cattle and dairy
farming areas, 180 miles west of the capital, Quito. The 3 pending
cases are in the Andes highlands. However, the government's concern
is Santo Domingo de los Colorados with 200 000 hectares of pastures,
200 000 liters per day of milk, and an annual killing of 80 000 head
of cattle.
In 2002, Ecuador was forced to declare a national quarantine
following the outbreak of 40 cases in the Andean province of
Chimborazo.
