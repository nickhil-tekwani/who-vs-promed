Bird flu strain found at Camden market in poultry; no human risk, official says
-----------------------------------------------
A strain of avian influenza, or bird flu, has been found in Camden
County, but it is not believed to threaten humans, officials said.
The flu was found among chickens and ducks at a "live bird market,"
said the state Department of Agriculture, which did not identify the site.
The influenza strain "appears to be low pathogenic and cannot harm
humans," Charles M. Kuperus, the state's Secretary of Agriculture,
said in a statement Friday [28 Apr 2006] night.
Kuperus noted none of the birds in the market had died from the
virus, which he said suggests the strain is not especially virulent.
The owner of the birds voluntarily killed his flock, and the facility
was cleaned and disinfected under supervision of the state agency.
The market will be inspected by the agency before it reopens, Kuperus said.
He said the sick birds were detected by routine testing, an event
described as "not an uncommon occurrence."
Preliminary tests were negative for type N1 of the virus, another
indicator that the local virus is not particularly dangerous.
More testing is being conducted at federal laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
Camden County health officials could not be reached for comment.
"It remains safe to eat poultry and poultry products that are
properly handled and cooked," Kuperus said, noting all forms of avian
influenza are killed by thorough cooking.
The most severe type of "highly pathogenic" bird flu, which has
caused human deaths in Asia, has not been reported in the United
States, according to the website of the National Chicken Council.
Milder forms of avian flu "occur occasionally around the world," the
poultry group said.
