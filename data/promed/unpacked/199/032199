More bluetongue cases confirmed
-------------------------------------
There have been 3 more confirmed cases of bluetongue disease in East
Anglia, said Defra officials yesterday [15 Oct 2007]. That brings the
total number of cases in Suffolk and Essex to 41 and sheep in several
flocks have become infected by midges carrying the virus.

The majority of cases have been found in cattle, including several
cases near Lowestoft, although the Ipswich area -- where the 1st case
of bluetongue was identified on 22 Sep 2007 -- remains the confirmed
cluster.

The 1st case of bluetongue has also been confirmed in Denmark as the
virus has spread further into northern Europe. It was found in a
sheep flock on the Danish island of Lolland and takes the EU total of
animals infected by bluetongue to 23 500 since August 2006. [23 500
animals or rather holdings?! clarification from the EU will help. -

Livestock farmers in the bluetongue control zone, which covers most
of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex, were allowed to start
moving animals outside the protection zone covering most of eastern
England from today [16 Oct 2007].

Experts believe bluetongue was carried into England by midges blown
across the sea from the European coast in a plume on 4 Aug 2007,
which is thought to have come up the Orwell estuary.

In view of the appearance of bluetongue in sheep in the UK and in
Denmark, British and Danish practitioners and sheep owners may
appreciate the following observations, kindly forwarded to us by a
Dutch sheep breeder:

"You have to be aware that the 1st signs are sudden. One day the
flock is healthy and the next day you spot an animal that is:
A: 'walking on eggs' -- stiff, very careful gait
B: separated from the flock
C: [having difficulty in] standing up
D: foaming
E: swollen, warm legs
F: the level in the water bucket is suddenly, for no apparent reason, dropping
G: (sheep) voices are changing, they get softer and higher
H: scouring.

At the first sign treat them for 3 days with an anti-inflammatory;
when they develop a swollen mucosa use corticosteroids. Normally, the
sheep recover but can be sick again within a day, after 4-5 days, or
even after 2 weeks, with secondary [complications] like pneumonia,
[lung edema], enteritis, inflamed coronets. They can be really sick.
All of our rams suffered from inflamed coronets, sometimes they
couldn't walk for more than 2 weeks. Please be careful cutting away
the pieces of horn, but you need to check every day, remove the loose
horn and mostly you find blisters under the horn.

Use [antibiotics to treat] secondary [infections].

Keep [the animals] eating, but give them soft food, no concentrates,
they will choke in it. Don't force them to eat: it has cost us a very
nice ewe.

Observe you sheep carefully every day and you can immediately spot
the changes and come into action.

It takes about 6 weeks for the sheep to get in condition again."

We are grateful to Betty Stikkers
