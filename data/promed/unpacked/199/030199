Pakistan Minister Says Anthrax Found in Letter
---------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan said on Friday official tests showed that at least one suspicious
letter received in the country contained anthrax [_B. anthracis_] spores,
the first such discovery on the subcontinent. "4 letters were sent to 3
places in the last 10 days -- to a national newspaper, a computer company
and a bank," Science and Technology Minister Atta-ur-Rehman told CNN. "One
case has been confirmed officially, by a government laboratory. The 3
others have been judged positive for anthrax [_B. anthracis_] by a private
laboratory but need to be officially confirmed by the government." Rehman
said 2 people had been exposed to the bacteria in Karachi, but neither had
developed symptoms of the disease. He did not specify where the
contaminated letter was found, nor the strain of the disease [isolate].
Hours earlier the Pakistan government had cast doubt on claims by a Karachi
newspaper editor who said that white powder in an envelope hand-delivered
to his paper last week had tested positive for anthrax spores. But it said
the government had ordered state health authorities to collect samples from
the Daily Jang incident and carry out their own tests at the National
Institute of Health. A government spokesman Major-General Rashid Qureshi
had told a news conference earlier on Friday there had been 2 reports of
possible exposure to anthrax spores in Pakistan and he did not express any
doubts.
One case related to a computer company that was not identified and the
other was the Daily Jang, which had printed a front page story about the
incident. "We received a press release envelope which contained white
powder...and it has tested positive for containing anthrax spores," Mehmood
Sham, editor of Pakistan's leading Urdu-language daily, told Reuters.
Agha Masood Hasan, postmaster general of Pakistan, said earlier in the day
that he had no reports of anthrax from his department but was providing
gloves to employees handling international mail. "I think there is no need
to be panicky," he said.
Both the U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission in Islamabad had
anthrax scares that proved false. The U.S. Embassy said on Friday an
envelope containing white powder received on Tuesday had tested negative.

Pakistani newspaper re-opens after scare
---------------------------------------------------
3 institutions were targeted with suspect mail. The Urdu-language newspaper
was one of 3 institutions sent letters containing white powder; a bank and
a computer business were also targeted.
The editorial offices of Pakistan's largest circulation newspaper have
re-opened after being decontaminated following the discovery of a letter
containing anthrax [_B. anthracis_] spores last month. None of the Jang
newspaper's staff in Karachi were found to have been exposed to the
bacteria. The newsroom was sealed and workers in protective gear sprayed
the area as staff were treated with antibiotics as a precaution.
Pakistan's leading hospital, which confirmed the letter as testing positive
for anthrax, said that the letter will be sent abroad for further tests.

In India, the health secretary of a western state said Friday that powder
found in an envelope in a government office tested positive for anthrax and
would be examined further.
In India, Maharashtra State Health Secretary Subhash Salunkhe said traces
of anthrax were found on an envelope received by the office of the state's
deputy chief minister. It was the first positive anthrax result in more
than 200 cases of suspicious envelopes tested in India.
