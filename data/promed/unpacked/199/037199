Fundacion Mundo Sano warned today [2 Feb 2009] about the increase of Chagas
disease in Spain and called for widespread screening of pregnant women from
risk areas to prevent further infections. According to data made public by
this foundation, in 2008, there were 450 cases in Spain of this disease,
which is incurable and asymptomatic for many years.

The director general of Fundacion Mundo Sano, Sonia Tarragona, believes
that although one cannot avoid transmission to the fetus if the mother is
infected, existing drugs are effective in preventing children from
developing the chronic form of the disease, which does not happen in the
case of adults. She also called for a review of the measures taken, such as
those by Spanish blood banks, not to accept blood donations from Latin
Americans, in light of the fact that many Spaniards have traveled to Latin
America for various reasons and may also have contracted the disease.

Catalonia, Madrid, Murcia, and Valencia are the autonomous communities that
recorded the highest incidence; although not being a disease of mandatory
notification, there are an unknown number of cases out there. Chagas
disease affects an estimated 20 million people, causes the deaths of about
50 000 per year, and is endemic in Latin America, especially in rural areas
of Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay, although migration and tourism have
resulted in many people with the disease living in Spain today.

[Valencia (Spain) has become the 1st European city to introduce a
compulsory test on blood donations by immigrants of Latin American origin
to check whether or not they are suffering from the disease. - Mod.JT

Congenital _Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection is a huge problem in South
America, and a high rate of infection can be maintained without
transmission through triatomid bugs simply from mother to child if a high
proportion of mothers are infected. In one study from Bolivia, 33 per cent
of pregnant mothers were seropositive, and 5.2 per cent of the newborns had
_T. cruzi_ in their blood (Brutus L, et al. Congenital Chagas disease:
diagnostic and clinical aspects in an area without vectorial transmission,
Bermejo, Bolivia. Acta Trop 2008; 106: 195-9
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448076?ordinalpos=5&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum>).

It is conceivable that infected newborns become lifelong carriers as are
seen for hepatitis B and when adults pass the infection to their children
thus maintaining a high rate of infection even with successful vector
control (See: Petersen E. Protozoan and helminth infections in pregnancy.
Short-term and long-term implications of transmission of infection from
mother to foetus. Parasitology 2007; 134: 1855-62
