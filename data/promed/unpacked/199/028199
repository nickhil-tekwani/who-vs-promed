Bovine tuberculosis (TB) was recently confirmed in a large beef herd in Alcona County, Michigan. This herd, which is the 73rd cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.

Bovine TB is an infectious bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle. It is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ), a US Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. Annual surveillance and movement testing are required of cattle producers, which helps catch the disease early and prevents it from being moved off the farm.

"In the [MAZ], anything shared by deer and cattle can be a potential source of bovine tuberculosis infection," said Michigan's Assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr, DVM. "Preventing deer from having contact with cattle feed, feed storage or watering areas is crucial for farmers in this area of Michigan and a part of wildlife biosecurity programs being implemented."

This latest development will be discussed at 2 informational meetings in the MAZ:

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the US has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the US. Many consider this one of the great animal and public health achievements in the US. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive, as animal health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.

Signs
----
Q. What is bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _M. bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often do not show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

Q. How does TB get into cattle herds? [One of these ways may be how the disease reached Nebraska. - Mod.TG]
A. TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the US, the 2 most common methods of introduction are:
(1) Purchase of or exposure to infected cattle, or
(2) Exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife. The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spread through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.
