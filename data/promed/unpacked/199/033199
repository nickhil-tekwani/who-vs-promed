The Public Health Ministry has warned tourists returning from a trip to a forest during the winter season to seek medical attention if they come down with a fever and headache, as they could have caught scrub typhus or malaria.

Scrub typhus is spread to people through bites by infected chiggers (larval mites) and the latter [malaria] through bites by female mosquitoes of the genus _Anopheles_, said Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, spokesman and deputy permanent secretary for the Public Health Ministry. Though the 2 diseases occur year-round, the numbers of cases rise during the winter season.

From 1 Oct 2017 until 12 Jan 2018, there were 2185 scrub typhus patients in Thailand, 2 of whom died, said Opas.

Scrub typhus symptoms include fever, headache (especially in the temples and forehead), body aches, and dry cough. Symptoms appear 10-12 days after being bitten. Some 40 percent of patients also had "eschars," dark red patches of dead skin tissue, around the skin areas where infected chiggers bit them. Some patients suffer from serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis, which could turn deadly. Chiggers live in shaded humid bushes.

Opas also advised that people emerging from the forest should shower and wash their clothing right away to prevent chigger bites.

[Scrub typhus outbreaks have been previously reported in central and northeastern regions of Thailand (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/2/17-1172_article, http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.16-0088, http://www.ajtmh.org/docserver/fulltext/14761645/75/6/0751099.pdf?expires=1516405239&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=F92A76E8DC5880377D340751E6B8F743, and https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/5/12-1445_article).

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to _O. tsutsugamushi_ at the site of the infected chigger bite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034347/).

Illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373099/).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.
