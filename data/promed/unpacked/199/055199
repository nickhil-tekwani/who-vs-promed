Zimbabwean authorities have banned the sale, slaughter, and movement of cattle in the Masvingo Province following an outbreak of anthrax and foot-and-mouth diseases.

All public cattle auction sales have been banned while the movement of cattle has also been suspended as the Department of Veterinary Services imposes stringent measures to minimize the spread of the diseases. The slaughter of cattle for ceremonies such as weddings and funerals has also been suspended amid concerns from villagers.

Masvingo Provincial Veterinary Officer, Ernest Dzimwasha, confirmed the outbreak but could not provide figures. "We are currently fighting these 2 cattle diseases and our men are on the ground to ensure that all the cattle in the affected areas are vaccinated," said Dzimwasha. "Chiredzi and Mwenezi districts remain the worst affected and we will lift the ban only if we are satisfied that the disease have been eradicated," added Dzimwasha.

Government last month [October 2014] declared the cattle diseases outbreak a national disaster by the government officials from the veterinary services said that at least 1000 cattle succumbed to the disease in less than 2 months. "The figure of those that have died could be much higher as reports from the affected districts are coming in daily," added the source.

Some villagers in some of the affected areas have complained bitterly over the stringent measures imposed by the veterinary services arguing that it will affect their daily lives. "Imagine that I am being banned from slaughtering my beast even at a funeral or wedding," said [a farmer] of Mwenezi.

"The only logical thing to do is to make sure that veterinary officers are in all the affected areas and inspect all the cattle on time including those that we might want to slaughter for funerals and weddings," he added.

However, it emerged that the Department of Veterinary Services is short staffed, which is hampering efforts to eradicate the diseases. The Zimbabwean government froze the recruitment of new staff into the civil service and the problems continue to haunt the Department of Veterinary Services, especially at such times of disease outbreaks.

The outbreak of disease is likely to affect the availability of beef products in several areas in southern Zimbabwe.

There were bovine outbreaks in Masvingo in 2003 when 8 people died of anthrax; 58 bovine outbreaks in 2005 with 398 bovine cases and 92 human cases; in 2005 there were 5 human cases with 3 deaths from folk eating jerky from infected carcasses of 2004; 11 outbreaks in 2007 with 39 bovine cases; 2 outbreaks in 2008 with 10 bovine cases; 2009 (3 outbreaks and 4 cases); 2010 (9, 69); 2011 (1, 1); 2012 (7, 10); 2013 had no outbreaks reported.

In the chaos and confusion of dealing with 2 simultaneous disease problems we can expect that people will butcher sick and dead animals, which will be followed by reports of human cases and maybe deaths. - Mod.MHJ
