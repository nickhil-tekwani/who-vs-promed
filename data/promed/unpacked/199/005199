Threat Assessment Brief: Rapid increase of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with multiple spike protein mutations observed in the United Kingdom
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this Threat Assessment Brief is to summarise the findings, assess potential public health implications of this new variant, provide options for response and point out limitations, unknowns, and needs for further studies and investigations.

Executive summary
-----------------
Over the last few weeks, the United Kingdom (UK) has faced a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in South East England, leading to enhanced epidemiological and virological investigations. Analysis of viral genome sequence data identified a large proportion of cases that belonged to a new single phylogenetic cluster. The new variant is defined by multiple spike protein mutations (deletion 69-70, deletion 144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) present as well as mutations in other genomic regions. While it is known and expected that viruses constantly change through mutation leading to the emergence of new variants, preliminary analysis in the UK suggests that this variant is significantly more transmissible than previously circulating variants, with an estimated potential to increase the reproductive number (R) by 0.4 or greater with an estimated increased transmissibility of up to 70%. This new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing. There is no indication at this point of increased infection severity associated with the new variant. A few cases with the new variant have to date been reported by Denmark and the Netherlands and, according to media reports, in Belgium.

Given that there is currently a lack of evidence to indicate the extent to which the new virus variant is spread outside the UK, timely efforts to prevent and control its spread are needed and include the following:
- Public health authorities and laboratories are urged to analyse and sequence virus isolates in a timely manner to identify cases of the new variant. People with an epidemiological link to cases with the new variant or travel history to areas known to be affected should be identified immediately to test, isolate and follow up their contacts in order to stop the spread of the new variant.

- If cases infected with this new SARS-CoV-2 variant or other new SARS-CoV-2 variants of potential concern are identified, countries should notify through the Early Warning and Response System of the European Union.

- The importance of strict adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions according to national policies needs to be communicated to the public, and in particular guidance on the avoidance of non-essential travel and social activities should be stressed.

- Laboratories should review the PCR performance and drop-out of the S-gene. PCR could be used as an indicator for cases with the new variant for further sequencing and investigation.

- Suspected cases of COVID-19 reinfection should be followed up, closely accompanied by sequencing respective virus isolates from these cases. Similarly, cases with treatment failures using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies should be further studied.

- With the implementation of vaccination, close monitoring of COVID-19-vaccinated individuals needs to be ensured to identify possible vaccination failure and breakthrough infections. Virus isolates from these cases should be sequenced and characterised genetically and antigenically.

[Please see COVID-19 update (545): mutations, UK, South Africa, South Asia, WHO, global 20201220.8032607 for an excellent discussion of the mutations and implications by my colleague Mod.UBA.

The full threat assessment brief can be found at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/SARS-CoV-2-variant-multiple-spike-protein-mutations-United-Kingdom.pdf.

Excerpts of the brief follow:
"A SARS-CoV-2 variant, referred to as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01), has been identified through viral genomic sequencing in the United Kingdom (UK). It is defined by multiple spike protein mutations (deletion 69-70, deletion 144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) present.

"Over the last few weeks, the UK has faced a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases (Figures 1 and 2, Annex Figures 5 and 6). This increase was pronounced in South East England, with an increase in the 14-day case notification rate from 100 cases per 100 000 population in week 41/2020 to over 400 per 100 000 in week 50/2020 (Fig. 1 and Annex Fig. 6).

"This increase led to an enhanced epidemiological and virological investigation. Analysis using viral genome sequence data identified a large proportion (more than 50%) of cases belonged to a new single phylogenetic cluster [1]. This variant is referred to in the UK as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01). Overall, around 5 to 10% of all COVID-19 cases are regularly sequenced in the UK, with a sequencing coverage in Kent, the part of South East England that was most affected, of around 4%. As of [13 Dec 2020], 1108 individuals had been identified with this virus variant in England, with the earliest case identified from [20 Sep 2020]. The observed rapid increase in COVID-19 cases overall was temporally associated with the emergence of the new variant in this area in November 2020. The reported COVID-19 cases related to the VUI 202012/01 variant are concentrated in Kent and wider South East England, including the regions of London and the East of England, but there are indications of a more widespread occurrence of cases across the UK as well as small numbers of cases detected in other countries. In Wales, as of [14 Dec 2020], 20 individuals had been identified with this virus variant of 4733 sequenced samples collected since [1 Nov 2020]. Additionally, Denmark has reported 9 cases [2], the Netherlands reported 1 case [3], and 1 case from Australia was identified through the GISAID EpiCov database. Media report that 4 cases have been identified in Belgium in recent months [4].

"On [19 Dec 2020], in response to the increase of this variant, the countries of the UK have announced stricter measures to be applied from [20 Dec 2020] and over the coming weeks, with affected areas going into a 'Tier 4' level with movement restrictions within and between more and less heavily affected areas [5,6]. These measures include recommendations for residents of the most affected areas to restrict movements and travel, including international travel, outside of these areas. The government of Scotland announced a travel ban between Scotland and the rest of the UK from [26 Dec 2020].

"In addition, the Netherlands issued a travel ban from the UK effective from 6:00 a.m. on [20 Dec 2020] until [1 Jan 2021] [3] and Belgium halted flight and train travel to the UK for a 24-hour period as of midnight on [20 Dec 2020] [7].

"Epidemiology
"The investigations into the properties of this new variant are ongoing, and poorer clinical outcomes, higher mortality or particularly affected groups have not been reported to date. The cases with the VUI 202012/01 variant are predominantly identified in people younger than 60 years, but the increase of overall COVID-19 cases in England is similarly driven by this age group (Figure 2). Preliminary modelling results show a strong association between the presence of the new variant in the Kent/South East England region and increasing incidence of COVID-19. Among the 20 VUI 202012/01 cases identified in Wales, cases have a median age of 41 years (range 11-71 years), and are mainly located in South Wales, where incidences are also rising. The increasing proportion of cases with the VUI 202012/01 variant among all sequenced isolates uploaded to the GISAID database is shown in Figure 3."

The document discusses possible impact on diagnostics and the modelling demonstrating the variant has increased the R0 by 0.4. They clearly mention that to date there is no evidence of increased severity of disease associated with this variant, albeit data are sparse. Given the spike protein changes, they raise the concern of increased reinfections and possible reduced immunity related to vaccination with the following statement "It is therefore essential to monitor changes in the spike protein among the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and assess possible antigenic changes."

"Recommendations for National Public Health authorities:
- Immediately identify people with an epidemiological link to cases with the new variant or travel history to areas known to be affected in order to test, isolate and follow up their contacts so as to stop the spread of the new variant. Virus isolates from such cases should be sequenced in a timely manner to identify cases of the new variant.
- Continue to advise the population on the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions according to their national policies, and consider in particular guidance on the avoidance of travel and avoidance of nonessential social activities.
- Continue to monitor for abrupt changes in rates of transmission or disease severity as part of the process of identifying and assessing the impact of variants.
- Notify cases of the new variant as well as new SARS-CoV-2 variants of potential concern through the Early Warning and Response System of the European Union.
- Follow up reports of suspected cases of COVID-19 reinfection and initiate sequence analysis of virus isolates from these cases.
- Follow up reports of cases with treatment failures using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies as recently described [17] and initiate sequence analysis of virus isolates from these cases.
- Ensure that close monitoring of COVID-19-vaccinated individuals regarding vaccination failure and breakthrough infections is in place and initiate sequence analysis of virus isolates from these cases, and then conduct antigenic characterisation to confirm or exclude vaccine escape mutants.
- Develop standardised mechanisms, in partnership with global stakeholders, including triggers to investigate and assess newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of animal reservoir, antigenic characteristics, transmissibility, infection severity, cross-protection and also with regard to adapting vaccine strain recommendations. If needed, establish systems for reassessing vaccine composition and strategy. "

"National public health laboratories should:
- Sequence virus isolates from cases with an epidemiological link to countries where the variant is present, currently the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands according to official reports, and possibly also Belgium.
- Increase the number of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates to identify new variants similar to the UK variants in EU/EEA Member States. Laboratories can refer to the upcoming technical note "Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2" which is in preparation by ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe for guidance about technologies and sample selection. ECDC can offer sequencing services to countries with limited national capacity in this area.
- Increase representativeness of isolates selected for sequencing based on population and geographic location of infections to identify emerging variants and assess spread.
- Assess the implications of the drop out of the S-gene target RT-PCR in use for diagnostic purposes and adapt the gene target regions for SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics. If sequencing capacity is limited, multi-target RT-PCR assays that include an S-gene target that is affected by the deletions present in the variant can be used for identifying isolates that show an S-gene drop out as a signal for further investigation. Note that the deletion at positions 69-70 of the spike protein is not exclusive to this variant. Confirmation using sequencing is recommended.
- Increase capacities to perform in-depth virus characterisation analyses genetically and antigenically or share isolates with SARS-CoV-2 reference laboratories for further genetic and antigenic investigations."

As a reminder similar concerns were raised when the D614G variant was identified. One hopes that continued studies will clarify any risks associated with this variant. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/20/netherlands-bans-uk-flights-after-finding-new-coronavirus-strain


Several European countries have banned flights to and from the United Kingdom and others were considering such action, all in hopes of blocking a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from establishing a strong foothold on the continent.

The Netherlands was the first on Sunday [20 Dec 2020] to announce an immediate ban on flights, with similar advisories quickly following from Belgium, Austria, and Italy. Germany said it is banning flights coming from Britain in reaction to the new coronavirus strain. Its transportation ministry said all UK flights with the exception of cargo flights were no longer allowed to land in Germany starting at midnight on Sunday [20 Dec 2020]. It didn't immediately say how long the flight ban would last, but DPA news agency [Deutsche Presse-Agentur] reported it would be in place at least until [31 Dec 2020].

Germany, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, also called a special crisis meeting on Monday [21 Dec 2020] to coordinate the response to the virus news among the bloc's 27 member states.

The Netherlands banned flights from the UK for at least the rest of the year while Belgium issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain, including the Eurostar.

Austria and Italy said they would halt flights from the UK but did not say exactly when that would take place.

Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio on Twitter said the government was preparing the ban "to protect Italians" from the new coronavirus variant. About 2 dozen flights were scheduled to arrive in Italy on Sunday [20 Dec 2020], most in the northern region of Lombardy but also to Venice and Rome.

The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures for people arriving from Britain.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Sunday [20 Dec 2020] said he was issuing the flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight "out of precaution".

An EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing, said on Sunday [20 Dec 2020] afternoon the European Commission was in touch with member states on the rapidly developing situation.

Just days before Christmas, high-speed train operator Eurostar cancelled its trains between London, Brussels, and Amsterdam beginning Monday [21 Dec 2020], but kept trains operating on the London-to-Paris route.

https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/20/world/covid-19-coronavirus


Countries across Europe and beyond began closing their borders to travelers from the United Kingdom on Sunday [20 Dec 2020], and the European Union set up a crisis management meeting, a day after Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, ordered a wholesale lockdown on London and surrounding areas, citing concerns of a new fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus.

Train stations in London on Saturday night [19 Dec 2020] filled with crowds of people scrambling to leave the city to escape the new restrictions, which went into effect at midnight and effectively quarantined the capital and other areas from the rest of the country, the harshest measures to be taken since the country's 1st lockdown in March [2020].

On Sunday [20 Dec 2020], Britain's health secretary, Matt Hancock, called those who packed trains "clearly irresponsible." He also said that the restrictions Mr Johnson imposed could be in place for months.

The 1st wave of countries to bar travelers from the United Kingdom was in Europe. The Netherlands said it would suspend flights from Britain from Sunday [20 Dec 2020] until [1 Jan 2021], noting that the variant found in England was "thought to spread more easily and more quickly."

Italy also suspended air travel, and Belgian officials on Sunday [20 Dec 2020] enacted a 24-hour ban on arrivals from the United Kingdom by air or train, which could be extended. Germany and Switzerland announced bans on travel between their countries, and both Britain and South Africa, where a similarly contagious version of the virus has emerged. Austria, Ireland, France, and Bulgaria also announced bans. Portugal, which banned travel to and from the United Kingdom, is making exceptions for Portuguese nationals or residents. And Canada said on Sunday [20 Dec 2020] that it would ban all flights from the UK for 72 hours, beginning at midnight.

In the United States, Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York urged the federal government to take action, saying that "right now, this variant in the UK is getting on a plane and flying to JFK [airport]," while also acknowledging that it may be too late. The State Department said that its travel advisory to Britain had not been changed and remained at Level 3.

Spain asked the European Union for a coordinated response, and senior officials from the bloc's 27 member states met by video conference Sunday [20 Dec 2020] evening to share their plans. They agreed to decide on any coordinated action at the crisis management meeting, to be held Monday morning [21 Dec 2020].

Within hours, more countries took action. Iran suspended flights to Britain for 2 weeks, Reuters reported. Israel barred foreign nationals not only from the United Kingdom but also from South Africa and Denmark, where a coronavirus mutation that occurred in mink was transmitted back into the human population. Turkey temporarily suspended flights from those 3 countries, as well as the Netherlands, Reuters said.

Transportation officials in England said that they would increase the number of police officers monitoring hubs like railway stations to ensure only essential journeys were being taken. And during one of the year's biggest shipping periods, the effects were sure to be seen at Britain's ports. The Port of Dover, one of the world's busiest, where thousands of trucks travel each day, closed its ferry terminal to "all accompanied traffic." Traffic had reached a fever pitch as companies stockpiled goods before new post-Brexit customs rules went into effect.

Viral mutations are not uncommon, and British officials said this variant had been detected in a handful of other countries. The estimate of greater transmissibility for the British variant is based on modeling and has not been confirmed by lab experiments, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government.

"Overall, I think we need to have a little bit more experimental data," she said. "We can't entirely rule out the fact that some of these transmissibility data might be related to human behavior."

The virus lockdown came as another down-to-the-wire drama was playing out for Britons: the trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union. Critics say the British prime minister's penchant for last-minute decisions has complicated the handling of the coronavirus crisis and narrowed the window for scrutiny of any trade deal with the EU.

[Unfortunately, this virus's ability for stealth transmission (asymptomatic infected individuals shed virus as do pre-symptomatic infected individuals) may well be its success ticket to more widespread transmission in other countries as a sizable number of individuals have begun their holiday travels already. Planning shutdowns leaving time for individuals to mobilize before the shutdown may be detrimental to interruption of transmission (see New York Times article above in [B]).

The comment from Cevik "Overall, I think we need to have a little bit more experimental data," she said. "We can't entirely rule out the fact that some of this transmissibility data might be related to human behavior," will hopefully account for some or more of the observed increase in transmission. We await more information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]

Thailand reports record-breaking 500 new virus cases
----------------------------------------------------
Health officials said 548 new coronavirus infections were found in connection with the outbreak at Thailand's largest wholesale seafood market.

All of the new infections -- an unprecedented number -- were linked to a seafood vendor who tested positive for the coronavirus earlier, Opas Karnkawinpong, Director-General of the Department of Medical Sciences said in a news conference broadcast to all TV channels on Saturday [19 Dec 2020] night.

Most of the cases did not display any symptoms, Opas said.

Samut Sakhon Governor Veerasak Vichitsaengsri said the province will reintroduce travel restrictions measures and business closures in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.

"The situation is certainly more severe than many of us had thought," Veerasak said at the news conference.

The case number is the highest number ever recorded since Thailand first witnessed a coronavirus infection in January [2020]. The previous highest daily count of cases was back in March [2020].

This is a developing story and will be updated without notice.

[Contact tracing of the local case detected in Samut Sakhon province on 17 Dec 2020 revealed a total of 548 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Samut Sakhon province is one of the renowned provinces with the seafood industry. The shrimp market (Talad Kung) is the central shrimp market and the majority of the workers are migrants.

According to the press release by the Ministry of Public Health at 21:00 ICT on 19 Dec 2020 (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=444980140239539&id=1629872910668055, in Thai), the ministry informed the people living in the affected areas not to leave the province, and those who had potential contact with shrimp dealers in the province since 1 Dec 2020 to monitor the symptoms for 14 days, wear masks and avoid going to public areas. - Mod.YMA

[At present, domestic cases of COVID-19 were detected in Samut Sakhon and nearby provinces. A majority of the cases were migrant workers and found to be linked with the recent cluster in Samut Sakhon province, while investigations are underway for the rest of the cases.

More cases might be discovered in the coming days since surveillance and investigation have been carried out in many other provinces to identify and test those who traveled to Samut Sakhon province.

Anyone who visited the shrimp market in Samut Sakhon province from 1 Dec 2020 onwards is encouraged to report to the nearby hospital for laboratory testing (https://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/crimecourtscalamity/2020/12/20/infections-from-seafood-market-outbreak-found-in-bangkok-other-provinces/). - Mod.YMA

In reading through Mod.YMA's excellent coverage of the unfolding situation in Thailand, a key question that comes to mind is what was the index case's exposure? It is curious that this outbreak is associated with a seafood market, similar to those seen in China. Definitely food for thought.... - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218].

Data by country, area, or territory for 20 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC20_1608513433.pdf.
Between the weekend reduced reporting in Europe and the clear backlog reporting by the USA, doing a daily detailed update doesn't make sense.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 20 Dec 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[Weekend reporting decreases are occurring. Among the countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, and Ghana. In the past 24 hours, the USA (189 811), UK (35 928), and Russia (28 948) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7788 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, Brazil (25 445), India (24 589), Germany (20 822), Turkey (20 316), Italy (15 102), Netherlands (13 032), France (12 799), and Colombia (11 160). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 60 countries on Fri 18 Dec 2020); 24 of the 50 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.5%. (influenced by Turkey's high backlog reporting 11 days ago). The USA is also showing reduced reporting with a 50% reduction in reported deaths from Fri 18 Dec 2020. Similar comparative averages for the USA show a decrease of 13.9% in reported cases and an increase of 4.5% in reported deaths. - Mod.MPP]
