Increase in Hepatitis B and C Morbidity in the Capital
------------------------------------------------------
MOSCOW (7 Dec 2000): Hepatitis C morbidity has been increased 7-fold, and
hepatitis B 2-fold during the last 5 years in the Russian capital,
according to the Moscow Committee of Health Care. Young people between 15
and 29 years of age comprise 80 per cent of those infected.
At the present time Russia has a high level of hepatitis C morbidity. For
the year 2000 the morbidity index is 19.3 cases per 100 000 population. By
comparison in 1994 this number was 3.2 cases per 100 000. Hepatitis C
virus is [responsible for acute hepatitis in 20 percent of cases, and
chronic hepatitis in 70 percent. Physicians warn that there are not
sufficient resources [to deal with this burden of disease.
In Moscow in 1998, 95 000 school pupils (80.3 per cent of the total number)
were
vaccinated against hepatitis B during a mass immunization programme. In
Apr 2000, more than 110 000 pupils (91.1 per cent) were immunized, and in
Oct 2000 the third stage of the vaccination programme was completed.
However, according to the statistical data, these measures do not help.
First of all only specific groups [of the population are
involved in the immunization programme, and others who potentially could
[transmit the infection are not included.

Hepatitis A Outbreak in the Khabarovsk Region
----------------------------------------------
KHABAROVSK (29 Nov 2000): According to the Khabarovsk Sanitary &
Epidemiological Service a hepatitis A outbreak was recorded among
schoolchildren in the industrial sector of Khabarovsk during a 2-week
period. A total of 34 teenagers [under 14 years of age have been
hospitalized with this diagnosis. [An outbreak of hepatitis A was also
reported in the Bikinsk district of the Khabarovsk area, where 40 people
(including both children and adults) have been hospitalized. The main
source of the infection in both cases was considered to be poor quality
drinking water.

Hepatitis A Outbreak Closes University Dormitory in Moscow
----------------------------------------------------------
MOSCOW (25 Nov 2000): Studies have been stopped at the Moscow Pedagogical
State University because [a hepatitis quarantine is in force. On 23 Nov
2000, 2 residents of the students' dorm were hospitalized with a diagnosis
of hepatitis A infection. The quarantine has been instituted because of
the [danger of the disease spreading among the 200 students who live in
the dorm and study at the university alongside the 2 infected
students. The University is situated in the center of Moscow in Vernadsky
Prospect. The quarantine will last till 28 Nov 2000, [provided no more
cases are reported.

Hepatitis and Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreaks in Saratov Oblast
-----------------------------------------------------------
SARATOV (24 Nov 2000): According to the Saratov Oblast (province) Sanitary
& Epidemiological Service, the Oblast is at the end of epidemics of
hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever. By comparison with Nov 1999 the number of
hemorrhagic fever cases has increased 32-fold. In the case of hepatitis,
only 3000 people (1 per cent of the 3 million population) have been
immunized against the infection. The Saratov physicians hope that a
recently-adopted immunization program "Vaccinoprophilaktika" [will improve
the situation, but the financial support [is only now in place.

Hepatitis A Outbreak in North Ossetia and Vladikavkaz
-----------------------------------------------------
NORTH OSSETIA (23 Nov 2000): [A total of 67 persons (2 adults and 65
schoolchildren) with hepatitis [have been admitted to the District
Infectious Diseases Hospital from Kizlyar village, Mozdok district, North
Ossetia. [The last time such an outbreak was observed was 20 years
ago. The source of the outbreak this year was infected drinking water
because of a water-supply break. Also the number of patients with the
diagnosis "zheltukcha" (hepatitis A) sharply increased in
Vladikavkaz. Every day 2-3 infected patients with this diagnosis are
[admitted to the infectious diseases department of the Republic Emergency
Hospital. [Currently there are several tens of patients in the
hospital. Physicians have to move patients to ambulatory care after 1-2
days because of insufficient numbers of hospital [beds.

Hepatitis A Outbreak in Brest Oblast, Belarus
---------------------------------------------
BREST (6 Dec 2000): Between 5 Nov and 5 Dec 2000, 22 persons (comprising 17
schoolchildren, 3 kindergarten children, and 2 teachers) from Mal'kovichi
village, Gantsevichi district, Brest Oblast (province), have been admitted
to the Gantsevichi hospital with a diagnosis of hepatitis A. According to
Valentina Bobko, the Head of the infectious diseases department of the
hospital, all patients are in satisfactory condition and no serious
complications have been observed. The village school and kindergarten were
closed for a 30-day quarantine period. According to Aleksander Solyanik,
chief sanitary physician of the district, the situation is stabilizing and
only one patient has been hospitalized with a diagnosis of hepatitis A
during the past week. Physicians connect the source of the outbreak with
poor quality drinking water. [A piped water supply is absent in the
village, and the ground water level is only 0.5 meter.
