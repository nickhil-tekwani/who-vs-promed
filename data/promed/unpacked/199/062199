A Comment on La Crosse Encephalitis Diagnosis
---------------------------------------------
The recent report and comment on La Crosse virus infection in a
12-year-old girl in Ohio are confusing [see: La Crosse encephalitis -
USA (OH): susp. 20040901.2433 & La Crosse encephalitis - USA
(OH)(02): susp. 20040902.2447].

Although the patient is described in the newspaper report as
suffering from encephalitis, she is also reported to be "doing well
and at home". Perhaps she simply has a severe infection with La
Crosse virus?

That she has a La Crosse virus infection must be questionable,
because the title of the report includes "suspected." I am pleased
to see that this is not yet being reported as a confirmed infection
with this virus. In 1986 I co-authored a paper with 3 members of the
Ohio Department of Health: Calisher, C.H., C.I. Pretzman, D.J. Muth,
M.A. Parsons, and E.D. Peterson. Serodiagnosis of La Crosse virus
infections in humans by detection of immunoglobulin M class
antibodies. J. Clin. Microbiol. 23:667 671, 1986.

In this paper we showed that at least one person with La Crosse virus
infection (confirmed in other ways) had IgM antibody to the virus for
at least 104 days after onset of illness. Therefore, the presence of
IgM antibody to this virus in a single serum cannot be used to make a
confirmed diagnosis. Dennis Cunningham indicates "Diagnosis is made
by the presence of IgM on acute serology. If acute serology is
negative, it is ideal to obtain convalescent titers [sic] as well."
Provisional serodiagnosis of La Crosse virus infections may be made
if IgM antibody is detected in patient's blood, but paired acute- and
convalescent-phase samples must be obtained before it is possible to
make a confirmed serodiagnosis.

The long history of the Ohio Department of Health includes
fundamental studies that provided data essential to our understanding
of the dynamics of La Crosse virus infections. I would hope that
tests of single serum samples are not being used there to replace
adequate testing.
