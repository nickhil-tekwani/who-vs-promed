Exotic mosquitoes intercepted at Ports of Auckland
-----------------------------------------------
Auckland Regional Public Health Service staff are responding to the
unexpected finding of exotic mosquitoes at the Ports of Auckland over
the weekend [30-31 Jul 2005].
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Quarantine staff captured an
exotic adult mosquito while conducting their routine duties at the
Port early on Saturday [30 Jul 2005] evening. An immediate search of
the vicinity revealed a number of exotic mosquito larvae on a cargo
hatch that had been off-loaded from a ship that had arrived in
Auckland a few days before the find. The specimens that were found
were _Stegomyia aegypti_ (Yellow Fever Mosquito) and _Stegomyia
albopictus_ (Asian Tiger Mosquito) [see moderator's comments on the
use of _Stegomyia_ as a genus at end of this post]. The 2 species are
known to be able to spread a number of diseases, including yellow
fever, which is one of 3 quarantinable diseases internationally,
namely, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, and Ross River
virus. The Asian Tiger Mosquito can also spread Japanese encephalitis
and West Nile virus.
MAF quarantine staff (MQS) took samples for confirmation and treated
the immediate site to kill any mosquitoes. MQS reported the incident
to the Auckland Regional Public Health Services staff, who are
treating the habitat and monitoring the area to detect any further
mosquitoes.
Deputy Chief Technical Officer from the Ministry of Health, JR
Gardner, says, "The cargo hatch that contained the larvae has been
treated and fumigated. The cargo sheds in the area have been fogged
to knock down any other adults that might be sheltering in them. A
survey has been conducted in the vicinity of the finding, and any
areas where mosquitoes could live and breed [have] been treated."
"We're confident that these measures have killed any other mosquitoes
that might have been (harboring) in the cargo hatches, but the
Regional Public Health Service are maintaining close surveillance
around the area and are conducting further searches for mosquitoes."
Mr. Gardner said Health protection staff have placed a number of
larval and adult mosquito traps in the vicinity, and the Ports of
Auckland are assisting with the operation. "The fact that MQS staff
detected the adult mosquito and the larvae within a short time has
been a major bonus for us. This meant that a rapid response followed
and improved the chances of achieving an eradication of this
potential hazard. Biosecurity strategy relies greatly on everybody's
participation in keeping our borders secure, in this event, the MQS
staff, the Port Company and the Public Health Services have worked
closely together," said Mr. Gardner. "It is essential that the site
is closely monitored for the next few weeks, and it is requested that
anyone working in the vicinity of Jellicoe Wharf who notices any
mosquito activity, such as insect biting or 'wrigglers in pooled
water' assist by reporting this to the Public Health Services. The
phone number to ring the Public Health Service is 09 2621855. Of the
2, the Asian Tiger Mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] would be the
greatest challenge to eradicate if it were to become established in
New Zealand. This species had demonstrated an ability to live in new
areas, adapting well to temperate climates and feeding on humans,
domestic and wild mammals and birds. The Yellow Fever Mosquito
[_Aedes aegypti_], on the other hand, feeds only on humans, is
climate sensitive, and has a limited flight range.
Health protection staff will monitor the traps in the area for a
further 3 weeks to ensure that the mosquitoes have not escaped into
the local environment. Mr. Gardner said the fact that the exotic
mosquitoes have been detected at the border shows systems are working
efficiently, and it means it is less likely they will spread in New
Zealand. Exotic mosquitoes of public health significance have been
intercepted on 40 occasions since January 1998.

[Although Reinert et al. (2004, Zoological Journal of the Linnean
Society, 142: 289-368) elevated many mosquito subgenera, including
_Stegomyia_, to generic rank, this created such controversy that many
mosquito authorities are not accepting this reclassification, partly
because of all the confusion it will create, especially among
scientists outside of the field. Consequently, in a ProMED post from
2 May 2005, I proposed that ProMED should favor using the older
generic names, thus retaining the familiar names _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Ae. albopictus_ (Archive number 20050503.1226).
In recent years, there have been several reports of exotic mosquitoes
being discovered at sea ports in New Zealand, so the discovery once
again of _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ comes as no surprise. But
there is no mention as to where the ship that had arrived in Auckland
a few days prior to the finding of these 2 _Aedes_ mosquitoes came
from. I agree that _Ae. albopictus_ would be the more difficult
mosquito to eradicate if it spread, and it would also pose a more
serious health hazard than _Ae. aegypti_. However, at present, New
Zealand has no mosquito-borne infections.
The Port Health Authorities in New Zealand have a good track record
of detecting and eradicating exotic mosquitoes at ports of entry. As
a medical entomologist, I would be interested to learn what kind of
traps are being used to detect the presence of these 2 mosquito
species. - Mod.MS]
