Source: ArabicNews; excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
14 people of different nationalities were reported to be infected by the
killer _E. coli_ germ in Kuwait, Al-Gomhoria daily said today.
Intestinal bleeding and bloody diarrhea are main symptoms of the disease.
The Kuwaiti Ministry of Health was said to be searching for 14 persons
carrying the _E. coli_ germ, as physicians had treated the 14 cases
ordinarily and claimed the _E. coli_ issue had not been raised in Kuwait at
the time when they diagnosed the cases, the paper added. Kuwaiti clinics
and hospital [records] are being thoroughly examined for any similar cases.
[That's all the information. Obviously an EHEC strain, but no info as to
whether it's O157:H7 or some other serotype. -- RAL]
