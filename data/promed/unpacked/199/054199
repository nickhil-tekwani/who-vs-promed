sources of information due to different times of "closure" of daily
figures reported. Times of daily report closures where known are
listed in the table of contents below. Newswires may mention a
confirmed case in a location that has not been on the official
reporting entity list as the confirmation arrived after closure of

[3] China - epidemiology of 1st 120 cases on mainland
Date: Sat 13 Jun 2009
From: Chen Jiming <jmchen66@yahoo.cn>


The epidemiology of the 1st 120 human A (H1N1) cases reported in China mainland
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [26 May 2009], we reported the epidemiology of the 1st 12 human A
(H1N1) cases identified in China mainland. Now, we report the
epidemiology of the 1st 120 human A (H1N1) cases identified in China
mainland as of [12 Jun 2009] using the data mined from online news.

1. Among the 120 cases, 104 were imported, 14 were domestic with
known infection source, and 2 were domestic with unknown source.
2. China mainland identified the 1st A (H1N1) case on [10 May 2009],
the 1st domestic case on [29 May 2009], and the 1st domestic case
with unknown source on [12 Jun 2009]. The emergence of the cases of
unknown source indicates that the risk of the disease spreading among
communities in China mainland is rising.
3. Transmissions of the disease from only 5 of the imported 104 cases
to others (that is, the 14 domestic cases with known infection
source) were identified through clinical observation. That is to say,
the reproduction rate is rather low (less than 0.2) as compared with
the data from North America. This should be one of the results of the
strict control measures implemented in China mainland so far. It is
interesting that one imported case with little self-restriction in
movement transmitted the disease to other 9 persons including members
of her family and a sightseeing tour from multiple provinces.
4. Among the 104 imported cases, 92 were from North America (69 from
USA and 23 from Canada), and 5 were from Australia. Others were from
Yemen, Venezuela, the Philippines, Argentina, and Japan. This
indicates that domestic cases might also have existed in Yemen,
Venezuela, the Philippines, and Argentina.
5. Among the 120 cases, 118 were reported male (60) or female (58),
that is, no gender difference was demonstrated.
6. Among the 120 cases, ages of 115 were reported. Most of them were
very young (83 are less than 31 years old, and 54 are less than 21
years old).
7. The 120 cases were reported by 15 provinces or municipalities, and
100 were from 5 provinces or municipalities (Beijing 33, Guangdong
30, Fujian 14, Shanghai 13, Sichuan 10).
8. All of the 120 cases developed some flu-like symptoms, but none of
them showed severe clinical signs, and till date, 62 have recovered.
At least 4 human infections with the virus without any clinical signs
were found and they were not included in the 120 cases.
9. 15 of the 120 cases were found through airport temperature
detection and 2 were found through train quarantine; the others were
identified through other ways.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs Ying-Xue Sun and Ji-Ming Chen
for sharing the report/information above. Of note is that one of the
importations listed is from Yemen where to date there have not been
official reports of influenza A (H1N1) infections to WHO. One wonders
whether there might have been infection transmitted during airline
travel vs as yet undocumented influenza A (H1N1) activity in Yemen.
Given the ever increasing numbers of cases and countries reporting
cases, either scenario is equally likely in this case.

It is also curious that in the one case where there was unrestricted
travel of an infected person, there were an additional 9 cases
identified, in contrast with the observed reproductive rate of less
than 0.2 in the other instances. - Mod.MPP]

[As of 15:00 GMT+2 (15 Jun 2009) there have been a total of 35 928
cases with 163 deaths attributable to influenza A (H1N1) infection
confirmed to WHO from 76 countries. In addition, according to
newswires new countries reporting cases since the release of the
daily WHO summary include Suriname and Jordan.

Reviewing the pattern in reported cases by countries as seen in the
WHO and PAHO official statistics, one can't help but suspect there is
significantly more influenza A (H1N1) activity in countries than are
being reflected by these reports. So far, the overwhelming majority
of cases have been described as mild and self limited, suggesting
that many cases might not come to the attention of the health sector,
so that contact tracing and importation "tracking" seems to play a
major role in case identification in many countries.

Note that in the 'news briefs' section, there is a space for reports
from Africa, yet there aren't reports other than the officially
confirmed cases reported from Morocco and Egypt. There are newswires
mentioning preparedness activities, but no cases have been officially
confirmed as yet. - Mod.MPP]
