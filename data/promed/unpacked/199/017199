[Now that West Nile virus cases are being reported in the northern tier of
states in the central USA, it will be surprising if cases do not begin to
appear in the Canadian provinces to the north of those states. - Mod.TY]

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,

** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC
site for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have been
reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments. ArboNet is the
national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquitoborne viruses.
Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when such cases
are reported to CDC.

DC mosquitoes test positive for West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------------
A mosquito pool in northeast Washington has tested positive for West Nile
virus, prompting the city's health director today [1 Aug 2006] to remind
residents that they should take precautions against contracting the
mosquitoborne illness.
Dr Gregg A Pane, director of the DC Department of Health, said the positive
test result, obtained on 27 Jul 2006 from 13 mosquitoes collected about a
week earlier in the 4300 block of Polk Street NE, comes "at the height of
West Nile virus season".
In response, health officials treated catch basins within the surrounding
8-block radius with larvicide and distributed literature about West Nile
virus and controlling the mosquito population, Pane said. So far this year
[2006], the health department has treated 4723 catch basins throughout the
District with larvicide and tested 2464 individual mosquitoes in 401
mosquito pools. Mosquito traps also have been set in all of the city's 8 wards.
