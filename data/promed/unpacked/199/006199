Outbreaks of Botulism: Northwest Territories and Quebec
The Botulism Reference Service (BRS) in Ottawa has confirmed that there
were 3 unrelated incidents including 2 outbreaks of botulism last month.
In the outbreak in the Northwest Territories, which was caused by
_Clostridium botulinum_ type E, 6 people consumed the food item, 4 were
affected, with one death. An incident in the Northwest Territories was in
a person who had consumed muktuk (a food consisting
of fermented chunks of blubber, skin, and meat from a white whale). Both
the muktuk and the patient's serum tested positive for botulinum
neurotoxin. The BRS is culturing the muktuk and gastric fluid for viable
_C. botulinum_. The patient has recovered. The second outbreak, without
fatalities, occurred in northern Quebec. A family became ill after
consuming seal meat. Antitoxin was administered. The BRS has confirmed
the presence of botulinum neurotoxin in serum from the most affected
patient. While gastric fluid and seal meat were both negative for
neurotoxin, the gastric liquid contained viable type E _C. botulinum_.
