4 more children have been diagnosed with salmonellosis since yesterday [Fri 16 Mar 2012], as the city's public health department continues to investigate an outbreak of food poisoning that appears to have spread through a caterer serving hot lunches at schools and daycares. There have now been 27 lab-confirmed cases of the foodborne bacteria since Public Health declared an outbreak early this week, including 23 children and 4 adults. (2 of the adults are included in the tally even though their cases are believed to be unrelated.) Friday afternoon, 16 Mar 2012, the health department also added 2 schools to the list of those where children have become sick: Bayvew Public School and Ecole elementaire Des Sentiers.

Investigators are still analyzing food from a kitchen run by a franchise of The Lunch Lady, trying to confirm suspicions that its meat lasagna and beef tacos were contaminated. All 6 schools and a daycare where children are known to have become sick are served by one franchise of The Lunch Lady, which delivers meals to kids whose parents pay for the service.

The results of the lab analysis are expected to take a few more days, perhaps even until next Wednesday [21 Mar 2012], said Public Health spokesman John Steinbachs. In the meantime, 2 Lunch Lady kitchens, on Boyd Avenue where investigators have been concentrating their efforts, and another in Kanata, are closed, said their owner. "We don't know what the source of the contamination is, and until we do, we're not going to be making or serving food," he said. Parents whose children get meals from those kitchens will have to make other arrangements for at least next week, the owner said.

Even if the contamination can be traced to ingredients in the Boyd Avenue kitchen, Public Health will need to figure out how the salmonella got into the food. [The owner] said investigators have been interviewing his staff; the kitchen got a clean inspection after the health department knew about the outbreak, and another one just in February 2012.
