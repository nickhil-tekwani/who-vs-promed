Federal drug regulators said Wednesday [5 Mar 2008] that a critical
blood thinner that had been linked to at least 19 deaths and whose
raw components were produced in China contained a possibly
counterfeit ingredient that mimicked the real drug.

Routine tests failed to distinguish the contaminant from the drug,
heparin. Only sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging tests
uncovered that as much as 20 percent of the product's active
ingredient was a heparin mimic blended in with the real thing.
Federal officials said they did not know what the contaminant was.

"At this point, we do not know whether the introduction was
accidental or whether it was deliberate," said the Food and Drug
Administration's deputy commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock.

Heparin is made from pig intestines. Scientific Protein Laboratories,
based in Waunakee, WI, bought raw heparin produced in some cases in
small, unregulated family workshops in China and processed it in
plants in Wisconsin and China, according to heparin traders and
producers in China. Baxter International purchased the active
ingredient from Scientific Protein and sold the finished drug.

Wayne Pines, a spokesman for Scientific Protein Laboratories, said
that nothing sinister about the contamination had been proved. "There
is no evidence of counterfeiting or tampering or anything of that
nature," Mr. Pines said. "No one really knows what happened here."

The FDA has now received 785 reports of serious injuries associated
with the drug's use. 46 deaths have also been reported to the agency,
but Dr. Woodcock said that just 19 of these appeared related to the
suspect heparin. Baxter executives said that the total death toll was
actually 4.

APP Pharmaceuticals, which previously split the heparin market with
Baxter, has been ramping up production to meet demand. So far, APP's
products show no signs of similar contamination, Dr. Woodcock said,
although some of APP's production is also based in China.

Most of the world's heparin supply originates in China, according to
Baxter. The FDA will soon make public the test used to distinguish
between real heparin and its mimic in hopes that regulatory bodies
around the world will adopt the test. "We don't know if any of the
heparin products worldwide might contain this contaminant, and that
is something we are going to be looking into," Dr. Woodcock said.

The FDA has yet to prove that the heparin contaminant is the cause of
the deaths and illnesses now associated with the use of Baxter's
product. But heparin batches associated with illnesses, all of which
were produced with ingredients made in China, were found to contain
the contaminant while batches not linked to illnesses proved to be
untainted. In a written statement, Scientific Protein said that "it
is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical
ingredient sourced from China and provided by SPL to Baxter is
responsible for these adverse events."

Since tainted batches were produced by Scientific Protein's plants in
both Wisconsin and China, "either both plants have problems with
processing or there's something wrong further up the stream," said
Peter Arduini, president of Baxter's medication delivery business.

[The identification of this contaminant may be useful in assessing
where and why the contamination has occurred as well as whether it
was deliberate. A subsequent posting reports cases in Europe
(Germany) as well. - Mod.LL]
