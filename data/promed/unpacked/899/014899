First report of eggplant mottled dwarf virus in cucumber and pepper in Bulgaria
D Kostova (<dkostova2000@yahoo.com>), Maritza Institute for Vegetable
Crops, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; V Masenga (Istituto Fitovirologia Applicata CNR,
Torino, Italy); RG Milne (Istituto Fitovirologia Applicata CNR, Torino,
Italy); V Lisa (Istituto Fitovirologia Applicata CNR, Torino, Italy).
Accepted for publication 11/06/2001.
Unusual virus-like symptoms were observed in ... cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_) under plastic and pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) in the open, near
Plovdiv, southern Bulgaria, in summer 2000. Cucumber plants showed
shortened internodes, severe dwarfing, epinasty, wrinkled epidermis, and
reduced leaf size. The disease appeared on about 30% of plants, at
flowering, in 2 localities, on cvs T-19 (pickling type) and Gergana (salad
type). On pepper, severe vein clearing and small yellow spots or yellow
mosaic were seen sporadically on young leaves at both localities.
Leaf samples were desiccated over calcium chloride, brought to Torino, and
sap-inoculated to test plants. 3 ... isolates ... designated P6 (cucumber)
and P15 and P27 (pepper) ... proved to be similar except that P27
[expressed] ... more severe reactions and higher virus titers. _Nicotiana
benthamiana_, _N. clevelandii_, _N. glutinosa_, and _N. megalosiphon_
developed] ... yellow local lesions followed by vein clearing, mottling,
mosaic, and stunting. _Chenopodium quinoa_, _Datura stramonium_, _Petunia
hybrida_, and _Ociymum basilicum_ gave local lesions only. The symptoms
resembled those reported for eggplant mottled dwarf virus (EMDV; a
rhabdovirus). [Severe symptoms were expressed by pepper isolates in pepper]
cv Quadrato d'Asti ... and cucumber cv Marketer reacted severely to the
cucumber isolate, but pepper was not infected by the cucumber isolate and
vice versa.
Electron microscopy of negatively stained crude extracts revealed large
numbers of rhabdovirus-like particles and free nucleocapsids but no other
virus-like particles. [Western blots, using EMDV antiserum As 0136 and
homologous virus (provided by Dr S Winter, DSMZ, Braunschweig) showed that
the homologous antigens and those of the 3 isolates reacted similarly.]
EMDV has been reported in pepper and cucumber in Italy (Roggero et al,
1995) and is known to infect ... cucumber and tobacco in Greece (Katis et
al, 2000) and eggplant in Turkey (Erkan, 1988).

[EMDV was first reported in eggplant (_Solanum melongena_) in southern
Italy in 1969. In addition to cucumber and pepper, the natural host range
of the virus includes tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), black nightshade
(_Solanum nigrum_), and _S. sodomaeum_ that, in Morocco, may be a perennial
source of infection. The virus is transmitted by contact inoculation and
grafting but not by seed. It spreads in Algeria, Italy, Morocco, Tunisia,
Turkey, and the Canary Islands.
In 1998 about 5 per cent of muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_ var. _reticulatus_)
crops in the Tuscany region of Italy were infected with EDMV, showing
stunting, short internodes, fruit deformation, and vein yellowing.
Identification of the virus was by Western blots. No differences between
the type isolate and the melon isolate were observed.
The vector of ECMV is unknown but because percentage of infection is
generally low, a polyphagous insect with low vector specificity may be
involved in transmission.
