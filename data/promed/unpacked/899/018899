Uganda health officials reported today [28 Nov 2022] an additional ebolavirus disease (EVD) case and death, the 1st in 11 days. According to a tweet earlier today, the Ministry of Health reports:

"The positive Ebola case today, 28 Nov 2022, is a 28-week male stillborn to an Ebola survivor mother. The mother is a 23-year-old resident of Kikandwa, Kasanda district who had stillbirth. She was attended to during delivery by an appropriately donned midwife and is in good condition."

Routine contact tracing and additional case investigation are ongoing. This brings the total confirmed cases to 142, including 56 cumulative deaths.

[The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) has not generally reported individual cases of EVD, but this Twitter announcement may be noteworthy because the latest case occurred 11 days since the prior EVD case. I believe that this may be the longest interval between confirmed cases since the beginning of the current Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda, and it is hoped that this may point to the end of the outbreak. However, contact tracing and additional case investigation are ongoing.

For a timetable of confirmed cases, see Figure 1 in the latest WHO/Uganda MOH Situation Report at https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON425. Please see the MOH tweet for a graphic summary of cases and contact tracing at https://twitter.com/MinofHealthUG/status/1597229047855349760. - Mod.LXL
