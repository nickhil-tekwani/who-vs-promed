A strain of bird flu has been detected in 4 swans found in the Seekonk River.

The cases were discovered as part of routine surveillance by the
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM).

DEM says the strain of avian flu detected in Rhode Island is not the
same strain that has infected people in Asia and Europe since 2003,
so it does not pose a significant health risk to humans.

However, the agency says the virus can be transmitted to wild birds
and domestic poultry flocks. It is urging all poultry owners to
employ standard biosecurity and sanitation practices. In particular,
they should prevent flocks from having any contact with wild birds.

All poultry owners should have their flocks tested. To schedule an
appointment, call the DEM's Division of Agriculture/Animal Health
Unit at 401-222-2781. There is no charge for the testing.

could only report it as an H7, but later in the afternoon, more was
known. Please see the next posting. - Mod.TG]

A bird flu virus strain has been found in 4 mute swans collected from
the Seekonk River -- near the Swan Point Cemetery -- as part of
routine state Department of Environmental Management (DEM) surveillance.

While the DEM says the strain is not harmful to humans, it is
suggesting that all poultry owners should have their flocks tested.

Tests by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) detected that the
swans, part of a sample of 11 birds, were infected with the H7N3
strain of avian influenza virus.

But the DEM emphasized in a news release today [21 Aug 2008] that it
was not the same strain that has infected people in Asia and Europe
since 2003, known as H5N1, and there is no known significant health
risk to people who are exposed to this strain of the virus.

There are no associated food safety concerns either, the DEM said.
Chicken and other poultry products are safe to eat.

However, the virus can be transmitted to other birds and poses a
significant risk to other wild birds and domestic poultry flocks. So
DEM's Division of Agriculture will increase surveillance of domestic
poultry flocks within a 6.2-mile radius of where the infected swans were found.

The Massachusetts Department of Agriculture will do the same in the
Bay State. Rhode Island DEM's Division of Fish and Wildlife will also
increase surveillance of wild waterfowl (swans, ducks, geese, and others).

Every year, State Veterinarian Scott Marshall at the state's
Department of Environmental Management said today [21 Aug 2008], a
single duck or bird tests positive for this flu. But this year
[2008], several birds tested positive for the virus. "That's what we
find a little more alarming," he said.

As a precaution, the DEM said that all poultry owners to protect
their flocks should carry out standard biosecurity and sanitation
practices. Poultry owners should prevent their flocks from contact
with wild birds.

Relative to other states, however, Rhode Island has a very small
number of large-scale poultry operations, according to Marshall.

The state has one large producer of game birds; 3 "layer houses," to
produce eggs; one large broiler producer, chickens that are sold to
be eaten; one turkey operation; and a few, smaller backyard
operations, according to Marshall. The largest number of domesticated
birds is about 35 000, in Foster, he said.

That's on the opposite side of the state from where the flu cases were found.

"If this is going to happen," he said of the bird infection, "it's in
a relatively safe place."

[This is in all likelihood a low pathogenic form. These articles do
not tell us whether this was surveillance antibodies [likely] vs.
active disease. Although there are more birds than have been found in
the past, it is interesting but not alarming. Again, it should be
stressed that there is no danger to humans with this surveillance
effort. - Mod.TG]
