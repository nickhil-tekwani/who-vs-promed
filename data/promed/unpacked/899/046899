According to our newspapers here [New Zealand it was a cruise ship group that
stopped in PNG [Papua New Guinea and made a trip inland, some of the
participants
contracting -- I thought it said -- typhoid. It was transmitted to some of
those who did not take the trip.
This is just a report from our Evening Post newspaper.
