State Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello, M.D., M.P.H., Dr.P.H., today
issued an update concerning the gastrointestinal illnesses suspected to be
linked to a spray park attraction at Seneca Lake State Park. The
Commissioner also announced the spray park attraction has been closed for
the remainder of the 2005 season.
The number of reported illnesses possibly linked to the park has grown to
746 in 8 counties, prompting the Commissioner to again stress precautionary
measures people should take to keep the illness from spreading further. The
746 cases have been reported by the following counties: Ontario (309
cases), Seneca (130 cases), Wayne (97 cases), Monroe (75 cases), Cayuga (56
cases), Livingston (50 cases), Onondaga (24 cases), and Tompkins (5 cases).
The most common symptoms reported are diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea,
vomiting, fever, headache and loss of appetite. To date, 5 of the cases
have been confirmed as cryptosporidiosis: one in Wayne County, one in
Ontario County and 3 in Cayuga County. Additional tests for other possible
causes of illness are pending. Of the 746 cases reported, many people have
since recovered, and those who are ill are instructed to see their physician.
The reported dates of illness range from early July to the present. The
State Health Department is working with local health departments and the
State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to investigate
the outbreak. The review is ongoing. Dr. Novello is recommending the
following precautions:
1. Persons who visited the Seneca Lake State Park or family members and/or
close contacts of ill individuals who visited the park since July and are
experiencing gastrointestinal illness should contact their medical provider
and their local health department (phone numbers below).
2. Health care workers with patient contact and food workers should notify
their employer if they are experiencing gastrointestinal illness symptoms
before returning to work.
3. Children and staff with stomach/intestinal illness should refrain from
attending day care. Day care centers should consult with their local health
department for recommendations on the timing for return to the day care
setting. Children should not be transferred to another day care center.
Dr. Novello also recommends that people take action to minimize the chances
of acquiring and spreading illness, including thoroughly washing hands
after using the toilet, changing diapers, or coming in contact with fecal
material in any way. Also, swimmers should avoid swallowing water,
especially in lakes, ponds, or rivers. To help prevent the spread of
illness, individuals who are experiencing gastrointestinal illness should
not swim while they are sick and for 2 weeks after their symptoms subside.
Individuals or family members who visited the State Park and are
experiencing gastrointestinal illness should contact their health care
provider.

A play area filled with water jets and sprinklers at a state park in
central New York has been identified as the source of a severe intestinal
illness that has stricken nearly 750 people in 3 weeks, the State Health
Department said yesterday.
Nearly all of the confirmed cases of the disease, a highly contagious
waterborne infection called cryptosporidiosis, have so far been traced to
the attraction, known as the Sprayground, at Seneca Lake State Park in
Geneva, N.Y., a Health Department spokesman, Jeffrey W. Hammond, said.
Although none of the people who were infected are known to be critically
ill, the outbreak may be among the largest ever involving cryptosporidiosis
in New York State, which typically has fewer than 500 cases a year.
The Sprayground, which gets about 43 000 visitors every August, was closed
on Monday after health officials noted more than 100 cases of the disease
in 8 counties. Last night, health officials said tests on a water tank that
feeds the play area had tested positive for cryptosporidiosis. The tank,
which uses water supplied by the nearby town of Waterloo, is used solely
for the Sprayground and has a chlorination and a filtration system.
A spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and
Historic Preservation, Wendy Gibson, said she thought the tank was the only
source of contaminated water, and said that a beach in the park would
remain open.
Health officials said, however, that they had not determined the extent of
the contamination and that they planned to run tests on drinking fountains
and other areas of the park. "Our investigation is ongoing, but so far we
know that that there was crypto in that tank," Mr. Hammond said.
The disease, which emerged in the United States in the 1970's, is known to
be one of the most frequent causes of traveler's diarrhea. Experts say it
is contracted primarily through contaminated food and tainted water
supplies and spreads very easily. Once it is picked up, the parasite lodges
itself in the victim's intestines for days or weeks, producing eggs and
causing severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.
Outbreaks of the disease are fairly common. One of the worst, in Milwaukee
in 1993, sickened 400 000 people and killed a half-dozen. But generally the
disease is not deadly and lasts only about a week in most people, then goes
away on its own.
Last night, health officials advised those who had recently visited the
Sprayground and then experienced stomach problems to see a doctor. They
stressed that people who suspect they have contracted the disease should
wash their hands frequently and stay away from others; many cases reported
so far have occurred in groups, often among people in the same household.
The first cases in the 8 counties near Seneca Lake emerged in early July,
officials said. After an investigation, they found that most of the victims
were children who had played in the Sprayground and complained of nausea
and diarrhea a short time later. "We closed the Sprayground down
immediately, and it's now going to be closed for the season," Ms. Gibson said.
The largest number of cases, 309 as of last night, was in Ontario County,
and the bulk of all the cases, 746 as of last night, were confirmed this
week after the public was alerted to the outbreak. In Tompkins County, 25
cases were reported Tuesday and Wednesday -- compared with 2-3 in an
average year.
Ms. Gibson said the extent of the outbreak might have to do with the
popularity of the Sprayground, which is about 11 000 square feet and often
used by parents as well as children.
"It's accessible for different ages," Ms. Gibson said. "The beauty of it is
that it is pretty accessible for people and doesn't involve a pool. It's a
whole series of sprinklers."

Number stricken by water park illness tops 1700
----------------------
The number of people who've reported getting sick after visiting an upstate
New York water playground has risen to more than 1700.
That's according to officials at the state Department of Health in Albany.
The agency says 1738 cases of illness have been reported in 20 counties.
Officials have traced the illness to the presence of cryptosporidium in 2
storage tanks that supply water to the popular "sprayground" at a park just
outside Geneva.
Known as crypto, the illness causes diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting and
headache.
So far, health officials have confirmed 13 cases among those who have
reported getting ill after visiting the park.
The state has shut down the sprayground for the rest of the season.

[Such parks distribute water as an aerosol, which apparently is a very
effective way of disseminating cryptosporidia. We are not aware of previous
outbreaks caused by such water parks, and it is clearly an exposure which
should be included in investigations of future outbreaks. The reports
mention that the water tank used as reservoir was chlorinated, but
cryptosporidia are relatively resistant to chlorination, and the treatment
was clearly not effective. - Mod.EP]
