An outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been discovered in cattle in Al-Ahsa, which is an area with many cows. All necessary measures have been taken to protect the livestock, said Mahmoud Al-Shuaibi of the Agriculture Department in Al-Ahsa.

"Al-Ahsa Agriculture Department, with the cooperation of the municipality and police forces, has prepared field teams under the supervision of Nabil Al-Muslim, livestock chairman, to control the spread of LSD," said Al-Shuaibi.

"The teams include detection and immunization, disposal, [vector] control, along with awareness and education represented by veterinary guidance. About 33 890 cattle have been examined and 30 384 immunized. The number of destroyed animals is 2432," he said.

Al-Shuaibi said that the Ministry of Agriculture had banned the sale of cattle in the markets. He confirmed that compensation had been paid to all owners of the destroyed cows by a committee designed for this purpose with members from several government agencies.

LSD poses no threat to humans. It can cause fever and nodules of varying size on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs, along with chronic weakness and skin lesions.

Biting insects spread the disease and vaccines are available, but there is no specific treatment for infected animals. The disease is currently endemic in most African countries where it was first identified in Zambia in 1929 and then spread north.

[Al-Ahsa, in Saudi-Arabia's Eastern Province, is regarded the largest oasis in the world. It is thus not surprising that this area harbours a significant part of the cattle population of the rather arid Kingdom.

Saudi Arabia reported the 1st outbreak of LSD to the OIE on 30 Apr 2015, and declared it resolved on the same date, following the application of partial stamping out. The outbreak reportedly started on the Tarout Island and Al-Hafouf on 5 Feb 2015 and was confirmed on 8 Apr 2015. The number of susceptible animals was 512, among which 196 cases, no mortality, 375 destroyed (the clinically affected animals and some "susceptible" animals; the criteria applied for their selection was not detailed).

Following the confirmation of the disease, vaccination in the region was applied. Reportedly, 27 504 cattle were vaccinated. The OIE report and map can be seen at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17605.

The current report on an outbreak on the mainland is indicative of the spread of the virus, which -- as explained in the media report -- is borne by biting insects. In view of the number of apparently confirmed cases and of the vaccinated animals, this outbreak has been going on for some time; its notification to the OIE is anticipated soon.

LSD was reported in Saudi Arabia following its notification from Kuwait, submitted 4 Jan 2015, which reported Kuwait's 1st LSD outbreak since 1991. The Kuwaiti notification was similarly belated; it had reportedly started already in November 2014. LSD has been spreading throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia since 2012.

The countries already known to be infected are Azerbaijan, Cyprus (North), Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories, and Turkey. Syria is also known to be infected, though no direct information could be obtained. LSD is endemic in Egypt.

To the best of our knowledge and as indicated in chapter 2.4.14 (LSD) of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2014, 4 live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been, so far, used as vaccines to protect cattle against LSD:
1. LSD virus strain from South Africa (Neethling);
2. RM 65 sheep pox strain;
3. Romanian sheep pox strain;
4. Kenyan sheep and goat vaccine (KS-1 or 0240)

Additional information on these vaccines is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf.

Information on the vaccine strain applied in Saudi Arabia will be helpful. - Mods.AS
