----------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the cases reported here in swans, we have noted an
above average number of cases of DVE [duck viral enteritis] this
season [2011], occurring sporadically in both swans and ducks, within
a number of different bird collections and zoos to which we provide
diagnostic services. As is typically the case in these collections,
deaths are usually isolated events or affect only a very small number
of birds. Birds have had the classical gross and/or histological
lesions. Additional diagnostics were not pursued. Mass mortality
events due to DVE are not typical in these collections, some of which
have had occasional cases around this time of year in previous years.

[Dr Stidworthy is gratefully acknowledged for the complementary,
firsthand information.

Duck virus enteritis (DVE) is included in OIE's list of notifiable
animal diseases.

UK's annual reports to the OIE indicated DVE's absence in 2005; no
information on the disease was included in later annual reports.-
