Clarification on New Vaccines in China to Control Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
The following statement is meant to clarify some misunderstandings in
the media about development of new avian influenza vaccines in China.
Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) of China has certified a
recombinant H5N1 fowlpox vaccine and an inactivated H5N1 reverse
genetics vaccine after very careful evaluation of their safety and
efficacy.
Since the H5N1 inactivated vaccine has proved immunogenic for ducks
and geese, the MOA suggests that if necessary, the new vaccine could
be used on waterfowl in the high-risk area, which contains many water
bodies, namely lakes and rivers. The vaccine is a muscular-injection
formula -- thus, it could not be applied by its introduction into
"rivers and lakes" [as erroneously stated in the media].
The MOA statement was misinterpreted when it was translated into
English by the media; therefore, I offer this statement to clear up
any possible misunderstanding.

[ProMED-mail is most grateful to Prof Hualan Chen for this 1st-hand,
authoritative, and expedient clarification. The information provided
puts the published -- and rather inaccurate -- news items in the
right perspective.
Details on the recombinant H5N1 fowlpox vaccine have been published
by Chuan-Ling Qiao et al (National Key Laboratory of Veterinary
Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, P.R. China) in their
paper "Protection of chickens against highly lethal H5N1 and H7N1
avian influenza viruses with a recombinant fowlpox virus
co-expressing H5 haemagglutinin and N1 neuraminidase genes", Avian
Pathology (2003) 32, 25 - /31. Similar data pertaining to the new
inactivated H5N1 reverse genetics vaccine will be most welcome. -
