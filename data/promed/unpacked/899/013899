Earlier this week the moderator of Pro-MED made a comment about a recent
case of anthrax in cattle discovered in Scotland. The comment suggested that
the feeding of Meat and Bone Meal in the UK may have spread the disease in
the past.
Historically, anthrax was an unusual challenge to the rendering industry
because of the high incidence of the disease during the early 1900's. This
disease was the early initiator for policies which established animal health
controls within the livestock and rendering industries. In perspective,
animal agriculture and the rendering industry successfully responded to the
major challenge of anthrax.
TIME - TEMPERATURE CONTROLS: A REVIEW
Work done by T.J. Murray of Rutgers University and published in 1931 in the
Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 48, Edited by Hektoen, L., and
Jordan, E. O., on The Thermal Death Point; Spores of Bacillus Anthracis
established the original and early guidelines for the time-temperature
inactivation of spores of anthrax. This initial research was considered the
guide for the rendering industry since anthrax was both a problem for the
industry, and indeed a public health problem. Murray's findings indicated
that effective temperatures for the destruction of the spores in
physiological solution of sodium chloride were 105, 100, 95, and 90C. At
105C, the time varied from 5 to 10 minutes; the spores of most of the
strains being destroyed in 5 minutes at 100C; at 95C most of the strains
were destroyed in 10 to 25 minutes; and at 90C, most of the strains were
destroyed in 15 to 45 minutes. Dry spores heated in the absence of moisture
were inactivated in 25 minutes at 120C. Dried spores heated under moist
conditions showed no increase resistance, being inactivated at 100, 95, and
90C. These times and temperatures were adopted as the original guidelines
used by the rendering industry.
In 1949, work published by Calderon Howe in "The Oxford Medicine, Edited by
Henry A. Christian and referenced as Chapter X, substantiated the early work
done by Murray on Anthrax, "spores suspended in normal saline are killed at
100C in 5 to 10 minutes." Howe found that dry spores in the absence of
moisture required higher temperatures to be inactivated.
Wilson and Miles in 1961, published in Topley and Wilson's Principles of
Bacteriology and Immunity (Chapter 34) findings on the resistance of the
anthrax bacillus,... "Moist heat sterilizes a saline suspension containing 1
million spores per ml in 15 to 45 minutes at 90C, in 10 to 25 minutes at
100C."
During the Anthrax outbreak of 1952, Dr. Oliver H.M. Wilder of Fayetteville,
Arkansas, prepared a table based on a literature review of anthrax and
developed time-temperature relationships for killing anthrax spores under
moist heat throughout to a temperature of not less than:
221 F for at least 8 minutes OR
212 F for at least 10 minutes OR
203 F for at least 25 minutes OR
194 F for at least 45 minutes.
In Sykes, G. (Editor) Disinfection and Sterilization, 2nd ed., Lippincott,
Philadelphia, 1965, cited the destruction time in minutes of different
bacterial spores by moist heat, and demonstrated the variables for Bacillus
anthracis as follows: At 100C destruction time took a maximum of 15 minutes,
but had a broad variation between 2 and 15 minutes. At 105C, destruction
time was 5 to 10 minutes. With dry heat, one would expect the destruction
time to be considerably longer since the "Inactivation process" takes place
by oxidizing the chemical constituents of the organism. (Moist head kills
microorganisms by coagulating their proteins and is much more rapid and
effective).
COMMENT
Modern processing systems used by the U.S. and Canadian rendering industries
fully incorporate the above findings and thereby produce a safe and wholesome
product.
