Cuba's government declared Tue 28 Aug 2012, that health workers had eradicated a cholera outbreak that infected 417 people and killed 3, according to a statement from the country's Health Ministry.

In early July 2012, Cuba said the sometimes fatal water-borne illness had returned to the eastern part of the island. It was the 1st outbreak of the disease in Cuba in more than a century.

Doctors were not certain how cholera was reintroduced to the island, but said that heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into drinking wells were to blame for the disease's rapid rate of transmission. Cholera, a bacterial infection of the small intestine, causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in infected people.

"They started coming in a few at a time," said Julio Cesar Fonseca Rivero, director of the Celia Sanchez Manduley Hospital, the largest in Granma Province. That province was the hardest hit by the outbreak. "The 1st day 5 came, and then 8. The most critical days were when there were 30 to 32 patients who arrived in a single day."

The disease, according to the WHO, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100 000 and 120 000.

Cuban health officials said they responded to the outbreak by bringing in clean drinking water, closing down food stands in affected areas and setting up checkpoints on roads to keep people ill with the disease from traveling.

According to the Health Ministry statement released Tue 28 Aug 2012, 10 days have passed since the last reported case of cholera

[The number of cases reported here (417) is substantially higher than the 158 reported 2 weeks ago. The passage of Hurricane Issac over the island of Cuba recently may well stir up the number of cases again. - Mod.LL
