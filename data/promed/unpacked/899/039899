Summary
-------
Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is involved in epidemics of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and has been reported to occur with severe neurological complications in eastern and south-east Asia. In other geographical areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly understood.

We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding the viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographical spread patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 in Europe relative to other parts of the world. For the study, European countries considered were European Union (EU) Member States and Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.

Viruses of the B4, B5, and C4 subgenogroups circulate mainly in eastern and south-east Asia. In Europe sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed, however C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies showed evidence of multiple events of spread involving C1 and C2 viruses within Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch outbreak caused by C2 and the occurrence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 arose while the circulation of C1 viruses was low. A transmission chain involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then further to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events whereby spread of viruses have occurred from, to, and within Europe appear to be involved in the long term survival of EV-71, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance of this virus.

Discussion
----------
The recent reporting of sporadic circulation of EV-71 strains of the 'Asian subgenogroups' B5 and C4 in European countries makes it important to determine the evolutionary origins and spatiotemporal spread of EV-71 infections in geographical areas other than eastern and south-east Asia. There is a large body of literature on the molecular epidemiology of EV-71 but, to our knowledge, the spread of this virus has not yet been analysed explicitly with recently developed phylogeographical models. In this report, we therefore applied demographic and phylogeographical analyses to compare the population structure and the dissemination patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups in Europe and Asia. We found that the EV-71 subgenogroups exhibit distinct phylodynamic patterns and that these patterns differed from those of past epidemics in frequency and geographical location. The transmission history of subgenogroup C2 was characterised by fewer increases in genetic diversity than in subgenogroups C1 and C4. For instance, the genetic diversity pattern of subgenogroup C2 shows clearly the two outbreaks (Taiwan, 1998 and the Netherlands, 2007) documented in the literature. The variations in genetic diversity over the study period also reflect gaps in virus sampling over time and surveillance differences between countries. In Europe, EV-71 sequences are determined solely in patients admitted to hospitals and in a few countries only, whereas in a number of Asian countries real-time epidemiological data are obtained from sentinel surveillance of HFMD cases. In this study, we used only full-length EV-71 1DVP1 sequences because phylogenetic trees based on short-length sequences did not provide a high level of statistical confidence. Partial nt sequences were notably determined for virus genotyping and ranged over different parts of the 1DVP1 gene. Accordingly, we had to discard a certain amount of sequence data, some from Europe, which might have been helpful in phylogenetic analysis of virus spread.

We show how transmission of EV-71 strains (subgenogroups C1, C2, and C4) occurs in Europe as discrete and temporally defined virus introductions, occasionally followed by limited local spread. The only exception to this pattern was the epidemic expansion in the Netherlands in 2007. Interestingly, we found limited phylogenetic evidence that the Dutch outbreak was the source of a large spread to other European countries. The phylogenetic patterns also show that European countries may experience multiple virus introduction events within the same year. This dissemination mode was observed within particular countries (such as France, Germany) for both subgenogroups C1 and C2 but was more clearly seen during three waves of infections in 2007, 2010, and 2013 (subgenogroup C2). The epidemiological and biological factors involved are unknown but the occurrence of these infection waves is consistent with the hypothesis that the sustained circulation of an EV-71 strain throughout Europe depends on the proportion of susceptible hosts in different countries. The data may alternatively indicate that the immunity elicited by the C1 and C2 infections is cross-protective, as suggested by earlier studies that identified common epitopes and suggested that human immune sera among virus strains of different EV-71 subgenogroups have cross-neutralization properties. In this respect, we also provide phylogenetic evidence that the spread of the C2 virus across European countries in 2007 happened at a time when C1 infections had been transmitted at low rates for at least 3 years.

It is particularly noteworthy that the transmission of EV-71 strains C1 and C2 in Europe is mainly dependent on the frequency of virus spread events between neighbouring countries. This has been previously described for EV-71 and for another EV, coxsackievirus B5. The present study also indicates that the long-term survival of EV-71 (C1 and C2) depends on continued virus transmission between individuals across larger geographical areas, notably Russia and Asia. We also reconstructed a consistent transmission chain caused by a C4 virus strain throughout Europe (Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, and Hungary), which suggests that the virus persisted between 2003 and 2005. The chain was brought about by a virus from Japan which eventually reached Canada between 2005 and 2006. Transmission of the C1 and C2 infections was low during the whole period in Europe. Similarly, the recent C4 infections in France (2012), and Russia (2013) arose during a transmission trough of both C1 and C2 infections. Thus, transcontinental transmission events between individuals should be considered in the global epidemiology of the virus: they provide the epidemiological bases for explaining the long-term survival of lineages despite abrupt extinctions that drastically reduce virus diversity after the occurrence of outbreaks in particular locations.

Earlier hypotheses proposed that yearly epidemics of EV-71 in Japan arose from spread of the virus from neighbouring countries. We suggest that virus strains are sustained by complex migration dynamics involving Europe and Russia, and possibly other geographical regions. This argument is lent weight by a recent study reporting the occurrence of EV-71 C4 in Denmark in 2012 and 2013. Our Bayesian analysis of the partial 1DVP1 sequences showed that the C4 viruses isolated in Denmark were distributed in two distinct phylogenetic clusters, which suggests independent virus sources (data not shown).

Conclusion
----------
Thus, the frequency of epidemics in Asian countries, the involvement of EV-71 in neurological conditions, the recent isolation of C4 variant strains in Europe, and the spread patterns of the virus between distant and neighbouring countries underline a need for enhanced surveillance of EV-71 infections in Europe using common enterovirus genotyping methods.
