Six Die Of Tick-borne Encephalitis In Primorye Region
-----------------------------------------------------
VLADIVOSTOK: As of 13 Jul 2001, 6 people, including one child, have died of
tick-borne encephalitis this summer in the Primorye Region of the Far East
of Russia
A spokesman for the Regional Medical Prevention Centre, told Itar-Tass on
Fri 13 Jul 2001 that 92 people, including 18 children, had been admitted to
hospitals on suspicion of having contracted this dangerous disease.
About 4000 people have sought medical care following tick bites over the
past 3 months. A virus causing brain membrane inflammation [tick-borne
encephalitis virus? was identified in 150 of them.
The tick danger in the Region's taiga arises in early spring and lingers
until November. Last year 8 people died of encephalitis in the Primorye
Region.

[This adds to the reports of illness in the human population associated with
increased abundance of ticks in rural areas of Northern Europe and Russia.
The increase in the tick population has been attributed to climate change by
Swedish workers. - Mod.CP
