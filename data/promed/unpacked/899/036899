Yellow fever strikes Amerindians in Acre
-------------------------------------
Cases of the disease have been identified in Aldeia [Amerindian village]
Nova Olinda on the upper Envira River, on the frontier of Acre state with
Peru. No deaths have been reported so far. The predominant tribe in the
region is the Kampa, whose village is 5 days upriver from the town of Feijo
in Acre.
A team from the Amerindian Health Service will vaccinate the
whole Amerindian population against YF next week [week beginning 20 Jan
2003], not only in Nova Olinda Village but also in the villages of
Simpatia, Cupuacu, Igarape do Anjo, Baixo Amazonas, Marunaua, Jaminawa,
California, Formoso, Grota & 7 Voltas.

[Given the remoteness of the affected region, there do not seem to be any
implications for international travel. However, prospective travelers to
any part of the Amazon region, as well as other localities currently
reporting YF activity -- see refs. below -- are strongly advised to get
vaccinated. - Mod.JW]
