Washington state has initiated a recall of live oysters harvested from the Samish Bay growing area in the Puget Sound area. The recall is in response to multiple cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ illnesses associated with oysters harvested in the area. The outbreak has already surpassed the highest number of cases ever recorded by the state for the month of July, according to the state's Health Department. Distribution details are incomplete but it is known that some of the oysters have gone to Asian and Canadian buyers as well as customers in the USA.

A recent heat wave, coupled with very low tides at mid-day, is likely to blame for the increased rate of illness, which is associated with eating raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters that are contaminated with _Vibrio_. The extremely low tides are part of an 18.6-year tide cycle, which means there will be more to come for a period of time during the cycle.

As of 16 Jul 2021, there were 52 lab-confirmed cases, of which 46 were foodborne _V. parahaemolyticus_ cases. That's compared to 5 in 2020 and a high of 25 in 2018. These last 2 counts included another type of vibrio but were mainly _V. parahaemolyticus_. The department says it's likely that not all of the cases have been reported and that it's investigating some pending cases that are beginning to come in from other states. Because this outbreak included the 4th of July holiday, tourists to Washington may have been affected and because it is still analyzing the data as it comes in, it can't confirm if anyone has been hospitalized. So far, no problems with retail food or restaurant handling practices have been found.

What's especially troubling about this situation is that although the weather has cooled considerably, investigators are finding high levels of _Vibrio_ in the water. Because of that, they expect to see additional cases as temperatures rise through the summer.

The harvest dates cited in the information about the recall provided by the state are [29 Jun through 16 Jul 2021]. The growing area will be closed for a minimum of 21 days as of [17 Jul 2021], but the closure can be extended if sampling results warrant an extension.

Consumers who have fresh oysters from Samish Bay are encouraged to fully cook the shellfish prior to eating to reduce the risk of illness. Recreational harvesters throughout the state are encouraged to check DOH's Shellfish Safety Map prior to collecting shellfish (https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/biotoxin/biotoxin.html).

Food establishments that serve molluscan shellfish should review their current supply of shellfish and must remove the recalled oysters from service.

[_V. parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea and now it is reported that most of the identified cases were this organism.

It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ as well as other vibrios, are naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, clearly accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease the chances of acquiring a case of foodborne illness compared to eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
