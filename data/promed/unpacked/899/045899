ND livestock producers warned of anthrax danger
-----------------------------------------------
Livestock producers along the Mouse (Souris) and Missouri rivers
should consult with their veterinarians about vaccinating their
animals for anthrax this summer. "River floodwaters may contain
anthrax spores and can expose spores already present in the soil,
increasing the risk of anthrax on pasture and grazing land," said
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring. "If your veterinarian says
your livestock -- cattle, sheep horses and all grazing animals -- are
at risk and recommends vaccination, please follow that
recommendation."

The state veterinarian, Dr. Susan Keller, said vaccination has proved
very effective in reducing anthrax deaths in North Dakota.
"Vaccination takes about a week to establish some level of immunity
and must be followed up with annual boosters," Keller said. "If fly
control application is needed, it may be just the time to run the
cattle through an alleyway and vaccinate them as well."

Keller also urged producers to monitor their herds for unexpected
deaths and report them immediately to their veterinarians. "The
carcasses of animals that die from anthrax decompose quickly often
with little or no signs of rigor mortis," Keller said.

Animal health officials are concerned that the history of anthrax in
North Dakota, together with reports of the disease in nearby states
and provinces, ideal weather conditions and the overland flooding
could result in widespread cases of the disease among unvaccinated
animals. Most frequently reported in northeast, southeast, and south
central North Dakota, anthrax has been confirmed almost everywhere in
the state. The state usually records a few cases every year, but in
2005, anthrax killed an estimated 1000 head of cattle, bison, horses,
sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk. Vaccinated animals rarely die
from the disease.

An anthrax fact sheet and maps are available on the North Dakota
Department of Agriculture website, click on Board of Animal Health

The bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ causes anthrax. The bacteria's
spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades, becoming active
under ideal conditions, such as heavy rainfall, flooding and drought.
When animals graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the
spores, they may develop anthrax.

[We now have had alerts for Saskatchewan, Minnesota, North Dakota,
and South Dakota. This may seem repetitive, but the only way to be in
control of this zoonotically lethal disease is to be alert during the
summer 'anthrax season.' With this year's flooding this region is at
significant risk. The spores don't become "active" so much as they are
moved by ground water up from within a grave site to the surface and
into the root system of plants that get grazed by cattle.

Cattle don't snip off forage like sheep and horses but wrap their
tongues about it and rip it out of the ground along with any soil
attached to the roots. In this way cattle consume some 5-6 pounds of
soil per day. And if it is from a contaminated soil site, they get the
anthrax spores as well. - Mod.MHJ
