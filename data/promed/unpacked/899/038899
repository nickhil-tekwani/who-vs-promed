[Just one day following the confirmation of bluetongue (BTv) by Austria (where a BTV-4 was identified), Slovenia has now confirmed a detection of the disease in a farm located in the north-eastern part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murska_Sobota). The serotype has not yet been identified.

For a general overview of the BTv situation in the area, please see the bluetongue outbreak map provided by the OIE's WAHID database for the time frame 1 Jan 2014 to 20 Nov 2015 at http://tinyurl.com/q6etbr8. Click on the territory of choice and zoom in. - Mod.CRD
