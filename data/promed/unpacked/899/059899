EQUINE HERPESVIRUS - NIGERIA (03)

In response to the ProMED-mail posting "Equine herpesvirus - Nigeria (02)
20070118.0232" I would like to offer the following observation.
We submitted the following report to the OIE earlier this week:
"Possible Horsesickness Outbreak: We have positive serology and PCR results
with a history of multiple deaths in Lagos Polo Club horses. Attempted
isolation, RNA extraction and sequencing are underway."
We now have some RNA from the blood clot, and amplification and sequencing
will be attempted.

[We appreciate Dr Gerdes informing us. It may be that this is not equine
herpesvirus but African horse sickness. We are anxious to hear the results
of the tests. We also appreciate Tayo Babalobi's alerting us to the
possibility of African horse sickness (see 20070118.0232). - Mod.TG]
