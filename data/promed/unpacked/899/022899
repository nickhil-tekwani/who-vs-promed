On 5 Jan 2022, the Montgomery County [Pennsylvania, USA] Health Department announced there was a hepatitis A outbreak. So far, they have confirmed 10 cases and 2 deaths. Officials are now working to determine if the death of a person on Monday [17 Jan 2022] is also related to the outbreak. They have not released detailed information on the victim due to the continued investigation.

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), which is found in the stool and blood of people who are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is also highly contagious. "It is a fecal/oral route. And that means there's a small amount of feces or poop on a substance that is ingested and that's how you get hepatitis A," Dr Darren Mareiniss of Einstein Health told NBC10.

Symptoms of hepatitis A can last up to 2 months and include fatigue, nausea, stomach pain and jaundice, though most people with the virus don't have long-lasting illness, according to CDC. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the virus. "The majority of the hepatitis A patients don't progress to fulminant disease," Dr Mareiniss said. "That means they don't progress to liver failure. It's less than 1% we believe. So, a lot of people have milder symptoms and they're self-limiting. It goes away."

While 10 cases have been reported in Montgomery County, Dr Mareiniss said there are likely many more. "Since you have 2 deaths, if it were out of 10 people that'd be 20% mortality if those were the only people infected," he said. "Clearly there are a lot more than those infected. That's what I would take away from that."

On 7 Jan 2022, the Montgomery County Health Department announced they were closing Gino's Ristorante & Pizzeria in West Norriton Township in relation to the outbreak. The restaurant has remained closed ever since, though the business has denied involvement in the outbreak and claimed they were the victims of false rumors. "We cannot and will not take responsibility for something we did not cause," Francis Recchuiti, an attorney for the restaurant, wrote.

A source told NBC10 all of the workers at Gino's have been tested and vaccinated against hepatitis A and so far there have not been any positive tests among the employees. The source also said a family member of an employee is still scheduled for a test, though they were previously vaccinated against the virus. It is unknown when or if the restaurant will reopen.

[Given the county health department's actions, it is likely that those affected reported ingesting food from the implicated establishment. Since pizza per se is cooked to high temperatures in an oven, unless uncooked ingredients are added after cooking, it would be unlikely that pizza was the source but rather a salad or undercooked food, for instance, shellfish. Since, even in adults, some cases of acute hepatitis A are asymptomatic, it is possible that this, like the recent Virginia restaurant outbreak, involved an infected food handler. If a non-restaurant-contaminated food were the source, one would expect that the cases would be linked to other establishments. A serosurvey of the patrons of the restaurant could more accurately assess if there were more cases by testing for IgM anti-HAV.

To prevent such outbreaks from occurring, although still not mandated or even advocated by CDC (1), food handlers can be immunized against hepatitis A virus (HAV). In the USA, HAV immunization is part of the routine pediatric vaccination program, but this only began in 2006 so many adults in the USA remain susceptible. The news report states that "all of the workers have been tested and vaccinated against hepatitis A." It is not clear if the vaccination was prior to the event and full immunity requires 2 doses separated by a number of months. It would be interesting if indeed all food workers at the establishment were anti-HAV IgM negative and would bring the investigation to possible other sources.
