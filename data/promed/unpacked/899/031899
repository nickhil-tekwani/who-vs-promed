[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. Two major antigenic types of the virus exist -- type 1 (European) and type 2 (American).

PRRSV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. The biology of the virus has been well characterised. Soon after the discovery of the virus it became apparent the North American (NA, type 2) and European (EU, type 1) PRRSV isolates represented 2 genotypes with antigenic differences. Additional investigations have demonstrated regional differences within each continent. These differences are now becoming blurred as type 2 PRRSV has been introduced into Europe (in part through the use of a modified-live vaccine made from a North American isolate) and type 1 virus has been discovered in North America. Most PRRSV isolates from South America and much of Asia are of type 2, and it is assumed these viruses were introduced through the movement of swine and/or semen.

The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine, semen and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. No other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.8.7 "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf (adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2010).

There is no evidence of human infection with PRRS virus.

Switzerland reported 3 outbreaks of PRRS in 2012. These were located in the Appenzell Ausser-Rhoden Canton (1) and in the Appenzell Inner-Rhoden Canton (2). The event was resolved 11 Jan 2013. See the final report on this event at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012863_20130114_175356.pdf.
