The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced on [Tue 27 Jul 2021] the state has surpassed 1000 reported cases of hepatitis A associated with a national outbreak that began in April 2017. [A total of] 63% of cases have required hospitalization, and 16 people have died.

Since 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received more than 41 000 reports of hepatitis A linked to a national outbreak with higher than expected hospitalization and death rates, according to NCDHHS. North Carolina has been tracking the outbreak since April 2018, and reported cases have increased significantly since August 2020. NCDHHS and local health departments are coordinating outreach events, conducting case investigations and contact tracing, and providing hepatitis A vaccine to people at risk.

Since 1 Jan 2021, 495 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A were reported, indicating a marked increase in transmission. Of those cases, 13% are also infected with hepatitis B and 48% with hepatitis C. Because hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver, people with other forms of viral hepatitis or anyone with underlying liver disease is at risk of more serious illness if infected.

Wednesday [28 Jul 2021], is World Hepatitis Day, an opportunity to increase awareness and encourage the health and safety of people at risk for and living with viral hepatitis, and health officials are reminding North Carolinians a safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is available for free at all local health departments to people in high-risk groups for this outbreak, including people who use drugs, people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing and men who have sex with men.

"The best way to protect yourself against hepatitis A is through vaccination," said Dr. Erica Wilson, vaccine preventable disease medical director in NCDHHS' Division of Public Health. "As always, good hand-washing is key, especially after using the bathroom, changing diapers and before preparing or eating food. Using harm reduction strategies and syringe service programs is also key in reducing the risk for people who use drugs."

This multistate hepatitis A (HAV) epidemic was well in gear prior to the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and it is likely that surveillance had fallen off related to lack of resources during the height of the pandemic.

The CDC numbers for North Carolina were last reported on 23 Jul 2021, which noted 982 cases since 1 Jan 2018 with 620 (63%) hospitalized and 16 deaths. Prior to the pandemic, affected states were updating numbers weekly. Since the outbreaks were first identified in 2016, 36 states have publicly reported the following as of 23 Jul 2021: cases 41 855, hospitalizations 25 409 (61%) and deaths 382.

The epidemic in these states has affected primarily the homeless and substance abusers and the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official -- "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" -- remains relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations in our midst. Cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks.

They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
