11 000 Birds destroyed: Vietnam reports bird flu in 6 provinces
--------------------------------------------------
Outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in 6 provinces in Vietnam and 11
000 birds have been culled to try to contain the disease, which has killed
20 humans here in 2004, authorities said Thursday. Drastic measures were
needed to prevent these outbreaks from spreading and claiming more lives,
an official said.
Veterinarians have culled up to 11 000 chickens, ducks, quail, and geese to
try to contain the virus, animal health department director Bui Quang Anh
said in state media.
"If certain sectors and localities do not implement drastic and effective
prevention measures, the outbreak could expand widely to affect
agricultural production prices and human lives," he was quoted as saying in
the English daily Vietnam News. "Local authorities have been asked to
monitor carefully the transport and trading of poultry to Vietnam's
neighboring countries," he said.
New outbreaks had been reported at a limited number of farms in the
southern provinces of Bac Lieu, Long An, Tra Vinh, Hau Giang, An Giang and
Can Tho, an official from the department told Agence France-Presse.
Vietnam declared in October 2004 that it had brought its latest outbreak of
avian influenza under control. It first made such an announcement on 30 Mar
2004 but had to admit later that the declaration had been premature after 3
people, including 2 children, died after being infected in August with the
H5N1 strain of the virus.
The occurrence of the "dangerous" H5N1 strain in wild animals made it
difficult to eliminate, the government said in state media Thursday.
"It exists in the wild and in water birds...It is therefore difficult to
completely wipe out the disease," the national steering committee for bird
flu control said in the Vietnam News.
Experts say avian influenza has entrenched itself in much of Asia and is
unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
Japan confirmed its 1st human case of bird flu Wednesday and said 4 other
people were suspected of catching the disease. South Korea culled thousands
of ducks this month after bird flu was detected among them.
United Nations health agencies and the Vietnamese government will next
month set up a permanent task-force to coordinate efforts against bird flu,
including immediate reactions to further outbreaks and long-term surveillance.

Vietnam faces new bird flu outbreaks
------------------------------------
Vietnam has -- since early December 2004 -- detected new outbreaks of bird
flu in 6 southern localities, which have either killed or led to forced
culling of nearly 11 000 fowl, local newspaper reports Thursday quoted the
Department of Animal Health as saying.
At a conference on strengthening anti-bird flu activities held on
Wednesday, the department's director Qui Quang Anh said outbreaks occurred
in 7 wards and communes in Can Tho city and the provinces of Bac Lieu, Long
An, Tra Vinh, Hau Giang and Binh Phuoc between 1 and 20 Dec 2004, killing
and leading to the forced culling of 3840 chickens, 3815 ducks and 3000 quails.
Samples from dead fowls were tested positive to the bird flu virus strain
of H5, he noted.
The bird flu situation is getting serious, since Vietnam discovered only
one outbreak last month, and the country is facing potential outbreaks in
the northern region this winter whose cold weather favors the disease's spread.
"We must closely follow the situation on a daily basis. The busy transport
and big sales of poultry during the Lunar New Year Festival (in early
February 2005) plus complex weather may result in outbreaks in the northern
region," Anh said.
Now localities nationwide are beefing up anti-bird flu activities, mainly
by disinfecting affected areas, monitoring the transport of poultry and
their eggs, taking samples from fowls in high-risk provinces for virus
testing, and raising public awareness of the disease nationwide.
In late March 2004, Vietnam declared an end to the bird flu that had killed
17 percent of its poultry population and claimed 16 human lives during the
previous outbreak starting in December 2003. A total of 43.2 million fowl
nationwide either died or were culled, causing direct losses of 1.3
trillion Vietnamese dong (USD 82.8 million) to the local poultry industry.
