[According to the report above, there have now been a total of 76 936 cases of confirmed COVID-19 reported from China, representing an increase of 648 cases from the revised cumulative total in the past 24 hours, of which 630 (97.2%) were in Hubei. In addition, there were 97 deaths reported, of which 96 (99.0%) were in Hubei. There was 1 new case reported from Hong Kong.

While there are fewer cases being reported on a daily basis in China, the number of cases and deaths reported from outside of China keeps increasing (see following sections below). As I mentioned yesterday (21 Feb 2020), it is definitely too soon to celebrate, as transmission outside of China increases.

[3] Iran: 28 cases, 6 deaths
Date: Sat 22 Feb 2020
Source: TV1 news New Zealand [edited]
https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/world/sixth-person-dies-coronavirus-in-iran


The governor of Markazi province told the official IRNA news agency today that tests of a patient who recently died in the central city of Arak was positive for the virus. Ali Aghazadeh said the person who died was suffering from a heart problem, too.

Yesterday [21 Feb 2020], Iranian health authorities reported a 5th death from the new virus and said the fatality was among 10 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.

So far, 28 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including at least 5 of the 6 who died. People are being treated for the virus in at least 4 different cities, including the capital, Tehran, where some pharmacies had already run out of masks and hand sanitizer. Other cities are Qom, Arak, and Rasht.

[The best information on the current status of the outbreak with confirmed cases is the daily situation report update published by WHO. The update is based on cases reported to WHO by 10 a.m. Geneva time (GMT+2). That means additional cases reported later are 1st picked up by local and international media sources and the Johns Hopkins CSSE group (see section [2] above). That qualifier being said, according to the most recent media reports, there have been an additional 10 cases and 2 deaths reported in Iran in the past 24 hours. Four major cities appear to be involved: Tehran, Qom, Arak, and Rasht. (Rasht is located in Gilan (or Guila) province on the Caspian Sea. According to Wikipedia it is the most densely populated city in the country. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasht.)

Qom is located to the southwest of Tehran in central Iran, and Guila is to the northwest of both Qom and Tehran and is located on the Caspian Sea. A good map of Iran showing provinces can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/iran/iran-political-map.html. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Iran is available at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7015552,128. - Mod.MPP]

[The problems facing the Gulf countries after the outbreak and especially the surge in Iran is illustrated by the fact that the UAE (United Arab Emirates) has around 750 000 Chinese residents, of which a considerable number went home for the new year and now returned. The Emirates airline reduced the number of flights to China but never stopped.

There are 30 weekly flights between Iran and the UAE and 2 daily flights between Iran and Oman. These will probably not be cancelled. Land crossings are another issue, and there is smuggling activity from Iran to Musandam (Oman).

Iran now reports 28 cases and 5 deaths, but an Iranian colleague says the data probably reflect under-reporting. He also reports that 2 physicians from hospitals in northern Tehran are now in the hospital, and that there is a shortage of test kits in Iran. The last will mean that cases are not reported because they cannot be tested. - Mod.EP, based in Muscat, Oman]

[4] South Korea ex Israel ex South Korea
A. Israeli sites visited by South Korean pilgrims
Date: Sat 22 Feb 2020

https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5682244,00.html


Following reports of the 9 pilgrims infected with the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] and taking off back to their country after visiting Israel, the [Israeli] Ministry of Health announced a series of precautionary measures. An official with the Ben Gurion office of the Population Registry Authority told Ynet on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] that, in light of reports, the possibility of refusing South Korea's tourists entrance is being considered. At 19:30, Korean Air is expected to land in Ben Gurion Airport.

The Ministry found their [the tourists'] tour routes, including overnight locations where they stayed. For example, the Nature and Parks Authority noted that tourists visited 3 of the visitors' sites they maintain -- Beer Sheva, Masada, and Caesarea -- as well as churches in Jerusalem. A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Israel said under investigation if its members had come in contact with the group. Meanwhile, 4 employees of the Nature and Parks Authority, who apparently came in contact with the group members in Caesarea and Tel Be'er Sheva National Park, were placed in solitary confinement, as well as 2 hotel employees at the David Dead-Sea Hotel who cleaned the rooms where the Korean tourists stayed. The hotel is said to follow the Health Ministry's instructions.

Here are the currently known locations and exposure times:

8 Feb 2020 - After 20:00 the Tower of David Hotel in Netanya and the Gallery Hotel

9 Feb 2020 - Caesarea, Gabriel Hotel in Nazareth, Gospel Church, Holy Family Church, Ein Gev Hotel

10 Feb 2020 - Ein Gev Hotel, Tenorin Restaurant, St. Peter's First Church, Bread and Fish Church

11 Feb 2020 - David Hotel, Dead-Sea

12 Feb 2020 - Masada, Timna Park, Leonardo Negev Hotel in Be'er Sheva

13 Feb 2020 - Tel Be'er Sheva National Park, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Grand Court Hotel in Jerusalem

14 Feb 2020 - Mount of Olives in Jerusalem - Peggy's House, Ascension Church, Pat Nostar's Church, Dominus Plevit Church, Gethsemane Church; Mount Zion - the Last Supper, Mary's Tomb, Gallicantu Church

15 Feb 2020 - Jerusalem, Gold Restaurant; Ein Kerem Jerusalem - St. John's Church, Visiting Church, St. Anne's Church, Blessing of the Flock (Bethesda), Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Church of Anastasis.

Also, at the Ein Gev Hotel, Sea of Galilee, the group was said to had stayed 2 nights, about 2 weeks ago. "The resorts are always very carefully cleaned. We take it seriously and conduct a thorough check with travel agents in Korea and Israel regarding the case."

Jonathan Barkai, an Israeli living in South Korea, told Ynet: "So far, we thought the virus was under control. This week it turned out that the number of infected people is rising. People here are getting stressed. Saturday night is always considered one of the busiest days, but there is no one on the street. People fear. But they most likely have contracted the virus in South Korea and traveled to Israel. When they returned, the disease erupted."

Ben Gurion Airport and Seoul have direct flights 4 times a week, from Korean Air Airlines. Today there is no restriction on entry of tourists visiting or returning from South Korea, and it was not included in the order issued by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri this week. The order restricted entry into Israel of anyone who had stayed in Thailand, Macau, Singapore, and Hong Kong for the past 2 weeks and does not have Israeli citizenship, in addition to a ban already imposed on foreigners arriving from China.

Nine South Korean nationals who visited Israel and the West Bank in February [2020] have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, Israel's Health Ministry said on Saturday [22 Feb 2020].

All 77 members of the group have already returned to South Korea, and at this stage it is unknown whether they were infected with the virus before or after arriving in Israel.

[As mentioned in the 2nd media report above in this section, there are presently 9 individuals from that tour group who are now positive for the SAR-CoV-2 on return to Korea. An MSN-Korea media report mentions that apparently one individual from this group of 77 individuals may have been ill prior to departure on this trip. The machine translation is suboptimal, but there are quotes of other members expressing anger towards this one individual for exposing them (see https://tinyurl.com/uug5tgg). As a reminder, the early presenting symptoms can be the same as for the common cold: sore throat and dry cough.

[5] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship: 23 passengers left without testing
Date: Sat 22 Feb 2020
Source: SBS [edited]
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/japan-says-23-passengers-mistakenly-left-virus-ship-before-testing


Around 100 more passengers have been allowed to disembark from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship over the weekend as Japan's health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested.

The news came as a Japanese woman who left the ship on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] tested positive for the virus after returning home to Tochigi Prefecture, Kyodo news agency reported, citing the prefectural government. She is the 1st person to have tested positive for the virus among the group of approximately 970 passengers who disembarked earlier this week, it said.

The 100 passengers who left on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] had been in close contact with infected people on board, local media said. They included the last group of Japanese passengers to leave the ship, while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for their governments to send chartered aircraft. They will be quarantined for 2 weeks near Tokyo, officials said.

An official apology
At a news conference on Saturday [22 Feb 2020], Health Minister Katsunobu Kato apologised for 23 passengers having been allowed to leave the ship without undergoing all the required tests. "We deeply regret that our operational mistake caused the situation," Kato said, adding that the passengers would be tested again.

With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1000 crew still on board. Many of them were not placed in isolation as they were needed to keep the ship running, preparing food and delivering meals to cabins. Critics have charged that they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease.

Kato defended Japan's on-board quarantine, telling a TV programme Saturday [22 Feb 2020] there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3000 people at once. Speaking at the news conference, Kato said 6 Australian passengers tested positive after leaving Japan. Meanwhile, 18 repatriated Americans and 1 Israeli who returned home from the ship have tested positive, authorities from the 2 countries announced Friday [21 Feb 2020].

Kato also confirmed that a Japanese hospital on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] used the anti-influenza medication Avigan, also known as Favipiravir, to treat a patient infected with the virus. Earlier in the day, Kato said the government would push for the use of such medicines if they were confirmed to be effective.

Outside the Diamond Princess, Japan has seen 105 cases of the new coronavirus.

B. South Korea: total 433 cases

The number of new coronavirus cases nearly tripled in South Korea on Saturday [22 Feb 2020], the 4th consecutive day that tally has seen a major spike. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 433 less than 24 hours after the sum stood at 156.

As of Tuesday [18 Feb 2020], the number of confirmed cases was just 31.

Many of the new patients Saturday [22 Feb 2020] were located in or near Daegu, South Korea's 4th-largest city, where dozens of people linked with a Christian sect known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have shown symptoms of respiratory illness. The church, which has about 150 000 adherents, says it has shared with authorities the names of members who may have been exposed to the virus, and it is encouraging them to enter quarantine.

Meanwhile, in the nearby city of Gumi, Samsung said it is shutting down a mobile device factory after confirming a case of the coronavirus at the facility. The Korean electronics giant said it is shuttering the factory at least through the weekend. "The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection," the company said in a statement released Saturday [22 Feb 2020].

Two patients in South Korea have died from the disease now known as COVID-19, while at least 18 have recovered and been released from care. Thousands more are still undergoing testing for the respiratory disease.

All told, there have been more than 77 000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide, more than 2300 of which have ended in a patient's death. The vast majority of those cases so far have been reported in mainland China, where the outbreak has its roots in the city of Wuhan, though the number of new confirmed cases there reportedly has been declining recently.

But the virus has not stopped at the Chinese border; Japan has seen recent leaps in cases of its own. And health officials are anxiously watching the numbers swell in countries even farther afield. "The increasing signs of transmission outside China show that the window of opportunity we have for containing this virus is narrowing," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told a news conference Saturday [22 Feb 2020].

Of particular concern, he said, are "the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case." He described as especially worrisome the disease's spread in Iran, where health officials have confirmed at least 28 cases, 10 of which were reported in the past day. He said the WHO has sent testing kits to Iran. And though just one confirmed case has been reported in Africa -- in Egypt, specifically -- Tedros warned that because of the robust trading relationship between China and some countries on the continent, health officials should be preparing for its arrival before long. "Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weak health systems," he said.

"We know a little bit more about this virus and the disease it causes. We know that more than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, but the other 20% of patients have severe or critical disease, ranging from shortness of breath to septic shock and multi-organ failure," said Tedros. "These patients require intensive care, using equipment such as respiratory support machines that are, as you know, in short supply in many African countries."

[The number of cases reported from South Korea continues to climb. There appears to be at least 2 foci of infection. A major contributor to this climb is the Church group that recently built a new church in Wuhan. But another religious group of pilgrims who went to Israel is also a focus of transmission as there have been 9 confirmed cases in this group as of today, 22 Feb 2020 (see section [4] above).

A media report just released states there have been 556 cases including 4 deaths: https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1005662088&plink=TWITTER&cooper=PUSH (in Korean).

C. Italy: 79 cases, 2 deaths
Date: Sat 22 Feb 2020

Cases of the new coronavirus in Italy, the most affected country in Europe, rose on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] to nearly 80, killing 2 people and prompting the government to close off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Authorities in the 2 regions, where the outbreak is concentrated, have canceled sports events and closed schools and universities, while companies from Ray-Ban owner Luxottica to the country's top bank UniCredit have told workers living in the affected areas to stay home.

Lombardy and Veneto represent Italy's industrial heart and jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output. With an emergency decree passed at a meeting in the headquarters of Italy's civil protection agency, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the affected areas. Competent ministers will also be able to halt sports events and school trips outside those areas.

"I've wondered myself why so many cases in Italy ... and the answer is in the rigorous and meticulous controls our country has adopted from the start," Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a late-night press conference. Italy's 1st victim was a 76-year-old woman who was found dead at her home 50 km (30 mi) south of Milan on Thursday [20 Feb 2020] and tested positive for the coronavirus. A 78-year-old man died of the infection in a hospital near Padua on Friday [21 Feb 2020] night. The man's wife and daughter are among 17 people infected by the coronavirus in the Veneto region, where authorities are considering suspending Carnival of Venice events currently taking place.

There are 54 cases in nearby Lombardy, including a man currently at San Raffaele hospital in Milan. The city, where Women's Fashion Week is underway, has a population of 1.4 million. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani said his fashion show on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] would take place in an empty theater without any press or buyers present to safeguard their health.

Milan's prosecutors office said it would not reopen on Monday [24 Feb 2020] and will remain closed until further notice. Organizers of the world's biggest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] postponed to the end of May [2020] the event that had been due to take place in Milan in a week.

Small town at heart of outbreak
The outbreak originated in Codogno, a small town southeast of Milan where Lombardy's 1st infected patient, a 38-year-old man, now in stable condition, was treated. "All those who have tested positive are people who on [18-19 Feb 2020] had contacts with the emergency room and the hospital of Codogno," Regional Health Councillor Giulio Gallera said, adding 259 people had been screened in the area in the past 2 days and 35 had tested positive. "A contagion rate of 13% is quite strong," he said.

Some 50 000 residents in Codogno and 9 nearby towns have been advised to remain indoors. Public gatherings including Sunday church services and football matches have been suspended, and schools and shops have been closed. Similar measures were adopted in the small Veneto town of Vo' Euganeo, where the male victim lived, and in other places.

Conte said further school shutdowns outside the outbreak areas would be up to local authorities.

Italy was the 1st euro-zone country to suspend all direct flights to and from China after 2 Chinese tourists from the badly hit city of Wuhan tested positive in Rome in late January [2020]. The Chinese tourists and an Italian national repatriated from Wuhan were the only 3 cases in Italy until Friday [21 Feb 2020].

[According to the above media report, there have now been a total of 79 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy including 2 deaths. The above report is the 1st detailing the apparent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Codogno, a town in the province of Lodi, Lombardy, located in northern Italy, and identifying the major increase in cases seen among individuals who were in the emergency room (ER) on 18-19 Feb 2020. There is no mention if there was a patient with COVID-19 confirmed in the ER on those days, or perhaps it was one or more of the 5 physicians confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection (see yesterday's [21 Feb 2020] report on the increase in cases in Lombardy Italy: COVID-19 update (13): China, global, Iran, Lebanon, Israel, WHO, RFI 20200222.7013077) who were working in the ER those days.

Lombardy is in the north central of the country, with Veneto on its western border in the northwest of the country. A good map of Italy showing provinces is available at http://ontheworldmap.com/italy/italy-provinces-map.html. - Mod.MPP]

Japanese government officials confirmed 14 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday (22 Feb 2020) as public health authorities struggle to contain a global epidemic. Among the cases was a junior high school teacher in Chiba prefecture just east of Tokyo who went to work even though she had symptoms, raising fears the virus could spread among her students and co-workers.

In the northern prefecture of Hokkaido, a boy less than 10 years old was added to the list. On Friday [21 Feb 2020], 2 brothers in an elementary school in Hokkaido were confirmed infected. Children had been thought to possibly be less vulnerable to the new virus, with far fewer reported infections in much younger people.

Japan's government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in July [2020].

In Japan, more than 100 people have now tested positive for the flu-like illness, which has killed more than 2300 in mainland China, where it emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year [2019]. In addition, more than 600 cases have also been reported on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that has been quarantined off Yokohama for more than 2 weeks.

Passengers who are not ill continued to leave the ship on Saturday [22 Feb 2020], domestic media reported, but uncertainty is high due to concerns that quarantine procedures on the ship were not adequate.

Of the new cases reported on Saturday [22 Feb 2020], 8 were in Hokkaido, according to the prefectural government's website, 2 were in Chiba prefecture, 1 was in Tokyo, and another in Wakayama prefecture in western Japan. Two more cases, a man in his 60s and a man in his 50s, were also confirmed in Kumamoto prefecture in southern Japan.

The junior high school teacher in Chiba, in her 60s, 1st showed symptoms on [12 Feb 2020] and was hospitalised on [19 Feb 2020], according to media. She went to work while she had symptoms, so the local government will close her school for 2 days from [25 Feb 2020]. The 2nd case was a woman in her 30s, also in Chiba prefecture, who has been hospitalised but is not showing any symptoms, the prefectural government official said.

There is no relationship between the 2 women, and it is uncertain how either of them got the virus, the official said.

[The number of cases reported by Japan is now at 122, according to the Johns Hopkins CSSE webpage (see [2] above). These are not including the 624 cases found to be PCR positive on the Diamond Princess (not counting evacuees). Local transmission is clearly ongoing.

With respect to the 2 women from Chiba prefecture, it should be noted that Chiba prefecture is where Narita airport is, a major international airport serving the greater Tokyo region. A map of Japan showing regions and prefectures can be found at https://www.kyuhoshi.com/map-of-japan/. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- 2 new countries (Lebanon and Israel) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. On [18 Feb 2020], a new protocol entitled "Surface sampling of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical 'how-to' protocol for healthcare and public health professionals" was published (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations). This protocol was designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus.

- The WHO director-general briefed the emergency ministerial meeting on COVID-19 organized by the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Details can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/emergency-ministerial-meeting-on-covid-19-organized-by-the-african-union-and-the-africa-centres-for-disease-control-and-prevention.

Subject in Focus: New protocol for early epidemiologic and clinical investigations for public health response

The understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 is currently limited among the general population, among healthcare workers, in households, and in other "closed" settings.

On [18 Feb 2020], a new master protocol entitled "Surface sampling of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical 'how-to' protocol for healthcare and public health professionals" was published (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations).

The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. This protocol was designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus in these settings. It is important that surface sampling is done as part of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, and that information obtained by environmental studies is combined with findings from epidemiological and laboratory investigations.

As a reminder, several early investigation master protocols and master forms for COVID-19 are available:

Early Epidemiologic and Clinical Investigations for Public Health Response
Setting: For whom? / Which protocol should be used? / Contact details for further information

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China is now 17 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Italy, Egypt, Iran, and Israel). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has been occurring on the ship.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 1402 including 11 deaths, with reports coming from 28 countries.

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
