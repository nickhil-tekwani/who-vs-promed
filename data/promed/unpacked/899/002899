The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 18 Oct 2018:
- A total of 227 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, with 192 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 192 confirmed, 112 died, and 58 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 40 suspected cases under investigation.
- 4 new cases confirmed in Beni.
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases in Beni (including 2 community deaths but dignified and secure burials).
- 5040 contacts to follow to date.

News of the response
- On Fri 19 Oct 2018, the response teams organized capacity building on Ebola virus disease for student representatives from the 17 higher institutions and universities in the city of Beni. Representatives in Beni Coordination Interestudiantine (COIB) approached the coordination of the response by expressing the will to get involved in the work of sensitizing the population.
- During this capacity building, the different experts followed one another to explain the pillars of the response. The 2 coordinators of Beni's sub-coordination, Dr Justus Nsio (Ministry of Health) and Dr Boubacar Diallo (WHO), began by making a general presentation on the disease before talking in more detail about their epidemiological surveillance work. Then, Red Cross officials demonstrated with their equipment about a dignified and safe burial that still raises questions in the community. Finally, officials from the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) spoke of the importance of youth engagement in the response.
- At the end of the session, the students made a commitment to get involved in raising the awareness of the other students and even took pictures to launch their campaign on social networks, particularly on WhatsApp, which is the communication platform used most by the young people of Beni.

[Peter Salama @PeteSalama tweeted the following on 16 Oct 2018:
From 8 Aug till now [16 Oct 2018], 18 000 people have been vaccinated against #Ebola in #DRC, including 7000 health/frontline workers and 4000 children. This is the result of an incredible team effort and international cooperation, with vaccinators from within DRC and from Guinea. - Submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

Actually, the number of vaccinees is 19 539 as of 18 Oct 2018. The team is to be congratulated on this accomplishment, especially given the violence and community resistance in the region. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 19 Oct 2018:
- A total of 235 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 200 were confirmed and 35 were probable.
- Of the 200 confirmed, 117 died, and 61 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 40 suspected cases under investigation.
- 8 new confirmed cases, including 6 in Beni and 2 in Butembo.
- 5 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 4 in Beni and 1 in Butembo (including 3 community deaths but dignified and secure burials).
- 3 new people healed, including 2 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.
- 5332 contacts to follow.

News of the response
- Two agents of the Medical Unit of Rapid Intervention (UMIR) of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) died following an attack by Mai-Mai militiamen from the Vulindi entry point, located at the entrance from the city of Butembo. UNAMIR elements, unarmed, had been placed at certain points of entry into hazardous areas to assist National Border Health Program (PNHF) officers. It seems that the attack was premeditated. In the middle of the day, 5 armed Mai-Mai militiamen emerged from the surrounding forest and opened fire on the 2 UMIR agents before leaving without wounding the civilians present. According to the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, "It is a dark day for all the teams of the response that sometimes put their lives in danger in the service of the nation. Health workers are not a target for armed groups. Despite the many attacks against them, our agents continue to go out on the ground every day to fulfill the mission entrusted to them. They are true heroes, and we will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure that they can do their job safely."
- After the dignified and safe burial of a man who died of Ebola in Butembo, a group of 22 young bikers from the neighborhood exhumed the body and opened the body bag. Influenced by rumors circulating in their neighborhood, they wanted to verify that no organ had been taken from the body by the response teams. By opening the body bag and putting their hands on it, they found themselves in direct contact with the bodily fluids coming out of the corpse. The next day, they agreed to all get vaccinated.

Vaccination
---------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 20 229 people have been vaccinated, including 9393 in Beni [North Kivu], 4391 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1592 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1085 in Butembo [North Kivu], 690 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 105 in Kalunguta [North Kivu].

[The reported number of cases increased by 8 over yesterday's report. Violence in the area directed towards healthcare workers (with 2 deaths reported) is extremely concerning. Additional reports indicate it's the 1st time healthcare workers have been directly targeted in this outbreak (see https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/dark-day-congo-rebels-kill-2-health-agents-fighting-ebola/2018/10/20/d4795df2-d4b1-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html?utm_term=.f643f2674dee for further information as well as https://actualite.cd/2018/10/20/rdc-tirs-larme-lourde-beni-plusieurs-quartiers-de-la-ville-desertes-par-la-population for a report on additional violence in the area. - Mod.JH]

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Fri 19 Oct 2018. Four more confirmed Ebola cases in DRC as suspected cases jump
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/news-scan-oct-19-2018

- Today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced 4 more confirmed cases of Ebola virus in Beni, the current epicenter of the outbreak in North Kivu province. Officials also recorded 3 new deaths in Beni, including 2 community deaths that had safe and dignified burials.

There are now 227 cases of Ebola in this outbreak, including 147 deaths. In addition to the confirmed cases, officials reported 40 suspected cases of Ebola, a doubling of recent numbers. The jump in suspected cases under investigation may be a positive development, though, a sign that increased surveillance in the city is working.

Vaccination efforts continued throughout the province this week [week of 15 Oct 2018], with more than 19 000 people vaccinated, including 8843 in Beni.

- Fri 19 Oct 2018. Ebola virus outbreak under control in Tchomia in 3 weeks
Digital Congo [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/5bc999d1f7b885000456d388/

The Ebola outbreak has been mastered in Tchomia, Ituri province, eastern DRC in a 3-week period by teams responding to the epidemic, reports a press release from the Department of Health on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018] at the ACP [Agence Congolese de Presse].

The source reported that the 1st confirmed case of Tchomia was notified on 21 Sep 2018 and that all contacts identified around the 2 confirmed cases of Tchomia, including those followed in Bunia, have come out of their 21-day follow-up period. This indicates that the epidemic in this health zone was perfectly mastered in 3 weeks.

The field teams managed to control 8 of the 10 outbreaks, despite the security context, including the Mabalako epicenter, in less than 4 weeks after the 1st confirmed case was reported in each of these health zones.

This confirms that a rapid medical response (surveillance, isolation center, immunization), combined with strong community engagement, is the most effective way to rapidly contain an Ebola outbreak and limit loss of life, the report said.

[3] South Sudan: diagnostic testing
Date: Fri 19 Oct 2018
Source: All Africa [edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201810190152.html

South Sudan has successfully conducted its 1st ever laboratory test for Ebola using the emergency management and laboratory infrastructure developed with support from WHO as part of emergency preparedness.

The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) for South Sudan, which was conducted in 2017, made a number of recommendations to fill the gaps in laboratory capacity and ability to fulfill the core competencies of the International Health Regulations 2005. WHO, with support from DFID, South Sudan Humanitarian Fund, USAID, and the European Union Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), has since been supporting the country to address these gaps, particularly in creating the capacity required to diagnose priority diseases in-country. Earlier this year [2018] 20 Ministry of Health (MoH) staff from the national and state levels underwent an intensive training on laboratory biosafety and EVD preparedness. This included training on the use of GeneXpert to safely test for the Zaire strain of Ebola at the National Public Health Laboratory.

On Fri 12 Oct 2018, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) in Rumbek alerted WHO of a suspected case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) involving one of its staff members who had recently returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A rapid response team of experts from WHO and MoH was immediately deployed to investigate the alert. Blood samples from the patient were tested for Ebola Zaire at the National Public Health Laboratory in Juba using the GeneXpert technology, and the results were provided within 6 hours of taking the sample in Rumbek, which is a 1st time in the country. In parallel, the samples were sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute for differential diagnosis.

According to Dr Olushayo Olu, the World Health Organization representative in South Sudan, testing of suspected EVD cases with support of optimal laboratory capacities at national level is a critical component of national readiness capacities for EVD response. He noted that the GeneXpert requires minimal training, limited laboratory infrastructure, procurement of only reagent kits, and no cold storage and can run on a generator. Dr Olu commended the efforts of MOH South Sudan on this important milestone. He acknowledged support from donors who have strengthened the laboratory system in South Sudan for EVD and other diseases of public-health importance. Furthermore, he pledged ongoing WHO support to establish additional capacity to diagnose the other strains in the country.
