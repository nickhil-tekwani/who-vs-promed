An outbreak of African swine fever has been registered in the village of
Dzoravank of Gegharkunik (Geghark'unik') region. [According to preliminary
data,] 60 pigs have been slaughtered. The deputy head of veterinary
services, Gevork Tovmasyan, said that it is not clear yet if the cause of
the outbreak is African swine fever [ASF] or classical [swine fever, CSF].
The village neighbors the Tavush region, where quarantine is in place. The
transportation of swine and pork is prohibited and the risk of spread is
low, the deputy said. As a reminder, 3000 pigs with ASF have been
slaughtered already in the country.

[On 29 Aug 2007, Armenia sent an immediate notification to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health),
reporting 6 confirmed ASF outbreaks in the northern provinces Tavush and
Lorri, bordering southern Georgia. The current suspected outbreak in the
village Dzoravank (see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AM/4/Dzoravank.html>) is within
Geghark'unik' province, south of Tavush (see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_pol_2002.jpg>.) The
full OIE report, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6051>.

Confirmation (or otherwise) of the current case and a follow-up report are
anticipated.
So far, 3 countries/territories are known to have been affected by the
unfolding ASF epizootic in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and Armenia.
The disease was initially reported by Georgia on 6 Jun 2007, stating the
start date as 22 Apr 2007. According to a Swiss-experts-mission report (see
ProMED-mail 20070920.3131), "The outbreak of ASF started on 22 Apr 2007
around the harbour city of Poti, although already in the beginning of April
2007 increased mortality of pigs was reported in Poti. The current most
likely hypothesis of introduction of the virus is via importation of
contaminated pork or pork waste from international ships. However, it will
be very difficult, or even impossible, to definitively prove this
hypothesis, due to the long time between the beginning of the outbreak and
its official recognition, as well as due to the lack of documentation."
According to another rumour, likewise unconfirmed, the disease was
introduced by garbage being offloaded from a ship in Georgia's autonomous
republic Abkhazia, rapidly spreading throughout that territory and into
Georgia proper.
The epizootic maintains a potential for further spread into neighbouring
countries: Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. - Mod.AS]
