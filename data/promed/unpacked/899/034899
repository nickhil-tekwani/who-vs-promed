In the past 4 months, King County has seen a surge in hepatitis A cases, with 71 confirmed putting the annual average of 5-16 to shame.

The Washington Department of Health had to declare a statewide hepatitis A outbreak on 30 Jul 2019. Numbers grew exponentially in the fall as more people began to show signs of the disease. Then came 2020, with 18 onsets in January, 19 in February, and a jump to 28 in March.

Similarly to the coronavirus, hepatitis A virus [HAV] thrives in poorly sanitized environments and transmits through contact with infected people and surfaces. It is a liver infection that originates from the ingestion of microscopic fecal matter of an infected person. Anyone who has not gotten a vaccine is at risk. It mostly affects the homeless and people who use street drugs, but also inmates, international travelers, people with chronic liver disease, or clotting disorders, and caregivers assisting hepatitis patients. Furthermore, it can transmit through sexual intercourse and the consumption of contaminated foods and drinks. On average, the virus incubates for 28 days, but it can take as long as 50 for its symptoms to manifest, and weeks to months for a person to recover. Hepatitis A has a mortality rate of 0.5% and does not become chronic, but its symptoms can be debilitating (or completely absent).

Between 1 Apr 2019, and 3 Jan 2020, there were 154 cases in the entire state, meaning that, during the same time, symptomatic people in King County alone represented approximately 27% of the affected population, this data is justified by the notoriously high homelessness and drug addiction rates in the county. However, April 2020 also saw a reduction of diagnosed cases, which fell to 17, while only 8 people began to show any symptoms. The decrease might be related to COVID-19 precautionary action. The fear of catching this virus could induce possible hepatitis-infected individuals to avoid hospitals and clinics, causing their illness to remain unreported and untreated. On a positive note, the drop may be the result of physical distancing, which could have contributed to limit the spread, and of the effectiveness of hepatitis A preventive programs.

In July 2019, King County Executive Dow Constantine announced he was allocating USD 350 000 from the Loss Control Program fund to extend free hepatitis A vaccinations and limit the spread among the homeless. In 2020, King County added USD 322 000 to continue the service. These vaccinations are available in various locations and mobile stations. Since January 2019, more than 2500 homeless and drug users have received immunization.

The Taney County Health Department has identified 3 cases of hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that affects the liver. Infection may occur by eating contaminated food or drink, in addition to person-to-person contact. Taney County health officials say none of these cases were related to food establishments or restaurants.

Hepatitis A symptoms include fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dark urine, light stools, and yellowing of skins and eyes.

Nationally, the hepatitis A outbreak has affected people since March 2017.

When hearing about hepatitis A, many people think about contaminated food and water. However, in the United States, hepatitis A is more commonly spread from person to person. Since March 2017, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) has been assisting multiple state and local health departments with hepatitis A outbreaks spread through person-to-person contact. The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent HAV [hepatitis A virus] infection.

The following groups are at highest risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection in these outbreaks and should be offered the hepatitis A vaccine in order to prevent or control an outbreak:
- people who use drugs (injection or non-injection);
- people experiencing unstable housing or homelessness;
- men who have sex with men (MSM);
- people who are currently or were recently incarcerated; and
- people with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

One dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine has been shown to control outbreaks of hepatitis A and provides up to 95% seroprotection in healthy individuals for up to 11 years.

Pre-vaccination serologic testing is not required to administer hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccinations should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained or records are unavailable.

[The new numbers for HAV infections in this prolonged multistate outbreak are substantially lower. In part, this may be due to a significant number of states not reporting new numbers in 2+ months which may be related to diverting public health staff to COVID-19 work. In the states, however, that have kept up reporting the numbers are lower which is likely due to both the stay-at-home orders to people related to COVID-19 and the fear of ill individuals to come to healthcare facilities because of the pandemic. - Mod.LL]
