[Details on the source of the "illegally moved animals" will be
helpful, in case available. Umm-Al-Fahm is on the demarcation line
between Israel and the West Bank (Palestinian Autonomous Territories);
see map at the above URL.

The 1st case of PPR in Israel, affecting a dairy sheep operation in
Hazafon (north) district, was detected on 3 Jan 1993; the date of
initial infection was suspected to be in December 1992, probably
introduced by illegal movement of infected animals from Lebanon.
During 1993, a 2nd outbreak was detected. Those 2 outbreaks were
controlled by severe quarantine measures, combined with regional mass
vaccination in sheep and goats, applying the rinderpest Plowright
vaccine. No additional outbreaks were recorded during the following 3
years, but in 1997, the disease reappeared and since then has been
reported each year (except 2002) until February 2006. A graph showing
the PPR situation from 1993-2009 is available on page 29 of the 2009
annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH)
(in Hebrew), at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/401D0A6E-6FA9-41AD-B52E-130299EA5CC5/0/doch_vet_shnati_2009.pdf.

Since March 2006, Israel replaced the heterologous rinderpest tissue
culture vaccine (Plowright rinderpest vaccine), applied since 1993 for
the mass vaccination of small ruminants against PPR, in favour of the
live attenuated homologous PPR virus vaccine, which became
commercially available during the late 1990s. This change was followed
immediately by a significant improvement, expressed by the absence of
clinical PPR in Israel since February 2006, until the current
outbreak.

It will be interesting to obtain information on the age of the
currently affected lambs and on their and their dams' vaccination
history.

The diagnosis of PPR in Israel is generally based upon
immunohistochemistry (IHC; see Ref. 1) and PCR, combined. According to
the VSAH annual report, only if both tests are positive is the case
officially regarded as PPR. It will be interesting to note whether the
same policy is being maintained (no IHC mentioned in the above
notification).

A map showing the global PPR evolution between 2000 and early 2011 is
available on page 53 of OIE's last bulletin, available on-line at
