Surveys for Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus (the Cause of Rhizomania),
other Viruses, and Soil-borne Fungi Infecting Sugar Beet in Syria

Phytopathology and Applied Zoology, Justus-Liebig-University,

Production of sugar beet, the most important source of sugar in Syria, has
suffered, especially from diseases, but no surveys had been implemented for
diseases caused by viruses and soil-borne fungi.
In 1998, samples were collected from plants showing symptoms of virus
infection (yellowing, wilting, necrosis and mosaic). Root samples (341)
were collected from crops of autumn-sown seed from 115 localities in 7
provinces. 173 root samples from spring-sown crops and 39 leaf samples were
collected during both seasons. The samples were tested for the presence of
viruses by DAS- and TAS- ELISA, and for soil-borne fungi on Rose Bengal agar.
Based on tests, we report for the first time the presence of Beet necrotic
yellow vein benyvirus (BNYVV), Beet soil-borne pomovirus (BSBV), Beet
yellows closterovirus (BYV) and Beet mild yellowing polerovirus (BMYV) in
Syrian sugar beet fields. _Rhizoctonia_ sp. and _Fusarium_ sp. were also
widely distributed in the crop.

[Contrary to this report, BNYVV was first reported in Syria by ProMED-Plant
in January 2000. BNYVV and BSBMV are transmitted by the soilborne fungus
_Polymyxa beta_; BYV and BMYV are transmitted by several aphid species. Do
any of our subscribers have access to crop loss data in Syrian sugar beet
crops infected with these viruses? Moreover, what is known about the
effects of mixed infections of sugar beet by these viruses in Syria? The
same question can be asked regarding mixed fungal-virus combinations. - Mod.DH]
