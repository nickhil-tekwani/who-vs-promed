About 30 patients who were being cared [for] because of moderate gastroenteritis in La Union and Cartagena urgent healthcare centers had a common feature. In addition to their main complaint, all of them attended the well-known Minero bar in La Union.

Cultures yielded _Salmonella_, a microorganism which may contaminate food and leads to gastrointestinal symptoms in persons eating such food, one of the most common causes of foodborne illness.

With respect to affected persons, 4 persons who were hospitalized because of the severity of their symptoms have already been discharged from Santa Lucia health center. There were waiters and cooks from the Minero bar among them.

According to the same sources, there has not been a decree to close the bar, only a single order to close the kitchen. Last Friday morning [15 Jun 2012], the owner of the bar was informed that he should close the kitchen until it is disinfected and it is determined what foods were contaminated. Nonetheless, the place was closed a few hours later, and the owner put a sign on the door announcing it would re-open next Tuesday [19 Jun 2012].

The Minero bar in la Union is one of the most famous places in this community, and it serves the most common dishes representing the local cuisine. The bar was founded in the mid-20th century, and even today it is closely related to the Cante de las Minas Festival.

Carlos Javier-Martinez, spokesman of the municipality, expressed his wish that this episode not affect negatively "the image of the bar or of the municipality catering trade", pointing out that "this has been an isolated and unfortunate occurrence which may happen to any professional." Mr Martinez added that the bar and its owner "are well linked to La Union people, and soon everything will return to normal for them and his clients".

[No information is given in the posting regarding the serotype of _S. enterica_ involved or the food vehicle of transmission. That members of the staff of the facility were also ill at the same time suggests that these individuals ingested the vehicle as well although it is possible that a food worker was the initial source.
