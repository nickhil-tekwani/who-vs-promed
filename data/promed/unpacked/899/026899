The BBC reports 15 new outbreaks today, bringing the total to 96, including
sheep and cattle in North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Berkshire.
This reporting occurs amid continuing confusion over reporting of number
and location of outbreaks.
MAFF reported only 11 new outbreaks today and total of 92 (including one in
N. Ireland): Cumbria (2 cases), North Yorkshire, Derbyshire, West
Yorkshire, Dumfries & Galloway, Worcestershire, Berkshire, County Durham,
and Dumfries & Galloway.
