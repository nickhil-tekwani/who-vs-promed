Comment on Sources of Infection
-----------------------------
I would like to elaborate on and clarify somewhat the comment made on the
likely sources of infection for domestic pigs. While rats and mice can be
a source, there are other important potential sources: cannibalism among
the herd; [consumption of meat in unboiled garbage; and scavenging on wild
animal reservoirs. All of these have been identified in other
outbreaks. Without a careful epidemiological study of the specific
outbreak, it is not possible to incriminate a specific source.
I hope this comment will help to inform others of the multiple risk factors
in pig infections, all of which must be considered in control efforts.
