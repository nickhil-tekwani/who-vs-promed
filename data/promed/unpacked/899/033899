In the last 5 months, Rio Grande do Sul [state] registered reports of
21 suspected cases of yellow fever [YF]. According to the Secretariat
of Health of Rio Grande do Sul, 13 were confirmed, with 6 resulting
in death. The state had recorded no cases of death by yellow fever in 42 years.

Only last Tuesday (31 [Mar 2009]), 5 cases were confirmed. According
the Director of the State Center for Health Surveillance, Francisco
Paz, one person died and another remains hospitalized. Also, [YF
virus deaths] in 1287 animals [presumably monkeys. - Mod.TY] in 110
municipalities were recorded.

The director said that 182 municipalities in the state are considered
areas of risk, totaling more than 2.5 million inhabitants. According
to him, the Vale do Rio Pardo, 155 km [96 mi] from Porto Alegre, is
the most critical area.

"We found that the movement [of the] virus has gone from a west to
east direction, with a monthly average speed of 100 km (62 mi]. In 5
months, the virus expanded its area of circulation close to 500 km
[311 mi], said Paz.

Rio Grande do Sul will expand the vaccination [coverage] for yellow
fever. According to the Secretariat, this week the state received 1
million doses of vaccine against the disease. Every resident of the
area of risk aged over 9 months who has not been vaccinated in the
last 10 years should be immunized.

People wishing to travel to Rio Grande do Sul should also be
vaccinated at least 10 days before arriving in the state. A
vaccination is valid for 10 years and is free.

In Sao Paulo state, 8 deaths from yellow fever have been recorded
this year (2009). In the region of Botucatu, 18 cases of the disease
were observed. The State Secretariat of Health considers 20
municipalities close to this city, which is 238 km [148 mi] from the
Sao Paul capital, to be a risk area.

People traveling to these municipalities or rural areas, especially
over the Easter holiday, should seek a health center to be vaccinated
at least 10 days before [traveling], the agency recommends. A
vaccination is valid for 10 years and is free.

[Apparently, all these cases have been infected by YF virus in its
sylvan [jungle] cycle of transmission. The concern is that the sylvan
cycle might spill over into an urban transmission cycle if there are
sufficient non-immunized individuals in the population.
