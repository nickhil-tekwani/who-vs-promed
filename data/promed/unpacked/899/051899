The authorities of Dinajpur Medical College Hospital [DjMCH, Rangpur division] vacated the surgery ward and suspended the functioning of operating rooms for 72 hours, following the detection of 2 tetanus patients there on [Tue 29 Sep 2015], said Dr Partha Sharathi Roy, in charge of the ward.

[The patients] of Sundarpur village under Kaharol upazila [Dinajpur district] -- underwent surgery at the hospital on [15 Sep 2015]. A tumor was removed from the back of [patient 1] while a hernia operation was conducted on [patient 2], said the doctors.

"After the surgeries, the 2 patients left hospital for home. They came to the hospital again on [27 Sep 2015] to get their stitches removed. On suspicion, doctors conducted a thorough check up on [Tue 29 Sep 2015] and found that they were infected with tetanus," Dr Partha said.

The 2 tetanus infected patients were sent to Dinajpur General Hospital as DjMCH does not have any quarantine facility, said Mohammad Ali, assistant director of DjMCH. The DjMCH authority suspended all kinds of operations for next 72 hours and vacated the surgery ward to prevent highly risky tetanus infection.

During a visit to the hospital on [30 Sep 2015], the correspondent found patients of the surgery ward were lying on the floor of the corridor. The patients will be shifted to their ward within 72 hours, said Masud Rana, ward master.

Emdadul Haque, deputy civil surgeon of Dinajpur General Hospital, said, "The 2 tetanus patients are being treated here in quarantine. There is no need to panic." Doctors, however, said fatality rate among tetanus patients is high.

[Quarantining patients with tetanus is totally inappropriate as the infection does not spread from person to person. It is acquired from the introduction of _Clostridium tetani_ bacterial spores from the environment, usually from trauma causing some devitalization of tissue or from a puncture wound. The spores germinate in the local anaerobic environment of the trauma site, producing the vegetative bacterial forms that produce the potent neurotoxin.

There are several other issues here:
1. Immunization with tetanus toxoid would have prevented the disease from occurring.
2. Adequate autoclaving of surgical instruments and supplies kills tetanus spores.
3. Proper surgical technique should have prevented the conditions needed for spore germination. - Mod.LL
