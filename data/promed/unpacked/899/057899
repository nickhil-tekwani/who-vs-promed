Flamingos at risk from deadly avian disease
-------------------------------------------
Nature lovers are being asked to look out for sick birds after a
frail flamingo was captured last year [2009] with signs of a deadly
avian disease.

Avian botulism -- which causes paralysis and often death in birds --
could potentially wipe out the islands' much loved water-based
wildlife. Herons, pelicans, flamingos and terns are among the species
at risk from the fatal illness. Scientists have confirmed that the
TCI's wetlands could easily support the growth of the avian botulism,
but apart from the solitary flamingo they have not yet found any
clear signs of sickness among local birds.

Concerns were 1st raised in December [2009] when an anxious citizen
captured a fragile flamingo and took it to the Turks and Caicos
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (TCSPCA)'s Doctor of
Veterinary Medicine (DVM) for diagnosis. The vet noticed some
possible signs of avian botulism and decided that a thorough
examination of the species' habitat was essential. The Department of
Environment and Coastal Resources (DECR) immediately visited wetlands
in North and Middle Caicos and in Providenciales where the birds
spend their day time foraging. There they conducted on-site
measurements of various environmental parameters believed to
influence the outbreak of the disease.

Preliminary results indicated that the water temperature water, pH,
salinity and other factors were favourable for the growth of
Clostridium botulinum - the bacterium that causes avian botulism.
However the team did not spot any bird that showed symptoms of avian
botulism nor any carcasses.

Despite the apparent absence of the disease the DECR continues to be
cautious, and members are currently undertaking a number of
precautions to decrease the likelihood of outbreaks. Among these
safety measures are the prompt removal of dead animals from wetlands,
reduction of decaying matter in the areas and the prevention of sharp
water draw downs that could kill fish and aquatic invertebrates. All
these actions could help to decrease the build-up of toxin-laden
maggots and rapid growth of botulism spores.

Clostridium botulinum can be found in the tissues of most wetland
inhabitants, including aquatic insects, mollusks, and crustacean and
many vertebrates, including healthy birds. Botulinum toxin is
produced only after the spores germinate, when the organism is
actively growing and multiplying. The spores are resistant to heating
and drying and can remain viable for years. Many species of birds and
some mammals are affected by type C botulism. In the wild, water
birds suffer the greatest losses, but almost all birds are
susceptible. Filter-feeding and dabbling waterfowl and probing
shoreline birds appear to be among the species at greatest risk.

In the Turks and Caicos Islands, there are many water birds that are
at risk from the disease including the Greater Flamingo, Brown
Pelican, Tricolored Heron, Reddish Egret, West Indian Whistling-Duck,
Clapper Rail, Sora, Least Grebes and the Moorhen.

The public is asked to notify the DECR of any sightings of seemingly
sick birds or abnormal behaviour from water birds.

[This may be premature, but one must remember that absence of proof
is not proof of absence. As and when our members are holidaying on
the islands, they might want to keep an eye open just in case. I can
find no ProMED reports of this condition in the Caribbean. - Mod.MHJ]
