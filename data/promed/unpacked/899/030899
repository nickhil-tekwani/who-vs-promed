[When biting flies get involved they are very clever in finding livestock that should have been vaccinated. And this can continue until the first frost. Fortunately, tabanid flies have difficulty in seeing sheep & goats. Tabanids are visually acute but they are looking for black-body mass and a sniff of carbon dioxide. I remember in the 2001 epidemic in West Texas that killed hundreds of whitetail deer; a flock of Boer goats right in the middle went unscathed. - Mod.MHJ]
