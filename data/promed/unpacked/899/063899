According to a member of the Ugandan parliament, at least 5,000 persons have
been infected with typanosomiasis in the northwestern section of the
country. The official, Obiga Kania, from the Arua District said overgrown
grass in the bed of the Inyau River had become a breeding site for the
disease's vector - tsetse flies. Kania also said that the only medical
treatment being provided is from Medecins sans Frontiere.
Local media said this is the first report in recent years of the disease
(sleeping sickness) in Uganda.
