Trout May Get Boost From Expatriates
--------------
Scientists may be able to partly contain whirling disease, introduced
to the United States by fish imported from Europe, with the help of a
disease-resistant American trout that has dwelled on the continent for
a century.
"We have been looking very hard in North America for whirling
disease-resistant trout and haven't found any. We have found a fish
that was moved to Germany from the US in 1880 or 1890 that is very
promising," said epidemiology professor Ronald Hedrick of the
University of California-Davis, perhaps the leading US authority on
the disease.
Hedrick and his research associate, fish biologist Mansour El-Matbouli
of the University of Munich, said the trout in question was imported
into Germany 120 or so years ago. Their report on El-Matbouli's
findings was recently presented to the Eighth Whirling Disease
Symposium.
"Development of this resistance is presumed to be the result of their
growth and reproduction under conditions of continuous exposure to the
parasite as the hatcheries use river water and mud-bottomed rearing
ponds," El-Matbouli said.
After the resistance was discovered, El-Matbouli exposed the trout to
whirling disease. The trout seemed to be able to survive the disease
as well as brown trout, long known to be generally resistant.
It wouldn't be the first time an expatriate had come to the aid of an
industry: The same thing happened with the French vineyards in the
1870s when French vines were grafted onto American roots resistant to
_Phylloxera_, which was ravaging the industry.
The disease has devastated some of the top rainbow trout streams in
the West, and its presence has been confirmed in 22 states. Colorado
has been one of the hardest-hit states. "Some of our fisheries are
pretty much exclusively brown trout now,'' Walker said.
Hedrick said it is likely to be 4 years before any German trout are
placed in U.S. waters, and several issues remain to be resolved.
Biologists need to make sure, as best they can, whether imported fish
might bring other diseases. "They probably would not be considered at
all in some areas,'' Hedrick said, referring to rivers where the trout
could endanger other native fish.
Walker said there will be controversy over introducing hatchery fish
in wild areas. Some scientists have expressed concern about how the
transplanting of the German fish could affect the gene pool of native
trout. "We'd hate to lose those traditional fish but whirling disease
has whacked them and there are few left,'' Walker said. In trout
fisheries created by humans, this would be less of an issue.
