As excessive levels of radioactive cesium have been detected in beef
cattle shipped from near the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, the
Fukushima prefectural government is considering asking livestock
farmers to voluntarily stop shipping cows, officials said Saturday [9
Jul 2011].

The request would apply to cattle in areas that have been designated
as "emergency evacuation preparation zones," which lie mostly between
12.42 [20 km] and 18.64 miles [30 km] from the nuclear plant.

Radioactive cesium exceeding government-set limits was detected in 11
cows shipped in May and June [2011] from a part of Minami-Soma,
Fukushima Prefecture, which is located within one of the emergency
evacuation preparation zones. All 11 cows were shipped by the same
farmer.

According to the prefectural government, a total of 2924 beef cattle
have been shipped from the designated areas since late April [2011].

The prefectural government has already asked the Minami-Soma
municipal government to voluntarily refrain from shipping beef cattle,
and the prefectural government is now considering asking livestock
farmers to refrain voluntarily from shipping beef cattle from anywhere
in the designated zones.

The prefectural government will make its decision after holding
discussions with livestock farmer associations.

According to prefectural government officials and other sources,
about 5700 beef cattle were being raised in the zones, which include
parts of Minami-Soma and Tamura, before the 1st accident at the
nuclear power plant occurred.

Cattle shipments from the zones were temporarily suspended after the
nuclear accident, but in late April [2011] the Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries Ministry said shipments could resume if the prefectural
government took certain safety steps, such as inspecting the surface
of the cattle bodies.

Of the 11 cattle that contained excessive levels of cesium, 6 were
shipped in May and June [2011], meaning they likely passed the
prefectural government's inspections.

The slaughterhouse in Tokyo where those 6 cattle were butchered also
tests some meat for radioactive substances, but not all.

According to the Tokyo metropolitan government's food standards
section, the 6 cattle were sold at a market held on the premises of
the slaughterhouse.

The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry and the metropolitan
government are investigating the subsequent distribution routes of the
meat.

University of Tokyo Prof Noboru Manabe, an expert on livestock
science, said eating beef containing radioactive cesium beyond the
regulated maximum would not damage a person's health.

"However, if beef like that can be distributed on the market, it can
damage people's trust in the meat industry as a whole. I think it's
necessary (for the government) to test all cattle suspected to have
been irradiated," Manabe said.

Straw fed to cattle at a farm in Minamisoma, Fukushima Prefecture,
was found to have high levels of radioactive cesium, local officials
said Monday [11 Jul 2011].

The Fukushima Prefectural Government took feed and water samples from
the farm Sunday [10 Jul 2011] after radioactive cesium was found in
the meat of 11 cows shipped from there to Tokyo for processing.

More than 10 000 becquerels [unit of radioactivity] per kg of cesium
were detected in the straw that had been placed in an unroofed area of
the farm when the earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima No. 1
nuclear power plant on 11 Mar 2011, they said.

Up to 3200 becquerels per kg of radioactive cesium were detected in
the meat, or up to 6 times higher than the provisional ceiling of 500
becquerels per kg. The contaminated beef did not reach retailers, the
officials said.

No radioactive substances, however, were detected on the cow
carcasses at the time of shipment, the prefecture said.

In the voluntary inspection, local government officials took samples
of feed and straw from the farm and well water given to the cows to
determine how the cows were exposed to radioactive substances.

The officials took about 2 hours to inspect the cattle shed and the
well and to ask the farm operator how the cows are managed and the
type and amount of feed they are given.

"I'm sure consumers are also anxious, so we hope the prefecture will
identify the cause," a family member of the farm's operator said after
Sunday's inspection.

Minamisoma is near the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, which has
been releasing radioactive materials since it was crippled by the 11
Mar 2011 tsunami.

According to the prefectural government, the farm fed the cows with a
livestock feed blend made outside the prefecture, while the water was
from the well.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government said Saturday [8 Jul 2011] that
high levels of radioactive cesium had been detected in meat from 10
cows shipped to a meat-packing plant in Tokyo from Minamisoma, a day
after it announced that a similarly excessive level had been found in
the meat of 1 of 11 cows shipped to the capital from the northeastern
city.

The Fukushima Prefectural Government asked Minamisoma on Saturday [9
Jul 2011] to voluntarily refrain from shipping beef cattle from all
areas of the city.

In addition to the 11 cows, a total of 6 cows from the farm in
Minamisoma were shipped to meat-processing plants in Tokyo and Tochigi
Prefecture in May and June, according to related local governments.

Although meat from the 11 cows has not been distributed, meat from
the 6 cows -- 5 shipped to Tokyo and 1 to Tochigi -- has been
processed and may have reached the market, prompting local authorities
to check where the meat was distributed.

[Both of these articles indicate that there was a level of radiation
in the meat of 6 bovine carcasses.

The government is moving to protect the health of the public. It has
a regulatory limit set. However, the cattle appeared healthy and
likely passed some sort of ante mortem inspection.

What is unclear is if this was cesium 134 or cesium 137. Cesium 134
has a very short half life and will reach lower levels quickly. Cesium
137 has a half life of about 30 years. While it is not specified it
could be a mixture of cesium 134 and 137.

Cesium functions a bit like potassium in the body. It is readily
absorbed and distributed in the body. The point is, this is not a body
surface contamination.

However, lets look at the level. The level found is a very low level
and is a regulatory limit, not necessarily a level that will cause
harm to the animals or to people that may consume the muscle.
Furthermore, the level will come down if the exposure stops. If the
feed stuffs are contaminated, it will cause the level to remain, and
depending upon the level in the feed stuffs, possibly rise.

Therefore the government, while seeking to keep the people safe, is
causing distress to the cattle operators as their cattle feed is
contaminated, and they apparently have no way to move the cattle. Not
selling the cattle and having to provide a non contaminated food stuff
is costing the producer extra money. So the government is seemingly
not helping the producer. (These articles are not clear on what
assistance the producers may be receiving.)

The levels mentioned above will not have any biological effect on the
animal or the consumer. There is some experience at this level as
these cesiums were associated with the Chernobyl event [April 1986],
which has some strong similarities, and there were no biological
effects. Likewise there was some extended long range evaluations done
from a Scandinavian situation.

The one issue that may bear watching is the level of radiation in the
milk. Milk may also be above the regulatory limits that have been set.
Remember, regulatory limits on meat/milk do not necessarily mean
harmful levels to the animal or the consumer.

So while we do not know what type of cesium is present, we do know
the levels as listed above are very low. While these levels may be
above regulatory limits, they are not biologically harmful. - Mod.TG]
