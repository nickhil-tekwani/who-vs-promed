["Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses are mosquitoborne pathogens that can cause nonspecific illnesses and encephalitis in equids (horses, mules, burros, donkeys and zebras) and humans in the Americas. Some of these viruses also affect birds and occasionally other mammals. No specific treatment is available, and depending on the virus, host and form of the disease, the case fatality rate may be as high as 90 per cent. Epidemic VEE viruses are also potential bioterrorist weapons.

"Until recently, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV) contained 4 genetic lineages. Lineage I was considered to be the North American variant of EEEV, while lineages II, III and IV were the South American variants. The latter 3 lineages have now become a new viral species, Madariaga virus. Unless otherwise specified, "EEEV" in this factsheet refers to all viruses formerly classified under this name, rather than lineage I viruses alone. The North American EEEV seems to be more virulent than Madariaga virus in people, and under some conditions, it is also more pathogenic in experimentally infected nonhuman primates (e.g., marmosets), sparrows and rodents. Comparative studies in horses have not been published, but severe illness has been reported in this species in both North and South America."
