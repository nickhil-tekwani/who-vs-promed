Another 3 head of cattle have died of anthrax in NSW's Upper Hunter
region, but authorities are still confident the outbreak is under
control. The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says the deaths
were on one of 8 properties already under quarantine at Rouchel, near
Scone, and followed 2 days without any stock losses. There have now
been 35 anthrax related cattle deaths. "We went for 48 hours without
a single mortality, and then recently we've had 3 deaths on one
property," DPI spokesman Brett Fifield told AAP. "[But] we fully
expect that we will see a plateauing off of mortality. When it comes
to the disease control, the deaths slow down and become infrequent
and not as many in number, and that's what we've seen at Scone." Mr
Fifield said the cattle were found today [31 Dec 2007], and cattle
infected with the anthrax bacteria died very quickly.

The DPI remained confident the outbreak had been contained. "Other
properties nearby may come up, but as long as we keep it at a nearby
location, we'll be happy," Mr Fifield said.

The 8 quarantined properties range from large holdings with up to 500
head of stock to smaller farms with less than 30.

The outbreak is thought to be a result of driving rain which hit the
region earlier this month [December 2007], exposing naturally
occurring anthrax spores, which can remain dormant in the soil for
decades.

According to the DPI, NSW experiences between 4 and 6 anthrax
outbreaks a year, however they usually occur in a known "anthrax
belt" in the state's west.

[The last Australian report, also dated 31 Dec 2007, had 9 properties
affected. The present total of 8 is either a journalistic error, or
one or more deaths on investigation turned out to be something else,
not anthrax. Both happen.

Ascribing this series of outbreaks to "driving rain" exposing viable
spores raises the question that, if this disease is in a new area, do
they have any evidence to confirm that past unreported/unrecorded
outbreaks have occurred on the index farm, and, if so, when? One
should remember that if every historic anthrax-cattle grave contained
viable spores, we would be vaccinating virtually every cow in every
country every year because of the cumulative incidence of this
disease worldwide. But the reality is very much the reverse. Spore
positive graves are the exception not the rule. If there is the
interest, it is worth soil sampling any known grave sites on this
farm.

It is always useful to do genomic analyses with any anthrax outbreak
but especially when in "new" areas. It makes tracing very much
easier. In the past, Australia obtained bone meal from
Tanganika/Tanzania and India, and the recent outbreaks in Victoria
and Queensland, etc., have been genetically typed.

Rain exposing spores is easier said than being a confirmed and
reliable explanation, and is often invoked when hard data is absent
and only speculation is available. There is a long history of rain
being followed by anthrax outbreaks. But the actual mechanism(s)
involved remain obscure. Some years ago, we investigated a series of
5 deaths in different pastures on one ranch in Coahila [Mexico]. This ranch
had a history of the disease. During the summer, these pastures had
had mesquite scrub bull-dozed to allow more grass to grow. But that
was in a drought, and no grass grew until rains began again to fall
in October, soon followed by these 5 deaths. We hypothesized that the
scrub clearing tore up the soil, exposing spores, which were then
included in the new grass root mat when the grazing responded to the
rains. There had been a similar situation in southern
Manitoba-northern Minnesota [USA] when the local ranchers disc-ploughed
some overgrown weed-choked pastures.

While I am sympathetic to explanations involving "washouts" of old
cattle graves and soil deposition on meadows downstream, similar to
what happened in Victoria in '93, the commonest event is earth moving
with heavy equipment, as in trenching, bull-dozing, ditch clearing,
and clearing clogged waterways downstream of tanneries and mills. -
