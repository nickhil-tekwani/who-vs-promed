A dozen high school students in Thailand were hospitalized after a
classmate sprinkled their instant noodles with insecticide as a prank.
Officials at the Pittayakom School in Hat Yai, 580 miles south of Bangkok,
said that [the student] decided Friday to sprinkle some insecticide on the
noodles, expecting his classmates to fall dizzy. Instead, they became
violently ill and had to be treated at an emergency room and have their
stomachs pumped. All but one had been released as of Monday.
