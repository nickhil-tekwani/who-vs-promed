The Los Lagos region has registered 2 possible cases of hantavirus [infections] recently, 1 in Muermos and the other in Futaleufú.

The 1st [case] concerns a 34-year-old agricultural female worker who was in the intensive care unit of the Puerto Montt hospital on mechanically assisted respiration. Due to her serious condition, she was transported yesterday [Wed 11 Jan 2017] by helicopter to Concepción.

The 2nd suspected case is a 3-year-old boy who was taken to the emergency health services in Futaleufú. It was decided to take him to the hospital in Esquel (Argentina) thinking that he had appendicitis. He was placed under observation and was diagnosed of meningitis. Later his condition worsened and was moved to the Puerto Montt hospital via helicopter. There, they did a rapid test for hantavirus [infection] and now the child has clinical symptoms of acute pneumonia [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome? - Mod.TY]. [It was decided that ] he should be moved again, this time to the Roberto del Río Children's Hospital in Santiago, where he is in serious but stable condition.

According to the press report in the Diario el Llanquihue, both cases were positive by the hantavirus rapid test and confirmation by laboratory tests is awaited.

[The circumstances under which these 2 individuals may have contracted their infections are not reported. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
