A man is being treated for inhalation of anthrax in intensive care at
Homerton Hospital after contracting the rare illness from making
drums from animal skins.

Health chiefs insist that terrorism is not involved and that there is
no risk to the public.

The man who is believed to be a Spanish musician is said to be
'critical but stable' and has been at the hospital for a week.

[Our thanks to Bengu for his informed confirmation on Monday (27 Oct
2008) and his follow up on 28 Oct 2008 with the link to this local
report. The patient is a musician who made drums using imported
animal skins. Hackney is a London borough in the east of London, and
possibly where he was living. - Mod.MHJ]

I am now chief advisor to the CEO at the Health Protection Agency and
I am dealing with the incident as Director on Call.

All the details of the case are on the HPA [Health Protection Agency]
website and we were amused to find that PROMED-mail did not put it up
until it had been confirmed by the media. This to me seems the wrong
way round. It is a confirmed case related to drum making using
imported animal skins but it did give us a fright when we first heard
about it on Friday [24 Oct 2008]. We posted a press statement on our
website on Saturday morning [25 Oct 2008] and sent it to the Press
Association for onward distribution to the media. We were also
surprised that the media were not interested and so far we have only
had enquiries from the local newspaper [see above].

[And our thanks to Nigel -- my students are convinced I know
everybody. It's not quite true.

Some background: Here at ProMED we are a significant target for those
putting out disinformation, quite apart from routine misinformation.
It is not infrequent. This report arrived with us promptly on Sat
25th Oct 2008, but without any echoes. The London press was silent as
was the BBC. The sophistication of phishing scams is so high these
days it just seemed too good a report and thus a possible hoax, and I
hadn't twigged that this Nigel was that 'Nigel' of the press release.
Plus the latter was a Professor! I could not get into my office to
post it until after Mass on Sunday morning, 26 Oct 2008, as the
campus was shut down all Saturday because of the football game -- we
lost embarrassingly badly to Georgia. After rechecking the London
Sunday newspapers, still silent, I posted the report with the
cautionary comment. In the meanwhile we were contacting many in
southern England who might know for confirmation.

We cannot say we never make mistakes but we try to keep it to a
minimum. - Mod.MHJ]
