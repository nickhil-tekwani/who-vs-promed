I would like to point out _Anaplasma marginale_ is not a blood parasite,
but an ehrlichial pathogen and thus a bacterial organism. _Ehrlichia_
(genus _Ehrlichieae_, family _Rickettsiaceae_, order _Rickettsiales_) have
been classified into three genogroups based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis.
_A. marginale_ clusters in one genogroup with _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_
(which is now considered to be the same as _Ehrlichia equi_ and the unnamed
agent of the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and _Ehrlichia platys_.
