Hong Kong (HKSAR) - The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for Hong Kong West Cluster (HKWC) made the following response to a case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) announced by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [20 Jul 2017]:

The male patient has been successively hospitalised in Grantham Hospital (GH) and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) since [10 May 2017]. On [6 Jul 2017], he developed JE symptoms at GH. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was conducted on [11 Jul 2017] and the diagnosis was confirmed today [20 Jul 2017].

The patient is now receiving treatment at QMH in critical condition.

The clinical teams have communicated with the patient's relatives to explain the diagnosis and will continue to provide appropriate treatment to the patient.

Regular mosquito preventive measures are implemented at HKWC according to the established guidelines of Hospital Authority. Since May 2017, the measures have been stepped up in the cluster. In response to this reported case, QMH and GH have further enhanced the frequency of anti-mosquito measures.

HKWC will facilitate the investigation of CHP to identify the source of infection as well as implementing any related measures.

[A 20 Jul 2017 report in RTHK (http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1343368-20170720.htm) indicated that the Centre for Health Protection has reported its 3rd case of Japanese encephalitis this year (2017), in a 52-year-old man, so clearly this is a different one from the case previously posted (Japanese encephalitis - China (HK) 20170701.5143730).

As noted earlier, Hong Kong is entering the JE virus transmission season. There have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong in past years. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

A JEV vaccine is available in China, but there is a question concerning justification of massive campaigns in Hong Kong where clinical cases are very few. However, it does seem curious that no recommendation is given for vaccination of travelers going to areas of active JE virus transmission outside of Hong Kong.
