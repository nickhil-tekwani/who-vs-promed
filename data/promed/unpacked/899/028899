Two animals in a herd of 30 Aberdeen Angus cattle were found dead
from anthrax, with blood extravasation from the body orifices. The
herd is in the Olavarria Partido [district], Province of Buenos
Aires, zona Pourtale. Anthrax had been seen in this zone in 1969.

The herd had not been vaccinated prior to this outbreak. The weather
has been very dry and there is therefore little grazing. There are no
human cases associated with this outbreak. The Veterinary Services
dealt with the carcasses in the standard way with 5 percent
formaldehyde, covering it with lime over which a thick plastic
tarpaulin has been placed and weighted down awaiting the carcass's
decomposition.

[It is mid-winter in Argentina and so anthrax should be infrequent.
Presumably these animals got infected as a result of ingesting
contaminated soil from an old and forgotten anthrax grave in the
pasture. I would expect that some 10 days before there had been a
short shower of rain with a resulting spurt of grazing growth in a
low lying area where the rainwater would have collected and stayed
longer than elsewhere in the field. Or the farm manager might have
been putting in new water lines to field water-troughs and gone
through an old grave, which became dangerous when the grazing grew up
and attracted animals to the site.

It is hard to persuade 'estancieros' (farmers) to maintain annual
vaccination in the face of a 40-year absence of outbreaks. But it is
vital to have the herd now vaccinated for at least 3 years and to
ensure that the carcass sites are thoroughly decontaminated. The
Argentine method of leaving the carcass to rot under a pile of lime
seems to be effective especially if it were chlorinated lime. The
bones are removed some 9 months later and the site checked.

Our thanks to Ramon for this report. - Mod.MHJ
