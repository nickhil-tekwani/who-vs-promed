3 more typhoid cases have been reported in the Western and Northern
divisions, says Public Health director Doctor Timaima Tuiketei. She said
the number rose to 42 cases since January 2005.
"There were 2 cases from the west and one from the north and the medical
officers have been vigilant on those coming in with symptoms," she
said. Last month [April 2005], there were 39 confirmed cases and the
public was warned against the fever.
Health Ministry chief executive Doctor Lepani Waqatakirewa said most of
those confirmed with typhoid had been successfully treated while others
were still being monitored. He said the main areas which reported cases of
typhoid were Lami, Vatuwaqa, Samabula, Ovalau and Koro in Lomaiviti,
Naweni, Rabi, Batiri and some areas in Macuata.
"The Central, Eastern and Northern outbreak response teams have worked
meticulously to conduct field investigations, case diagnosis and conducted
community mobilisation and awareness prevention campaign programs," he said.
Typhoid is a life-threatening illness that is caused by the bacteria
Salmonella. Those with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their blood
stream and intestinal tract and can spread the infection directly to other
people through contaminated food and drinking water.
Last month, a man suffering from typhoid died at the Colonial War Memorial
Hospital. It was the 1st fatal case, and the man (who lived in Suva)
visited the hospital's outpatient department complaining of vomiting. He
was treated by a medical officer, given medication and told to go home and
rest. He returned a few days later vomiting blood and was admitted but
nothing could be done to save him.
The public have been advised to properly dispose human waste and feces,
wash their hands with soap after using the toilet, provide safe water
supply and drink cooled boiled water, eat properly cooked food and protect
food from contamination by flies and wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly
before eating.
People who have been clinically suspected to have typhoid should not
prepare or handle food. They should always wash their hands with soap and
water after using the toilet and return to the doctor immediately when
asked to come for a follow-up.
People who have been confirmed with typhoid must complete their treatment
even though they might feel better and return for regular follow-up check
with their doctor when requested.

[This is a relatively small extension of the outbreak in Fiji. Typhoid
fever can be acquired only from a human source, and it is unknown whether
the source of infection in these recent cases was from fecal contamination
from patients with clinically apparent disease or from asymptomatic
carriers. The best answer to preventing typhoid fever is adequate hygiene
and adequate sanitation. - Mod.DK]
