Mushroom poisoning, Voronezh region, Russia
-----------------------------------------------
Since the end of June 2005, 19 people, including 3 children, have suffered
from mushroom poisoning in Voronezh and in other parts of the Voronezh
region, the Territorial Management of the Russian Consumer Supervision for
the Voronezh region stated.
Cases of mushroom poisoning have been registered in Voronezh (10 people)
and in 6 districts of the region (Anninskiy, Borysoglebskiy, Kashyrskiy,
Novokhoperskiy, Novousmanskiy, and Ternovskiy).
An inhabitant of Voronezh, who used the unknown mushrooms in food, has
died. As has been noted in the press services of the Territorial Management
of the Russian Consumer Supervision, the victims collected russulas, which
look like fairy-mushrooms.

[The articles here indicate that poisoning by mushrooms is on the rise. But
the articles do not tell us much about clinical signs or the mushrooms
themselves.
In the United States, fairy mushrooms are generally regarded as toxic.
However, that is a common name not a scientific name. It is difficult to
know what species of mushrooms are being discussed when common names are
used. In one part of the country or the world, the term fairy mushroom may
not be associated with poisoning, while in other regions it may be. It is
always best, if possible, to know the scientific name to avoid confusion. -
