Fears over new cow brain disease
--------------------------------
Scientists are concerned at the potential threat to humans from a mysterious
brain condition that paralysed and killed a young cow. Tests for various
known bovine diseases have all proved negative.
The Veterinary Laboratories Agency [VLA] is now trying to pin down the cause
of the disease, which has been described as a type of cattle poliomyelitis.
At present there is no evidence to suggest a risk to humans, but scientists
are not ruling it out. It is thought that the brain disease vCJD originally
passed to humans from cows infected with the closely-related condition BSE.
Analysis of this cow's brain showed that the disease affected the white
matter. This led to paralysis for 5 to 6 days, followed by death.
A spokesman from the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra)
said the case was being carefully investigated. He said: "The Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA) have recorded possibly a new condition in cattle in
the UK. "In layman's terms, a type of cattle polio was identified which we
haven't seen before."
The animal was tested for a battery of diseases, including louping-ill, a
virus which causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and is
transmitted by ticks; West Nile disease, a virus spread via mosquito which
has not yet come to the UK; and bovine herpes 1. However, all 3 results
were negative. [West Nile virus has never been recorded from cows, except in
a notorious ProMED post in which I picked up a Connecticut USA news report
where the word "cows" turned out to be their misprint for crows! - Mod.JW]
The location of the farm where the cow died has not been released [nor the
actual date of death, apparently. - Mod.JW], but no meat from the animal has
been allowed into the food chain.
10 cattle in contact with the stricken heifer were also tested for louping-
ill and found to be negative. All 10 remain in good health.
The Defra spokesman said it was too soon to speculate as to the knock-on
effect of this as-yet undefined condition. He said: "The long-term risk to
public health is not known. It is impossible to make an assessment from a
single case where the agent responsible is not known. Further investigations
are ongoing."
The latest information on the case will be set out in the Veterinary Record,
the veterinary industry's magazine. Details of the cow's condition were
brought to the attention of the UK Zoonoses Group at a meeting in April 2004.
The group discusses those diseases and infections which can be transmitted
between animal and man.

[This news item, related to the investigation of a single dead heifer, is a
clear reflection of the increased transparency in relation to disease-related
information, a significant outcome of the BSE history.
The information available at this stage is very limited; one may assume that
the clinical observations (seen when?), combined with histopathological
findings, may have led the investigators to suspect an infectious, probably
viral disease, causing inflammatory changes. It may be also assumed that
spongiform CNS changes have been ruled out. Including louping-ill and West
Nile virus (WNV), both arthropod-borne flaviviruses, in the differential
diagnosis short-list may reflect their concern on possible human health
hazard -- hopefully to be ruled out, the sooner the better. The Flaviviridae
family includes several zoonotic viruses, such as Tick-borne encephalitis
(TBE), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and the
Alkhurma virus, as well as dengue and yellow fever.
More details on the clinical symptoms and their duration, as well as on the
histopathological findings in the various parts of the CNS and neuromuscular
system, could be helpful. We wish the VLA success in their endeavors to
achieve an early identification of the etiological agent. - Mod.AS]
[Perhaps someone could check the Veterinary Record article -- when it
appears -- for those details & let us know? There is anecdotal evidence for
an outbreak in cattle of polio-like disease in the USA 30 or 40 years ago --
does anyone recollect? - Mod.JW]
