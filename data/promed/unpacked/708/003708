Regarding this outbreak, the rancher had one cow die approximately
28-30 Aug 2005, followed by 8 more on 4-5 Sep. At that time he moved
the cows to a different pasture; all were okay until 10 Sep, then
started losing more cows. All said, 37 cows dead (no calves).
The pasture the cows were in initially was pretty well grubbed down.
The owner indicated he had probably left them in a week or 2 too
long. Also, some pretty nasty, stagnant water in the "creek" -- a
very alkaline area.
Initial source of infection -- not sure. Would think either along
the stream or soil in the pasture, with the cows inhaling/ingesting
spores on the short pasture.
I think perhaps the 1st dead cow may have served as a point source
for at least the next wave of deaths.

[I have seen this before where the primary case sets off a chain of
cases, each link about an incubation period apart. It comes about
through the animals being attracted to the extravasated fluids, which
contain salt; plus curiosity of course. There could be several very
speculative reasons for only the adult cows being affected; if they
were fitter than their mothers, they would need a higher infective
dose; if they grazed less, there would be less chance of exposure,
ingesting less contaminated soil; if frightened of the carcasses,
they would have less chance of exposure. In general, young stock have
much lower attack rates than adult cattle. Because there are as yet
no reports of cases on adjoining ranches, one must assume that the
index case got infected from ingesting spores somewhere near the
creek, where an anthrax-infected cow might have been buried in the
past. Spores survive best in moist, alkaline soil. Unless one is
frankly lucky (with ranch histories, rancher memories) it is
sometimes difficult to determine the "whys."
