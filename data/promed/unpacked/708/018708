In July 2020, 117 cases of rabies in animals were recorded, according to the [Russian] Federal State Budgetary Institution, the Rosselkhoznadzor publication Veterinary and Life reported. This compares with 77 sick animals identified in June. In July, the largest number of cases of rabies was noted in the Yaroslavl, Saratov, Penza, Ryazan, Chelyabinsk, Vladimir, Samara, and Kaluga regions.

Among wild carnivores, 61 cases of rabies were identified in July. The largest number of infected [wild carnivores], foxes, is 39, as well as 13 raccoon dogs and 4 badgers. One case of infection was recorded in the populations of [each] wild boars, wolves, raccoons, moles, and martens. In addition, 52 cases of infection with the virus in cats and dogs have been reported. Among cattle and small ruminants, 4 cases of rabies were recorded in July.

It should be noted that in Moscow, 3 settlements are closed due to this, in quarantine. Restrictions were introduced in the settlement of Klenovskoye in the Troitsky District, in the settlement of Sosenskoye in the Novomoskovsky District, and on the territory of the Nagatinsky Zaton in the southern district of the capital. Veterinarians remind that one of the most effective ways to prevent rabies in animals is vaccination.

A new rabies vaccine for domestic and farm animals was developed at a scientific institution of the Rosselkhoznadzor -- the Federal Center for Animal Health (FGBI ARRIAH). The inactivated emulsion cultural antirabies vaccine "ARRIACH-Rabivak" forms stable immunity in animals (the level of antibodies is 2-3 times higher than that of traditional vaccines) for a period of more than 12 months.

Abstract
--------
Eliminating rabies is challenging in many developing countries, especially in rural areas. In contrast to the annual decline of human cases in China in last decade, the incidence of rabies in livestock has been increasingly reported. This paper reports the rabies outbreaks in beef cattle (Angus) in Shaanxi Province, China, which caused 31 and 5 deaths at an attack rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 13.6%‐26.4%) and 0.25% (95% CI: 0.1%‐0.6%) in a satellite cow farm (farm A) and a core intensive farm (farm B), respectively. The rabies infection was confirmed by several laboratory tests, and rabies virus (RABV) strains SXBJ15 and SXYL15 were isolated and characterized from farm A and B, respectively. The 2 strains were found to have a high genomic sequence similarity to the dog‐associated China clade I strains previously identified in the neighboring area. SXBJ15 was shown to have a higher mouse pathogenicity (1.07) than SXYL15 (0.45). RABV was also detected in the saliva and salivary glands from the affected cattle. The potential causes were investigated on the farm, and the biosecurity scores were 20 and 64 (a full score of 82) for farms A and B, respectively. The rabies infection is likely to result from rabid free‐roaming dogs (FRDs).

On farm A with more cow deaths, the rabies transmission between animals [see comment] can be attributed to the improper disposal of aborted fetuses and placental materials as a food source for rabid FRDs, high stocking density, and drinking water sharing.

Additionally, vaccinating cattle with a canine vaccine was shown to help stop the spread of rabies in herds. These results indicate that the occurrence of RABV on cattle farms can be prevented by improving biosecurity measures to control the entry of rural FRDs on the farm and immunizing farm cattle against rabies.

[The paper addressed an event dating back to 2015; the discussion chapter of the paper includes the following article 4.2, titled "The possibility of cattle-to-cattle transmission cannot be ruled out." It includes the following extract:

"In the current study, the excessive salivation of the diseased cows might transfer their saliva into the water trough and the left feedstuffs, leading to transmission through drinking water or contaminated feed with nasal and/or buccal routes. This agreed with the observations in farm A, where the index cases were located upstream of the shared drinking trough closest to the building entrance, followed by the infection of the other cows "downstream" of the water trough. Generally, a wound is considered as essential for RABV infection, and the outbreak of cow rabies in winter might be related with the fact that the farm only has coarse wheat straw as the winter roughage, which is hard and sharp and might cause injuries in the buccal mucosa of cows, thereby facilitating virus entry. Another possible transmission route from cattle to cattle might be related to social licking, which may pass the saliva from the infected cow to the nostril/muzzle of another cow and transmit the virus. In the present study, compared with farm B, farm A had a higher severity of RABV transmission and a higher frequency of licking behaviors because the cows were closely tethered with each other. The empirical evidence for the spreading ability between livestock needs to be studied in the future."

The possibility of cattle-to-cattle rabies infection was supported by information that "no dog-bitten wounds on the rabid cows were observed on the farm --- initially leading to the speculation that source of cattle infection on farm A were "wild animals such as wolves or wild dogs during grazing"..... "However, the rabies clinical signs were initially observed on 3 non-grazing cows, followed by the infection of other cows in the building, indicating that the onset of rabies in early December 2014 should not be attributed to the bites of potential wild animals during grazing."

The apparent absence of visible biting wounds at the time of clinical onset does not preclude exposure to rabid carnivores weeks, even months earlier. Such exposure could have taken place also within the premises of farm A which had a low score of biosecurity. Further studies into such a (speculative) scenario are warranted.

Under "wild animals" the paper mentions 2 species -- "wild dogs" and wolves. As observed elsewhere globally, rabid foxes as well as other wild carnivores can readily enter farm premises. The red fox, the largest fox species, can be found in most parts of China.

China's Center for Disease Control (China CDC) and the US CDC China office and headquarters staff jointly hosted a Stepwise Approach to Rabies Elimination (SARE) Workshop in Beijing in March 2019. The 4-day workshop was attended by national and provincial health officials from the human and animal health sectors, as well as experts from WHO, FAO, and OIE. Dog-rabies eradication was the main issue. The Workshop's report publication is expected soon. - Mod.AS
