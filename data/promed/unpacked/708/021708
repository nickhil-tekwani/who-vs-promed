Cleft palates can be caused by a number of agents, chemical and biological.
Giving consideration to the recent land clearing I would suspect either the
recent introduction/re-emergence of a new pathogen (even a slight increase
in body temperature can have profound effects on offspring), exposure to
organochlorines if there has been use of these substances in that area in a
time frame that would correspond to the early gestation period (cleft palate
occurs only early in gestation), or surface water contamination (but only if
these animals consume surface water).
I would suggest comparing the dates of early gestation with an evidence of
spraying that might coincide with those dates. If that doesn't play out then
try testing surface water for "the usual suspects" including heavy metals.
If that fails then I would suspect an infectious agent.

[This has been a fascinating discussion but we have heard nothing from the
Queensland mammologists directly involved. If anyone has their ear(s), would
you please persuade them to provide an update of what is their thinking on
this apparent outbreak. Thanks. mod MHJ
