The Ministry of Health and Social Development has confirmed 3 cases of chikungunya [virus infections], following reports of confirmed cases in St Martin and increased surveillance throughout the Virgin Islands. Dr Ronald Georges, medical officer of health in the Ministry of Health and Social Development said, "We have confirmed 3 cases on Jost Van Dyke."

Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes.

"It is important to note that these confirmed cases were not exposed to travel, which alerts us that the virus is already in our mosquito population," Dr Georges stated.

According to Dr Georges, the ministry has been coordinating a response with the Environmental Health Division to minimise the impact of chikungunya [virus infections]. He is reminding the public to take appropriate measures to minimise exposure to mosquitoes. As such, the health division has stepped up its fogging programme and will be addressing "hotspot" areas known for mosquito breeding.

Dr Georges explained that chikungunya [virus infection] causes symptoms similar to dengue fever, which last 2-5 days. Symptoms include rash, arthritis-like pain affecting multiple joints, headaches, conjunctival infection, back pain, nausea, vomiting, polyarteritis, and a fever of 102 deg F [39 deg C] or higher. "Anyone experiencing one or more of these symptoms should contact their healthcare provider immediately," he said, adding, "Persons are urged to be vigilant in inspecting their premises for mosquito breeding sites."

He said that measures should also be taken to keep mosquitoes out of homes for example: removing catchment of still water, cover containers storing water, and more importantly necessary precautions should be taken to protect babies by placing a protective net over cribs. In addition the use of insect repellent on adults and children is also useful.

Clinicians and health care providers are asked to continue to report syndromic data to the Surveillance Unit in the Ministry of Health and Social Development, especially fever surveillance within 24 hours for continuous monitoring.

The Environmental Health Division will continue surveillance and control measures at ports of entry. However, residents are asked to remain vigilant in preventing mosquitoes from breeding around their homes and businesses.

[Spread of chikungunya virus to other islands continues. In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only preventive measures that can be taken as noted in the report above. Fogging provides no long-term vector control. Breeding sites must be eliminated or treated with larvicides for effective control. That requires public cooperation and participation. Arrival of chikungunya virus in the dengue virus endemic areas of mainland Americas is probably more a matter of "when" than of "if".
