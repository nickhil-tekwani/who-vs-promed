Company's Hepatitis A vaccine banned
----------------------
The government has banned the use and sale of a Hepatitis A vaccine
produced by a Hangzhou company that has been linked to the death of a
student. The State Food and Drug Administration has brought in the
measure while it investigates the cause of the incident, which also
left more than 300 pupils ill. The administration will also check
other vaccines across the country.

Health Minister Gao Qiang said yesterday at a press conference in the
city of Suzhou, in Anhui Province, that the accident could be the
result of psychosomatic factors. Because the students received the
vaccine together and talked about it afterwards, they may have
brought on the ill effects themselves.

In this case most of the sick children were girls aged around 10, who
often feel increasingly uncomfortable after talking with each other
about inoculations, said an expert.

But Gao said it was too early to draw any conclusion on whether the
tragedy was related to the vaccines or not. Gao stressed the
importance of organizing inoculations by following proper procedures.
No organization or individuals are allowed to inject vaccines for a
group of people without approval, Gao added.

The vaccines at the centre of this case have been sent to Beijing for
further testing. The results will be released in 10 days' time,

Medical experts with the China Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention, also speaking at the press conference, said they believed
the illness had no direct link with the vaccines, given the students'
symptoms.

Mao Jiangsen, president of Pukang Biotechnology Co, the firm at the
centre of the row, said his company attributed the student's abnormal
symptoms to food poisoning. Mao, an expert with the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, argued the vaccine in this case would not lead to the
symptoms displayed by the pupils. These symptoms included numbness
and difficulties in breathing, he said.

Damage to the students' hearts and livers could have been caused by
diarrhoea following food poisoning, Shanghai Morning Post quoted Mao
as saying.

"Our vaccine should not be blamed," Mao said. "It is just an
coincidence it happened at the same time as the food poisoning."

When asked about the death of the student, Mao said he did not want
to comment, but added the vaccine the girl received was good.

Mao also answered claims that the incident was caused by the method
of transporting of the vaccine, which was not shipped in a
refrigerated truck. "Even if they were not cool, the vaccines would
lose its effectiveness, but would not kill people," Mao added.

3000 Hepatitis A vaccines produced by the company, which were sold in
Shanghai earlier this year, are likely to have been used. But no
incidents have so far been reported.

The incident under the spotlight happened when 2444 students aged
between 3 and 16 in Sixian County of East China's Anhui Province
received vaccines on 16 and 17 Jun [2005]. Among those vaccinated was
a 6-year-old [girl] from Shuiliu Primary School. She died on 23 Jun
[2005]. A post-mortem examination showed Li suffered from respiratory
failure and serious infection.

[The above newswire is somewhat confusing, as it mentions suspension
of use of the vaccine pending further studies (a logical response).
It also mentions the theory of mass hysteria in response to either
the single death or of an outbreak of diarrhea coincident with
vaccination, but then goes on to mention the possibility of an
outbreak of food poisoning triggering the mass hysteria, and explains
the cardiac and hepatic abnormalities observed in some of the
children as secondary to food poisoning.

This moderator is confused in trying to sort out these reports, and
would be very grateful if authoritative sources in China shared
results/observations of preliminary investigations. In addition,
results on testing of the implicated vaccine would be appreciated. -
