Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Dec 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 29 Dec 2017
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected

Mute Swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: This is the 1st detection of the subtype H5N6 in Switzerland. Samples were sent to the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (FLI), Germany for further analysis. 1st preliminary results suggest a relation to the HPAI virus H5N8/H5N6 strains recently detected in Europe.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Reference Centre for Diseases of Poultry and Rabbits (NRGK) (National laboratory) / Mute Swan / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 22 Dec 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As is mentioned in the epidemiological comment section, this is the 1st detection of subtype H5N6 in Switzerland, and preliminary results indicate that it is related to the HPAI H5N8/H5N6 strains recently detected in Europe.

The current H5N6 strain circulating in Europe was detected in the Netherlands on 9 Dec 2017. Comments published in ProMED posting 20171209.5493234 are pertinent to the actual event reported by Switzerland.

"According to information published by the diagnosing laboratory at the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR), the causative pathogen has been serotyped as HPAI H5N6. Its genotyping has shown that this strain is not related to the zoonotic H5N6 strain circulating in Asia, which is known to have caused human infections there. The H5 is related to the high pathogenic H5N8 virus, which was recorded in the Netherlands (including on the same farm; see further) in 2016. The N6 is related to a low-pathogenic virus strain detected earlier in wild birds in Europe. The current H5N6 strain has been established by the reassortment of the 2 mentioned European strains. Follow-up investigations are being applied by WBVR to obtain additional data on the origin and genetic composition of this new reassortant."
