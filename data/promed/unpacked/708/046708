Spread of Sleeping Sickness in Uganda
---------------------------
The movement of refugees across the Ugandan and Sudanese borders has been
blamed for increased cases of sleeping sickness in some areas of
north-western Uganda, and health authorities say these movements make it
difficult to control the spread of the disease.
"It is difficult to control the disease because refugees cross the borders
spontaneously," said Mr Dawson Mbulamberi, Uganda's Assistant Commissioner
for Health Services in charge of vector-borne disease control. He said more
than 70 per cent of the 700 cases that have been confirmed were refugees.
The minister said most of the cases were identified among the Sudanese
refugee population in the area.
The outbreak of sleeping sickness, which is caused [transmitted by the
tsetse fly, comes just as the country is recovering from the Ebola outbreak
that killed more than 150 people last year. Uganda's health budget was
strained by the epidemic, which devastated the northern district of Gulu.
Following the escalation of the 18-year-old civil war in southern Sudan,
Uganda is hosting thousands of Sudanese refugees. The Health Ministry has
blamed the spread of the disease on the Sudanese refugees fleeing the war
and famine. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said the
current exodus was a result of the failure of food distribution systems in
Southern Sudan.
Dr Mbulamberi said an NGO operating in Yei, southern Sudan, was identifying
the victims and sending them to Omugo in Arua, northwestern Uganda, for
treatment. The disease is characterised by fever, headache, joint pains and
loss of appetite. In its advanced stages, it causes mental disorder and
death if not treated. It can also cause miscarriage in pregnant women.
Health officials have warned that if the situation in north-western Uganda
is not arrested, the disease could spread to other areas.

[The news report indicates that sleeping sickness is spreading in northern
Uganda, but when the details are read, it is clear that the vast majority of
cases are imported from southern Sudan. No doubt trypanosomiasis has
increased in southern Sudan with the breakdown of the infrastructure, and no
doubt also that many of the refugees are infected when arrving in Uganda.
However, transmission in Uganda has not been shown from the data here to
present a major problem, and will depend on the ability to control the
tsetse fly population in the areas where the refugees are settled. In a
situation with no tsetse fly control the refugee population would be a
reservoir from which the infection could spread to the local population.
