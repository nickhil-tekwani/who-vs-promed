After crows and ducks, the deaths of cows have sparked panic among residents of Paradip town.

As per reports, while 4 cows died mysteriously in different slums of Paradip town, nearly 10 to 12 have been affected by an unidentified disease in the last one week. Consumption of milk has also gone down in the slum areas due to the outbreak of the mysterious disease, sources said.

Locals alleged that release of toxic effluent in water bodies and feeding on chemical waste are the main causes behind cow deaths in the locality. They said people are reluctant to consume milk of the affected cows. Veterinary surgeon of the Animal Husbandry department Priyadarsi D Rout said: "We have collected blood samples of the affected cows. It has been found that the cows have been affected with a fatal protozoal disease."

Precautionary measures have been taken to check the mortality of the cows and spread of the disease. Though cattle mortality has decreased, 2 to 3 cows are dying everyday due to the unidentified disease.

The reports are awaited from Bhopal laboratory to ascertain the exact cause of the cow deaths, Rout added.

In the last 20 days, nearly 300 crows and ducks have died due to an unidentified disease in the port town.

[Information from knowledgeable sources in the area on the "fatal protozoal infection" identified by the veterinary authorities will be appreciated.

Theilariosis or babesiosis are to be included among candidate agents. If this etiology of the bovine event is definitely established, the earlier deaths of crows and ducks becomes coincidental.

Alternatively, or additionally, the non-infectious etiology, as alleged by "locals," namely "toxic effluent or feeding on chemical waste," is in need of confirmation or exclusion by the animal health and environmental agencies. - Mod.AS
