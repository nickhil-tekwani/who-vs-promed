Russia: Outbreak of Hepatitis A Reported in Omsk
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A has been reported in the Sherbakul region of
Omsk. Single cases of hepatitis A infection were reported from the
beginning of autumn. However, currently 13 people are hospitalized, 9 of
whom are children. All of them were admitted to the infectious diseases
department of the regional hospital and they are being given appropriate
treatment. The cause of [infection is contaminated drinking water]. The
water was transported from the nearest spring in containers. This spring is
not as clean as it used to be because of the proximity of a pond used by
animals.

[The last sentence about the spring water source seems to suggest or imply
that the source of the hepatitis A virus contamination may have been
animals. However, if an unprotected spring is the water source,
contamination with human feces or urine is also likely to have occurred.
The mention of spring water brings up the bigger picture issue of the need
for safe water supplies and education of the public. Local populations
should be aware of the need for individual water treatment activities
before consuming water from "natural sources" that are non-official water
supplies/untreated water supplies. The newswire seems to suggest that
water is gathered by individuals from this spring and brought to households
in containers -- a model seen in many developing countries. Open water
sources such as springs or ponds can be high risk for contamination with
many different microorganisms of which the hepatitis A virus is only one of
many. There is an interesting discussion of a "safe water system" on the
CDC website <http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/> that addresses water captured
in personal containers. There is also an extensive bibliography list at
<http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/pub.htm> for published articles addressing
this issue. In many countries, there has been the need to advise the public
that "pristine park water" may be pristine on a "gross" level, but is not
microscopically pristine. - Mod.MPP]
