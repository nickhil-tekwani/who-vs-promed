Children from Nyaung Chaung camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kyauktaw Township, Arakan State, are reportedly suffering from diarrhea due to unsafe drinking water. The ponds typically used as a water supply by the IDPs are suffering from drought and mudslides, which has led to an influx of children suffering from diarrhea, U Khaing Myo Aung, manager of the IDP camp, told DMG.

"At least 5 children get sick every day. Some go to the clinic and feel better. Children suffer from diarrhea almost every day. If the children are really sick, they are sent to the Thayet Tapin rural health centre. Sometimes, they are transferred to Kyauktaw Hospital," he said.

As many as 3000 IDPs from more than 800 households in Tinma, Thasi, Pyaing Taing and Marlar villages in Kyauktaw Township, as well as some villages in Chin State's Paletwa Township, are currently taking refuge at Nyaung Chaung IDP camp. Due to the drought in the camp, IDPs are using pipelines from the Zee Chaung dam in Kyauktaw Township, but water-related hardships remain.

"There is a waterway pipeline that connects the IDP camp with a small pipe from the Zee Chaung reservoir. We have to queue up to fetch water. The water was clean, but we have only a small amount of water. We are in trouble to fetch water because there are many people at the camp," U Khaing Myo Aung said.

The township administration and relevant aid organizations are said to have been notified of the need for help to solve the problem, but reportedly no assistance has been provided yet.
