["Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is also known as early mortality syndrome (EMS) and is caused by infection with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_."

"This disease affects mainly _Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei_ and _Penaeus monodon_. It may also be problematic in _Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) chinensis_. Kuruma prawns are unaffected but may act as carriers. Live polychaete worms may also act as vectors for specific virulent strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ when used to feed broodstock prawns" (Source: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/acute-hepatopancreatic-necrosis-disease.pdf).

The disease has been reported from China (2010), Viet Nam (2010), Malaysia (2011), Thailand (2012), Mexico (2013) and the Philippines (2014) (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.01_AHPND.pdf). - Mod.CRD
