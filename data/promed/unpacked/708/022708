OIE: Finland's risk of mad cow disease minuscule
------------------------------------------------
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) says Finland is free
[see commentary] of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The
organisation made the announcement at its annual general meeting in
Paris on Tuesday [27 May 2008].

The declaration means the risk of mad cow disease in Finland is minuscule.

According to Jaana Husu-Kallio, the director of the Finnish Food
Safety Authority, the announcement offers Finland an edge in
exporting meat outside the EU. Only 9 other countries share the
BSE-free status with Finland.

She adds that Finland may be able to cut back on testing of the
disease due to the declaration. However, that decision has to be made
by the EU. According to Husu-Kallio, the onus is now on Finland to
show that testing could be reduced without harming food safety.

A total of 172 countries belong to the OIE, 10 of which have received
the top-level classification of being free of BSE. Sweden, Norway,
and Iceland also received the classification on Tuesday [27 May 2008].

Finland and Sweden are the only EU members to have received the
top-level status. However, the risk of BSE in Bulgaria and Romania is
pending on more information from those countries. Major meat
producers Brazil and the United States have not achieved the
top-level classification from the OIE.

One case of mad cow disease was detected in Finland in 2001. After
the incident, Finland began widespread testing for the disease.

Currently, tests are carried out on all slaughtered animals over the
age of 2.5, as well as on all cattle less than 2 years that are ill
or butchered due to emergency situations.

[2] Korea: safety standards

Tougher safety standards for Korean beef
----------------------------------------
The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on
Wednesday [28 May 2008] said it will release new enhanced safety
standards for Korean beef probably early next week, when it
promulgates sanitary conditions for US beef imports.

Major points in the ministry's new safety standards are to restrict
the slaughter of so-called "downer cows", strengthen the ban on
animal byproduct feeds, and expand BSE testing -- the measures
internationally recommended to prevent the outbreak and spread of mad
cow disease.

A ministry official said, "Korea is a BSE-free country, as no mad cow
disease has ever broken out. We've just enhanced the safety standards
for Korean beef as many people called for such a measure due to
renewed US beef imports."

Last year [2007], Korea applied to the world organization for animal
health (OIE) for a country risk assessment for BSE. As a result,
Korea was rated an "undetermined risk country," the lowest of 3
grades. The others are "negligible" and "controlled" risk. At the
time, the OIE explained Korea had not done adequate BSE testing and
had not clearly defined its ban on the use of animal byproduct feeds.

Woo Hee-jong, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul National
University, said since BSE could theoretically break out in Korean
cattle, "we must enhance safety standards by taking active measures
including drastically increasing tests for mad cow disease."

[3] Netherlands: 85th case since 1997

New case of mad cow disease discovered in Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------------
A fresh case of mad cow disease has been discovered in northern
Netherlands in the Drenthe province, it was reported.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide in its report said that an 8-year-old cow
fell ill in May [2008] in Drenthe and had difficulty in walking.
Veterinarians eventually killed the animal and an autopsy was
conducted. During examination it was found the cow was infected with
BSE or bovine spongiform encephalopathy virus, more commonly known as
mad cow disease.

The discovery of the fresh case of mad cow in the region came after
the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture announced in March [2008] that the
disease had been detected in a farm in the town of Dinkelland in
Overijssel province. The discovery came following the autopsy of a
slaughtered animal.

This is the 3rd case of mad cow [disease] in the Netherlands in 2008
and the 85th since 1997.

The disease affects the central nervous system of the animal and is
believed may be transmitted to human beings after eating an infected
animal brain or spinal cord.

[The correct definition of Finland's approved new classification
(item 1 above) is "a country with a negligible BSE risk in accordance
with Chapter 2.3.13 of the Code". The other 9 countries, currently
sharing with Finland this status, are Australia, Argentina, Iceland,
New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Singapore, Sweden, and Uruguay.

Pending the outcome of the risk assessment, the cattle population in
a country, zone, or compartment can be classified as a negligible BSE
risk, a controlled BSE risk, or an undetermined BSE risk. Most OIE
member countries belong currently to the 3rd group.

BSE, including the updating of the lists, has been subject to an
extensive discussion during the current 76th General Session of the
International Committee of the OIE, being held in Paris, 25-30 May
2008. These annual meetings bring together representatives of
(currently, 172) OIE Member Countries, as well as observers from the
international organisations that have signed an official agreement
with the OIE. In addition, there is participation of other
international and regional organisations and invited guests.

The International Committee establishes the policies of the OIE and
supervises their application. This year [2008] its main work
concerned the adoption of international standards regarding safety in
world trade in animals and animal products, the fight against animal
diseases and zoonoses, and improving the quality of veterinary
services. A comprehensive review of the world animal health situation
has also been given, derived from information submitted by each
Member Country and Territories. - Mod.AS]
