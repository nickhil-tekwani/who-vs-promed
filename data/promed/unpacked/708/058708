There hasn't been too much discussion here concerning CSE [caprine
spongiform encephalopathy] in goats. Below, I've posted abstracts from what
seems to be the main set of results (better read at
www.mad-cow.org/mad_goat.html). What I found:
Goats are not much of a quantitative issue in Britain, with 18,000 animals
reared mainly for milk and hair, versus an annual sheep slaughter of
19,000,000. In other countries, goats are much more abundant. There may be
some use of goats in production of medical products. I found nothing one way
or the other on dairy goat herds receiving protein supplements. Goats
generally get thrown in with the sheep as far as offal regulations go.
Goats are said to be one of the three species known where TSE occurs
naturally, with the disease going back 200 years or more. Goats are commonly
kept with sheep, and CSE is associated with the occurence of OSE [scrapie].
In fact CSE is commonly assumed to be scrapie in goats, though no mechanism
for horizontal cross-species transmission has been advanced. There has been
a concern about BSE passing to goats mirroring the concern of BSE passing to
sheep.
The genetic situation is a bit muddled. In the course of establishing
various breeds, various prion alleles have become established that otherwise
might be rare polymorphisms. While some breeds are prone to CSE or differ in
incubation periods [codon 142], none of the alleles seems sufficient to
cause CSE. [There is always the awful possibility, as in high
hexapeptide-repeat chickens, that inbreeding has fixed a rogue prion with
early onset of infectivity but very late onset of symptoms.]
In other words, (non-experimental) CSE has been sporadic, not familial, just
as with OSE and BSE. The wild-type goat prion sequence can be recovered
with confidence since so many artiodactyl sequences are known.
It might be possible to demonstrate horizontal transmission more rigorously
by putting goats into a (non-rendered protein supplemented) herd of sheep
with a defined strain of scrapie, followed by strain-typing with comparison
to inoculated goats, along with appropriate controls. The _mechanism_ of any
horizontal transmission would not be illuminated by this experiment,
however. The only possibly similar situation that comes to mind is chronic
wasting disease in captive deer quartered in sheep pasture.

Novel polymorphisms in the caprine PrP gene: a codon 142 mutation associated
with scrapie incubation period.
J Gen Virol 77 ( Pt 11): 2885-2891 (1996) Goldmann W, Martin T, Foster J,
Hughes S, Smith G, Hughes K, Dawson M, Hunter N
Age at disease onset and rate of progression of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies in man, sheep and mice are modulated by the host genome, in
particular by the PrP gene and its allelic forms. Analysis of the caprine
PrP gene
revealed several different alleles. Four PrP protein variants were found,
three of which were goat specific with single amino acid changes at codons
142, 143 and 240. The fourth was identical to the most common sheep PrP
protein variant (Ala136-Arg154-Gln171). The dimorphism at codon 142 (Ile -->
Met) appeared to be associated with differing disease incubation periods in
goats experimentally infected with isolates of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, sheep scrapie CH1641 or sheep-passaged ME7 scrapie.

Encephalopathy in cattle experimentally infected with the scrapie agent.

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, Mission, TX

Ten 8- to 10-month old cattle were each inoculated intramuscularly,
subcutaneously, intracerebrally, and orally with the scrapie agent to
determine whether cattle are susceptible to it. Two inocula, both 10%
homogenates of cerebrum, were used. One inoculum was from a sheep used for
the second experimental ovine passage of the agent from 4 naturally affected
Suffolk sheep. The other inoculum was from a goat used for the first
experimental caprine passage of the agent from 2 naturally affected dairy
goats living with the Suffolk sheep, the source of their infection. Between
27 and 48 months after inoculation, neurologic disease was observed in 1 of
5 cattle given the sheep brain homogenate and in 2 of 5 given the goat brain
homogenate.

Transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to sheep and goats.
Vet Rec 133 (14): 339-341 (1993) Foster JD, Hope J, Fraser H Institute for
Animal Health, AFRC, Edinburgh.
Spongiform encephalopathy has been confirmed in both 'positive' and
'negative' lines of Cheviot sheep (selected for their differential response
on experimental exposure to scrapie) after intracerebral injection or oral
dosing with brain homogenate derived from cattle with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). With either challenge the incubation period of the
disease ranged from 440 to 994 days in both lines of sheep. In a similar
experiment, three Anglo-Nubian goats developed the disease 506 to 570 days
after intracerebral infection with the same BSE homogenate, and two of three
goats developed the disease 941 and 1501 days after oral dosing; the other
goat and some sheep from each of the experimental groups remain alive 1720
days after exposure. This is the first report of the experimental
transmission of BSE to sheep and goats.

Natural scrapie in goats: neuropathology.
Vet Rec 131 (5): 93-96 (1992) Wood JL, Done SH
Pathology Department, Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, Surrey.
The brains of the 20 goats affected with natural scrapie received at the
Central Veterinary-Laboratory, Weybridge, since 1975 were examined
microscopically. Lesions of a spongiform encephalopathy were found in the
brainstem, cerebellum, diencephalon, corpus striatum, and also in the
neopallium or cerebral cortex. The lesions in the neopallium have not
previously been reported in natural scrapie in goats. Deposits of amyloid
were present in the thalamus in three of the 20 goats.

Detection of scrapie-associated fibrils in scrapie in goats.
Veterinary Record 1991 129 19 432
Perrin, G. G.; Perrin, G. J.; Benoit, C.
Three goats, 2 4-year-old sisters and the 3-year-old progeny of one of them
were examined for wasting, fine head tremor and over-excitability triggered
by noise. They all came from a flock in which scrapie had previously been
suspected, but never confirmed. The animals were killed and brain samples
cultured for Listeria were negative. Histopathology showed the presence of
spongiform encephalopathy patterns as single and multiple vacuolisation of
neuronal cytoplasm in the medulla. Electron microscopy revealed clusters of
scrapie-associated fibrils.

FDA proposes prohibiting sheep and goat offal in ruminant feed
A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/VETNEWS/VET00051">VETNEWS ... 08/31/1994
In the August 29, 1994, Federal Register, FDA proposed a rule to prohibit
specified offal from adult (more than 12 months of age) sheep and goats for
use in ruminant feed. FDA is proposing this action because the specified
offal may contain the agent that causes scrapie, a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep and goats. ... Because FDA cannot positively
rule out a direct association between scrapie, BSE, and human TSEs, FDA is
proposing this action to protect the health of animals and humans.
Processed tissues from sheep and goats are used as ingredients in animal
feeds. These products are derived from slaughter byproducts (slaughter
inedibles) and dead, dying, diseased, and disabled (4-D) animals. These
slaughter inedibles and 4-D animals include certain offal that are the
subject of this proposed rule. Specified offal is defined in this proposal
as any tissue from the brain, spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsil, lymph
nodes, or intestines (duodenum to anus, inclusive) of sheep or goats, or any
processed product that is reasonably expected to contain specified offal.
Products which are likely to contain specified offal include dried meat
solubles, glandular meal, meat meal, meat and bone meal, animal byproduct
meal, meat meal tankage, animal digest, bone ash, bone charcoal, spent bone
charcoal, cooked bone meal, and bone phosphate.....

Mapping of mitochondrial DNA of individual sheep and goats: rapid evolution
in the D loop region.
Cell 11 (3): 571-583 (1977)
Upholt WB, Dawid IB
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from sheep and goat was compared by restriction
endonuclease analysis and heteroduplex mapping in the electron microscope.
The fragment patterns produced by endonuclease Hae III from three
individual sheep and two goat mtDNAs all differed from each other. The three
sheep mtDNAs had identical Eco RI and Hind III fragments, but the two goat
mtDNA patterns differed from each other as well as from sheep mtDNA. We
estimate that each sheep mtDNA differs from each other by 0.5-1% of its
nucleotide sequences, the two goat mtDNAs by 1-2%, and there is a 6-11%
sequence difference between sheep and goat mtDNAs. [Chromosome count: cattle
(Bos taurus, 2n = 60), goat (Capra hircus, 2n = 60) and sheep (Ovis aries,
2n = 54)
