The public health authority in southern Ontario says it has confirmed what they believe to be the 1st 2 known cases of canine influenza in Canada.

The H3N2 strain of the virus was detected by a veterinarian in dogs imported by an adoption agency from South Korea via the United States.

"A small number of dogs having close with the affected dogs also have mild respiratory disease, but test results from those animals are not yet available," the health unit said in a press release.

"Canine influenza virus is of concern because it is highly transmissible between dogs, particularly in areas (such as Canada) where dogs do not have natural immunity from previous infection and where canine influenza vaccination is rare," the health agency explained.

"There is no known human risk from H3N2 canine influenza virus; however, the risk of reassortment (or mixing together) between the canine H3N2 virus and human seasonal influenza viruses is a potential concern," the health unit added.

Dr Wajid Ahmed, acting medical officer of health for Windsor-Essex, said canine influenza is "actually pretty common in South Korea but it's not seen here."

Like the human forms of influenza, most dogs getting the disease will recover from it without any issues, he said.

Dr Ahmed said canine influenza is not known to be transmissible to humans but may be transmissible to cats.

Dr Kate Sweetman, a Windsor veterinarian, said there is no reason for pet owners to panic if they suspect canine influenza.

However, Dr Sweetman advises pet owners to call their veterinarians to discuss whether they should bring their pets to the clinic. "Putting your dog in a waiting room where there are other dogs could help spread canine influenza," she explained.

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit said the disease can be "highly contagious" so care must be taken with sick dogs. "Dogs with signs of respiratory disease (such as cough, decreased appetite, nasal and eye discharge, and fever) should be kept away from others dogs for at least 2 weeks," the health unit said.

[We are saddened to learn this very contagious disease has made its presence known again.

If you have a sick animal, have touched one, or take one to a veterinary office, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before touching other animals. Washing your clothes and showering or bathing are critical to help keep the spread of this disease down, and not track it back to your home if you are working in a shelter or a veterinary office.

Canine influenza (CI) or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the USA, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the USA, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.

"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the USA" (see https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx).

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (such as dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm). - Mod.TG
