Correction
----------
[In part [1] of the ProMED-mail post "Viral gastroenteritis update 2003
(10) 20030320081", the location of a norovirus-suspected food-borne
outbreak of viral gastroenteritis was given as the state of Missouri. The
original report was taken from the St Louis Post-Dispatch and I assumed
erroneously that the location of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows
would be in Missouri. Galen Isringhausen has informed me that in fact the
National Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows is located approximately 15 miles
east of Missouri in St. Clair County, Illinois. I apologize for this error
and thank Galen Isringhausen for putting the record straight. - Mod.CP]

Ireland: Norovirus Recurrence at Geriatric Hospital in Waterford
----------------------------------------------------------------
St Patrick's, the Waterford City geriatric hospital, remains closed to
visitors and admissions due to another outbreak of the winter vomiting
virus [a.k.a. norovirus infection]. 16 suspected cases of the virus have
been reported among staff and patients at the hospital since Tue 1 Apr
2003. A South Eastern Health Board (SEHB) spokesperson said that since the
weekend one patient and 2 members of staff have reported symptoms
consistent with the highly contagious virus.
Meanwhile, the work-to-rule industrial action being taken by 50 nurses at
the hospital is continuing. A Labour Relations Commission hearing between
the Irish Nurses Organisation and the SEHB is scheduled to take place in
Kilkenny tomorrow morning (Thu 10 Apr 2003) in a bid to resolve a dispute
over inadequate staffing levels. Under the work-to-rule, nurses have been
refusing since 24 Mar 2003 to carry out non-nursing duties such as taking
phone calls, doing portering, and clerical work.
But the hospital's services have been further disrupted since this latest
outbreak of [norovirus infection], which 8 patients and 8 members of staff
are believed to have contracted. The SEHB has appealed to the public to
assist the Board's measures to curb the virus's spread by not visiting the
hospital, unless in exceptional circumstance. A SEHB spokesperson said full
infection control measures have been implemented at St. Patrick's Hospital.
[Norovirus infection] also affected patients and staff at St. Patrick's
Hospital last year.
