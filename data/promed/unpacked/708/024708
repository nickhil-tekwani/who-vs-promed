[(*) Cases added since the previous BSE update of 23 Jun 2003.
These are not official data. They are derived from the above-mentioned
source, which seems to be updated meticulously. The data from some
countries may include exceptional imported cases or exclude exported cases
which were found positive in the countries of destination. For these
details and for additional updated information, the reader is referred to
the source and to the updated (30 Jul 2003) OIE table:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_esbmonde.htm>
Most countries show decreased incidence of recorded BSE compared to 2002.
The 2 exceptions are Portugal and Spain, where -- during the first 7 months
of 2003 -- the number of recorded BSE cases exceeded 70 percent of their
total annual number in 2002. Canada had its first reported endemic BSE
case in a 6-years-old animal in May 2003. - Mod.AS]

90 percent of the animal feed from cattle affected by mad-cow disease is
not accounted for
-------------------------------------------------
The cement plants in charge of destroying banned meat and bone meal for
animal feed have only received a small fraction of it, and there is concern
that the fraudulent sale of illegal feed continues.
Rafael Fernandez, general director of the Spanish Association of Cement
Producers (Oficemen) expressed concern that part of the 400 000 tons of
meat and bone meal for animal feed produced in Spain annually is not being
destroyed and that the fraudulent sale of illegal feed continues.
In 2000, the European Union imposed a ban on meat and bone meal in animal
feed, in a drive to halt the spread of mad cow disease. At that time,
Oficemen signed an agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture by which the
banned animal feed would be destroyed by the cement plants, at an annual
cost to the state of approximately 132 million euros. Each plant has the
capacity for incinerating 20 000 to 30 000 tons of animal feed per year.
When the agreement was signed, the production of meat and bone meal for
animal feed in Spain was approximately 400 000 tons per year. Currently,
less than 60 000 tons per year (less than 15 percent) are being incinerated
in the ovens of all the cement plants in Spain.
Although part of the animal feed is disposed of in garbage dumps, and an
additional small amount -- around 20 000 tons -- was incinerated in an
electrical plant in Andalusia, it is largely unknown what is happening to
the remaining 90 percent.
Last week, the National Reference Center for Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies announced that the number of cases of "mad-cow" disease in
Spain continues to grow and predicted 150 new cases during the remainder of
2003. [see comment to item 1 above].

Canada tests far fewer animals for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad
cow disease, than even some countries that have never reported a case of BSE,
MP Dick Proctor said. As a result, he added, international boycotts that have
punished the Canadian beef industry since a single mad cow case was reported
in Alberta in May 2003 will likely continue, amid the belief that this
country has not seen the last of the disease.
Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief and his predecessor, current Public Works
Minister Ralph Goodale, expressed frustration recently that 34 countries --
particularly Japan and the United States -- continue to ban Canadian beef
despite efforts from Ottawa to ensure its safety. [But] the government has
failed to implement measures recommended by a veterinary panel in June 2003
that called for a complete end to the use of cattle-based feed. Canada has
long forbidden the use of cattle-based feed for cattle and other ruminants,
but the veterinary panel suggested such feed should be illegal for all
animals. A spokesperson for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said a
complete ban is still under consideration.
Proctor also listed 17 countries that in 2002 tested more cattle for BSE
than Canada, including Sweden and the USA, which have never reported a
case of the disease. While Canada tested only 3377 cattle of the more than
3 million domestic animals slaughtered last year, the USA tested 19 990
and Sweden tested 37 497.
Japan, which has had 7 cases of mad cow in the last 2 years and is now a
major roadblock to the resumption of the Canada-U.S. beef trade, tested
1 283 000 head of cattle in 2002.

[Undoubtedly, the current Canadian BSE testing figures are rather modest;
however, the cited relatively very high figures of the Japanese BSE testing
scheme deserve a brief analysis. About 40 percent of the tested bovines
slaughtered in Japan during 2002/2003 were older than 30 months; about 60
percent of the tests related to young stock, namely animals which are left
out of the testing scheme in EU and other countries, where mass testing for
BSE is practiced. On the other hand, only a relatively small number of
animals at higher risk (fallen stock, etc.) have been covered by the
Japanese testing scheme until recently. As mentioned in the "Summary of
recent news reports in Japan on BSE testing" (see BSE update 2003(04),
20030426.1019), a new law effective 1 Apr 2003 states that all the cattle
over 24 months found dead on farms should be checked for BSE. The Japanese
Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (MAFF) stated that they
cannot check all the dead animals in 17 prefectures, and that total test
numbers will be about half of the expected 80 000. It will be interesting
to obtain the current figures on the performance of this new "dead on farm"
testing scheme in Japan.
