The Ministry of Agriculture said Monday [10 Mar 2008] it has received
the reports of 12 bird flu cases this year [2008], warning a more
"complicated" epidemic control situation.

Of the 12 cases 3 have been confirmed, with 2 in Tibet Autonomous
Region and one in Guizhou Province, both in southwest China, said Li
Jinxiang, director of the ministry's veterinary department, on the
sidelines of the annual session of China's top legislature.

He said 3 factors shall be blamed for the outbreak of bird flu cases.
First, south China was hit by unprecedented snowstorm and cold snap
from the beginning of this year [2008], which made bird flu virus
active;
Secondly, snowstorm and cold snap affected regular immunization work,
as it was conducted usually in February and March;
Thirdly, snow and ice disaster harmed the living conditions of
livestock, bringing risks of epidemic spread.

The official said currently relevant government departments across
the country are actively launching spring epidemic control and
immunization work. The ministry has prepared 5 billion milliliters of
vaccine for immunization efforts.

Epidemic surveillance has also been strengthened to rule out hidden
dangers in time, he said.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza - Egypt
-----------------------------------------
After the 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt in Feb 2006, the
government adopted several mechanisms to limit the spread and control
the disease as well as the risk of human infections. In the control
process, an estimated 30 million birds were culled and, more
recently, there has been widespread free vaccination of private
sector commercial flocks and backyard poultry. As of [11 March 2008,
there had been 46 human cases, 20 of them fatal. - Mod.AS] The rapid
spread of the disease in Egypt has been related to the development of
poultry product supply chains that move millions of birds per day
with low levels of biosecurity. More recent outbreaks would appear to
be related to the mixture of ducks and chickens in the rooftop and
backyard systems and their close proximity to industrial poultry
units. Ducks play a critical role in the maintenance of HPAI H5N1,
and current strengthening of surveillance systems and epidemiological
analysis should allow the development of improved containment
strategies.

For this report, HPAI is viewed in terms of market shock and threat
to livelihoods. While the significant costs in terms of HPAI control
and some loss of international trade are recognized, space and time
do not allow for these to be covered in detail.

The importance of poultry within Egyptian households is unique.
Addressing the impacts avian influenza has had on these households,
in particular the poor and vulnerable families, with actions to
support the affected households is a challenge not just for poultry
health specialists and development specialists but also for national
and local government institutions that need to assess these actions
in light of efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals.

Significant market shocks to commercial and backyard poultry
operations in Egypt have followed the same sequential pattern in
other countries dealing with HPAI
- during and immediately after an outbreak, demand falters, prices
drop, supplies decline as producers reduce output (birds are culled,
mortality rates increase, or producers respond to reduced consumption
and lower prices), and industry returns decline; and
- markets subsequently recover but the ability of producers to
re-enter the market in a timely fashion may be compromised by various
factors with implications for the long-term structure of the sector.

The food management chains of the industrial chicken sub-sector
(broilers and layers with associated breeding stock which account for
80 percent of the chicken population) have weak contractual
arrangements, poor infrastructure investment, and limited investment
in food processing, marketing, and retailing. It is possible that
this is hampering Egypt's ability to control HPAI and also to compete
in international markets, but this requires further study and
analysis to reach definitive conclusions.

Specimens from 4 Owston's palm civets in Viet Nam's Cuc Phuong
National Park, which died in February [2008], have been tested
positive to bird flu virus strain H5N1, local newspaper Pioneer
reported Tuesday [11 Mar 2008].

According to tests by Viet Nam's Central Veterinary Diagnosis Center,
the 4 civets were infected with H5N1. Specimens from a civet in the
national park in northern Ninh Binh province, which died on 2 Mar
2007, have been tested negative to the virus.

The park's staff named Tran Quang Phuong said that after the deaths
of 5 Owston's palm civets in late February and early March [2008],
there are now 8 civets in the park.

In June 2005 when bird flu was hard hitting Viet Nam, 3 Owston's palm
civets in the national park died. According to tests by a laboratory
in China's Hong Kong, they were infected with H5N1 [see ProMED-mail
posting 20050826.2527].

It has remained unknown why the civets have been infected with the
disease, the newspaper said.

Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health on 10 Mar 2008 said the
country currently has 9 localities having poultry being hit by bird
flu: Quang Ninh, Hai Duong, Nam Dinh, Tuyen Quang, Ninh Binh, Phu
Tho, Ha Nam, and Hanoi in the northern region, and southern Vinh Long
province

Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in December 2003, have
killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowls
in the country.

The Luang Namtha provincial governor has announced a total ban on the
sale of poultry in the province, as well as prohibiting the purchase
of poultry from neighbouring countries for the next 30-45 days,
following 4 separate outbreaks of bird flu.

"If the provincial authorities do not detect the H5N1 virus during
this period they will lift the ban," the deputy head of the
provincial Livestock and Fisheries Office, Ms Bouathong Inthongsay,
told Vientiane Times last week [3-9 Mar 2008].

She said that each section of the provincial Committee for Bird Flu
Control had allocated staff to monitor the situation and take extra
precautions in outbreak areas. They would set up checkpoints between
villages to make sure there was no trade or movement of poultry
either within the province or with other provinces.

The governor also announced the setting up of checkpoints on
international borders, to maintain strict control, said Ms Bouathong.

Following the outbreaks in 3 districts, the neighbouring provinces of
Oudomxay, Phongsaly, and Bokeo are now vulnerable to infection.

Luang Namtha's highest risk district is considered to be
Viengphoukha, as this surrounds the only road leading from the
outbreak areas to the provincial capital and other provinces, she
said. The committee has organised staff to disinfect all vehicles
using this road.

The provincial Public Health Department is distributing information
to local communities about the bird flu virus, such as how it is
transmitted, the risks it poses for animals and humans, and how
people can prevent it spreading.

No humans have yet to contract the virus because most local residents
understand the dangers and have cooperated with the authorities, said
a departmental official, Mr Aae Mithda.

He said that 2 people had reported flu-like symptoms in Namlue
village, the site of the 4th outbreak. They were undergoing tests but
the results were not yet known. It was possible their illness might
be just a common cold, although they had been in contact with poultry.

National and international organisations were helping with the
prevention of further outbreaks in the province and recently the
Chinese government had provided some equipment and disinfectant, he
added.

Other northern provinces are also taking precautions in the wake of
the outbreaks, checking illegal sales of poultry in markets and
shops, according to a report from local authorities.

Last month 700-800 poultry died in Hatdaen village in Khua district,
Phongsaly province. However, tests had proved they were not infected
with the H5N1 virus, said the deputy head of the provincial Livestock
and Fisheries Office, Ms Somnith Keoboun-ngeun. She believes the
chicken died from diseases resulting from the cold weather, as this
area has never experienced bird flu in the past.

Bird flu has spread to another district in Bangladesh despite massive
culling by authorities to control the outbreak, officials said on
Sunday [9 Mar 2008], bringing the number of affected districts to 47
out of 64.

The new case of the avian influenza was found in Brahmanbaria, in the
east of the capital Dhaka, livestock officials said. They added that
the spread of bird flu had slowed in the previously affected areas in
recent weeks.

Nearly 1.25 million birds have been culled since the virus was first
detected in March 2007, threatening the impoverished country's
growing poultry sector.

Industry officials said bird flu had caused losses of about 45
billion taka (USD 650 million) to the poultry sector, which accounts
for 1.6 percent of gross domestic product.

Around 5 million of the country's more than 140 million people are
directly or indirectly involved in poultry farming, of whom officials
estimate more than 1.5 million have now become jobless.

No human bird flu cases have been reported in Bangladesh, a densely
populated nation where poultry is commonly kept by households.

Experts fear the H5N1 strain could mutate or combine with the highly
contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic, especially
in countries such as Bangladesh where people live in close proximity
to backyard poultry.

Eating well-cooked meat is safe but experts have warned about
handling H5N1-tainted birds or meat without protection. Humans
usually contract the virus only after close contact with infected
birds.

[6] India (West Bengal): route of infection
Date: Tue 11 Mar 2008

Smuggling of poultry for trade, from bird flu free districts of West
Bengal into the affected districts, may have caused the highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus to resurface in West Bengal.

According to the avian influenza control and containment protocol, no
"repopulation" of poultry is allowed in an infected district at least
3 months from the time culling teams complete disinfection operations.

However, reports officially sent to the Centre almost 2 weeks ago by
teams travelling across West Bengal had clearly documented how
poultry was being sold in local villages of Birbhum and Murshidabad,
which were the 1st 2 districts to be infected by the virus in January
[2008].

The reports were then forwarded to state government officials, who
were asked to immediately curb such practices until the virus was
completely destroyed. But on Friday night [7 Mar 2008], the Centre's
worst fears were confirmed -- the virus had returned to haunt West
Bengal.

Animal husbandry secretary Pradeep Kumar said, "Central teams had
confirmed incidents of villagers selling poultry within infected
districts even when repopulation of poultry within 3 months from
completion of containment and cleaning up operations is strictly
prohibited."

TOI [Times of India] was the first to confirm the reappearance of the
virus in Raghunathganj-II and Jiaganj blocks of Murshidabad. The 2
areas witnessed death of nearly 1000 birds in the past 10 days. Kumar
confirmed to TOI, "2 samples from these blocks sent to HSADL [High
Security Animal Disease Laboratory], Bhopal, on 6 Mar 2008, tested
positive. We notified the West Bengal government on Saturday [8 Mar
2008]."

Animal husbandry commissioner Dr S K Bandhopadhyay said, "We don't
know whether this is a fresh outbreak or whether the virus was being
carried there all along by ducks. However, surveillance teams had
informed the state government that repopulation and trade was
occurring in districts like Birbhum, Murshidabad, and Burdwan."

According to officials, even if trade and smuggling of birds were
taking place clandestinely, it was the state government's highest
priority to bring an end to the practice because restriction on
movement of poultry from and inside bird flu affected areas was
banned.

Bandhopadhyay added, "Backyard poultry droppings always remain in the
environment for some time. The moment we repopulate before the virus
is stamped out completely, scavenger birds pick on the droppings. If
these contain the virus, the new lot of birds then get infected."

Meanwhile, the state government started fresh culling operations in a
radius of 5 km (3 mi) around the 2 new areas of infection. While 22
440 birds are to be culled in Raghunathganj-II, the culling target in
Jiaganj is 27 000. Twenty rapid response teams (RRTs) have been
deployed in each of the 2 blocks. Since the outbreak of bird flu in
Bengal was notified on 15 Jan 2008, over [4 million] birds have been
culled and [1.4 million] eggs destroyed.

Bandhopadhyay said, "We expect the culling to be over in 4 days time.
The sooner we start surveillance, the better."

[According to a previous report (see ProMED-mail posting
20080309.0967), the minister of animal resource development, Anisur
Rahman, said on 8 Mar 2008: "We didn't carry out culling operations
in 2 freshly affected blocks of Murshidabad in January [2008] when
bird flu first hit Bengal. We shall begin culling there in full swing
from Monday [10 Mar 2008]." Though illegal transport of animals and
their products is a major route of disease dissemination, in this
case -- provided the information above is accurate -- no smuggling
from other regions was needed to revive the epizootic. Hopefully, the
performance of the control measures has been improving since. - Mod.AS
