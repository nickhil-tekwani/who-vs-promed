A Marburg-like virus festering in a Congolese gold mine has killed 73
people, health officials said Friday. "There are dead rats, bats and even
human bodies decomposing in these mines," Floribond Tshoko, an
epidemiologist of the World Health Organization (WHO), told Reuters.
The 73 have died from hemorrhagic fever -- which causes massive internal
bleeding -- believed to have been caused by the Marburg Virus. Tshoko said
Marburg virus had been firmly identified in only eight of the 88 known
cases.
The fever has killed 73 of 88 people affected in Durba in the northwestern
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Officials said it was
probably caused by conditions in the mine. Tshoko said measures should be
taken to close down the mines, as three-quarters of the 88 suspected cases
registered since November 1998 were gold diggers who entered the mines
illegally without protective equipment.
The disease has taken on epidemic proportions since May, health officials
said. In August, seven suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever were detected
in Durba. Three were gold diggers and one was a Ugandan soldier who had
been in the mines. Ugandan troops are backing rebels against the government
of President Laurent Kabila.
The gold mines in Durba are jointly owned by the state Office des Mines de
Kilomoto and the Canadian gold mining company Barrick Gold Corp. Barrick
pulled out of the operations in Durba when a war between Tutsi-led rebels
and the government broke out in August 1998. "The government has to take
the measures to close the mines, but the war situation has made that
impossible," Tshoko said. The area continues to be controlled by rebels
and it is unclear who would have the authority to close down the mines.
A plane belonging to Medecins Sans Frontieres flew to Durba Friday to
collect blood samples taken from the latest victims.
[Unfortunate occurrence and sad situation, and unfortunate that the social
conditions are not such that researchers can enter the area and collect
specimens from bats and other possible hosts. The natural reservoir of
Marburg virus is unknown. - Mod.CHC

At the above WHO website are 8 reports and updates about the April-May 1999
outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever in Democratic Republic of Congo.
DETAILS OF THE TESTING ARE GIVEN THERE.
For example, update 2 says, "Today WHO received a report from the WHO
collaborating centre at the National Institute for Virology, in South
Africa that a blood sample collected from the district medical officer who
became ill in Watsa zone, in the northeastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and died on 23 April 1999 with symptoms of
haemorrhagic fever, is positive for Marburg virus. Samples from four other
suspected cases were negative. Investigations will be initiated to
establish whether Marburg fever was responsible for an estimated 76 cases
of hemorrhagic fever (52 deaths) that have been reported in Watsa and a
nearby community of Durba."
Note this is a short excerpt, there is MUCH more info there.

["Positive for Marburg virus" could mean that the patient had antibody to
this virus. One positive does not a diagnosis make. It remains to be seen
whether this is indeed an important outbreak, perhaps an epidemic, of
Marburg virus infections or whether the report of the diagnosis is simply
an erythematous clupeid. If Bob Swanepoel (National Institute for
Virology, in South Africa) says it is positive, it is positive. Sometimes
people extrapolate from there. - Mod.CHC
