A recent study has confirmed for the 1st time in Ecuador the presence of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ and _Sugarcane mosaic virus_, which together form the maize lethal necrosis disease (MLN) complex. This terrible disease has been identified in the main maize producing areas of the coastal region in Manab√≠ province in 2014 and is herewith reported also for the 1st time from South America.

Possible sources of the new viruses are still unknown. It is estimated that the disease has been present in the country for about 2 years with incidence increasing to 14 per cent in 2016. It is feared that the new disease will threaten the cultivation of 280 000 ha [about 692 000 acres] of maize, which are needed for the country to be self sufficient, and also endanger seed trade in the region.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles) with one of several other species of the family _Potyviridae_. As synergistic partners of MCMV in MLN, _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_) or _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) have been reported previously from the Americas and Europe. MLN as well as MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727). The disease is spreading in the region where millets have recently also been identified as an additional crop host being affected by MLN (ProMED-mail post 20150820.3590521). _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV) has been reported as the co-infecting virus in Sub-Saharan Africa, but MDMV and SCMV belong to a complex of closely related potyviruses infecting tropical grasses. Based on serology, some strains (for example, MDMV-B) varying in host range and ability to be seed transmitted have been reassigned between the species which has resulted in some confusion in taxonomy.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield and as virus reservoirs, making disease monitoring difficult. While MCMV is not seed transmitted, the synergistic partner viruses WSMV and MDMV (including some reassigned strains previously included in SCMV) are. Thus, losses from MLN are both due to yield reductions and trade implications (as mentioned above) resulting from the risk of virus infected seed. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, as well as use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses.

The claim that reassigned 'SCMV' strains have been found associated with MLN in Ecuador, rather than the 'original' MDMV known as coinfecting partner in northern America may point towards different strains being involved in northern and southern regions of the continent. In contrast, similar seed transmissible strain(s) seem to be involved in both South America, the centre of origin of maize, and Africa which may provide some clues as to the direction or possible sources of global spread of MLN.
