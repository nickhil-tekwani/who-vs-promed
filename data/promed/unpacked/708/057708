Astrakhan spotted fever. --p.20
Since 1972 in Astrakhan Oblast annually in late spring, summer and early
autumn are registered some cases of prolonged high-temperature fever,
previously called virus exanthema.
Rickettsial etiology of the disease was suggested initially by data of
results of serological analysis. In 1990 two strains of rickettsia referred
to the group of tick-borne spotted fever were isolated from the blood of
patients.
>From 1983 till 1997, 1,378 cases of Astrakhan spotted fever were
registered, with an increase of morbidity from 6 cases (0.6 per 100,000
population) in 1983 to 204 cases (19.9 per 100,000 population) in 1997.
In parallel with a morbidity increase the list of villages involved is
growing too.
Rickettsia carriers in foci are ticks (_Rhipicephalus pumilio_).
Astrakhan spotted fever is similar clinically and epidemiologically to the
Marseilles [spotted] fever in Mediterranean Provinces, but the former
differs in seasonal incidence and sporadic cases with annual [severity] of
clinical picture of the disease.

Astrakhan fever is an acute febrile disease caused by a spotted fever group
_Rickettsia_ sp. It is endemic to rural areas of Astrakhan of the Russian
economic federation. Astrakhan is part of the Volga economic region in the
northeastern section of the Caspian Sea bordering Kazakhstan. Clinical
manifestations of Astrakhan fever include high fever, maculo-papular rash,
headache, insomnia and severe myalgias, and resemble Mediterranean spotted
fever (MSF) which is caused by _Rickettsia conorii_. Astrakhan fever is
distinguished by the low rate of tache noire (eschar [black focal skin
lesion at location of the tick bite - Mod.JW]) that is characteristic of
MSF. Serologic and phylogenetic studies have shown relatedness among the
Astrakhan fever isolate, _R.conorii_ and _Rickettsia israeli_ that allow
grouping the three rickettsia into a _R. conorii_ complex.
In addition the _Rhipicephalus_ tick complex transmits the three rickettsia.
