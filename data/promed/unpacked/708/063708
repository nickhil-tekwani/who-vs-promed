Between January and June 2007, a total of 90 cases of measles were
notified in Passau and Rottal-Inn, 2 districts of Lower Bavaria in
southeast Germany sharing a border with Austria. Almost 30 percent of
the cases (n=26) attended a local Montessori school frequented by
pupils from the 2 affected districts and from Austria.
A case was defined as a resident of one of the affected districts
with onset of symptoms (generalised maculopapular rash lasting 3 or
more days, fever, and at least one of the following symptoms: cough,
coryza, Koplik spots, or conjunctivitis) between 12 January (week 2)
and 8 May (week 19) 2007. A case was laboratory-confirmed by
significantly increased measles-specific IgM antibody titres or by
detection of measles virus (MV) nucleic acid.
Outbreak description
--------------------
Between week 5 (end of January) and week 22 (end of May) of 2007, a
total of 90 cases of measles were notified to the District Health
Authorities (DHA) in Passau and Rottal-Inn. The 2 primary cases (aged
7 months and 3 years) developed measles in mid-January [2007] after a
trip to Switzerland where, according to their mother, they had been
in contact with measles-infected individuals. However, since they did
not consult a physician during the course of the disease, they were
not notified to the health authorities until 2 months later. In late
January and early February [2007], 4 contacts from their family and
neighbourhood aged 9-16 years fell ill with measles. Of these 4
cases, 2 attended the above-mentioned Montessori school. From there,
the outbreak spread to 7 other schools and one kindergarten. An
institution was considered affected by the outbreak when there were
at least 2 cases from different families.
[The original text provides a figure showing the course of the
outbreak by week of onset of symptoms and by week of notification.]
The exact date of onset is missing for 9 cases, all of whom were
notified in week 11 [12-18 Mar 2007]. Comparison of the 2 datasets
highlights the delay between onset of disease and case notification,
amounting to 3 weeks at the outset of the outbreak. The majority of
cases with known date of onset fell ill between week 8 [19-25 Feb
2007] and 16 [16-22 Apr 2007] (n=70, 86 percent). The outbreak peaked
in week 12 [19-25 Mar 2007] with 14 new cases. Only 4 cases fell ill
after week 16 [16-22 Apr 2007]. The numbers of new cases decreased
after the start of the Easter holidays in week 14 [2-8 Apr 2007].
Case description
----------------
Cases were between one month (no laboratory confirmation,
epidemiological link with 16-year-old sister also not
laboratory-confirmed) and 27 years of age with more than half in the
early school age, that is, 6-11 years (n=53, 59 percent) (Figure 2).
55 cases were female (61 percent). The median age was 9 years for both sexes.
According to the vaccination history, as many as 81 cases (90
percent) were without protection provided by vaccination at the time
of infection and no case had received 2 doses of measles vaccine
[data tabulated in the original text.]. It should be noted, however,
that 2 cases were below one year of age, that is, below the
recommended age for measles vaccination.
A total of 6 cases (7 percent, aged 16 months to 27 years) required
hospitalisation: 4 for fever and a 10-year-old child for an adverse
reaction to penicillin that he had received for suspected scarlet
fever. A 16-month-old boy suffered from fever and conjunctivitis, and
was treated in an Austrian hospital close to the German-Austrian
border. To date, no cases with measles specific complications (such
as pneumonia, otitis media, and encephalitis) have been reported.
Laboratory results
------------------
A total of 22 cases (24 percent, aged 16 months to 27 years) had
laboratory confirmation for measles. 20 cases were serologically
confirmed; 2 of them, however, had received measles vaccination
within 14 days prior to laboratory diagnosis, so a positive antibody
titre due to the vaccination cannot be excluded. The remaining 2
cases had laboratory confirmation by detection of MV nucleic acid
performed at the National Reference Centre (NRC) for Measles, Mumps,
Rubella at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Molecular typing of the
MV detected in these samples showed genotype D5. Sequential typing
revealed a genome sequence identical to that of the main MV strain
linked to the current large outbreak in Switzerland (1).
Public health measures
----------------------
The DHA focused on case ascertainment, contact tracing, and a
comprehensive information campaign for the general public. Press
statements and written information distributed to the heads of
schools and day-care facilities and to physicians in the affected
region included information on the current measles outbreak, on
protective measures including vaccination, and on the legislation
concerning measles and the attendance of schools and day-care
facilities. The DHA sporadically checked vaccination records in
schools and day-care facilities. Parents of non- or partially
vaccinated children were advised to complete their child's
vaccination schedule. However, the number of resulting vaccinations is unknown.
Discussion
----------
The measles outbreak described here originated in a population of
non-immunised pupils of a Montessori school, and lasted for over 4
months (week 2 [8-14 Jan] to week 19 [7-13 May], 2007). Presumably,
the control measures implemented by the DHA, the limited number of
susceptible individuals in the region, and the Easter holidays (weeks
14-15 [2-15 Apr 2007]), which limited the contacts among pupils and
children in day-care facilities, all contributed to the end of the outbreak.
It is possible that a large number of infections could have been
prevented by stricter and timelier public health interventions,
including an on-site vaccination offer. However, this was not
feasible mainly due to delay between onset of disease and case
notification especially at the beginning of the outbreak. A
pre-requisite for early outbreak detection is case notification by
health professionals and by heads of schools and day-care facilities.
The latter would have been particularly important in this outbreak
since the primary cases and their contacts did not consult physicians.
In 2005, vaccination coverage with at least 2 doses of measles
vaccine was 70 percent among first graders (5-7 years) in both
affected districts. Coverage with at least one dose was 94 percent
and 92 percent in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn,
respectively (2). The figures only represent pupils with available
vaccination records (approx. 90 percent in both districts) and are
probably an overestimation of the true vaccination coverage. However,
the figures are higher than for the whole of Bavaria. This shows that
gaps in vaccination coverage are likely to exist in subpopulations
with a sceptical attitude towards measles vaccination like the
families of Montessori school pupils in this outbreak. Actions aiming
at a further increase of measles vaccination coverage should
especially target these sub-populations and their physicians.
The MV strain identified during this outbreak was not only found in
Switzerland. Further epidemiological investigations and genotyping
allow us to reconstruct a chain of infection from Switzerland via
Bavaria to Austria, Lower Saxony in northern Germany, and Denmark
(detailed results to be published soon). The outbreak described in
this paper occurred in an area close to the German-Austrian border
where residents of both countries consult physicians on both sides of
the border, according to proximity to their place of residence. To
date, 3 Austrian measles cases (out of a total of nine cases of
measles reported in 2007 to the Austrian National Reference
Laboratory for Measles, Mumps, Rubella) were linked to the Bavarian
outbreak (personal communication with Professor Heidemarie Holzmann,
3 Oct 2007). However, since the reporting of cases among residents of
a foreign country is not mandatory for German and Austrian
physicians, active case finding would be needed to better assess the
size of the outbreak. This demonstrates the need of an
institutionalised approach to exchange of information on infectious
diseases across international borders, if the World Health
Organization (WHO) goal of measles elimination by 2010 is to be achieved.

[This report highlights continuing problems in eradication of measles
even in highly immunised populations as a consequence of the
existence of minorities reluctant to accept vaccination. The spread
of a single strain of measles virus from Switzerland, via the border
region of South Germany and Austria to North Germany and eventually
to Denmark, illustrates the critical need for close international
collaboration in measles surveillance. - Mod.CP]
