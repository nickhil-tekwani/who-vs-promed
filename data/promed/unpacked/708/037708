[This new outbreak in Maseru is distant to the south from the Berea outbreak reported in March 2014, and for which we just now have a belated vaccination report. The Maseru outbreak is in fact during this summer's season, while the earlier Berea outbreak was in last summer's season. Maseru had previous outbreaks in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2013. Berea has had previous outbreaks in 2009, 2012 and 2013.

The recent outbreak in Mohale's Hoek is close to the SE border with South Africa, and might well reflect a cross-border ecology and epidemiology of that region, shared with its neighbour. The earlier known outbreak in Mohale's Hoek was in 2010 and 2011.

Over the years there have been not infrequent human cases, usually just a handful. But in 2008, there were 29 human cases with 3 deaths, and in 2012, 238 cases with 2 deaths. But this is to be expected if livestock outbreaks are treated retrospectively when they are noted officially. - Mod.MHJ
