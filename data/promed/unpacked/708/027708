The disease which has claimed 3 lives in Lamtaput block of Koraput district
during the last 2 weeks has been confirmed as anthrax, according to a
private hospital where the patients were treated. [See my comments
regarding the diagnosis - Mod. LL] Specimen of the skin lesion found
on the patients had been sent to the Christian Medical College (CMC)
at Vellore who confirmed it as anthrax, Dr. Manoj Jacob, the treating
physician at Asha Kiran Hospital at Lamtaput said.

"The lesions were typical of anthrax and we sent it to CMC for
confirmation", he said. Jacob said that the hospital, which had a
tie-up with CMC, had not received such patients of late except the
one who came on Mon, 23 Jun. "We are treating him for anthrax", he
said.

He said that the people got infected while skinning dead cattle and
the lesions, if not treated, led to septicemia which was fatal.
Anthrax could develop in the intestine or lungs if rotten cattle
flesh was eaten without proper cooking, Jacob said.

Describing the disease as highly infectious, he said that a patient
chose to go to the disari (village quack) who pretended to treat him
by blowing into his face. The next day, the disari himself landed in
the hospital with similar symptoms [see discussion below - Mod.LL].
National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi has asked the
health authorities at Koraput to send the samples of any fresh
"suspected anthrax" cases.

"Our officers have talked to the state and district health
authorities. We have offered all technical help," NICD director Dr
Shiv Lal said. "If there is a need, we will send a team to
investigate," he said. NICD has rapid response teams in various
districts under its national surveillance programme for communicable
diseases, Lal said. But, according to the information available with
the NICD, last "suspected anthrax" case was reported on 14 Jun. There
have been 14 suspected cases from Jan 2003 to until this outbreak and
one death, he said.

Health ministry sources said that Anthrax in cattle was common in
India. As the spores of the disease causing agent are able to live on
grass for 40-50 years, when cattle eat infected grass, they get
gastrointestinal anthrax. Some communities such as kurgis in
Karnataka eat dead cattle, getting infected in the process. The
disease is endemic in some areas of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, they
said. 3-4 years back, some deaths were reported in Karnataka, they
added.

[It remains unclear how many of the cases and deaths were from the
uncommon septicemic dissemination of cutaneous anthrax and how
primary were primary visceral forms such as gastrointestinal. The
statement that anthrax is highly infectious from person-to-person as
stated in the posting is untrue. The infectious form of _B.
anthracis_ is the spore and in the human host, spores are not
excreted. If the scenario involving the disari is correct then the
diagnosis (at least in the disari) is not likely to be anthrax -
perhaps the disari was a co-primary case. - Mod. LL]

[Prohibition of skinning and opening of anthrax carcasses is an
elementary requirement. They should be covered with kerosene or crude
oil to keep flies, dogs and prey animals away until their disposal by
complete incineration or deep (at least 2 meters) burial. Otherwise,
additional cases in animals grazing on the the said plot will follow
- for decades. - Mod. AS]
