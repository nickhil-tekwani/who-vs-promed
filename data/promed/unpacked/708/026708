Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia [CBPP], Niger
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 15 Dec 2020 from Dr. Issiako Abdou, Director General of Veterinary Services, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, Niamey, Niger

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 3 Dec 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 6 Dec 2020
Report date: 15 Dec 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 15 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides SC_
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Ingari, Bankilare, Tillaberi
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Dec 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 35 / 7 / 5 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 20 / 14.29 / 71.43 / 14.29
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with infected animals(s) at grazing/watering
Epidemiological comments: The disease is notified by Niger through the 6-monthly reports as being present in the country limited to one or more zones. However, the disease was not present in this area of the region, where vaccination is regularly applied. A few years ago, due to the lack of vaccination, the disease occurred for the 1st time in this village, hence this notification. Niger has a national strategic plan for the control of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia.

Control measures
Measures applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, zoning, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), ante- and post-mortem inspections

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: LABOCEL (national laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 6 Dec 2020 / Positive
Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 6 Dec 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle and water buffalo caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _Mycoides_ (_M. mycoides_). As the name suggests, it attacks the lungs and the membranes that line the thoracic cavity (the pleura), causing fever and respiratory signs such as laboured or rapid respiration, cough and nasal discharges.

"Because it is highly contagious with a mortality rate of up to 50%, it causes significant economic losses. CBPP is a prominent cattle disease in Africa.

"CBPP is a disease listed by the OIE in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Member countries are obligated to report occurrences of the disease according to the standards in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

"The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code specifies the steps a country must follow in order to be officially recognized by the OIE as free of CBPP.

"Transmission of the disease occurs through direct contact between an infected and a susceptible animal which becomes infected by inhaling droplets disseminated by coughing. Since some animals can carry the disease without showing signs of illness, controlling the spread is more difficult.

"There is no evidence of transmission through fomites (inanimate objects such as clothing, implements or vehicles), as the organism does not persist in the environment.

"Humans are not known to be susceptible to contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, so there is no public health risk."
