The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) today [27
Jan 2011] notified veterinary and border authorities in Asia of a
major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the Republic of
Korea [South Korea], urging them to be on the look-out for livestock
showing signs of infection by the highly contagious animal disease.

FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep, goats and
pigs, causing high fever. It is characterized by lesions in the
animals' mouths and feet. The disease does not affect humans.

FAO said that the Republic of Korea has since late November last year
[2010] imposed quarantines, initiated a vaccination campaign that is
targeting 9 million pigs and 3 million head of cattle, and culled 2.2
million livestock.

The overall cost of the FMD control effort in the Republic of Korea is
estimated at about USD 1.6 billion, according to FAO, which described
the outbreak as "unprecedented."

"The current FMD dynamics in eastern Asia, as well as the magnitude of
the outbreak in South Korea, are unlike anything that we've seen for
at least a half century," said Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary
Officer. "This makes preparedness and monitoring extremely important
right now. Authorities in Asia should make sure they are in a position
to detect any instances of the disease and respond rapidly in an
appropriate way. FAO is advocating proactive vaccination campaigns
designed to stop the spread of the disease," said Mr. Lubroth.

Subhash Morzaria, the Asia Regional Manager of FAO's Emergency Centre
for Transboundary Animal Disease Operations, said the outbreak must be
tackled as a regional problem. He said the agency's regional office
for Asia and the Pacific is planning a meeting of chief veterinary
officers of East Asian countries to discuss the current situation and
coordinate the response.

Mr. Lubroth noted that when responding to outbreaks, countries should
adhere to accepted practices that adequately take animal welfare and
environmental impacts into account. FAO said that media reports of an
FMD outbreak in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
[North Korea] have not been confirmed by authorities there.

According to the agency, FMD spread through China in recent years and
entered eastern regions of Russia and Mongolia for the 1st time. The
disease recently affected an estimated 1.5 million Mongolian gazelles,
whose migration may have helped carry the virus into China. FAO sent
an emergency response team to Mongolia to help authorities cope with
the disease.

Mr. Lubroth said that overall, the situation in Asia is a cause for
concern, given the approaching Lunar New Year holiday during which
large numbers of people will be on the move in the region, many of
them carrying meat and some transporting animals. One of the early
signs of the disease in infected animals is the excessive production
of saliva and nasal discharges. The FMD virus may survive for several
hours outside the infected animal, especially in cold and humid
environments.

[FAO is traditionally engaged in the control of TAD's (Transboundary
Animal Diseases), with FMD being one of the top rank entities. The
organisation's active involvement in the containment of the current
epizootic in east and southeast Asia is indeed essential. One of the
tasks to be handled at the earliest is the examination of the
appropriateness of the vaccine(s) used in the region. Has the
vaccination in S. Korea (allegedly, with the O Manissa vaccine strain)
been proven to be effective? In particular, is it effective in pigs?

While in S. Korea one single strain of FMDV serotype O has been
identified so far (namely topotype SEA, strain Mya-98), another
serotype-O strain is known to be circulating in the region, namely
Topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia. In Viet Nam, for example, both strains
have been shown to be circulating simultaneously (see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm>). According to
official reports, FMDV serotype O is known to be currently active in
12 of Viet Nam's provinces (Son La, Quang Ninh, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Cao
Bang, Dien Bien, Thai Nguyen, Ha Giang, Kon Tum, Nghe An, Hoa Binh and
Tuyen Quang). Have the vaccines used there been tested on their
efficacy to render protection against both the afore-mentioned strains?

FAO hosts the prestigious EUFMD commission, a powerful and experienced
body engaging leading FMD experts as well as the World Reference FMD
Laboratory. Their involvement in the complex job of controlling the
current epizootic, preventing its further spread while becoming
panzootic, will be promising news. - Mod.AS]
