been wandering around cyberspace since then. Airmail would have been

Europewide alert over Italian bottled vegetables
---------------------------------------------------------
A warning has gone to all Member States of the European Union after a
patient was treated for botulism at the Istituto Superiore Di Sanita,
Rome. Botulinum toxin was apparently detected in the product eaten by
the patient [in Aug 1998].
The product is marketed under two different names -- either
"Ribollita Toscana", or "Minestrone Di Verdure". It is manufactured
and packed by "Fattorie Toscana Riunite SRL (Lucca) at a factory in
Bolgheri-Bibbona (Livorno), Italy. It is contained in glass jars with
a net weight of either 340g or 640g, and has a 'best before' date of
31/12/2002.
The product is distributed within France, Germany, and Switzerland.
