Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to chicken
-----------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections linked to kosher chicken.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _Salmonella_ from ill people in this outbreak showed that they are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 27 Aug 2018, 17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- have been reported from 4 states.

State / Ill people
Maryland / 1
New York / 11
Pennsylvania / 4
Virginia / 1
Total / 17

Illnesses started on dates from 25 Sep 2017 to 4 Jun 2018. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 76, with a median age of 14. 53 percent are female. Of 16 people with information available, 8 (50%) have been hospitalized, including a death reported from New York. Illnesses may continue to be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 14 people interviewed, all (100%) reported eating chicken products. Of 9 people who reported brand information, 7 reported specifically eating Empire Kosher brand chicken.

The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- has been identified in samples from raw chicken collected at 2 facilities, including one that processes Empire Kosher brand chicken. The samples collected by USDA-FSIS at the slaughter and processing establishments were part of USDA-FSIS' routine testing under the _Salmonella_ performance standards. WGS showed that the _Salmonella_ strain from these samples is closely related genetically to the _Salmonella_ strain from ill people.

Available data indicate that some kosher chicken products are contaminated with this strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- and have made people sick. Consumers should be aware that any raw chicken may be contaminated with germs and should always follow steps to prevent salmonellosis from these products.

[This is the CDC report regarding an outbreak of salmonellosis associated with kosher chicken occurring in 4 eastern USA states, primarily New York. Since salmonellosis is a hazard from a variety of foodstuffs including chicken, any raw chicken should be appropriately cooked, practicing good kitchen hygiene to avoid contamination of the kitchen and the food after it is cooked. - Mod.LL
