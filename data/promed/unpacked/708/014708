[1] Cases in past week

Nigerian health officials reported 68 new confirmed Lassa fever cases during the past week from 7 states: Edo (35 cases), Ondo (19), Bauchi (1), Ebonyi (7), Anambra (4), Imo (1) and FCT (1) [Federal Capital Territory] with 4 new deaths in confirmed cases from 2 states: Ondo (2), and Bauchi (2).

From [Mon 1 Jan - Sun 18 Feb 2018], a total of 913 suspected cases, and 73 deaths have been reported from 17 active States (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, and Gombe).

Since the onset of the 2018, 277 cases have been classified as: 272 confirmed cases, 5 probable cases with 59 deaths (54 in Lab confirmed and 5 in probable). Case Fatality Rate in confirmed and probable cases is 21 percent.

Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa.

Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.

The symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.

There is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever.

The Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria

[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. As reported recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

As noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients, and is most effective if the patients is treated early in the course of infection.

Director of Disease Control, Edo State, Dr. Osamuwonyi Irowa, has said that the state recorded 521 suspected cases of Lassa fever this month [February 2018].

Irowa disclosed this at the inauguration of the Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin yesterday [Wed 21 Feb 2018].

He said 124 cases had been confirmed out of the 521 suspected cases recorded in 13 local government areas.

The director, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), also said 15 deaths were recorded with 509 cases under surveillance, while 10 suspected cases had developed symptoms.

Inaugurating the centre, the Deputy Governor, Mr. Phillip Shaibu, said that the Lassa fever response mechanism was aimed at ensuring a coordinated control of the epidemic. He charged the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to encourage volunteers to support their staff for effective control of the disease. Shaibu said government was working towards building isolation centres to decongest the patient population at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital.

[With cases scattered over 17 states, support efforts by the NCDC and others are likely being stretched thinly over the affected areas. The newly established Edo state Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin will be a good local support unit for the state.
