An outbreak of measles -- the 2nd of its kind this year [2010] -- has been
declared after 8 cases of the disease were confirmed in Northern Ireland
over the last few weeks.

The 1st 2 cases were associated with a volunteer youth work initiative
which took place over a weekend, and there have since been 6 further
associated cases. They were at Down High School, Cedar Integrated Primary
School in Downpatrick, Belfast Bible College in Dunmurry, and Queen's
University. None of those diagnosed had had the measles vaccination (MMR).

The Public Health Agency (PHA) has written to anyone who could have been
exposed, advising them of the situation and the need to rapidly protect
unvaccinated individuals with the MMR [mumps, measles and rubella] vaccine.
The PHA advises that anyone who may have been in contact with a measles
case and who feels unwell should stay at home, as this is an infectious
condition before the associated rash develops. Nine to 11 days after
becoming infected, symptoms including a runny nose, watery eyes, swollen
eyelids and sneezing, red eyes, temperature and aches and pains begin to
appear.

Dr Lorraine Doherty, Assistant Director of Public Health (Health
Protection) at PHA, said: "These cases are of serious concern and remind us
that there is no room for complacency. It is vitally important to ensure
young people's vaccinations are up to date." It is important that anyone
with suspected measles should not be in a situation where they can spread
the disease, such as a GP [general practitioner] waiting room or an
accident and emergency waiting room. People should, therefore, phone in
advance and get advice rather than just turning up to these places.

[By way of comparison, and to put this information in perspective, the most
recent figures from the Health Protection Agency indicate that the total
number of measles cases confirmed in England and Wales for the year to the
end of August [2010] is 292, with 67 new diagnoses in August 2010 compared
with 100 during the previous month.

Although some of the cases in August 2010 were associated with ongoing
outbreaks in traveller communities, there were also a small number of
clusters and sporadic cases outside these communities. Cases are
predominantly children under 18 years of age (73 per cent). A detailed age
breakdown of cases for 2010 to the end of August 2010 by region is
available on the HPA website at
