Samples from 2 Shenzhen wet markets have tested positive for the H7N9 bird flu virus that has infected 2 people in Hong Kong.

Confirmation of the test findings came 2 days after the municipal government said the border city could not be confirmed as the source of the outbreak.

The Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong said yesterday [Tue 10 Dec 2013] that H7N9 had been detected in 3 samples of blood and urine taken from poultry stalls at 2 wet markets in Shenzhen's Longgang district.

The infected samples were among 70 collected on Tue [10 Dec 2013] from 13 wet markets across the city. One infected sample came from a chopping board at a stall selling live poultry at the Henggang market. The other 2 were found in chicken urine from a stall at the Kangqiao market in the Nanwan neighbourhood.

The commission said the risk of bird flu spreading in the province was high and warned the public to stay alert.

But last night [10 Dec 2013], traders at the Kangqiao market said sales were continuing. "They came to collect samples, but we heard nothing about the test results, and trade continued all day long today," one trader said.

University of Hong Kong microbiologist Ho Pak-leung said he believed the deadly virus was already spreading in Guangdong and the surrounding areas.

He urged Hong Kong to halt live poultry imports from the mainland. At present, only imports from 3 Shenzhen farms are suspended.

Ho said the Longgang markets may have been responsible for the infection of a 36-year-old Indonesian domestic helper [name withheld] who may have handled a live chicken at a flat in Nanwan Street, near one of the infected markets. The 2nd Hong Kong patient is an 80-year-old man who recently spent time in Shenzhen. The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection said he had not handled live chickens. His family had bought a slaughtered chicken near Fuyong town in Baoan district, far from where the positive samples were found.

[The H7N9 issue in southeastern China became subject to OIE's considerations in April 2013. The virus was found to circulate primarily in poultry live markets without clinical manifestation in the birds but causing serious disease and mortality in contact persons. The intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) was found to be 0, and the gene sequencing showed that the agent was a "low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI)." In view of the public health impact, China commendably reported to the OIE all virus detections related to poultry, either from the birds or from the "environment." As "reason for notification," the expression applied was "new strain of a listed disease."

Between 4 Apr and 21 May 2013, 21 "outbreaks" of "LPAI H7N9" were reported (in 10 reports). For all reports and a map showing the respective locations, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013474_20130521_113421.pdf.

OIE issued 3 press releases on the issue, as follows:

1. "The OIE, World Organisation for Animal Health, highlights the exceptional nature of the influenza A(H7N9) event notified by China" (11 Apr 2013), at http://tinyurl.com/cexsv5l.

2. "Questions and Answers on influenza A(H7N9);" (11 Apr 2013), at http://tinyurl.com/bw4ebjk.

3. "OIE expert mission finds live bird markets play a key role in poultry and human infections with influenza A(H7N9)," (30 Apr 2013), at http://tinyurl.com/cltzu6b.

Shenzhen is a major city in the south of southern China's Guangdong Province, situated immediately north of Hong Kong.

Shanghai has recently decided to suspend live poultry trading from 31 Jan 2014, the 1st day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, until 30 Apr 2014 in order to prevent a recurrence of the bird flu.

It will be interesting to see whether other municipalities in southeast China follow Shanghai's example. - Mod.AS
