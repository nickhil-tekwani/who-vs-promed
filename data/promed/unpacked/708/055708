Patients with high-grade fever, headache, bodyache, rashes, eschars, red eyes, and not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, have been found to have contracted scrub typhus. According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD), so far 75 cases tested positive for scrub typhus (by ELISA), while new cases are still being reported from various parts of the country.

Although, a study published in 2004 showed scrub typhus among febrile adults in Kathmandu, no fatal cases were reported. Nevertheless, at least 8 patients infected with scrub typhus have died in the current ongoing outbreak (2015), which is the 1st known large-scale epidemic with high case fatality rate in Nepal. Some of the patients (from a neighboring district Dhading) diagnosed with scrub typhus had been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, and recovered uneventfully after treatment with doxycycline. The current epidemic emphasizes training programs for scrub typhus for health care providers, so as to suspect scrub typhus early and treat accordingly to prevent complications or death.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for alerting us to the presence of scrub typhus in Nepal. He says that 75 cases tested positive for scrub typhus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The scrub typhus ELISA when performed with 56 KDa antigen has 90 percent or greater sensitivity and specificity and provides positive results within 3-4 days after the onset of illness (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17034691, http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1395.full, http://cvi.asm.org/content/10/3/394.full, and http://www.afrims.org/weblib/eapr/2006_7/p39-40.pdf).

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun is likely referring to a 2001 study that documented scrub typhus among 28 out of 876 adults in Kathmandu, presenting with a non-specific febrile illness; none of the 28 had an eschar and no fatal cases were reported (1). A serodiagnosis of scrub typhus in the 28 patients was based on the presence of IgM antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) (http://www.ajtmh.org/content/72/1/10.full).
