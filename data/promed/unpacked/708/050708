The National Health Institute (INS) of the Ministry of Health (Minsa) confirms a case of melioidosis in a 19-year-old woman, who died 47 days ago in a clinic in Lima. She was touring in the north coast of the country, and her diagnosis was pneumonia and sepsis by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, which produces a disease called melioidosis.

Melioidosis is a potentially fatal disease for which treatment is available. It is acquired mainly by the contact of the skin (with small wounds) with soil, muddy soil or contaminated water. It can also be acquired by ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water or inhalation of contaminated soil dust. Transmission from person to person is very rare.

The symptoms depend mainly on the location of the infection and the patient's immune status. The risk of presenting severe forms and even death from this disease is greater in patients with diabetes, chronic renal failure, alcoholic hepatitis, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and immunosuppressive treatment. The groups most at risk of acquiring this disease are agricultural workers (especially those engaged in rice farming), rural dwellers in the tropics, people visiting endemic areas and military personnel. It has been reported in tropical and subtropical countries in Asia, Australia/Pacific Islands, India, Africa and less commonly in Central America and the Caribbean. Sporadic cases of the disease have been reported in Ecuador, Guyana and Brazil (according to the CDC in Atlanta, USA).

An investigation is currently under way to determine precisely the origin of the infection. There is no evidence of additional confirmed cases of melioidosis in our country [Peru] and therefore does not pose a danger to public health. It should be noted that antimicrobials are available for the treatment of melioidosis which are in the pharmacological request of the Ministry of Health.

[It is presumed that the case was acquired in South America as a travel history outside Peru is not stated. It is also not stated if the diagnosis was made pre- or postmortem.

This recently published paper (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al., Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016;1:15008. doi: 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2015.8., PMID: 27571754, article available at, http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158.pdf) for 2015 estimates the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:

Area / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands
South Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42
East Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31
Sub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15
Latin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1
Middle East and North Africa / 49 / less than 1 / less than 1

Although a classical infection in eastern Asia and Northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, the Caribbean basin, Central America, and as in this case, South America. - Mod.LL
