Dutch cull birds in 3rd find of bird flu signs
------------------------------------------------
The Dutch government has ordered some 1000 birds culled at a farm in
the south, the 3rd time in a week that tests have shown signs of
antibodies to a mild strain of bird flu, the farm ministry said on
Thu, 18 Mar 2004.
The farm in Steenbergen had links to a farm in Lopik, in the centre
of the country, where the authorities on Wed, 16 Mar 2004, ordered
the culling of 600 ducks, after antibodies showed up that could
indicate the birds were in contact with the contagious virus.
The ministry suspected the antibodies developed after the 2 farms had
imported ducks.
"The source may have been 2 shipments of a total of 2500 ducks from
abroad. We suspect that they may have been carriers of a low
pathogenic strain of the virus," Nienke van der Zee, a spokeswoman at
the agriculture ministry, said.
5 other farms, which also received ducks from the 2 shipments, are
still under investigation. Test results may come on Friday or over
the weekend, Van der Zee said. She declined to identify the country
that had exported the ducks.
Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman will bring up the issue of
preventing another outbreak of bird flu at the next meeting of
European agriculture ministers in Brussels on Monday.
During 2003 a mild form of the virus mutated into an aggressive
variant, leading to the slaughter of 1/4 of all Dutch poultry at a
cost of hundreds of millions of euros.
The ministry said antibodies found in the latest 2 farms were for a
different strain of bird flu than antibodies found at the Eemsmond
farm in the northeast of the country on Saturday, where all 22 000
chickens were culled [see comment].
At Steenbergen, 442 ducks, 531 chickens, 5 turkeys, 9 geese, and 77
doves were culled.
Russia on Wednesday suspended poultry and poultry product imports
from the Netherlands to prevent the spread of bird flu,
The Netherlands has the right to export poultry meat to Russia within
a 205 000-tonne quota issued to the European Union together with
countries that plan to join the bloc in 2004.
The European Union's largest poultry exporter slaughtered 30.7
million birds at some 1300 farms to contain the outbreak of the virus
that led to one human death.
Avian influenza has spread across much of Asia in recent months,
killing at least 15 people in Viet Nam, 7 in Thailand [now 8; see
20040317.0738. - Mod.AS] and sparking fears of a crisis like that
caused by the outbreak during 2003 of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS).

[According to preliminary data from the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture
(see 20040318.0753), the avian influenza virus strain identified in
the other affected duck-farm was an H5; the chicken farm in Groningen
was infected by an H7 strain.
The Dutch daily Agrarisch Dagblad said on Fri 19 Mar 2004 that the H5
positive ducks, discovered in Lopik, might have been imported from
France. Confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated.
Agrarisch Dagblad further says that 7 additional contact farms are
currently under epidemiological investigation. - Mod.AS]
