A/H1N1 influenza, Canada
------------------------
Information received on 5 May 2009 from Dr Brian Evans, Chief
Veterinary Officer, 59 Camelot Drive, Room 146 W, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 21 Apr 2009
Date of first confirmation of the event: 1 May 2009
Report date: 2 May 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 5 May 2009
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 25 percent
Mortality: 0 percent
Zoonotic impact: possible transmission of the novel A/H1N1 influenza
virus from humans to pigs.
Causal agent: novel A/H1N1 2009 influenza virus
Serotype: other
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Alberta (Clearwater county)
Affected population: farrow/finishing operation: 220 sows and their
piglets in 2 barns and 1800 growers in 4 barns. Clinical signs
(respiratory) were observed in the grower population. Mortality
slightly increased in the last few days in weanlings but at this
point, it is not certain how much of this is attributable to A/H1N1
influenza virus infection.
Total animals affected
Species: swine
Susceptible: 2020
Cases: 450
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: 22.28 percent
Apparent mortality rate: 0 percent
Apparent case fatality rate: 0 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 0 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: possible
transmission from humans to pigs.
Epidemiological comments: A carpenter hired by the farm owner
(ALB-001) travelled to Mexico recently and returned to Canada on 12
Apr 2009. The carpenter, the producer, and the producer's family had
been ill with flu like symptoms between 14-29 Apr [2009].
Investigation of human cases by the Public Health authorities is
underway.

A Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) team attended the premises
on 28 Apr [2009] and collected samples from swine for influenza virus
testing.

Swabs and serum samples were received at the CFIA National Centre for
Foreign Animal Diseases (NCFAD) in Winnipeg on 29 Apr 2009. The
samples were run in conventional RT-PCR for the Matrix and the H1
gene (primers kindly provided by the PHAC [Public Health Agency of
Canada] National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg). These results
showed that 19/24 samples were positive for the M gene and 15/24
samples positive for the H1 gene.

This was immediately followed up by sequencing of these PCR products
(6 samples for the Matrix and 5 for the H1 gene). The sequences of a
segment of approximately 244 nucleotides of the Matrix gene from 6
samples showed that this sequence was 100 percent (for the 244
nucleotides sequenced) identical to sequences derived from the novel
A/H1N1 influenza virus from the USA and Mexico and similar results
(99-100 percent identity) were found for around 500 nucleotides of
the H1 gene from 5 samples. The sequences derived from the pig
samples were identical to each other and for the M gene most similar
to the Eurasian lineage while the H1 gene is more reminiscent of the
North American lineage as would be expected for this novel virus.

Additional sequencing of part of the N gene clearly shows that this
is a N1 virus and the sequence of the approximately 1400 nucleotide
fragment is highly related to the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus. It is
thus confirmed that this is the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus and
being very closely related to the human strains based on the genes
sequenced so far. Full characterisation is continuing and so is virus
isolation in eggs.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; no vaccination; no treatment of affected
animals.

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name ant type: CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal
Diseases - Winnipeg (national laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: gene sequencing
Test date: 4 May 2009
Result: positive
Species: swine
Test: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date: 1 May 2009
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is an absolutely fascinating report as it clearly indicates how
the proverbial zoonotic bridge is a 2-lane highway. Humans and
animals can interface and transmit disease through many varied and
unpredictable scenarios as illustrated by the events described here.
The story also highlights the need for surveillance on swine farms
particularly those where the unusual chance contacts between an ill
human and pigs would have occurred early in this outbreak, before
awareness of this virus got disseminated and the importance of
keeping sick people off swine farms fully realized everywhere. Thus,
swine farms in Mexico, Texas, and California near the location of
early human cases should intensively evaluate any respiratory disease
and include the new, novel influenza A (H1N1) as a potential
differential diagnosis. Broad efforts at surveillance in swine
populations should be a definite priority at this point in the
outbreak.

The decision not to cull the pigs may very well be because they had
already recovered from the respiratory signs indicated but
clarification would be helpful. ProMED-mail will also be very
interested in the results of the follow up investigations of the
people involved at the Alberta farm. - Mods.PC/MHJ/AS]
