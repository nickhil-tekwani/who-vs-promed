Another 3 people have died of cholera in [Siaya] county, raising the death toll to 8 since last week. County Public Health Officer Mabel Chanzu said 119 more cases of those infected have been reported, bringing the number of those admitted in hospital to 140. The victims have been admitted to Ambira hospital, Simenya dispensary, Rangala, and St Paul's missions' hospitals in Ugunja, while others are in Ukwala Sub-county Hospital and Sifuyo health centre in Ugenya. In Alego Usonga, patients are admitted to Siaya County Referral Hospital, Rwambwa and Rabar health centres, and Inuka Dispensary in Gem. "We are working with community health workers to help in educating the public on the importance of using treated water," said Chanzu.

The major sources of the infection are Uludhi and Wuoroya rivers that cut across the villages in Ugunja, Gem, and Alego Usonga sub-counties and River Nzoia in Ugenya. By last [Wed 24 Feb 2016], 5 people had died and 69 others were admitted to hospital after the 1st outbreak of cholera in 2016. "We are now doing door-to-door sensitisation as a way of containing the disease," she added.

Chanzu said health teams were also visiting funerals and village barazas [place where public meetings are held] to educate the public. She also added that they are working on water quality control where they distribute water treatment chemicals like pur, aqua tab, chlorine granules, and water guard. "We are educating the residents on how to use the chlorine chemicals and we allow them to demonstrate to ensure they are well educated. The people are also being advised on water, especially to avoid using a particular water source for drinking, cooking, bathing and washing," said Chanzu.

She said public health teams had put up cholera treatment units in health centres, which are well equipped to prevent and control the spread.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Busia County)

A person has died while 10 others admitted to Port Victoria Hospital following a cholera outbreak in Budalangi Sub-County. Health Chief Officer Asoka Itur said the number was likely to rise because more patients with cholera symptoms were being admitted. Dr Itur said lack of water in the area was the leading cause of the disease, adding that the cases were mainly from homes around River Nzoia.

"For the last one month, locals have not been supplied with clean water but the issue has been resolved. Most of the people in the region use water from River Nzoia which is contaminated," he said. Dr Itur said they have admitted cases from Bunyala West, Sigiri, Sirisia, Magombe East, Rugunga, and Mabinju. "We have closed down all hotels, public eateries, and cooking joints in the region," he said, calling on locals to observe cleanliness and drink treated water.

Bunyala West MCA [Member of County Assembly] Chris Nakitare called upon residents to dig toilets and stop keeping the dead for a long period. "It is a medical requirement that victims of cholera should be buried immediately to avoid more infections," he said. Mr Nakitare appealed to the county administration to supply more drugs and health personnel at the hospital.

The health department has since deployed community health workers to create awareness about the disease, besides urging residents to work with county officers to prevent any further spread. "We have [an] isolation ward at Port Victoria Hospital to deal with emerging cholera cases," said Dr Itur. Dr Itur added that the county government had started distributing chlorine to the affected homes as well as oral rehydration solutions to help the dehydrated patients regain body fluids.

Cholera cases in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, have increased to 41 with 1 death recorded so far since the waterborne disease broke out early in February 2016, a senior government official said on [Wed 24 Feb 2016]. Ministry of Health acting spokesperson Tasila Pitters said only the death of an 18-month-old female child has been recorded so far, adding that the cumulative number of suspected cases recorded so far were 41 while confirmed laboratory positive cases were 18.

The 1st case was recorded on 4 Feb 2016 in one of the city's sprawling slums and the official said health authorities have since intensified inspection to contain the disease. So far 152 public premises, 52 schools have been inspected in the affected area and 97 water samples collected. According to the official, research conducted in the area has established that the main source of cholera was from contaminated water being used by the community.

The authorities have since distributed 15 518 bottles of chlorine so that residents could treat their water.

This is the 1st time in 6 years that the Zambian capital is experiencing a cholera outbreak.

According to the health department, 7 cases of cholera have been reported in Ilemela District. The acting Mwanza Regional Medical Officer, Onesmo Rwekendera told The Citizen that the patients have been admitted to Karume Health Centre. He said despite efforts to curb the disease, new cases of cholera are cropping up.

"We have involved all health departments in the region to find ways to curb this disease. We have deployed special task forces to create more public awareness on the importance of hygiene including drinking clean and safe water," he said. But the medical officer admits that this task has been difficult due to the high influx of visitors entering Mwanza City.

According to the city council's health officer Osward Mpelasoka a quarantine area for cholera patients has been set up in Igoma Ward on the outskirt of the city: "We are responding to people with diarrhea and dehydration as first steps of action in controlling further spreading." He added that the city council is monitoring and disinfecting areas that have had cases of cholera.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR (Souh Kivu Province)
Date: Mon 22 Feb 2016

More than 100 new cases of cholera, including 2 deaths, were recorded in the health area of Uvira (South Kivu) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since January 2016, according to a Radio Okapi report.

The bacteria are acquired through ingestion of contaminated water or food through a number of mechanisms. Water is usually contaminated by the feces of infected individuals. Drinking water can be contaminated at the source, during transport or during storage at home. Food can get contaminated by soiled hands, during preparation or while eating.

Beverages and ice prepared with contaminated water and fruits and vegetables washed with this water are other examples. Some outbreaks are linked to raw or undercooked seafood.

Treatment of cholera consists of replacement of fluids lost, intravenous replacement in severe cases. Doxycycline or tetracycline antimicrobial therapy can shorten the course of severe disease. There is an oral vaccine available in some countries but it is not available in the US. Cholera prevention is the same as in other causes of traveler's diarrhea.

Cholera, according to the World Health Organization, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100 000 and 120 000.

Diarrhea outbreak in 3 VDCs [Village Development Committees] of western Dailekh [district] has claimed lives of 2 children and downed many others in the last couple of days. Lakandra, Tolijaisi, and Bishala VDCs are grappling with the disease as health officials are scrambling to treat the patients, most of whom are children.

A 7-month-old and an 8-month-old from Tolijaisi VDC died on Saturday night [13 Feb 2016] at a local clinic, the District Public Health Office (DPHO) said. Besides diarrhea, some children are also suffering from pneumonia and fever.

Dr Kikash Sah, who works at a local health centre, said 12 children have been referred to Surkhet [district] for treatment while others are receiving treatment in local health facilities. "Most of the patients are [younger than] 2 years of age. It is still unclear what caused the outbreak," Dr Sah said.

DPHO [District Public Health Office] Chief Dr Nirmal Rasaili health workers are already working in the affected villages while another team from Surkhet Regional Health Director is expected to reach by [Tue 16 Feb 2016].
