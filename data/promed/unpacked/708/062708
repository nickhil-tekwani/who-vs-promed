The Dr Sardjito hospital here have received 2 more suspected bird flu
patients after it earlier received 4 patients. "A patient identified as DS
(14) from Depok, Sleman, was admitted on Saturday evening while DF (1) from
Prambanan, Sleman, on Sunday afternoon," member of the Bird Flu Control
Team of the hospital, Dr Amalia Setyati, said here on Sun 28 Jan 2007. The
result of a quick test shows that DS had been infected with the bird flu
virus, while DF was not.
"This was the result of a quick test with an accuracy rate only 50 percent.
So for the time being the diagnosis must not be used as reference. For
certainty we still have to send their blood samples to the Health
Ministry's research and development center for further and more intensive
tests," she said.
She said 5 [suspected?] bird flu patients were currently being treated at
the hospital. "They were admitted on Friday but YD who was admitted on
Saturday was allowed to go home. However we will only send their blood
samples for the tests to the Health Ministry`s research and development
center on Mon [29 Jan 2007]," she said.
She said 13 medical personnel who had dealt with bird flu patients at the
hospital also had their blood tested as a precaution. "This is merely an
anticipation, because we had direct contact with the patients," she said. A
6-year-old girl who died at the hospital on 19 Jan 2007 had been positive
diagnosed with bird flu [see above]. Her death brought the number of people
killed by bird flu in Indonesia to 63.
