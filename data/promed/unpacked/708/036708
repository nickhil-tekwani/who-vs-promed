Apart from the question of whether the burning temperature will be anywhere near the temperature required to destroy prions, this whole exercise looks suspiciously like a traditional strategy for increasing the deer population for the benefit of hunters. That the theory behind it is emerging from Colorado is particularly odd in view of the Colorado experience with both wildfires and CWD over the past 40 years.

The wildfire history of Colorado over this time is documented here:
http://static.colostate.edu/client-files/csfs/documents/COLORADOWILDFIRES_reprt_table_cb_000.pdf

CWD was 1st identified in Colorado in 1967, the year after what was then a record wildfire year for the state, with 673 fires burning 7361 acres.

Since then, the average number of wildfires and acres burned per year have increased steadily, to an AVERAGE of 2973 fires and 41 430 acres burned per year in 2000-2009, while CWD has run amok throughout Colorado and spread to many other states, chiefly with elk transports among hunting ranches.

Fires, at the very least, have failed to control the spread of CWD. Not only that, while correlation does not imply causation, fires may have accelerated the spread. This could have occurred, for example, by possibly causing infected herds in fire zones to migrate into proximity to other herds, and then by attracting uninfected herds into regrowth areas shared with infected animals.

If prionic disease researcher Mark Zabel is correct in his theory that deer and elk become infected chiefly by ingesting prions taken up by plants, either wildfires or controlled burns may have stimulated the ingestion of prions by stimulating the new growth that deer most like to eat.

Please note that setting fires to promote the regrowth that deer favor is a tactic practiced since pre-Columbian times, and was a staple of wildlife management during the several decades (1950s through 1990s) when state agencies typically tried to boost the deer population to as much as a 3rd above overwintering carrying capacity, to accommodate hunters and encourage license sales.

This approach fell out of vogue among many and perhaps most state agencies circa 2000 because of the growing perception that having too many deer was/is a traffic hazard, inhibits the growth of the biggest bucks, and harms bird habitat, and -- most of all -- because of increasing concern about "controlled" fires becoming wildfires, as happens more and more in the ever-dryer forests of much of North America.

In response, however, private property owners who hunt or lease land for hunting have over the past 15 years or so formed many "controlled burn groups" to boost deer population. Under pressure to stop controlled burns, chiefly as a fire hazard, these people have been casting about left and right for pretexts to continue, including tick control, control of "noxious" weeds and non-native plants, etc.

Since prescribed burns will tend to increase the deer population willy-nilly, since most of the burning is highly unlikely to destroy prions, and since more deer tend to increase the risk of infectious disease transmission (even if the transmission only occurs through cervid practices such as gnawing bones for calcium), this whole exercise looks more like a prescription for spreading CWD than a prescription for actually controlling it.

[Fair comment. If fires are to help control CWD maybe their preferred site would be on deer breeding farms with good security. Thus quarantined deer could be moved to "clean" pasture while the "contaminated" pasture is burnt. And the boundary fencing is high enough to prevent the breeding deer from escaping and the wild deer to gain entry. - Mod.MHJ
