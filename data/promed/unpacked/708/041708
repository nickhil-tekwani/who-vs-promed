Poliomyelitis in the Dominican Republic and Haiti - A Comment
------------------------------------------------------------
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported an outbreak of
poliomyelitis in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. This outbreak occurred
after the Certificate of Eradication of Poliomyelitis in the Americas was
issued in Aug 1994, following an absence of reports of wild poliovirus
circulation for 3 years.
It was also reported that the strain involved in the outbreak is [a
vaccine-related strain of Poliovirus type 1, [exhibiting 97% nucleotide
similarity, and acquired neurovirulence, invasiveness and
transmissibility. Such characteristics suggest a prolonged period of
viral circulation (2 years) in a population with very low anti-polio
vaccination coverage or a long [period of persistence in immunodeficient
people. In Egypt, vaccine-related poliovirus type 2 remained in
circulation for 10 years [originating from populations with low immunity
level. Another [incident of prolonged persistence of poliovirus type 1
occurred in Israel.
Cuba has 38 years' experience in the application of its Program Against
Poliomyelitis. This program is partially based on the detection of
poliovirus circulation by investigating every flaccid paralysis case, by
applying different immunological assays, and by active search for the virus
in both healthy children and the environment. Our indicators of
Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP) are similar to those
reported in countries that have a good surveillance system and use oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV). A historical perspective on persistence of the
vaccine-related poliovirus in the population and in the environment has
been published recently (Bull PAHO 1999, 77(8): 681-687). The results of
all investigations carried out since 1970, and those concluded after 1997
(unpublished), are similar in demonstrating that persistence and
circulation of the virus does not extend [beyond 2 or 3 months after the
vaccination campaign concludes. Subsequently, no virus circulation has
been detected for about 7 months every year after the vaccination campaign.
We infer that the strategy of administration of OPV in campaigns of
[massive extent greatly limits the possibility of viral circulation. This
strategy can result in a remarkable decrease [of virus transmission
through contact between children and other individuals. On the other hand,
a strategy of continuous vaccination could increase virus circulation
between vaccinated children and individuals not vaccinated at the same
time. Since 1965, we have unpublished investigations demonstrating
effective reactivation by detecting an increase of neutralizing antibodies
to Poliovirus type 2 in about 50% of children receiving 2 or 4 doses of
OPV. In a few children with reactivation it is possible to obtain viral
isolation from feces.
The same phenomenon was observed with types 1 and 3 poliovirus, although in
a smaller percentage with our OPV [formulation of 0.5-0.2-0.3. These
results also allow us to infer that the immunity [generated is sufficient
to effectively prevent disease, but it is not as effective for
[containment of virus circulation, which is achieved with several dose
applications. In synthesis, it was demonstrated that when the geometric
mean antibody titer is 1:64 and 1:55, in children with 2 and 4 doses
respectively, (i.e. an increase in 4-fold or more in antibody titer), it
could be an indicator of replication of the vaccine-related virus. On the
other hand, the changes in neurovirulence, invasiveness and
transmissibility [exhibited by vaccine-related poliovirus are really a
great danger. It is known that changes toward neurovirulence of
vaccine-related poliovirus take place quickly in the vaccinated child. In
spite of this, cases with VAPP are [rare. A longer period of circulation
presupposes changes in invasiveness and transmissibility; thus the
administration of OPV in [massive campaigns (predetermined number of doses
and children ages) [is essential to avoid the emergence of a dangerous
virus derived from the OPV.
We recognize the great complexity of organizing massive vaccination
campaigns with OPV of at least 2 doses every year to more than 90% of
children of 2 to 3 years of age. However, by applying the
whole-year-vaccination method the dangers of the use of OPV persist.
