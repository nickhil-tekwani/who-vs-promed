The sister of Viet Nam's 1st confirmed bird flu patient of the year
[2009] died with similar symptoms last week, and the director of the
hospital where she was treated said she probably also had avian flu.
"We suspect that it was bird flu that caused her death," said Truong
Thi Mau, director of the Ba Thuoc district hospital. "But we can't be
100 percent sure because there was no sample for tests. At the time,
we thought her illness was something else," Mau said by telephone
from Ba Thuoc, about 150 km (95 miles) south of Hanoi in Thanh Hoa province.

Earlier this week, Vietnamese authorities said the 13-year-old girl's
younger sister was in hospital with an H5N1 virus infection. Both
girls had eaten duck and chicken raised on the family farm, Mau said.
The 13-year-old developed a high fever and severe cough on 25 Dec
2008 and died in the district hospital on 2 Jan 2009, Mau said. After
her 8-year-old sister was confirmed to be infected with H5N1, about
50 children with flu symptoms were brought in by nervous parents in
the area, but tests for avian influenza were negative on all of them, she said.

Five Vietnamese people died of bird flu in 2008 out of 6 reported
H5N1 infections, all in the north of the country, in the 1st quarter
of the year, when cooler temperatures allow the virus to thrive. The
H5N1 strain has killed 247 people globally among the 391 confirmed
cases since 2003, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Before the latest case in Viet Nam, the WHO said Viet Nam had
experienced 106 human infections, the 2nd highest after Indonesia
among 15 countries with known human cases.

Health authorities in Beijing said this week that a 19-year-old woman
died of H5N1 after coming into contact with poultry. It was China's
1st case in almost a year. Chinese state media on Thursday [8 Jan
2009] quoted Deng Xiaohong, spokeswoman for the Beijing Health
Bureau, as saying the city's bird flu alert would probably be lifted
by 12 Jan 2009 if people who had contact with the dead woman did not
fall sick themselves. "At present, there is no biological basis for
human-to-human transmission, so there is almost no possibility of
human-to-human transmission in Beijing. I hope everyone in the city
can rest easy," Deng told state television. In China, the agriculture
ministry said on Thursday [8 Jan 2009] it had found no bird flu cases
amongst poultry in Beijing or areas surrounding the city where the
19-year-old woman had died. In Viet Nam, the authorities have
confirmed outbreaks among poultry in 2 areas near Hanoi, including Ba
Thuoc, where nearly 8000 poultry had been slaughtered to prevent it
from spreading.

[The failure to retain clinical samples from the 13-year-old sister
of the confirmed case of avian H5N1 influenza, if accurate, implies
that this case will remain a suspected case only. The presumed death
of 2 members of the same family does not necessarily imply
human-to-human transmission, as both girls had contact with the same
diseased birds .
