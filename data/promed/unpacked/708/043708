Cholera Kills 119
------------------------
The cholera epidemic [in Uganda] has claimed 119 lives since its
resurgence this year, the commissioner of community health, Dr. Sam
Okware, has said.
He told journalists at the weekly ministerial press briefing on 12
Dec 2002 that 2023 cases had been reported this year, most of them in
districts bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
[Case-fatality rate = 5.8 percent -Mod. LL]
Okware, who was flanked by the in-charge of health promotion, Paul
Kaggwa, and the city senior medical officer, Dr. Timothy Muzira, said
the number of cases reported in Kampala and Wakiso had by yesterday
hit 34, with 2 deaths.
He said the situation was under control, with the number of reported
cases dropping from 16, when the epidemic broke out on 25 Nov 2002,
to 1 case reported yesterday.

Cholera Spreads to 8 Districts
----------------------------------------------
The cholera outbreak reported in Kampala and Wakiso has spread to 6
other districts, health minister Jim Muhwezi said 9 Dec 2002.
Muhwezi has now slapped a ban on the sale of locally buveera [local
term for plastic bag]-packed cold drinks throughout the country. He
said the ministry had been monitoring the 15-epidemic prone districts
but only 6 had been affected.
Addressing reporters at the ministry headquarters in Kampala, Muhwezi
said, "There has been a systematic follow-up of the epidemic in
disaster-prone districts of Mbale, Sironko, Pallisa, Katakwi,
Kapchorwa, Kumi, Masindi, Hoima, Bundibugyo, Kasese, Runkungiri,
Kabale, Nebbi, Arua, Yumbe and Moyo. Only 6 districts of Kasese,
Bundibugyo, Masindi, Arua, Nebbi and Hoima continued to report
cholera cases," he said and added that the pandemic had killed 4 in
Kampala city.
Muhwezi, flanked by state minister Mike Mukula and top city and
health officials, said whoever defied the drink ban would be dealt
with. "It applies to all sorts of locally prepared drinks whether
packed in buveera or bottles," the stern-looking Muhwezi said.
Muhwezi emphasised that all drinking water must be boiled, and that
sugarcane from a plantation in Kitaka zone in Rubaga Division should
not be eaten. He said experts had condemned it as contaminated with
sewerage. "We shall take tough measures with other security organs to
make sure that we cordon off that plantation to make sure that people
do not eat the sugarcane," Muhwezi said.
