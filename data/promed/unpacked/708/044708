[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map appended to the report, at the source URL above. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Belarus can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/71T1.

The PRRS diagnosis, officially reported to the OIE after being diagnosed by 3 local (regional, national) laboratories and by a foreign, reference laboratory, is a confirmation of the media-derived information included in ProMED-mail posting 20130508.1699903.

Earlier, African swine fever (ASF) was reportedly suspected by media sources (and Ukraine's Veterinary Services).

A highly pathogenic subtype 3 PRRS virus (coined "Lena"), which differs from European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic levels, was isolated in Belarus in the late 2000s. During an experimental infection trial, severe clinical signs developed, and 4 out of 10 inoculated pigs died (see ProMED-mail posting 20101016.3744).

Additional information on PRRS and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf.

It will be a relief if even the slightest possibility of mixed infection with ASF is officially ruled out, based upon laboratory testing. - Mod.AS]
