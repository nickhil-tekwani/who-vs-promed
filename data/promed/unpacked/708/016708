["ASF has traditionally been present in the African continent, where it has been reported in 32 countries since 2005. In 1978, the disease was introduced to the Italian island of Sardinia and has since become endemic. In 2007, the disease was confirmed in the Caucasus region of Georgia. From there, the ASF virus gradually spread to neighboring countries (i.e., Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Belarus), affecting domestic pigs and wild boar. The 1st occurrence of ASF was reported in the European Union (EU) in 2014, and since then, numerous EU countries have been affected by this devastating pig disease that continues to be reported in 16 countries (during 2020 / 2022). Two European countries have managed to eradicate the disease: Belgium (event resolved in March 2020) and Czech Republic (event resolved in April 2018). In August 2018, the virus leapt to China (People's Rep. of), which represented the 1st occurrence of ASF in Asia. Since then, the disease continued to spread in the Region, affecting 16 countries as of 2021. In September 2019, the 1st occurrence of ASF in Oceania was reported by Timor-Leste, followed by Papua New Guinea (March 2020). In July 2021 the disease reappeared in the Americas after an absence of almost 40 years, having been introduced in Dominican Republic and later in Haiti. In January 2022, ASF genotype II was notified on the Italian mainland after around 40 years of absence. Two new countries reported the 1st occurrence of the disease in January [2022] as well: North Macedonia and Thailand. In March 2022, ASF has been reported for the 1st time in Nepal. Globally, since 2005, and as of 7 Jul 2022, ASF has been reported in a total of 74 countries. Since January 2020, 10 countries have reported ASF as a 1st occurrence in the country, while 13 countries reported its spread to new zones. In 2022 alone, 4 countries reported the 1st occurrence of ASF, and 4 countries reported the 1st occurrence in a zone. This highlights a continuous spread of the disease into new countries, and new zones in countries already affected.

"As observed in Europe and in some regions of Asia, the short-distance transmission of ASF seems to depend largely on the wild boar population density and their interaction with low-biosecurity pig production systems. Good knowledge and appropriate management of the wild boar population, as well as a strong coordination among the veterinary services [and] wildlife and forestry authorities are required to successfully prevent and control ASF.

"The long-distance transmission may be associated with human activities. It is important to maintain a high level of disease awareness among the general public and all the actors involved in the value chain, including border control, to prevent the movement of ASF-infected commodities entering new areas."
