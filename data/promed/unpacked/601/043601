The City of Amarillo has confirmed its 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection], an infection of the lungs which is caused by several different strands [?] of the virus found in rodents.

The City's Health Department says the patient has improved, but hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can be a very serious illness.

Health officials say the disease can be contracted in places like barns, outbuildings, sheds or any environments where rodents are living. The host of the virus is the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_], which lives in the western and central US and Canada, including the Texas Panhandle.

Infection occurs when the virus is breathed in after it has been kicked up from things like dried rodent urine, droppings, nesting material, and saliva.

A release from the city says [Sin Nombre] hantavirus has not been shown to transmit from one person to another.

It also states potential risk activities for HPS:

- Opening or cleaning cabins, sheds and outbuildings, including barns, garages and storage facilities that have been closed is a potential risk for hantavirus infections, especially in rural settings.

- Cleaning in and around your own home can put you at risk if rodents are present.

- Construction, utility and pest control workers can be exposed when they work in crawl spaces, under houses, or in vacant buildings that may have a rodent population.

- Campers and hikers can also be exposed when they use infested trail shelters or camp in other rodent habitats.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_). This is another reminder that this is the season for spring cleaning in North America, and closed buildings that have been unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.

Laboratory tests confirmed last Wednesday [21 May 2014] that a 2nd San Luis Valley resident has developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) following exposure to [a] hantavirus. Earlier this month [May 2014], a Saguache County resident died after being exposed to the virus in Rio Grande County. The most recent exposure occurred in Costilla County, and that patient has been hospitalized.

"We urge people to take proper precautions to prevent exposure because although it is rare, HPS is a serious, often deadly disease," said Samantha Escobedo, San Luis Valley regional epidemiologist. "The virus is not spread from person to person. It is carried by deer mice in our area, so keeping rodents away from where you live and taking proper precautions when cleaning are the best ways to prevent infection." Keep rodents away by storing your food and pet food in secure containers, closing holes in walls and foundations, keeping the area around your house clear of woodpiles and debris and setting out mouse traps at the 1st sign of mice.

Spring cleaning can increase your risk unless you take proper precautions. Do not sweep or vacuum mice droppings or nesting materials, because breathing dust containing infected droppings or urine is the most common way to be exposed to the virus. Before entering or cleaning enclosed buildings and other enclosed areas where mice may have been present, open them up to air out for 30 minutes. Wear gloves and consider wearing an N-100 rated respiratory mask (available at most hardware stores) when cleaning rodent-infested indoor areas. Spray mouse droppings and nesting materials with a disinfectant and let them sit for a few minutes before disposing of them in a plastic bag.

Early medical care is crucial for those who do become infected. The 1st symptoms appear 1-6 weeks after exposure and are flu-like: fever, headache, muscle pain and sometimes nausea and vomiting. A few days later, difficulty breathing develops and progresses very quickly to inability to breathe. Anyone who experiences early symptoms in the weeks following exposure to rodents, their droppings, or their nests, should seek medical care immediately and be sure tell the medical provider about the exposure to rodents.

According to CDPHE statistics, the San Luis Valley reported a total of 10 HPS cases in the 10-year period from 2003 to 2013.

Authorities of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) detected a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province. This was announced this Friday [29 May 2014] by the Regional Director of Health in this province, Roy Herrera.

Herrera stated that the case is a 45-year-old woman resident in Rio Viejo del Solar. "The patient is currently interned in the intensive care unit of the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital with symptoms compatible with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome," he added.

So far this year [2014], 22 cases of hantavirus [infection] have been reported in Los Santos province, with one person who died as a result.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus, which has caused several HPS cases as mentioned above. Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. No ecological details are provided concerning the environment where the woman may have acquired her infection.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
