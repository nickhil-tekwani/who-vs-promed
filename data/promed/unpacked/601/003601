Comment to:CJD (new variant), blood restrictions - New Zealand
New Zealand is going to exclude from blood donations any persons who spent,
between 1980 and 1996, more than 6 months in Britain. The ban will come
into effect 17 Feb 2000.
Neither the time point of the ban nor the cut-off of 6 months seem very
convincing for me.
The peak likelihood to acquire nvCJD by eating British beef may have been
in the mid 1980s, and the persons at risk had more than 10 years to donate
and contaminate the New Zealand blood supply.
There may be practical reasons to only exclude donor applicants who spent
more than 6 months in Britain, but if one believes at all that persons
possibly could have acquired nvCJD during a stay in Britain, then a cut-off
of 6 months is not very convincing.
In addition, a filtering process should be put in place in order to
eliminate (not identify, as stated in the original message) CJD
infectivity. Filtration of blood is based on experiments which show
that, for infectivity of orally administered prions, white blood cells are
indispensable. To my knowledge, these were not just any white blood cells,
but B-lymphocytes. However, if indeed CJD infectivity is associated to B
lymphocytes, then filtration might be of limited effect, because the
reduction of B-lymphocytes even with the most advanced filters is far less
than the average 10(4) to 10(5) reduction for all white blood cells and,
as a consequence, any existing CDJ infectivity might not be completely
eliminated.
There are many good reasons to filter blood. With the current knowledge,
the wish to eliminate CJD infectivity seems a debatable reason at best for
filtration.
So neither exclusion nor filtration might have an extraordinary effect on
the safety of the New Zealand blood supply.
