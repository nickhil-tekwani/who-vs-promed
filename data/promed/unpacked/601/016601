----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's very interesting that the newspaper tells of reports of birds dying all along the Texas coast, because Texas Parks and Wildlife [TPWD] has actually been re-opening bays for shellfish harvesting because of declining cell counts. (You can see the status of various bays at http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/status.phtml).

It would be interesting to know what sort of birds have been reported dead or dying along the Texas coast (the red tide cell levels appear to have been decreasing over the past 6 weeks, reading into the report at the TPWD website). As the moderator suggested: What are the ducks (and other birds) eating that has such high levels of toxin?
