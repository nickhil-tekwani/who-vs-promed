Rabid Skunks Near Needville And Beasley
---------------------------------------
The discovery of rabid skunks near Needville and Beasley has prompted
Fort Bend County Animal Control officials to urge that owners make
sure their pets' rabies vaccinations are up to date. Animal control
officers found one skunk that tested positive for rabies in an
unincorporated area near Beasley, and the other inside Needville city
limits, according to a statement issued Wednesday [10 June 2009] by
the Fort Bend County Health and Human Services. No other details
about the discoveries was immediately available.

"Although the incidence of rabies is low among domestic animals in
the United States, with the occurrence of wildlife rabies comes the
increased risk for infection of humans," said County Animal Control
Director Vernon Abschneider.

Abschneider's department is urging pet owners to keep their animals'
rabies vaccinations current.

"It is also important to keep your animals restrained and not allow
them to roam freely, as this will further protect them from
confrontation with wildlife," Abschneider said.

He added that skunks are nocturnal, and if they're active in the
daytime, it's an indication they're rabid. Therefore, any daytime
sightings of skunks should be reported to local animal control officers.

Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system and
transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. It is almost always
fatal once symptoms in humans or signs in animals appear. Humans and
animals can be exposed to rabies from the saliva or brain and spinal
cord tissue of a rabid animal that bites or scratches them. Wild
animals, such as raccoons, bats, skunks, foxes and coyotes are more
likely to carry rabies. Exposure can also occur if infected saliva or
tissue gets into a fresh wound (one that has bled within 24 hours) or
the eyes, nose or mouth.

Several things can be done if one is exposed to rabies. After being
bitten, it is important to quickly wash the animal bite or scratch
with a lot of soap and water. Then, contact your doctor immediately
to receive rabies immune globulin and a series rabies vaccine to
prevent infection. The rabies immune globulin and the 1st vaccine
should be given as soon as possible after exposure. However, if the
animal can be caught and observed or tested for rabies, it is safe to
wait up to 10 days before starting the series.

The early symptoms of rabies include irritability, headache, fever,
itching or pain at the site of exposure.
