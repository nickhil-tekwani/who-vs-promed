A live bird market in New York City has been depopulated after avian influenza was found there.

The detection in Queens highlights an important part of the Northeast poultry industry having made great strides in combating avian influenza over the past 20 years.

Chickens, ducks, and guineas tested positive at the live market. After depopulation, the carcasses were disposed of in a sanitary manner, according to the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets. About 170 birds were killed, according to USDA, whose lab confirmed the outbreak 12 Nov 2022.

The state is investigating the source of the virus. As a precaution, other New York live bird markets have been ordered to clean and disinfect, and all markets will be tested to ensure the virus has not spread, the state said.

All live bird markets in New Jersey have also been tested for avian influenza, and all were negative, the state's Ag Department said.

Despite the negative tests, 5 New Jersey markets were at high risk because of the New York detection, and they chose to undertake a virus elimination protocol, which includes the removal of all birds from the market, cleaning and disinfecting, and sampling for the disease, the Ag Department said. Those markets can reopen 72 hours after cleaning and disinfecting.

All of the New Jersey markets have been made aware of the New York detection and have agreed to increase their surveillance efforts, the New Jersey Agriculture Department said.

As of last year [2021], New York state had 87 live bird markets, over 80 of them in New York City. New Jersey had another 36.

Though fowl come to the market from across the Northeast, most of the birds are produced on about 300 farms in Pennsylvania, said Jarra Jagne, a poultry professor at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, at a conference in Pennsylvania last year [2021].

The live bird markets cater to customers of many ethnicities, with a survey finding Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Haitian Creole among the languages spoken at the businesses. Each group prefers certain types of birds, including brown broilers, often called red birds, as well as spent laying hens, Silkies, guineas, and ducks.

It all adds up to a vibrant trade, with half a million birds passing through Northeast live bird markets per week, Jagne said.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the live markets had little regulation and often harbored low pathogenic avian influenza, which can mutate to a more aggressive form.

The current outbreak of a highly pathogenic strain, one of the worst in U.S. history, has led to the loss of 50 million birds across 46 states.

In the early 1980s, Pennsylvania had a major outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza involving a strain similar to one circulating in New York City live bird markets. A strain from the markets was responsible for outbreaks at 5 commercial farms from 1996 to 2002. "By the end of the '90s, the state of New York decided to step in and said, 'We cannot take this anymore. We're not going to be the state everyone points a finger at starting all these outbreaks in all these other states,'" Jagne said.

In 2003, USDA, New York and the industry set up testing and prevention protocols having greatly improved disease conditions at the live markets. For example, birds must now be slaughtered at market rather than customers doing it at home, Jagne said.

In 2019, the last year before the pandemic disruptions, some 24 000 birds and 4 000 environmental samples from the markets were tested, and none were positive for avian influenza.

New York City has a moratorium on new live bird markets, and the COVID-19 pandemic brought renewed calls for a full ban, Jagne said. The coronavirus is thought to have jumped from an animal to people at a live animal market in China.

Avian influenza has the potential to make a similar leap, though the current outbreak does not pose an immediate public health concern, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

https://theirturn.net/2022/11/21/avian-flu-outbreak-in-nyc-live-animal-markets-spark-renewed-calls-for-their-closure/


In a letter to the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, local and national animal protection organizations are calling on Commissioner Richard Ball to suspend operations at the 87 live animal markets across the state that sell live animals to the public and slaughter them on the premises. The calls come amid an avian flu outbreak at a Queens live poultry market that led to the temporary closure of 34 similar markets in New York and New Jersey. Approximately 170 birds were killed in the Queens facility where the flu was found.

In the letter, the advocacy groups urge Commissioner Ball to "cease operations" at the markets in order to prevent "the next pandemic" from originating in one of them. COVID-19, the advocates note, was transmitted from animals to humans in a live market in China and spread throughout China before health authorities were even aware of it. Like the live markets in China, many of those in New York City are located in densely populated neighborhoods, where a virus could rapidly spread before being detected.

While the current strain of avian flu is not easily transmitted from birds to humans or among humans, some cases have resulted in "severe disease that resulted in death," according to the CDC. Young children and infants are at higher risk. Scientists are concerned that a mutation in the virus could create a pathogen that could sicken and kill humans in far greater numbers. According to infectious disease experts, live poultry markets, which house multiple species of birds, are a breeding ground for mutations.

Professor KF Shortridge, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong who studied a 2005 avian flu outbreak that originated in Hong Kong, describes live bird markets as an "avian influenza melting pot."

In April 2022, parents of New York City public school children sent a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul and NYC Mayor Eric Adams asking them to suspend the operation of live animal markets due to an avian flu outbreak elsewhere in New York state. In the letter, Brooklyn resident Irma Labiosa expressed particular concern about the close proximity of a live animal market to her son's elementary school. "The sidewalk in front of the live animal market next to my son's school is often contaminated with chicken feces and blood," said Ms. Labiosa, who signed the letter to Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul. "He could be tracking this waste into his classroom, onto the subway and into our home."

Calls to suspend operations at live animal markets began in 2018 when public health and animal rights activists with the advocacy group Slaughter Free NYC began conducting educational outreach about the health risks in front of markets in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Despite the fact that the outbreak of COVID-19 lent credence to Slaughter Free NYC's mission, New York designated the state's live markets as "essential businesses" which could remain open during the statewide lockdown.

Angered by the state's failure to protect public health, NY State Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal and NY State Senator Luis Sepulveda introduced legislation to shutter the markets until a safety assessment could be conducted. "We should have learned after the COVID-19 pandemic struck and claimed millions of lives that live animal markets are breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases," said Assembly Member Rosenthal. "When chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other animals are kept in crowded cages and in unsanitary conditions, the risk of disease spread is great and the impact on public health can be tragic. As avian flu outbreaks proliferate around the world, as well as right here in New York City where dozens of live animal markets operate just steps from apartment buildings, schools, and playgrounds, it is irresponsible to do nothing. It is time for swift action by the City and State to protect public health. I also look forward to the passage of my bill, which would pause the operation of these live animal markets so the state can conduct a thorough evaluation of the safety of these markets."

In an April 2020 interview about COVID on Fox News, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, weighed in on the controversy surrounding live animal markets, stating, "I think they should shut down those things right away. It boggles my mind how, when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human/animal interface, we don't just shut it down... I would like to see the rest of the world really lean with a lot of pressure on those countries that have that because what we're going through right now is a direct result of that." Fauci, the public face of the COVID-19 pandemic, made no specific reference to the wet markets in the United States.

[Live animal markets serve many purposes, from food sources to the selling of different animals for different purposes. Live bird markets, as with other live animal markets, can be a cauldron for mixing various diseases and exposure of those diseases to a variety of animals. Even if it is not a market, per se, but rather a large gathering of animals, such as the wild horse incident early this year in the USA. [see: Undiagnosed deaths - USA (03): (CO) wild horse, bacterial infection susp 20220503.8702988, Undiagnosed deaths - USA (02): (CO) wild horses, H3N8 equine influenza susp 20220430.8702943, Undiagnosed deaths - USA: (CO) wild horses, RFI 20220429.8702901] Comingling of different cohorts of animals, whether horses, birds, other animals and in some cases human beings, can lead to spreading of disease, or potentially mixing of disease. - Mod.TG]

[Although live animal markets are now known by most of the world's reading public to be a potential source of zoonotic spillovers because of the COVID pandemic, it may come as a surprise to many people (including Americans) that such markets are not uncommon in cosmopolitan Western metropolises. The borough of Queens, however, stands out even among these large cities. If the boroughs of New York City were classified as independent cities, Queens (population 2.3 million) would be the 4th largest city in the USA, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Moreover, almost 50% of Queens residents are foreign-born and come from an incredible variety of national backgrounds, such that Queens may well be the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The location of the live poultry market in question is not specified but could be in or near downtown Flushing, which has been rapidly gentrified in the 2000s by Chinese immigrants, or along the main thoroughfare of Roosevelt Boulevard, where over 300 languages are spoken https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/more-than-300-languages-are-spoken-along-this-nyc-street#.

Dr. Anthony Fauci's statement in article [2], was made in April 2020, shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was therefore referring to live animal markets in China, given the already-known link of the original outbreak to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. Nevertheless, the argument made by community activists, animal advocacy groups, and local politicians for closing similar markets in New York is still valid, namely that "live animal markets are breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases."
