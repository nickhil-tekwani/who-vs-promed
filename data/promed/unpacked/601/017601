[Abstract & translation by Mod.JW
Dr Leo Jimenez Ojeda, vice-president of the Independent Medical College of
Santiago de Cuba, reported to CubaPress on 3 July 1997 that the dengue
epidemic has spread from Santiago de Cuba to: Dos Caminos de San Luis,
Palma Soriano and the Boniato jail, Guantanamo, Songo-La Maya and San Luis,
with isolated cases reported from Camaguey, Las Tunas, Havana, Ciudad de la
Habana and Cienfuegos, in the center & west of the island.
[It is to be hoped that Dr Leo Jimenez Ojeda will not suffer the same fate
as the president of the College, who has been detained by the authorities
since 25 June, reportedly for declaring that the extent of the outbreak in
Santiago de Cuba was much greater than officially stated - Mod.JW
Cienfuegos
----------
A pregnant woman aged 22 years died on 27 June 1997 with a diagnosis of
"disseminated intravascular coagulation with symptoms associated with
dengue." [This diagnosis is compatible with DHF - Mod.JW
Guantanamo
----------
A local doctor (named in the report) confirmed that 4 cases of dengue were
admitted to the Agostino Neto general teaching hospital.
Havana & Ciudad de La Habana
----------------------------
The dengue vector mosquito is reported to be found in the municipalities of
Playa, Central Havana, Old Havana, 10th of October, Cerro & Plaza. An
"eradication" campaign is ongoing in the capital and will continue until 23
July.
Santiago de Cuba
----------------
Dr Carlos Dotres, Minister of Public Health, stated that the outbreak in
Santiago de Cuba is now under control, and has caused no more than 10
deaths, none of those in adults.
However, another doctor, who remains anonymous, declared that there have
been more than 11 000 cases, 2500 of them being hemorrhagic dengue. 40
patients were in the intensive care ward of Saturnino Lora hospital. In
the El Caney obstetrics & gynecology clinic there were reported to be 98
pregnant women with dengue, 22 with DHF (one of those in intensive care),
and 5 of the newborns were also sick, one critically. In the infant's
hospital there were said to be 182 children with dengue.
The death certificates of those who die of dengue are reported to include
the term "hipogolonico," i.e. to die without blood [having bled to death? -
