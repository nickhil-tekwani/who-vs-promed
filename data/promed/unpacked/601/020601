Human plasma available for research purposes
--------------------------------------------
I would like to expound on Dr Borchert's comments regarding the 2 Russian
scientists -- one survivor, one fatality -- who were infected with Marburg
virus in the laboratory. My organization has been working with the
institute concerned and the survivor of the Marburg infection for 4 years.
We have collected approximately 3 1/2 liters of human plasma, [which has
been tested and found to be negative for HIV-1,2 antibody, HIV p-24
antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus. This material
is available at no cost to researchers, and has been collected for
therapeutic use. The material has been stored at -20 degrees C and could be
considered for therapeutic application in the event of a laboratory accident.
It was the work with this individual which led us to test the effects of
tetracycline as an immune modulator that stimulates receptor antagonist
activity against cytokines produced by hemorrhagic viruses. As indicated
[in a previous post and elsewhere, survival rates in guinea pigs and mice
infected with Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever
viruses, and _Escherichia coli_ 0157 show a statistically significant
difference in comparison to the control groups.
