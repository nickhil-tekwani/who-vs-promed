JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS - BELGIUM EX CHINA (05)

There is precious little evidence to support recommendations about Japanese
encephalitis prophylaxis in China. Having lived and worked in Beijing for
several years, I have the following observations:
1. The Chinese routinely immunize children against Japanese encephalitis
with a live attenuated vaccine at ages 8 months, 2 years, and 6 years. This
has been the case since the early 1990s and is thought to be the major
factor in decreasing reports of the disease in China.
2. Most adult Chinese probably have some natural immunity to the disease.
Expatriates do not, and hence adults may be as much at risk as children.
3. The illness and laboratory results described for the Belgian child in
previous postings seem entirely consistent with Japanese encephalitis.
4. In my practice in Beijing, it was surprisingly common to be told by
Chinese patients (including urban-dwellers) that they had had Japanese
encephalitis as children or young adults. I had no way of corroborating
these claims, as most adult Chinese are likely to have antibodies to JEV.
5. As the Biken vaccine is not licensed in China, we used the live
attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine manufactured by the Chengdu Institute of
Biological Products. We gave only a few thousand doses, not enough to
assess efficacy, but this has been studied by others. In fact, the vaccine
has been given to more than 180 million children since its licensure in
China in 1988; its efficacy and safety have been studied and published in
articles in the Lancet (Vol 358, 2001), Vaccines (Vol 17, 1999) and Journal
of Infectious Disease (Vol 176, 1997). It is also now used in South Korea.
Our experience has been similar to that reported by others: it is
significantly better tolerated than the Biken vaccine with few reported
side effects and produces good immunity after a single dose (although a
booster at one year is recommended). Given that one of the reasons for not
recommending more extensive vaccination of travelers to China is the
possibility of serious allergic or neurologic side-effects from the Biken
vaccine, the Chinese vaccines deserve more attention.
6. Expatriates living in Beijing may be at significant risk of Japanese
encephalitis, because many of them live in housing compounds on the
outskirts of the city, compounds that are surrounded by pig farms and in
some cases, swampy rivers. Expeditions to rural areas are also popular. 3
years ago there was a confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis in an adult
expatriate living in a very upscale compound in Beijing and with no travel
history (in fact, he had been in Beijing for less than one month at the
time illness developed). He survived, but with neurological sequelae.
7. Shanghai, because of its warmer and more humid climate, is in the
Japanese encephalitis belt for a greater part of the year than Beijing.
Some of the expatriate compounds in Shanghai are also on the outskirts of
the city.
8. Even for urban-dwellers, it is worth remembering that proximity to
animals is in general much greater in Chinese cities than in the west.
Animals are often transported in open trucks and carts through the city,
and wet markets are still widespread. I have also seen brucellosis in urban
dwellers in China, acquired through exposure to pigs!
9. There have been 6 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in Hong Kong
so far in 2005. Hong Kong in particular would do well to look more closely
at this issue. I have never quite understood the recommendation that
Japanese encephalitis vaccination is not required for travelers staying for
less than one month in China. I don't think the mosquitoes discriminate.
Although it is true that it is a matter of risk assessment, the risk was
extrapolated from small numbers of returning travelers. Official reporting
of Japanese encephalitis in China is notoriously inaccurate -- not because
of any intent to deceive, but simply because reporting frameworks are in
general not well-developed.
There are 30 000 - 50 000 reported cases of JE in Asia each year --
probably a gross underestimate, in China as well as Vietnam, Thailand,
Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan, Korea, Nepal, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines
and India. The case fatality rate is 5-35 percent and up to 75 percent of
survivors may have neurological sequelae. I have never been convinced that
the existing recommendations were based on an accurate picture of the local
conditions. Only 1 in 200 people infected with Japanese encephalitis are
thought to develop the full-blown disease, but given the high morbidity and
mortality associated with the full-blown disease, the lack of effective
treatment, and the increasing numbers of non-immune people traveling to and
living in these areas, it may be time to reassess the recommendations about
prophylaxis. The only way to effectively treat Japanese encephalitis is to
prevent it.

[We are grateful for Dr. Borwein's commentary, which is both informative
and comprehensive. As a practitioner having lived and worked in one of the
major endemic areas of concern for many years, she makes points that are
worth careful consideration. She suggests that the existing recommendations
about prophylaxis of JEV infections for foreign travellers to the endemic
communities should be reassessed. In her opinion, any travellers from
non-endemic countries should obtain vaccination prior to making trips to
the endemic and seasonally epidemic areas regardless of duration of stay --
not just those intending to stay for one month or longer, as recommended by
the current guidelines. However, prophylaxis with vaccines is not without
risk; one has to balance risk against benefit. There are efficacious JEV
vaccines, both attenuated (e.g. SA 14-14-2 vaccine manufactured in China)
and inactivated (e.g. the Biken vaccine manufactured in Japan). This thread
is now cut. - Mod.RY]
