The World Health Organization (WHO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Health in Iraq, is scaling up preparedness and response activities to control the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever outbreak in Iraq.

As of 22 May 2022, Iraq reported 97 laboratory-confirmed cases and 18 deaths, with Thi Qar governorate reporting more than 50% of the cases. Currently, all Iraqi governorates have reported cases.

Further coordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health is underway to make a difference in controlling the outbreak.

"WHO is working closely with partners to enhance surveillance and outbreak response interventions in all affected areas. We are hoping to educate the population and those working closely with animals and livestock to raise their awareness of the disease, reduce their exposure to the virus, and prevent further transmission," said Dr Ahmed Zouiten, WHO representative in Iraq.

"The different meetings and field missions we have conducted so far allowed us to interact with different spectrums of society and identify the gaps to be bridged, especially in view of the approaching Eid Al-Adha festival, where communities come into close contact with animals, including potentially risky animals."

Emergency response activities
WHO is working closely with the Ministry of Health to build up and deploy joint rapid response teams from the health and agriculture sectors to implement a practical strategy for the treatment of animals. WHO also aims to strengthen the diagnostic capacity of hospitals, train health workers to strengthen their capacity for adequate case management, and enhance epidemiological investigation and surveillance to detect and respond to cases as early as possible, as this increases the chances of survival. In addition, WHO and the Ministry of Health have scaled up risk communication and community engagement activities to raise the awareness of the general public and target vulnerable groups and communities.

WHO and the Ministry have conducted a mission to Dhi Qar governorate to assess preparedness and response efforts to the outbreak. The mission conducted different meetings and sessions with health officials and workers, community leaders, and women in the governorate to discuss health needs and gaps in responding to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and boost coordination to ensure greater engagement at all levels. Other governorates will also benefit from WHO and Ministry support.

To strengthen the capacity of laboratories in other governorates, WHO has started the process of procurement of essential laboratory supplies to ensure continuity of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever testing.

Community engagement
WHO, in coordination with the Ministry, has so far conducted 3 health education sessions targeting 200 community members, including religious/tribal leaders, women, health workers, and butchers, to equip them with the correct information on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and mobilize them to spread the acquired knowledge among their communities.

Fifty women were engaged during the session, focusing on the best household practices to control the transmission of disease at the household level, while 50 community leaders and butchers were updated on health-related concerns regarding livestock trading and freshly slaughtered livestock. Twenty health workers were also sensitized to the incidence of the disease, the number of ticks in the environment, and the influence of climatic factors and geographical conditions.

In addition, WHO and the Ministry of Health paid a field visit to Al-Fhood township in Thi-Qar to discuss with community leaders the priority interventions to lower transmission and prevent further spread of the disease.

A new kind of disease is spreading rapidly in the Middle East Asian country of Iraq these days. And in this disease, the patient has a high fever, and blood comes out of his nose. It is being told that the patients suffering from this disease are dying due to excessive bleeding through the nose. According to information about the disease, the World Health Organization says that there have been 19 deaths from the disease in Iraq so far. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, it is a virus-borne disease for which no vaccine is available yet. According to a report that has come to light, a health worker fell prey to the infection of this virus during the spraying of pesticides on the cow.

Health workers in rural areas of Iraq are reportedly working wearing PPE kits after the outbreak of the disease, and this hemorrhagic fever has been named Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is spreading rapidly from animals to humans. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, this disease is spreading in animals by the bite of insects. It is being said that by coming in contact with infected animals, humans are falling prey to this infectious disease. So far, 111 cases of CCHF infection in humans have been reported in Iraq. Regarding this disease, the doctors say that the infection of this virus can spread rapidly because there is bleeding both inside and outside the patient's body.

The most serious of these is bleeding from the nose. The cause of death of 2 out of 5 cases of CCHF is nose bleeding. Haider Hantouche, a health official from Dhi Kar province, said that the number of cases of this CCHF is unprecedented. More than half of the cases of this infectious disease have been reported in southern Iraq, a poor agriculturally dominated region. According to the health official, in the past years, the cases of this disease could have been counted on the fingers, but now the disease is spreading quite rapidly. Doctors say that in Dhi Kar province, the infection is spreading from wild and domestic animals such as buffalo, cows, goats, and sheep.

An outbreak of the so-called "nosebleed fever" in Iraq has raised concern among veterinary and health authorities in the country.

The tick-borne viral disease results in a high mortality rate -- nearly 2 out of 5 -- in humans.

It's not yet fully understood what's behind the spike in cases, which has greatly affected the livestock industry. The virus is known to cause severe bleeding both internally and externally, and especially from the nose.

"The number of cases recorded is unprecedented," Haidar Hantouche, a health official in Dhi Qar province, told the AFP.

Here's what we know so far:

What is it?
Among epidemiologists, it is known as the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) defines CCHF as a "zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks with a high mortality rate in humans."

"We're closely following an outbreak in #Iraq, where veterinary authorities are investigating CCHF in ticks and livestock," [WOAH tweeted on Thursday [26 May 2022]].

What causes it in humans?
It's a viral disease. In humans, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a disease caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV).

It is known to cause uncontrolled bleeding, intense fever, and vomiting.

How is it transmitted?
CCHFV is transmitted by bites from infected ticks (mainly of the _Hyalomma_ genus) or by direct contact with blood or tissues of infected ticks, viraemic (having a virus or viruses in the bloodstream) patients, or viraemic livestock.

What's the latest about CHHFV in Iraq?
The WHO, in an update, stated that most cases are among farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians: people mainly get infected via ticks on livestock.

"Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons," the agency added.

The virus has also adversely affected meat consumption in the country, with many butchers saying cattle arriving for slaughter has fallen to half normal levels.

"People are afraid of red meat and think it can transmit infection," said Fares Mansour, Director of Najaf Veterinary Hospital.

When was the nosebleed fever case first detected?
It was first documented there in 1979. Since then, there had been only a handful of cases reported each year.

What are the symptoms?
The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms that include headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, vomiting, red eyes, a flushed face, red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate. (Source: US CDC)

How many cases have been reported so far?
Since the beginning of this year [2022], cases have soared, with more than 100 reported in Iraq so far.

Kirkuk nosebleed fever
In March [2022], the UK Health Security Agency reported a case in England, following travel to Central Asia.

In the past, the virus has recorded major outbreaks in the European Union, Eastern European states, principally in the Balkans, Turkey, and Russia, according to European CDC. Globally, CCHF is the most widespread viral tick-transmitted haemorrhagic fever.

European CDC estimates the following:

- Up to "3 billion people are at risk of infection globally, and 10 000 to 15 000 infections -- 500 of them fatal -- occur every year.
- Cases have been reported in over 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe, in regions where _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks are established.
- CCHF nosocomial infections with "considerable" mortality rates have been observed in various countries.

How do infections spread?
Wild and domestic animals serve as hosts of CCHFV, as they support tick populations by providing blood meals, and they can transmit the virus to both ticks and humans when they are "viraemic," having a virus or viruses present in the bloodstream.

The EU CDC reported cases imported from "endemic" countries.

"Therefore, awareness should be raised among health practitioners that a patient's travel history needs to be recorded in detail," the agency stated.

What animals have been infected by nosebleed fever virus?
ECDC reported that CCHFV-specific antibodies have been detected in a variety of wild and domestic animals (e.g., livestock, horses, dogs, chickens, camels, ostriches, swine, hares, deer, buffalo, and rhinoceroses).

In birds, antibodies have only been detected in guinea fowl and ostriches.

What explains the emergence of CCHFV in a particular country?
Several factors -- both biotic (relating to life) and abiotic -- play a role in the emergence and spread of CCHFV in a region.

Factors include certain climatic conditions that favour tick abundance, land fragmentation, legal or illegal livestock trade, and activities in abandoned agricultural areas that increase human exposure to ticks.

"Climatic changes may also redirect the route of migratory birds, and if they are infested with infected ticks, CCHFV can be introduced into new areas," the European CDC stated in a brief.

How fast does it spread?
Onset of the disease can be "swift," according to the US CDC.

Is there a cure for it?
The virus has no vaccine yet. The long-term effects of nosebleed fever infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow, according to the agency.

What happens next?
The European CDC recommends that "seroprevalence studies" -- to measure the level of a disease-causing agent in a population, as measured in blood serum --be conducted in humans, wild animals, and domestic animals.

The agency also recommends screening of ticks for CCHFV infection and sharing of useful information about the circulation of the virus in a particular region.

[CCHF exemplifies a classic zoonotic disease that requires a One Health approach at every step, outbreak investigation, case detection, and joint public health response by the human and animal health sectors. It appears that the chain of disease transmission continues, possibly due to tick infestation of a large number of animals /cattle, poor socioeconomic conditions of the affected region, and low level of public awareness about preventive measures. - Mod.UBA
