Anthrax infection in a resident of the village of Kakashur, Karabudakhkent district, has been confirmed, and residents are undergoing emergency chemoprophylaxis and vaccination, the Ministry of Health of Dagestan reported. The "Caucasian Knot" has reported that a resident of the village of Kakashura, Karabudakhkent region, was hospitalized with suspected anthrax; 6 people, including 3 children, are at risk. The district authorities announced the introduction of quarantine in the village.

A case of cutaneous anthrax was confirmed in the Karabudakhkent region. "The patient has been hospitalized in the infectious disease hospital in the village of Gurbuki and is receiving all the necessary treatment, nothing threatens his life," the Ministry of Health of Dagestan said today [7 Apr 2022].

A circle of contact persons at risk of infection has been identified; they are given emergency chemoprophylaxis with antibacterial drugs. More than 100 residents of the village have received an anthrax vaccine, and disinfection measures have been taken, the department said in a message on the Telegram channel. The head of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, introduced quarantine in a part of the Karabudakhkent region where the anthrax outbreak was detected. "To establish restrictive measures (quarantine) on the territory of the personal subsidiary plot of [...], located in the village of Kakashura, Karabudakhkent region until 21 Apr 2022," the text of the decree says. A ban has been established on visiting the farm by unauthorized persons, except for the personnel working there, and the import and export of livestock is prohibited.

In a 5-kilometer (3.1 mi) zone from the outbreak, the import of unvaccinated animals, the export of livestock for slaughter, and the holding of fairs, exhibitions, and animal sales are prohibited, follows from the text of the decree of 6 Apr 2022, published on the website of the head of the republic.

Rospotrebnadzor of Dagestan recalled today [7 Apr 2022] that since 2020, this is the 3rd case of an anthrax outbreak in the villages of Kakashur and Kakamakhi of the Karabudakhkent region. "According to epidemiological investigations, the following factors also became the causes of human infection: direct contact during the forced slaughter and butchering of cattle, the lack of pre-slaughter veterinary examination, incomplete coverage of livestock with anthrax vaccination," the agency said.

Vaccinate all livestock, and if signs of disease are detected in livestock, be sure to contact veterinarians, urged Rospotrebnadzor in his Telegram channel.

The "Caucasian Knot" also wrote that in November 2020, quarantine for anthrax was introduced in the village of Kakamakhi, where anthrax was confirmed in 5 people. On 6 Aug 2021, it became known that a 52 year old slaughterer from the village of Kakashura was diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax. On 10 Aug 2021, the village administration reported that quarantine was established in the village, and posts were set up at the entrance to the village. On 23 Aug 2021, the quarantine was lifted.

The Department of Rospotrebnadzor for the Republic of Dagestan informs about the annual registration of cases of anthrax in the Karabudakhkent region: in October 2020 in the territory of the Karabudakhkent region in the village. Kakamahi was registered a focus of anthrax with a total number of victims of 5 people in August 2021 in the village. Kakashur was registered a focus of anthrax with the number of victims of one person; in March of this year [2022], Kakashur also had an anthrax outbreak with one victim. Settlements are permanently unfavorable for anthrax.

According to epidemiological investigations, the following factors also became the causes of human infection: direct contact in the process of forced slaughter and butchering of cattle, lack of pre-slaughter veterinary examination, and incomplete coverage of livestock with anthrax vaccination.

Anthrax is an acute dangerous infectious disease of domestic, wild animals and humans. The causative agent of anthrax is a large bacillus, which, under unfavorable conditions for it, passes into a very stable form -- a spore. Spores persist for a long time (several decades) in the external environment: in soil, as well as on wool, leather, bone meal, bristles, and fur of animals killed by anthrax; spores are not destroyed by salting meat or tanning leather. They can survive for years in water and decades in soil. Direct sunlight acts very slowly, and anthrax spores practically do not die in the soil; as a result, they can form soil foci that are dangerous to animals.

Infection of animals occurs when eating infected grass, swallowing water into which spores from the soil have fallen. Infection can also occur by airborne dust when breaking the soil with hooves. Anthrax disease in animals develops acutely and always ends in their death.

Ways of infection of people: The source of infection for humans is sick domestic animals: cattle, horses, sheep, goats, deer, camels, pigs. A person becomes infected with anthrax bacilli through damaged skin and mucous membranes while caring for sick animals, providing them with veterinary care, butchering carcasses, skinning, and burying the corpses of animals that died from anthrax. Infection can occur through contact with contaminated soil during earthworks in the zone of soil foci. Infection is not excluded when eating the meat of sick animals or when bitten by blood-sucking insects (gadflies, fly-burners, etc). A person with anthrax is not a source of infection for other people, since for the pathogen the human body is an epidemiological dead end and a foreign host. Susceptibility to anthrax in humans does not depend on age, sex and other physiological characteristics of the organism; it is related to the routes of infection and the magnitude of the infectious dose.

In order to prevent anthrax, the Department of Rospotrebnadzor for the Republic of Dagestan strongly recommends:
- never buy meat and meat products in spontaneous markets, on the streets; raw and undercooked meat can become a source of infection;
- in case of illness of animals, do not allow forced slaughter in the farmstead without an examination by a veterinarian;
- do not to allow the use of meat in preschool, school, children's health-improving, medical and other public catering establishments without a veterinary examination and branding;
- do not purchase fur, leather products from private traders;
- it is mandatory to register livestock with veterinarians and annually vaccinate all farm animals in private backyards, farms and other forms of farms against anthrax;
- persons who have an occupational risk of anthrax infection (veterinary workers, employees of meat processing plants, slaughterhouses, procurers of raw materials of animal origin, livestock owners involved in breeding and slaughtering livestock, etc) must annually be vaccinated with a specific anthrax vaccine;
- if anthrax is suspected, you should immediately consult a doctor for emergency preventive treatment and medical supervision.

Remember! Only strict adherence to preventive veterinary measures will protect you from anthrax!

[There was a similar outbreak in this village last year (2021); see relevant posts listed in the See Also section below. This would suggest that the responses last year and especially of livestock vaccination in the village and immediate surrounding areas was more a statement of bureaucratic intent than of reality. All livestock and especially cattle should be vaccinated immediately in such an outbreak and annually in the spring for the following 4 to 6 years depending on circumstances. Any unexpected deaths must be reported and investigated. Talk is ineffective. Action, especially livestock vaccination, prevents further outbreaks.

Dagestan is an autonomous republic of Russia. It is small -- 19 400 square miles and 2.9 million people -- on the north west Caspian Sea coast and adjoins Azerbaijan, Chechnya, and Georgia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan). - Mod.MHJ
