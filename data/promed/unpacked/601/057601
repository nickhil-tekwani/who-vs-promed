The number of people who have fallen victim to a measles outbreak in the North-East has risen by 30 in a week.

Figures released today [Tue 19 Mar 2013] show 164 confirmed cases and 158 suspected cases of measles have been reported in the region since the beginning of September 2012. The majority of cases are in the Teesside area, with 42 people in Middlesbrough and 65 people in Stockton affected. In County Durham, 19 people have come down with the highly contagious illness and 28 in Darlington.

The figures, published by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show 40 per cent of all reported cases involve young people between the age of 10 and 19, who continue to be the most affected. Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the HPA in the North East, encouraged people to vaccinate themselves [i.e. seek vaccination] against the illness. She said: ""Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. "If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status, they should check with their GP. If you've missed out on MMR in the past, it's always possible to catch-up as the vaccine can be given at any age."

Schools in Neath, Port Talbot, and Carmarthenshire have so far not been affected by the measles outbreak, but parents there are also being advised to heed Public Health Wales's advice to get vaccinated.

Advice from public health Wales has been sent to every school in the Neath Port Talbot county, urging parents to have their children vaccinated as quickly as possible and to remain vigilant for symptoms, which include red/brown spots, watery eyes and sneezing. And parents in Carmarthenshire are also being advised to remain alert. "I'd urge all parents in Carmarthenshire to please get their children vaccinated. "This outbreak is becoming very concerning, and the cases are not too far away from us in the Swansea Valley."

Health authorities of a Sudanese refugee camp in Chad announced the emergence of 4 cases of measles in the area. This skin disease is highly contagious, they warned.

Adam Hassan of Djabal Camp's Medical Centre said all 4 cases of measles were diagnosed within the same family. He noted that 370 people aged between 9 months and 15 years old had been vaccinated against the disease. Nevertheless, the health official advised Djabal's residents to "stay away from those infected with measles due to its highly contagious nature." Hassan further advised them not to touch tools or clothes used by the sick and to refrain from eating their food.

[Camp Djabal is one of 2 Darfur refugee camps located in southeastern Chad. Only secondary, unpaved roads travel to this area; that is a good 6 hours from the central NGO hub of Abeche. Surrounding Camp Djabal are half a dozen Internally Displaced Persons camps, home to local Chadians who have been displaced from their villages due to inter-ethnic violence that has been on the rise. Resources dedicated to Camp Djabal and the other camps in the area are few. Firewood is scarce. Education offered in the camp only reaches level 6, and the students are eager for more. Without this opportunity, the older boys will most likely return to Darfur in search of a school, work, or most likely a rebel group to join.

[5] Ghana (Tamale)
Date: Wed 20 Mar 2013

The Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) continues to record fresh cases of measles [known as "kuagu" in the local dialect] after an outbreak of the disease towards the end of 2012. A total of 108 children were admitted to the hospital last year [2012] after contracting measles. Two of them died later as a result of complications from the disease.

This year [2013], 27 cases have already been reported at the TTH between January and February 2013, thereby raising concerns of the possibility of fresh outbreaks. During a visit to the Children's Ward of the TTH, the Daily Graphic newspaper learned that almost each week, children are being brought to the hospital with symptoms of measles. The 2 paediatric consultants in charge of the children's ward, Dr Anthony Amankwa Amponsem and Dr Hassan Mumuni, said they had confirmed most of the cases as measles.

They said that sometime last year [2012], the hospital noted that there was an outbreak of the disease in Tamale and surrounding communities and, therefore, instituted mechanisms to manage the situation. "We allocated a separate ward for measles admissions because the disease is contagious," said Dr Amponsem, who is the head of the Paediatric Faculty of the hospital. "We are still getting new cases, but it appears the numbers are declining," he further stated.

At the time of the visit, there were 3 babies with their mothers isolated in the ward reserved for measles patients. "We [were] brought here on Sunday," said the mother of a 6-month old child, who had some sparse rashes on her head and neck and had calamine lotion smeared all over her body. The mother said her daughter experienced a rise in body temperature, and when they brought her to the hospital, she was diagnosed as a case of measles. Another mother, who was assisting a nurse to administer some medications for her 7-month-old son, said they had been in the hospital for 3 days. Her baby still had some rashes on his buttocks. "His condition is improving because the rashes are gradually drying up," she stated with some sense of relief.

Measles is highly contagious and spreads through fluids from an infected person's nose or mouth. Health officials agree that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. In Ghana, babies are immunised against measles when they are 9 months old. They are eligible for another dose when they reach 18 months. It appears, however, that many babies are getting infected with the disease before they are 9 months old. In the view of Dr Ken Sagoe, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the TTH, if the trend becomes widespread, the health service may need to shift the time of measles vaccination to 6 months to give babies better protection.

He explained that the situation in which children who had already received the vaccine had contracted the disease may be due to a number of factors. "Probably, the vaccine was not properly administered, or its potency was reduced due to improper preservation," he stated. Dr Sagoe said some children could also have immunity deficiencies, and this would make them more susceptible to such conditions. He appealed to parents and school authorities to quickly send children to the hospital when they develop symptoms such as fever, runny nose, catarrh and rashes.

Meanwhile statistics from the paediatric unit of the TTH revealed that measles is the 5th highest cause of admission, coming after malaria, pneumonia, malnutrition, and acute gastroenteritis.
