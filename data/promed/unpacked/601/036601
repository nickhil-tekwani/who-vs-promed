Health department: Pesticide poisoned Bohol school children
-----------------------------------------------------------
Pesticide in cassava sweets poisoned more than 100 grade school
students in Bohol, the Department of Health (DOH) revealed on Mon
14 Mar 2005. Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit said the results of
laboratory examinations conducted by the University of the
Philippines-Poison Management and Control Center showed that
"carbamate" poisoning killed 28 children and caused vomiting and
diarrhea spells in 77 others recuperating in 3 hospitals in Bohol.

"Based on the examination, the cause of death of children was
diarrhea and dehydration secondary to pesticide and also possibly
secondary to an infectious agent," Dayrit said.

Carbamate has the ability to bind cholinesterase for 6 hours with no
permanent damage. It affects the central nervous system but it could
be treated with atropine antidote. While the DOH has already
pinpointed pesticide poisoning as the cause, Dayrit said there are
other factors that might have aggravated the situation and resulted in
the death of the children.

"Chronic exposure to pesticides," which are present in the
environment in Mabini, Bohol, was noted, Dayrit said. "The overall
picture here is you have a highly contaminated environment and
pesticides and bacteria in the same place where the food was
prepared, halo-halo yung (mixing of) food and pesticides, and
these may have infectious agents," he added.

He said of the 49 grade school pupils tested, 82 percent of those
who ate a local snack food called "maruya" suffered diarrhea, while
62 percent of those who did not eat the same food also got diarrhea.

Vendor admits using more poisonous cassava variety
--------------------------------------------------
A vendor's confession that she used a more poisonous variety of
cassava gave the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) its 1st
significant lead in solving the mystery behind the mass food
poisoning deaths at the San Jose Elementary School in Mabini town,
Bohol province. NBI Director Reynaldo Wycoco said the vendor who
prepared the fried cassava that killed 27 pupils and hospitalized 105
others admitted yesterday [Sun 13 Mar 2005] that she had used the
root crop's white variety for the 1st time.

The vendor said that she usually used the yellow cassava, the less
lethal variety, according to agricultural experts. Wycoco said
agriculturists from the Philippine Root Crops Authority based at the
Leyte State University said the cyanide content of the white variety,
also called "pulotan," amounted to 330 to 360 parts per million
(ppm). The yellow variety, on the other hand, contained only 30 to
60 ppm of cyanide.

Experts stressed that the maximum tolerable cyanide content should
only be 120 ppm, Wycoco said. "Based on the confession, we got
samples of the white root crop and the vat she used in frying the
cassava for laboratory analysis," Wycoco said in a phone interview,
adding that sample tissues from the victims' bodies obtained during
an autopsy were also brought to Manila.

The NBI chief said that, if tests show that the white variety of
cassava had indeed caused the massive poisoning, the bureau
would recommend the uprooting of all white cassava plants in the
country.

Bohol Governor Erico Aumentado has ordered the immediate
destruction of all the white cassava variety in Mabini and urged
residents to refrain from eating the root crop pending the results of
the investigation.

During their conversation, Aumentado said the vendor told him that
what she had cooked as "maruya" (caramelized cassava slices fried
in cooking oil) had come from a white cassava variety locally known
as "pulotan," which had a high cyanide content. Following the
confession, Aumentado yesterday, 13 Mar 2005, asked the NBI not
to rule out cyanide poisoning yet. Although the NBI still had to
officially conclude its investigation, there was growing suspicion that
the children had eaten cassava laced with either pesticide or
herbicide, after a search of the vendor's house yielded a plastic
container of a known insecticide brand whose white powdery
substance was similar in appearance to flour.

[It appears that pesticide contamination may have been the major
issue in this tragic event. It also seems like the more toxic "bitter"
cassava was used. - Mod.LL]
