[A previous lumpy skin disease [LSD] outbreak was recorded in the same Russian oblast (province), Samara, in May 2016 (see 20161015.4561983).

Samara was the 16th province affected by LSD in Russia during the LSD epizootic which had started in September 2015. Those territories, as reported to the OIE, are (listed in order of 1st infections):

1. Respublika Dagestan
2. Respublika Kalmykiya
3. Chechenskaya Respublika
4. Astrakhanskaya Oblast
5. Stavropol'skiy Kray
6. Respublika Ingushetiya
7. Krasnodarskiy Kray
8. Volgogradskaya Oblast
9. Rostovskaya Oblast
10. Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya
11. Respublika Adygeya
12. Kabardino-Balkarskaya Resp
13. Tambovskaya Oblast
14. Ryazanskaya Oblast
15. Samarskaya Oblast
16. Saratovskaya oblast
17. Orenburskaya oblast

For OIE's interactive map, showing all LSD outbreaks reported from Russia since 2015, please go to https://tinyurl.com/y8m7hajx (click, to center, on the Russian cluster, zoom in).

The disease initially spread in the Federal District South Russia (aka North Caucasus), from where it penetrated the Federal District Central Russia and eventually leaping north eastwards into the Volga Federal District, namely the 3 oblasts Samara, Saratov and Orenburg oblasts, all having common borders with Kazakhstan. For Russia's federal districts maps see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_districts_of_Russia (the Volga District, in green).

In July 2016, West Kazakhstan, bordering the 3 named Russian oblasts in the Volga Federal Distraict, suffered a large-scale LSD event (20160727.4374008). Possible link to the LSD situation in bordering Russian Volga Federal District was subject to discussions (see commentaries in 20170804.5228182, 20170831.5287377).

Russia applies mass preventive vaccinations against LSD. Information on the vaccination history of the current 2 affected farms would be helpful. - Mod.AS
