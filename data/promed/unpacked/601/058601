Wal-Mart stops buying Chile salmon on virus outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, stopped buying
salmon from Chile, the largest supplier of the fish to the USA, after
an outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in the South American
nation.

Wal-Mart switched to "Atlantic" suppliers of salmon after the fish
became "unavailable" in Chile, Caren Epstein, a spokeswoman with the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, said in an e-mailed response to
questions [8 Jul 2009]. She declined to be more specific on the other
countries it was buying from.

Norway is the world's largest supplier of salmon, ranked ahead of
Chile and the UK. Chilean supplies of the fish will slump 59 percent
this year [2009] because of the virus, according to Norwegian industry
consultant Kontali Analyse AG.

Marine Harvest ASA, the world's largest salmon supplier, started
sending Norwegian salmon to the US market 2 weeks ago to keep up
supplies to clients who were buying fish from its Chilean farms, said
Jorgen Christiansen, a spokesman for the Oslo-based company. He
declined to name the clients.

Chilean salmon farms suffered an outbreak of the virus known as ISA
last year [2008 -- see ProMED refs. below] because producers held too
many fish in farms off the coast of the island of Chiloe in southern
Chile, Jimenez said. The outbreak of the virus is linked to the
density of fish farmed in offshore areas and the company is working on
vaccinations to combat the disease, he said.

Revised law
-----------
Chile's producers, including AquaChile SA, await a new government law
that will provide tighter industry controls. The law will also provide
producers with the opportunity to start new production sites in fjords
further south. "Nobody dares yet put new fish in the water until the
government dictates the new law and all the norms that we have are up
and running," Cesar Barros, head of Chilean salmon industry chamber
SalmonChile, said in an interview.

Any recovery in Chile's salmon industry may be delayed if banks don't
provide sufficient loans for farmers to replenish their production
sites, said Christiansen.

["Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a disease of farmed Atlantic
salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by the orthomyxovirus infectious salmon
anaemia virus (ISAV). ISA primarily affects fish held in seawater or
fish exposed to seawater. However, indications of disease outbreaks in
fish held in fresh water have also been reported. The disease may
appear as a systemic and lethal condition characterised by severe
anaemia and haemorrhages in several organs. The most prominent signs
observed are pale gills, exophthalmus [protruding eyes], distended
abdomen, and petechiae [blood spots] in the eye chamber; skin
haemorrhages in the abdomen and scale oedema [swelling] may occur. The
major findings on post-mortem examination are circulatory disturbances
in several organs caused by endothelial injury in peripheral blood
vessels.

These clinical manifestations of ISA are found in 4 organs: the liver,
kidney, gut, or gill. The liver manifestation is characterised by dark
livers caused by haemorrhagic liver necrosis. The kidney manifestation
is characterised by moderately swollen kidneys with interstitial
haemorrhaging and tubular necrosis. The gut manifestation is
characterised by dark red guts caused by haemorrhaging within the
intestinal wall but not into the gut lumen. In addition to being pale,
the gill manifestation includes, in some cases, accumulation of blood,
especially in the central venous sinus of the gill filaments. Lesions
in the liver and gut are easily visible while lesions in the gills and
kidney are less obvious. In some ISA outbreaks, one of the organ
manifestations can dominate, while in other outbreaks all
manifestations can be found. In individual fish all manifestations may
be found to some extent. Outbreaks dominated by either the liver or
kidney manifestation appear to be most common. Haematocrit less than
10 in end stages may be observed. Diseased Atlantic salmon presenting
with anaemia and circulatory disturbances should be examined for ISAV
infection, if there are no other, obvious causes to explain their
condition.

"Mortality during an outbreak of ISA may vary significantly. Daily
mortality in affected net pens may initially range from 0.5 to 1 per
cent, but may increase with time. Cumulative mortality ranges from
moderate to high and may exceed 90 per cent in severe cases. The
disease usually starts in one net pen and it may take many months
before the disease develops in neighbouring net pens. Although natural
outbreaks of ISA have been recorded in farmed Atlantic salmon only,
subclinically infected feral Atlantic salmon, brown trout, and sea
trout (_S. trutta_) have been identified. ISAV has also been detected
in 2 marine species, pollock (_Pollachius virens_) and cod (_Gadus
morhua_)." - Mods.AS/TG]
