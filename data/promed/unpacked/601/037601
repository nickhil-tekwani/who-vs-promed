Health authorities are investigating a possible link between a
salmonella outbreak in Australia's eastern states and rockmelons
(cantaloupes) from north Queensland. There has been a dramatic surge
in salmonella food poisoning around the country, with about 100
confirmed cases in the past month.
New South Wales has been hardest hit with 50 cases and 4 confirmed
cases in the ACT (Australian Capital Territory). In most cases,
victims had reported eating rockmelons in the days before falling ill.
Investigations are now under way to see if fruit grown in north
Queensland are the cause, but growers are sceptical. ACT chief
health officer Dr Paul Dugdale says people should be extra vigilant
with food hygiene when eating fresh fruit.
"The salmonella is known to be something that can contaminate the
skin of the rockmelon so it sits outside of the rockmelon and it's
when you cut into it the knife then carries the salmonella onto the
flesh, which you then eat," he said.
Dr Dugdale says consumers should be extra careful when preparing
rockmelons, while officials work out the origin of the salmonella
strain. "We're working back up the food chain to try and identify
where the contaminated fruit is coming from and we will work then to
stop it," he said.
New South Wales Health Department director of communicable diseases,
Dr Jeremy McAnulty, says the strain of the bug identified is
Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Saint-Paul and 90 per cent of victims
reported eating rockmelon before getting sick.
"We usually see a handful of cases a month, but so far in Oct 2006
we've seen in order of about 50," he said. Dr McAnulty admits food
poisoning through rockmelon is rare.
A possible link has been traced to Queensland and environmental
officers are taking samples from farms and suppliers in northern
Queensland to determine if rockmelons grown there are the source of
the outbreak. Queensland Health spokesman Dr Frank Beard says
salmonella is a notifiable condition so they are treating the
investigation seriously.

The following paragraphs were extracted from the MMWR summary of the
Salmonella Poona outbreak cited in the 'see also's (20021123.5884):
"Salmonella infections have been linked to melons at least since 1990
when _S. enterica_ serotype Chester traced to cantaloupe caused 245
illnesses in 30 states. The cantaloupe were imported from either
Mexico or Guatemala. In 1991, an outbreak of cantaloupe-associated
serotype Poona infections caused 400 illnesses in 23 states. Illness
was associated with eating pre-cut cantaloupe in fruit salads or from
salad bars. Although industry sources identified the lower Rio Grande
Valley in Texas as the probable source of the implicated cantaloupe,
some might have come from Mexico.
In response to this outbreak, FDA conducted a microbiologic survey
that isolated a variety of Salmonella serotypes from approximately 1
percent of sampled imported cantaloupe and watermelon. In 1997, an
outbreak of serotype Saphra infections affected 25 persons in
California. Illness was associated with cantaloupe imported from
Mexico. After the 2000 and 2001 serotype Poona_ outbreaks [see
archives listed below], FDA conducted farm investigations in Mexico,
issued press releases to warn consumers, placed implicated farms on
detention, and conducted sampling surveys of imported cantaloupe. The
1999 and 2000 FDA surveys of imported produce indicated that 5
percent of cantaloupe sampled (8 of 151) was contaminated with Salmonella...
FDA provides information about the decontamination of melons to the
retail industry, food-service establishments, and commercial
processors of pre-cut melon. The use of sodium hypochlorite or other
permitted antimicrobials in combination with brushing is recommended.
The potential for microbial contamination also might be reduced by
using only good-quality fruit that is free from open wounds or
defects that might allow bacteria to contaminate the interior of the fruit.
Additional research is needed to determine the effectiveness of
consumer produce-washing practices. Consumers should be sure that
fresh-cut melons are refrigerated or surrounded by ice; leftover cut
melons should be discarded if left at room temperature for more than 2 hours."
The specific serotype here, Saint-Paul, can be multi-antimicrobial
resistant (1) and has been associated with human outbreaks associated
with bean sprouts (2), and poultry (3, 4) and has been isolated from
cattle, turkeys and horses.
