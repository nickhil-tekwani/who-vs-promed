[The following is the text of an OIE report - Mod.PC
Translation of an e-mail received on 23 August 2000 from Dr Oscar Alejandro
Bruni, President of the National Service of Agrifood Health and Quality
(SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food,
Buenos Aires:

Diagnostic results on the communally-owned farm
The results of the laboratory tests carried out on the illegally imported
animals (10 steers) that were found on the communally-owned farm in Formosa
are as follows:
ANIMAL Nº ORIGIN VIAA(1) EITB(2) ELISA FC 50%(3) PROBANG
1 Illegal + + -
2 Illegal + + -
3 Illegal - - -
4 Illegal + + A A 24 +
5 Illegal - - -
6 Illegal - - -
7 Illegal - - -
8 Illegal - - -
9 Illegal + + -
10 Illegal - - -
(1) VIAA: virus infection associated antigen
(2)EITB: electroimmunotransfer blot
(3)CF: complement fixation
The 82 bovines (52 cows and 30 steers), belonging to two farmers and kept
on the communally-owned farm, which had been in contact with the
illegally-imported animals, were tested. Eight of these animals yielded
positive results on the VIAA and EITB tests.
Monitoring of herds adjoining the communally-owned farm
All the serological tests performed on the 387 bovines of the 12
consignments that left the area around the communally-owned farm gave
negative results. In no case were lesions or other clinical signs
compatible with foot and mouth disease (FMD) observed. These herds continue
to be subjected to strict clinical and laboratory monitoring.
The results of the laboratory tests on the animals of consignment No. 13
(comprising 4 bulls), of which 2 animals were moved to Corrientes (C) and 2
to Entre Ríos (ER), are as follows:
ANIMAL No. VIAA EITB PROBANG
1/ER - - -
2/ER + + -
3/C + + -
4/C + + -
Epidemiological comments
It has proved possible to confirm the working hypothesis regarding the
origin of the animals that tested positive. Indeed, the illegally imported
animals have been shown to be the factor behind the positive results and
the quarantine that was subsequently imposed, since all the other
laboratory tests have yielded negative results, except for the animals in
consignment No. 13 and the 8 animals from the communally-owned farm which
were in the group of 82 bovines that had been in contact with the illegally
imported animals.
It should be noted that the animals involved in this episode in Argentina
are adults with solid immunity acquired as a result of the systematic and
mandatory vaccination carried out in Argentina until it was suspended on 30
Apr 1999.
Situation regarding the control measures
Stamping out
As of the date of this report, stamping-out operations have ended in the
three establishments with serologically positive animals. Slaughter of all
the animals that tested positive in the three farms has been completed. All
susceptible and in-contact animals as well as all the animals that could
have been in contact with the illegally imported bovines and which were
included in the consignment that was moved out of the area, have been
slaughtered and their carcasses destroyed. The final figures are:
- Formosa (communally-owned farm):
1308 bovines,
10 goats,
35 sheep
9 pigs
(owned by 26 different farmers), slaughtered on 15 Aug 2000.
- Corrientes:
1546 bovines slaughtered on August 12.
- Entre Rios:
709 bovines slaughtered on August 10
During the stamping-out procedures it was noted that none of the animals in
these establishments showed clinical signs of the disease. The farms and
their facilities have been thoroughly disinfected and a waiting period is
being imposed before restocking.
Control of animal movements from the region to the rest of the country
The epidemiological follow-up that was put in place requires that all
animals that were moved from the region to other parts of the country
during the period 1 Jun to 5 Aug 2000 be sampled, placed in quarantine;
movements of these animals to other destinations are banned.
A database with the information on the above shipments was created to
identify even minimum risk possibilities. All points of destination, to
which the consignments were shipped prior to the establishment of the
surveillance zone, were informed. To date, 41 herds including 2377 bovines
in different parts of the country have been tested. All serological test
results were negative.
Prevention and prophylactic measures in the surveillance zone
After the first laboratory findings described in the first report, a system
of zoning was established, with surveillance zones where strict controls
are being implemented. In compliance with the OIE International Animal
Health Code, preventive measures, including a ban on all movements of
animals susceptible to FMD from the surveillance zones to other parts of
the country, have been adopted.
In each surveillance zone, all movements of animals to slaughter will be to
an abattoir within the surveillance zone; they will be subject to strict
controls, including a clinical inspection at the point of departure and at
the destination.
Preventive measures in the rest of the country
In the rest of the country, all movements of susceptible animals to
wintering farms are banned. This involves 252 907 farms and 50 357 559
bovines, in addition to pigs, sheep and goats. Only direct movements to
abattoirs approved for domestic consumption or export in compliance with
the animal health agreements concluded with each importing country are
authorised. All livestock auctions have been suspended.
Mass serological survey
To confirm the health status in the rest of the country, and, in
conjunction with the other actions, a large scale serological survey is in
progress to develop a countrywide serological map.
To date, 2473 bovines, 42 sheep, 11 goats, and 43 pigs, have been sampled
in 102 farms. All serological test results were negative.
