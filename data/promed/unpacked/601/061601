Rapid risk assessment: Multidrug-resistant _Staphylococcus epidermidis_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This rapid risk assessment addresses the public health risk associated with a previously unrecognised international spread of near pandrug-resistant strains of _S. epidermidis_ as a cause of infection in several countries including EU Member States.

Executive summary
-----------------
Several endemic multidrug-resistant _S. epidermidis_ strains predominate across healthcare systems globally [1]. Increases in the rate and breadth of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents among these strains is a concerning trend that may limit treatment options for indwelling and prosthetic device infections that are already difficult to treat. Although there are a number of alternative antimicrobial agents that are active against staphylococci, clinical experience with these antimicrobial agents is still limited.

Consequently, the precise significance for the therapeutic outcome in patients who have foreign devices (such as central vascular catheters, orthopaedic prosthetic devices, and cerebrospinal fluid shunts) and surgical site infections of evolving resistance mechanisms that have been recently described in _S. epidermidis_ is not yet fully characterised.

Further epidemiological studies of the geographical prevalence of multidrug-resistant _S. epidermidis_ strains as a cause of invasive infection in susceptible patient populations as well as prospective in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcome correlation studies are needed to clarify their clinical impact on therapeutic outcomes of foreign-body infections However in the majority of cases of _S. epidermidis_ infections, removal or replacement of the contaminated medical device is already required in addition to antimicrobial therapy.

Irrespective of the findings of further studies, the increasing resistance of _S. epidermidis_ to multiple antimicrobial agents that are currently considered as 1st-line agents for the treatment of _S. epidermidis_ infections highlights the need for prudent use of them and therefore the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. Treatment options should be guided by local epidemiological surveillance data and individual antimicrobial susceptibility test results for each patient's isolates.

Ensuring consistent application of proper infection prevention and control practices, particularly during the insertion and use of medical devices, is crucial for prevention of infections by _S. epidermidis_. More information on antimicrobial susceptibility testing against newer antimicrobial agents with activity against _S. epidermidis_, as well as better evaluation of their effectiveness, is necessary for the optimal management of _S. epidermidis_ infections.

Public health issue
-------------------
A recent article published in the journal Nature Microbiology, 'Global spread of three multidrug-resistant lineages of _Staphylococcus epidermidis_', by JYH. Lee et al. [1] reports a previously unrecognised international spread of near pandrug-resistant strains of _S. epidermidis_ as a cause of infection in several countries including European Union (EU) Member States.

Disease background information
------------------------------
_Staphylococcus epidermidis_ is the most common species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and is the most common species of normal human skin microbiota. _S. epidermidis_ is a Gram-positive bacterium and able to form biofilms. A frequent skin coloniser, _S. epidermidis_ commonly contaminates clinical microbiology samples, but is also a frequent cause of healthcare-associated infection. Due to the propensity to form biofilms, _S. epidermidis_ is a leading cause of infections related to medical devices, such as central venous line-associated bloodstream infections, prosthetic valve endocarditis and surgical site infections (such as hip and knee prosthetic joint infections). CoNS were the most frequently identified cause of central line-associated bloodstream infections in surveillance of healthcare-associated infections acquired in intensive care units in 11 European Union (EU) Member States in 2015 [2] and the second-most common organism isolated from hip and knee prosthetic joint infections in surveillance of surgical site infections in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) [3].

Specific strains of _S. epidermidis_ can become predominant in hospital settings and have been shown to spread within hospitals [4] and between hospitals and countries [5,6]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) studies have demonstrated that several lineages predominate globally, with the most common lineages being ST2, ST5, and ST23. The modes of transmission of _S. epidermidis_ in hospital settings are not well characterised since it is a ubiquitous commensal of the human skin and only acts as an opportunistic pathogen.

Healthcare-associated strains of _S. epidermidis_ produce extracellular biofilms that hinder the action of most antimicrobial agents and host immune response, thus making treatment of medical device infections challenging and often requiring the replacement or removal of the contaminated device for successful treatment of the infection. Antimicrobial agents are administered concomitantly with replacement or removal of the device. Healthcare-associated strains of _S. epidermidis_ tend to be multidrug-resistant, with resistance to methicillin ranging from 75% to 90% [7-9].

Resistance to other antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, fusidic acid, and fluoroquinolones is also very high. The antimicrobial agent of choice for most infections caused by _S. epidermidis_ is vancomycin. Strains with decreased susceptibility or with resistance to vancomycin and the presence of subpopulations resistant to vancomycin (heteroresistance) have been commonly reported [10-12]. Heteroresistance to glycopeptides is not detected with standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing techniques and requires special methods such as the gradient diffusion macromethod or population-analysis profiling area under the concentration-time curve [13]. However, the clinical significance of heteroresistance is unknown [14-16]. Rifampicin [rifampin] is often recommended for the treatment of infections involving prosthetic devices due to activity against staphylococci in biofilms. However, rifampicin should always be used in combination with other active antimicrobial agents due to the rapid development of resistance to rifampicin when used as monotherapy [17]. Resistance of _S. epidermidis_ to rifampicin is also commonly reported [18]. Several other antimicrobial agents remain active in vitro against _S. epidermidis_, such as ceftaroline, ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, oritavancin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, tedizolid, telavancin, and tigecycline. However, resistance to linezolid is increasingly reported, having spread among major predominant healthcare-associated lineages, and can be plasmid-mediated [19-21]. Resistance to the other listed antimicrobial agents is still uncommon.

Due to the challenges of treatment of medical device infections, consistent application of periprocedural infection prevention measures is crucial [22].

Event background information
----------------------------
A comparative genomic study of 419 _S. epidermidis_ clinical isolates from Australia, the EU (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom) and the US identified dual D471E and I527R rpoB gene mutations as a common mechanism related to rifampicin resistance and heteroresistance to glycopeptides that is prevalent among two common sequence types globally: ST2 and ST23 [1]. The study also describes an increasing prevalence of resistance to rifampicin among clinical _S. epidermidis_ isolates from 2007 to 2017 in an Australian hospital and from 2012 and 2017 in a Belgian hospital. The study further confirmed the long-lasting predominance of a limited number of genetic lineages of multidrug-resistant _S. epidermidisÂ¬_ in hospital environments in Australia, the US and the above-mentioned EU Member States.

[The ECDC articles above alert us to the global spread of multidrug-resistant clones of _Staphylococcus epidermidis_. Both _S. epidermidis_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ have become important pathogens in nosocomial infections associated with the use of indwelling catheters and other medical implants. Like _S. aureus_, _S. epidermidis_ persist on implanted medical devices due to formation of biofilm that is able to protect bacteria from antibiotic penetration. Most clinical isolates of _S. epidermidis_ are resistant to methicillin making these infections difficult to treat. For this reason, the drug of choice for treatment of _S. epidermidis_ infections is frequently vancomycin.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin for strains of _S. aureus_ that are susceptible to vancomycin are equal to or less than 2 mg/L. _S. aureus_ strains with reduced vancomycin susceptibility include vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_ strains (VRSA; MIC 16 mg/L or greater) and vancomycin-intermediate _S. aureus_ strains (VISA; MIC = 4 to 8 mg/L).

Some strains exhibit "heteroresistance," that is, a mixed population of bacterial cell with varying vancomycin MICs. More than 99% of the bacterial population of heterogeneous strains is susceptible with vancomycin MIC (2 mg/liter or less), but about 1 in 105-106 are less susceptible to vancomycin with MICs in the intermediate range.

In clinical practice, when the vancomycin MIC is greater than 1 mg/L, the probability of achieving therapeutic blood levels of vancomycin is low with conventional dosing; higher doses may risk nephrotoxicity and high-frequency hearing loss in older patients (https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa036). With heteroresistant strains, vancomycin may create a selective pressure that will favor the outgrowth of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcal subpopulations. However, the clinical significance of heteroresistance in _S. aureus_ has been difficult to assess, although some studies have found its presence is associated with worse clinical outcomes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1865872/).

Rifampin is a potent bactericidal antistaphylococcal antibiotic and is currently used in combination therapy for catheter- and other implant-associated staphylococcal infections, serious _S. aureus_ infections, and to eradicate asymptomatic carriage of methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA). Bacterial resistance to rifampin arises from mutations that alter the rifampin binding site of RNA polymerase. These mutations are located in the rpoB gene that encodes the beta subunit of the bacterial RNA. In _S. aureus_, studies have shown that certain rpoB mutations have resulted in decreased susceptibility not only to rifampin, but also to other antibiotics such as vancomycin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165293/) and daptomycin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2981288/).

Exposure to rifampin can select for rpoB mutants with various levels of increased vancomycin resistance that involves both heteroresistant and intermediate resistant strains (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165293/). This implies that the combined use of rifampin and vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA may have to be reevaluated in view of the risk of facilitating MRSA to acquire vancomycin resistance.

As with _S. aureus_, vancomycin heteroresistance also occurs in _S. epidermidis_ isolates (https://aac.asm.org/content/60/10/5673) and may be associated with a poor response to antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255553/). Lee et al (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6660648/), referenced in the ECDC articles above, confirmed the causal link between certain mutations in rpoB that confer co-resistance to rifampin and vancomycin resistance in _S. epidermidis_, similar to the effect of rpoB mutations in _S. aureus_ and exposure to rifampin can select for reduced susceptibility to other antibiotics, such as vancomycin, in _S. epidermidis_ as rifampin can do in _S. aureus_. - Mod.ML]
