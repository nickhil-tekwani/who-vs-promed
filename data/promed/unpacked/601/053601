A teen from South Kazakhstan oblast has been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Tenginews reports, citing the press office of the Regional Consumer Rights Department.

On 21 Jul 2014, a 14-year-old teenager came to a local hospital feeling sick after being bitten by a tick on 15 Jul 2014. The boy removed the tick himself and did not go to the hospital until he started feeling bad. He was transferred to the Regional Hospital after the tests confirmed CCHF.

At the moment, the boy's condition is considered satisfactory. It has been the 4th confirmed case of CCHF in the region since the beginning of the year [2014]. Earlier, on 18 Jul 2014 a resident of Yenbekshi District was hospitalised with similar symptoms. The man said that a couple days before, he had removed a tick from his hip. After being diagnosed with CCHF, the patient was transferred to a hospital in Shymkent. He is currently under a doctor's supervision at the hospital, and his condition is considered satisfactory.

Since the beginning of the year [2014], there have been 24 patients with suspected CCHF infection. In 2 years, there has not been a single lethal case.

"Last year [2013], there were 4435 tick bites registered. This year [2014], thanks to chemical control, there have been 3003 cases [of tick bites]," the Department reported.

According to WHO, CCHF is a common virus "primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals." Although there is no vaccination available, the antiviral drug ribavirin is used to treat bitten patients. CCHF has a mortality rate from 10-40 per cent.

[CCHF cases have been reported with some frequency in Kazakhstan in past years. Apparently, the affected 14-year-old boy in the above report was infected via tick bite. _Hyalomma_ ticks are the main vectors of CCHF virus. Although CCHF virus infection can be acquired by contact with viremic blood of humans or of animals, or tissues of animals immediately after slaughter, infection via tick bite is more common. CCHF virus is in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
