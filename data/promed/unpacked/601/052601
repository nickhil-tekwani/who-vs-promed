Computer networks have been used for years by public health officials to
monitor outbreaks of disease. Typically, the networks compile a database of
reports about sick patients from doctors or other health care workers and
look for patterns of illness or symptoms. But the reporting and compiling
can take a day or more, delaying detection of an outbreak.

Even before the anthrax attacks in the United States last fall, public
health experts had recognized a need for more rapid surveillance and
detection, given that an outbreak may involve deliberate and widespread
attempts to infect rather than the natural spread of contagion. Several
universities and hospitals are developing systems to collect and analyze
disease data immediately as soon as a patient is admitted to a hospital
emergency room, for example.

One such program, called Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance, or
RODS, is being developed at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at the
University of Pittsburgh. Since October, the program, financed primarily by
the National Library of Medicine, has been receiving data about patients
through a private computer network from 15 hospital emergency departments
in Western Pennsylvania as soon as the patients are admitted.

The information includes the chief complaint a patient gives to emergency
room administrators, like respiratory problems, rashes or diarrhea. The
system also notes the patient's age, time and date of visit, gender, and
ZIP code. This information is kept separate from the patient's name,
address and Social Security number to protect privacy.

The system compares new reports with those in its database, looking for
similarities. In addition, the RODS project uses geographic information
systems software that maps the data to reveal any geographical patterns
behind the surveillance information.

"Our goal is to be able to analyze patterns and ask whether there is
something unusual compared to the usual," said Dr. Michael Wagner,
assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and
director of the RODS Laboratory and the Biomedical Security Institute in
Pittsburgh. Because it focuses on symptoms of patients seeking emergency
care, delays in the detection of outbreaks could be cut significantly.

"A lot of places receive data in batch mode at midnight," Dr. Wagner said.
"This can mean delays in detection of up to 24 hours." The idea, he said,
is that "if 10 people show up with diarrhea in the middle of the night,
it's going to be detected at 3 a.m. rather than at midnight the next
night." If those people are the first of many victims of a bioterrorism
incident, one that will require large amounts of resources like medicine to
fight, "those hours are going to make a difference," Dr. Wagner said.

During the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in February, RODS linked to
about 30 area hospitals and walk-in clinics. Although there were no
incidents of bioterrorism during the games, the system did detect an
influenza outbreak based on the number of patients who showed up with
respiratory complaints.

Ideally, as the RODS system evolves, it would find ways to link to other
sources of data.

"There's a torrent of information being collected routinely in real time,"
Dr. Wagner said. "Over-the-counter sales of pharmaceuticals contain
information that's very relevant to outbreaks of disease. Our goals include
building a thin layer of data collection infrastructure on top of the
existing data collection systems of health care and other
industries." Another real-time disease surveillance program, the
Children's Hospital Project in Boston, monitors its own complaint data and
data from another Boston hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Several other area hospitals have agreed to collaborate over the next year.
Doctors involved in the project are particularly interested in exploring
whether changes in patient behavior can be interpreted as early indicators
of disease outbreaks.

"When people get sick, their behavior changes, and some of these changes
will influence their use of the health care system," said Dr. Kenneth
Mandl, attending physician in pediatric emergency medicine at Children's
Hospital in Boston. He is also a principal investigator of the Children's
Hospital Project, which is financed by the federal Department of Health
and Human Services.

He said that the group was looking for "signature patterns" in sets of data
from emergency departments to detect small and large surges in certain
kinds of visits.

If anthrax was released into a ventilation system in a school, for example,
Dr. Mandl and his staff would look for increases in numbers of children
showing up at hospitals with flulike symptoms over the course of each day,
in addition to clusters of children coming in who lived near one
another. The trick is having a foundation of data about normal behavior
patterns for comparison, Dr. Mandl said. The Boston project is using a
database with information on hundreds of thousands of patients who have
been seen in the emergency department at Children's Hospital over the last
8 years. Whether the goal is to get immediate access to information or not,
disease surveillance systems face many hurdles, most notably the
cooperation of doctors and hospitals in making patient information
available in standardized form. Virtually everyone in the field agrees on
the importance of developing systems that do not require any extra work
from hospital personnel.

"Doctors aren't very compliant about reporting, so the surveillance systems
that rely on that kind of effort tend not to work very well," Dr. Mandl said.

Others question whether patients' complaints are the most accurate way of
gauging potential threats, or whether a doctors' diagnoses or requests for
laboratory tests are a better indicator.

"We think the clinician is going to give us a better picture of a potential
syndrome rather than a patient's self-report," said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, who
oversees a system in the Seattle area that monitors patient discharge
diagnoses in 12 emergency rooms.

[At present there is recognition that no one disease surveillance system is
sufficient to capture all disease occurrence around the world, or even
within a country or a region of a country. In many areas there are
political constraints that create barriers to reporting. In addition, we
still have not mastered how to overcome the barriers of reporting on the
part of a very busy private sector.

Another recognized limitation of disease surveillance is how to correct
laboratory and clinical skill weaknesses that place constraints potentially
leading to errors in diagnoses. To address this last issue, there has been
an emphasis on the development of syndromic surveillance, which relies on
the reporting of clinical syndromes rather than of diagnoses. This means
that the presenting clinical symptoms of cases are reported (e.g. fever and
respiratory illness, fever and hemorrhages, fever and neurologic
symptoms). The Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system
described in this article is such a system that is based on syndromic
surveillance.

At the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases 2002, there
were several presentations related to enhanced surveillance systems and
real-time reporting. Readers are encouraged to view the webcasts of these
presentations:
<http://www.cdc.gov/iceid/webcast/a-z_topics.htm#surveillance_systems>

In one of these presentations, Dr. Ray Arthur of WHO presented data on the
information sources used by the Outbreak Response Team at WHO
Geneva. Their data show that 45 percent of outbreak notifications come
from unofficial sources such as the Canadian Global Public Health
Information Network (GPHIN) and ProMED-mail.

In a prior ProMED-mail posting (Bioterrorism: WHO guidance 20020126.3401),
Mod. JW commented "One highly cost-effective way of improving national
surveillance and alert mechanisms is to implement a national internet-based
outbreak early warning network on the principles of ProMED-mail". At that
time ProMED-mail requested information on alternative surveillance systems
in development, and Dr. Zelicoff of Sandia Laboratories provided
information on the Rapid Syndrome Validation Project (RSVP) being tested in
New Mexico (Disease surveillance: enhancement 20020128.3424). The RSVP
and RODS systems are both internet-based systems addressing real-time
illness presenting to Emergency Rooms and in the case of RSVP, primary care
providers. These systems appear to be very promising for providing
complementary information. We look forward to hearing more results from
the implementation of these and other complementary surveillance systems. -
