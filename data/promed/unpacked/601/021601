A yellow fever outbreak in Angola has killed 37 people since December [2015] with 8 new cases reported in the last 24 hours, the country's national director of health Adelaide de Carvalho says.

The outbreak of yellow fever, which is transmitted by mosquito bites, began in the Luanda suburb of Viana but has spread to other areas of the southern African country, with 191 people infected so far.

De Carvalho said on [Wed 10 Feb 2016] health officials were monitoring suburbs around the capital of Luanda where infections have been worsened by unsanitary conditions caused by a garbage collection backlog.

"Actions should be developed for the improvement of public sanitary and garbage collection," de Carvalho said.

Symptoms of yellow fever include sudden fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.

[The increase in numbers of cases to 191, with 8 new cases in 24 hours, and more yellow fever (YF) fatalities is serious. Collection of garbage may be helpful in eliminating the breeding sites for the vector mosquitoes, but initiation of a comprehensive vaccination campaign is urgent. YF has been spreading around the country in recent days. Although 70 percent of the population reportedly has been vaccinated previously, obviously there are enough unvaccinated susceptible individuals to sustain ongoing transmission and spread.
