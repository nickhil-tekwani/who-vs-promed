The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) is investigating a
cluster of cases of vibriosis in eastern Missouri which were identified 27-28 Jun
2012. 3 cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ [infection] have been identified during this time
period. Typically, this infection is associated with eating raw or undercooked
shellfish, particularly oysters. The investigation is ongoing. DHSS recommends that
any person who has signs or symptoms of acute gastroenteritis after consuming raw
or undercooked shellfish should seek medical care. Health care providers should
consider obtaining stool cultures for Vibriosis in such patients.

Vibriosis is caused by _Vibrio_ bacteria, such as _V. parahaemolyticus_ that grow
in coastal waters. Risk factors for acquiring gastrointestinal Vibrio infections
include: eating raw or undercooked shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels) or crabs; or
cross-contamination of other foods and surfaces with raw shellfish or crabs during
preparation.

Disease symptoms may include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and
in some cases, signs of severe infection (septicemia), including fever and low blood
pressure.

Symptoms can start from 4 to 96 hours after eating contaminated food. Vibriosis
can be a mild to serious disease. People with weakened immune systems, especially those with liver disease, diabetes, and peptic ulcers, are at highest risk for serious disease. The infection is not normally communicable from person to
person. Vibrio infections can be treated with antibiotics. Most episodes of diarrhea are mild
and self-limited, and do not require treatment other than oral rehydration.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E. coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State and Alaska, can also be associated with oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Most cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection are reported from coastal states where there is more exposure to the contaminated (usually) oysters. Oysters, however, can be shipped to non-coastal water states such as Missouri. Affected oysters are classically harvested in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico or other warm water areas but with global warming, the infection has been associated with more northern climes such as Alaska, Washington State and Maine.

The source of the shellfish here is not state and it is certainly possible for cases to be recognized in other states. - Mod. LL
