Influenza update - 379 (based on data up to 11 Oct 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- The current influenza surveillance data should be interpreted with caution as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has influenced to varying extents health seeking behaviors, staffing/routines in sentinel sites, as well as testing priorities and capacities in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.
- Globally, despite continued or even increased testing for influenza in some countries influenza activity remained at lower levels than expected for this time of the year.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained below inter-seasonal levels, though influenza detections were reported in some countries.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, the influenza season remained low or below baseline overall. Very few influenza detections were reported across countries.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, there were no influenza detections reported. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity, likely due to COVID-19, decreased in most reporting countries.
- In tropical South America, there were no influenza detections across reporting countries.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was reported in Cote d'Ivoire and Mali.
- In Southern Asia, there were sporadic influenza detections across reporting countries.
- In South East Asia, increased influenza detections were reported in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR).
- Worldwide, of the very low numbers of detections reported, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 69 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from [28 Sep 2020] to [11 Oct 2020] (data as of 23 Oct 2020 4:13 AM UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 81 257 specimens during that period. A total of 172 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 108 (62.8%) were typed as influenza A and 64 (37.2%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 4 (6.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 62 (93.9%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 2 (8%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 23 (92%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO encourages countries continue routine influenza surveillance, test samples from influenza surveillance sites for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 virus where resources are available, and report this information in a timely manner to established regional and global platforms (See the Operational considerations for COVID-19 surveillance using GISRS guidance at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions).

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2021 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on [16 to 24 Sep 2020] in the format of an e-Consultation. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.

In Kyiv, the incidence of influenza and ARVI [acute respiratory viral infections] has sharply increased -- almost 11 000 people have become infected in a week. This was reported by the press service of the Kyiv City State Administration. "In the capital, 10 804 patients with influenza and acute respiratory viral infections were registered in the week," the statement says.

It is noted that the morbidity among schoolchildren has significantly increased (4955 children fell ill).

At the same time, the Kyiv City State Administration claims that this level of incidence of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections among Kyiv residents is 51.4% lower than the baseline.

A total of 35 people are in hospitals with influenza and ARVI, 14 of them are children.

As we reported earlier, supplies of vaccines from flu reached Ukraine. The 1st batch of triple vaccine Jiss Flu (more than 30 000 doses) from South Korea already passed the lab tests and supplied to Ukrainian pharmacy stores. The tetravalent Vaxigrip Tetra from France is supposed to be available for sale in pharmacy shops in about 2 weeks. Influvac vaccine from the Netherlands will reach the sales soon after passing the lab tests as well.

Another virus is making its way to the front lines: the flu. "This year [2020] is more important than any other year in the history of us giving the influenza vaccine or the flu shot," said Dr Fares Khater, an infectious disease specialist with Appalachian Regional Hospital.

Dr Fares Khater says our region could see a triple threat this year [2020] with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. "Influenza, COVID-19 which is already going on, and we are going to have the others, which is a group of 14 respiratory viruses that have no treatment or vaccine for them," Dr Khater said. "If you can vaccinate yourself for the flu, get it out of the way."

Kentucky Department of Public Health's latest reports show more than 40 cases were reported in counties across the state this week. A 4th of the cases were confirmed in Pike, Floyd, and Greenup counties -- with Pike County ranking as the 4th-highest number of cases confirmed in the state.

Helping to keep the case numbers down, Dr Khater said, is possible with the addition of mask-wearing, but protection won't happen overnight. It takes 2 weeks for flu shots to become effective in your body. "It takes 2 weeks to build up immunity so the sooner the better. Immunity lasts all year long. Some people say, 'I don't want to get it too early because it will fade off,' and it doesn't," Dr. Khater said.

While an earlier recommendation from medical professionals suggested getting 2 shots this year [2020], Dr Khater says otherwise. "You don't need another one in the spring. Immunity is sustainable all year long. One flu shot is enough," he said.

["WHO reports the worldwide circulation of influenza virus to be much lower than expected for this time of the year. With over [47.9 million cases and about 1.2 million deaths as of 4 Nov 2020] due to COVID-19 reported globally and the northern hemisphere entering the influenza season, this low circulation of influenza virus could be matters of both reassurance and concern, warns WHO. The decreased circulation of the virus is likely largely attributable to the mandatory physical distancing and hygiene protocols implemented to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV2.

"However, the potential impact of altered infection testing priorities, healthcare personnel capacity, and health-seeking behaviors during the pandemic should not be ignored." (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30130-0/fulltext).

It is important to understand that the key measures recommended for the prevention of influenza include cough etiquette, hand washing, and annual vaccination, particularly in the high-risk groups. The 1st 2 are the same non-pharmaceutical measures (NPIs) as those recommended for COVID-19 protection, except the availability of an efficacious vaccine, as yet.

The bottom line is that both diseases can be prevented by mask-wearing, frequent and thorough hand washing, coughing into the crook of your elbow, staying home when sick, and limiting contact with people who are infected. Another strategy to reduce the likelihood of a double epidemic would be to strengthen existing influenza vaccination programs.

In addition to continuing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), one way to prepare for a possible double epidemic is to ramp up the testing capacity for both COVID-19 and seasonal infections. Combination testing for both COVID-19 and influenza could also be beneficial, as a single sample could be used to distinguish the 2 infections in patients presenting with similar symptoms. Another reason it is important to determine whether respiratory symptoms are due to influenza or to COVID-19 (or both) is that mitigation efforts for the former aren't as strict as for the latter. - Mod.UBA]
