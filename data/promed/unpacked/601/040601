Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease shows up in Niagara County
-----------------------------------
With the deer season open, news that outbreaks of epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has been found in deer from Albany,
Rensselaer and Niagara counties [in New York state], is distressing.
The diseased deer from Niagara County was reported from the Youngstown area.

Although EHD is not a threat to human health, hunters are advised to
wear rubber gloves when field dressing deer. They are also advised to
not eat organ meats such as heart or liver and to wash thoroughly any
instruments such as knives that come in contact with deer tissue.
Eating any organ meat poses a risk of infections of various types to
humans. Hunters are advised to have deer boned out professionally to
assure as much fat, connective tissues and lymph nodes [as possible]
are removed.

In general, any animal suspected to be ill should not be consumed. If
the deer you drop doesn't seem healthy, notify a DEC [Department of
Environmental Conservation] officer and if the deer is considered
unfit for human consumption, you will be issued another deer tag.

Generally, symptoms of an infected animal would be swollen head, neck
or tongue, ulcers within the mouth, peeling of hooves and intestinal
bleeding and possibly staggering when walking or running. Animals
contract EHD from bites of flies called midges. A heavy frost kills
the midges, eliminating the danger of further incidents.

[Whether] the deer you take appears healthy or not, the main thing
you should always think of is to be as clean as possible. You cannot
wash your hands often enough. Also, check your clothing for any deer
ticks that may have jumped from the deer to your clothing. Some deer
ticks can carry Lyme disease, which can be fatal to humans. Don't
take a chance. If the deer appears suspicious, call a DEC officer to
be on the safe side.
