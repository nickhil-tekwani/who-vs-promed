Accepted for publication 25 Oct 2004
In the spring of 2004, severe outbreaks of a disease resembling citrus
blast (Whiteside et al., 1988), were observed on trees of orange (_Citrus
cinensis_ cv. Washington) and mandarin (_Citrus reticulata_ cv. Marisol) in
the Turkish Mediterranean regions of Adana and Antalya. Characteristic
disease symptoms were 1st seen on leaves as water-soaked lesions and black
areas on the petiole wings.
Later lesions extended to the mid vein of leaves and to the twigs
surrounding the base of the petiole. Finally, the leaves dried and rolled,
while still firmly attached, before eventually dropping without petioles.
The necrotic areas on twigs further enlarged, and the twigs were eventually
killed within 20-30 days. The damage was serious in a 50 hectare citrus
orchard in Antalya, with a disease incidence of nearly 100 percent.
12 isolates of a bacterium, consistently isolated from infected leaves,
petioles, and twigs, which formed fluorescent colonies on King's medium B,
were purified and used for further studies. All isolates were gram,
oxidase, pectolytic activity, starch hydrolase, arginine dihydrolase, and
nitrate reduction negative; and levan, gelatin hydrolase positive. They
produced hypersensitive reactions (positive) on tobacco leaves (_Nicotiana
tabacum_ cv Samsun N.). All produced acid from glucose, glycerine,
arabinose, mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and xylose, but not from lactose
and maltose.
The test results conformed to the characteristics of _P. syringae_ pv.
_syringae_ [Pss] (Braun-Kiewnick & Sands, 2001) as the causal organism of
citrus blast and were similar to those of reference strain NCPPB 2307 of
Pss used in this study. Fatty acid analysis (Ataturk University, Erzurum,
Turkey) confirmed the bacterial strains as Pss with similarity indices of
81 to 94 percent.
Pathogenicity of the strains was tested on one-year-old mandarin.
Inoculations were made using a hypodermic needle with a suspension of
bacteria in a saline buffer (100 million cfu per ml), into areas on the
wing of the petiole. Saline buffer alone was used for negative controls.
Test plants were incubated in clear polyethylene bags for 24 hours in a
controlled climate room at 25 C, 70 percent relative humidity, and 16-hour
per day light period.
Inoculated plants showed water-soaked or black areas, which quickly moved
in both directions along the mid vein of the leaves, 7 to 9 days after
inoculation. From these, Pss was readily re-isolated.
Bacterial canker on apricot caused by Pss has been reported previously in
Turkey (Kotan & Sahin, 2002), but this is the 1st outbreak and occurrence
of citrus blast disease in Turkey.
[There was an error in the nomenclature of mandarin. The original text
indicated that mandarin was _Citrus rediculate_, but it should have been
_Citrus reticulata_. The original text has been corrected. - Mod.DH]

[The only reference in the ProMED-Plant archives is that of Pss as a
pathogen on mango. Pss is an epiphytic bacterium and usually causes damage
following an injury, such as wind damage, frost, hail, etc. Frost causes
the removal of the epidermis thus allowing the bacterium to invade floral
tissues. Low temperature and wet conditions favor disease development.
Boron deficient trees are more susceptible to disease. Disease management
involves protection from frost, removal of contaminated shoots, and use of
copper sprays (Bordeaux mixture) at bud-swelling stage. In years of heavy
rainfall, a 2nd application of Bordeaux mixture may be necessary. The 2nd
link shows good pictures of diseased tissues on pear; I could not find good
photographs for citrus, but the photographs of pear are useful and should
give you a good idea of disease symptoms.
