More than 170 people have fallen ill in a suspected food poisoning case at a furniture factory in Baoshan District [Shanghai], district authorities said today, 16 Jun 2016

The canteen of Taiyi Co Ltd had made cold dishes improperly, which could have caused the incident, the Baoshan District Market Supervision and Management Bureau said based on its initial investigation result. The canteen has been closed.

Patients showed symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting since 7:50pm yesterday, 15 Jun 2016, and they received treatment at the northern outlet of Huashan Hospital. They are in stable condition. Investigation is still underway.

[There is not enough information given to suggest an etiology of the illnesses here which include chemical poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, viruses, bacterial infection, bacterial toxin, shellfish toxin, and parasitic infestation. The incubation period of the illness, whether vomiting or diarrhea were more prominent, and whether fever was present can be helpful. - Mod.LL
