BANANA VIRUSES - PHILIPPINES (02): (CATANDUANES) ABACA BAN

Selling and transporting abaca planting materials outside the island
province of Catanduanes, the "abaca capital of the Philippines," is
now a crime punishable with imprisonment and heavy fines.

The ordinance is a preventive measure against the spread of abaca
plant diseases in the light of findings that the dreaded bunchy top,
mosaic and bract mosaic diseases have been infecting 15 percent of the
province's vast abaca plantations.

The measure was enacted in response to findings that some abaca
producers and traders have been indiscriminately selling planting
materials to buyers from the Bicol mainland and transporting them
outside the province.

[A number of viruses can affect the members of genus _Musa_, which
includes species and hybrids representing wild and cultivated bananas,
plantains (cooking bananas), and abaca (_Musa textilis_).

_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_) only affects
_Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana
with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. The
virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands.
BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a
persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material.
The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be
transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

Mosaic-like symptoms on _Musa_ species may be due to several viruses,
but the mosaic disease above most likely refers to certain strains of
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV; genus _Cucumovirus_). In banana, this
disease is also called infectious chlorosis or heart rot. CMV is
spread by several species of aphids, mechanical means, with infected
plant material, and has also been reported to be seed transmitted in
banana (more information on CMV via ProMED-mail post 20080505.1533).

_Banana bract mosaic virus_ (BBrMV; genus _Potyvirus_) affects _Musa_
species causing characteristic dark reddish-brown mosaic symptoms,
which are especially obvious in bracts. It is responsible for
significant yield losses in banana and abaca in the Philippines,
India, and Sri Lanka. BBrMV is spread mainly by several aphid species
and infected planting material, transmission by cutting tools is still
being investigated.

Control of these viruses is difficult since aphid vectors and virus
reservoirs are widespread. Disease management may include removal of
inoculum, use of clean planting material, and use of
resistant/tolerant crop varieties for replanting. The quarantine
measures described above would be likely to limit spread of the
viruses and/or local viral strains if they can be enforced effectively.
