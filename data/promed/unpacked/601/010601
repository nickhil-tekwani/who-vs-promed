[A] Vaccines against long COVID
A new review of 15 studies analyzed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows COVID-19 vaccination is protective against developing symptoms of long COVID, or symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks after the initial infection.

The UKHSA said approximately 2% of people in the United Kingdom with COVID-19 have gone on to develop long COVID, with the most common symptoms being lingering fatigue, shortness of breath, and muscle and joint pain.

In a new rapid evidence review (https://ukhsa.koha-ptfs.co.uk/cgi-bin/koha/opac-retrieve-file.pl?id=fe4f10cd3cd509fe045ad4f72ae0dfff), the agency says 8 studies show strong evidence that people who received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine are half as likely to develop long COVID. Another 4 studies demonstrate evidence that people who are vaccinated after receiving a long COVID diagnosis see their symptoms improve.

Mary Ramsay, MD, the head of Immunization at UKHSA, said in a press release (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-review-shows-vaccinated-less-likely-to-have-long-covid-than-unvaccinated), "These studies add to the potential benefits of receiving a full course of the COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself from serious symptoms when you get infected and may also help to reduce the longer-term impact."

In a related development, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) yesterday [16 Feb 2022] published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection new rapid guidelines for the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID [see citation below].

ESCMID recommends that patients experiencing respiratory symptoms at 3 months post initial infection may benefit from routine blood tests, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests.

[B] Promising COVID-19 antiviral combo
A phase 2/3 trial of 2246 symptomatic, unvaccinated, high-risk COVID-19 outpatients finds that a combination of the antivirals nirmatrelvir and ritonavir lowered the risk of progression to severe illness by 89%.

Results of the trial, led by scientists from nirmatrelvir-maker Pfizer, were published yesterday [16 Feb 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) [see citation below].

The researchers randomly assigned 2246 COVID-19 patients to receive either 300 milligrams (mg) of oral nirmatrelvir and 100 mg of ritonavir (1120 patients) or a placebo every 12 hours for 5 days (1126).

An interim analysis of 774 patients treated within 3 days of symptom onset showed that nirmatrelvir recipients' incidence of COVID-related hospitalization or death by day 28 was 6.32 percentage points lower than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval [CI], -9.04 to -3.59; relative risk reduction [RR], 89.1%).

Three of 389 nirmatrelvir patients (0.77%) were hospitalized, but none died. In contrast, 27 of 385 placebo patients (7.01%) were hospitalized, and 7 of them died.

The final analysis of 1379 patients showed similar efficacy, with a difference in incidence of 5.81 percentage points (95% CI, -7.78 to -3.84) and a relative RR of 88.9%. All 13 deaths were among placebo recipients.

The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was lower in the nirmatrelvir than in the placebo group at day 5 of treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in similar proportions in both groups (22.6% with nirmatrelvir vs 23.9% with placebo). Serious adverse events occurred in 1.6% of the nirmatrelvir group, compared with 6.6% in the placebo group, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 2.1% vs. 4.2%, respectively.

Two adverse effects were reported more often in the nirmatrelvir than in the placebo group, with 5.6% versus 0.3% having an abnormal sense of taste and 3.1% versus 1.6% reporting diarrhea.

A related editorial (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2202160) by Eric Rubin, MD, PhD, NEJM editor-in-chief, and Deputy Editor Lindsey Baden, MD, said that the antiviral combination should be reserved for high-risk COVID-19 patients no more than 5 days after symptom onset. "Until we have a better idea of the potential for the emergence of resistance, we need to be good stewards of this medication," they wrote.

"Nirmatrelvir is an orally administered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor with potent pan-human-coronavirus activity in vitro."]

[From the editorial,
". . . Investigators now report in the [NEJM] the 1st small-molecule antiviral agent designed specifically to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The active component, nirmatrelvir, is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme, one of 2 essential proteases encoded by the virus. Protease inhibitors have a record of success in treating viral infections that dates from their introduction for the treatment of HIV. Like the antiretroviral medications, nirmatrelvir is rapidly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is therefore administered together with a low dose of the potent inhibitor of that enzyme, ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir blocks viral replication in vitro at low concentrations and, when given with ritonavir, achieves effective plasma levels."

"In vitro studies, however, suggest that the activity of nirmatrelvir is preserved across all tested viral strains."

"The absolute benefit will accrue primarily to patients at highest risk for disease progression, particularly those with multiple and serious coexisting conditions and those unable to mount sufficient immune responses. The timing of nirmatrelvir therapy is probably critical as well. Although the trial showed little difference between initiating treatment within 3 days and initiating it within 5 days after the onset of symptoms, initiating therapy much later than 5 days is very likely to be less effective. This is certainly true for other antiviral agents, such as remdesivir, which has only a small effect in hospitalized patients but has a much greater effect when given early in the course of infection." - Mod.LK]

[2] South Africa: clinical severity BA.2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
-------
Early data indicated that infection with omicron BA.1 sub-lineage was associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation and severe illness, compared to delta infection. Recently, the BA.2 sub-lineage has increased in many areas globally. We aimed to assess the severity of BA.2 infections compared to BA.1 in South Africa. We performed data linkages for (i) national COVID-19 case data, (ii) SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data, and (iii) COVID-19 hospitalisations data, nationally. For cases identified using TaqPath COVID-19 PCR, infections were designated as S-gene target failure (SGTF, proxy for BA.1) or S-gene positive (proxy for BA.2). Disease severity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models comparing individuals with S-gene positive infection to SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between 1 Dec 2021 - 20 Jan 2022. From week 49 (starting 5 Dec 2021) through week 4 (ending 29 Jan 2022), the proportion of S-gene positive infections increased from 3% (931/31 271) to 80% (2425/3031). The odds of being admitted to hospital did not differ between individuals with S-gene positive (BA.2 proxy) infection compared to SGTF (BA.1 proxy) infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.09). Among hospitalised individuals, after controlling for factors associated with severe disease, the odds of severe disease did not differ for individuals with S-gene positive infection compared to SGTF infection (aOR 0.91, 95%CI 0.68-1.22). These data suggest that while BA.2 may have a competitive advantage over BA.1 in some settings, the clinical profile of illness remains similar.

Discussion
We found a similar proportion of individuals were hospitalised and developed severe illness, given hospitalisation, for individuals infected with BA.1 compared to BA.2, during the omicron-dominated 4th wave in South Africa. These data are reassuring, suggesting that while BA.2 may have a competitive advantage over BA.1 in some settings, the clinical profile of illness remains similar. South Africa may differ from other settings in having a high level of previous immunity following natural infection, and data evaluating BA.2 severity are needed from other settings.

"...BA.2, is a strain of the highly contagious omicron variant that appears to spread even more easily: about 30% more easily.

"Because BA.2 quickly overtook the original omicron in South Africa and other countries and has even caused a 2nd omicron surge in Denmark, researchers have been bracing for the same thing to happen in the US.

"'A lot of us were assuming that it was going to quickly take off in the United States just like it was doing in Europe and become the new dominant variant,' says Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.

"So far that hasn't happened. Instead, BA.2 has slowly, but steadily, spread even as the omicron surge continued to dissipate. The fear is that spread may be on track to rapidly accelerate in the near future.

"BA.2 has now been found from coast to coast and accounts for an estimated 3.9% of all new infections nationally, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It appears to be doubling fast.

"'If it doubles again to 8%, that means we're into the exponential growth phase, and we may be staring at another wave of COVID-19 coming in the US,' says Samuel Scarpino, the manager director of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation. 'And that's, of course, the one we're really worried about . . .'"

"Although vaccination and prior infection does appear to protect people against BA.2, this version of the virus seems somewhat better at evading the immune system than the original omicron was. This increases the concern that it could drive a growth in new cases."

[3] Russian flu? Coronavirus?
Date: Tue 15 Feb 2022
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/health/russian-flu-coronavirus.html


In May 1889, people living in Bukhara, a city that was then part of the Russian Empire, began sickening and dying. The respiratory virus that killed them became known as the Russian flu. It swept the world, overwhelming hospitals and killing the old with special ferocity.

Schools and factories were forced to close because so many students and workers were sick. Some of the infected described an odd symptom: a loss of smell and taste. And some of those who recovered reported a lingering exhaustion.

The Russian flu finally ended a few years later, after at least 3 waves of infection.

Its patterns of infection and symptoms have led some virologists and historians of medicine to now wonder: Might the Russian flu actually have been a pandemic driven by a coronavirus? And could its course give us clues about how our pandemic will play out and wind down?

If a coronavirus caused the Russian flu, some believe that pathogen may still be around, its descendants circulating worldwide as one of the 4 coronaviruses that cause the common cold. If so, it would be different from flu pandemics whose viruses stick around for a while only to be replaced by new variants years later that cause a new pandemic.

If that is what happened to the Russian flu, it might bode well for the future. But there is another scenario. If today's coronavirus behaves more like the flu, immunity against respiratory viruses is fleeting. That might mean a future of yearly COVID shots.

But some historians voice caution about the Russian flu hypothesis.

"There is very little, almost no hard data" on the Russia flu pandemic, said Frank Snowden at Yale.

[It is going to take sequencing of snippets of RNA from autopsy tissues or cadaver samples to determine whether the "Russian flu" was actually a coronavirus. Until that is successful, not an easy feat, one can only speculate. There are some factors that are suggestive of a coronavirus rather than the flu (e.g., loss of taste and smell, greater mortality in older people). But they are not definitive. It is an enticing hypothesis that, if proven, could help elucidate what the future holds. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 34 countries including Russia (152 337), Germany (111 824), South Korea (99 550), Turkey (85 026), Japan (72 861), Brazil (42 379), the USA (57 665), UK (48 820), Spain (48 778), Viet Nam (46 880), the Netherlands (35 987), Indonesia (34 418), Switzerland (32 172), Malaysia (27 808), Denmark (27 406), Chile (25 073), Italy (24 484), Poland (23 667), Australia (21 744), Mexico (21 449), Austria (21 436), Iran (19 110), Greece (18 088), Singapore (13 623), Thailand (18 363), Finland (17 671), France (17 195), Norway (14 879), Israel (13 951), Ukraine (13 562), Hungary(13 261), India (12 106), Ireland (11 654), Jordan (11 254), Argentina (11 170), and Ecuador (10 961) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3091 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 19 Feb 2022 to late 20 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. However, the 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 79 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 39 of the 79 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 21.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 45.0% decrease in daily reported cases and 18.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.39 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 426.38 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.90 million reported deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
