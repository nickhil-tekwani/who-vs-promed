The Health Protection Agency announced on Saturday [25 Oct 2008] that
it has been responding to an isolated case of inhalation anthrax
contracted from imported animal hides used for making drums. The
patient concerned is being treated in intensive care at a London
hospital. As part of an investigation to identify where the anthrax
originated from, the Agency will be carrying out some testing at the
patient's workshop in Hackney at the start of next week. This will
involve a team from the Agency who will wear protective clothing and
use a handling tent outside the property. These are standard
procedures when this sort of work is carried out, to prevent the
potential of any transfer of the bacteria.

Professor Nigel Lightfoot, Chief Advisor at the Agency, said, "We
have been working with Hackney Council to ensure that all residents
of the property have been communicated with and have had an
opportunity to ask questions. There is no risk to the inhabitants of
this block of flats, or the wider residents in the area. The
patient's property is currently secured and there is no-one living
there. If this testing reveals the presence of anthrax spores then
this information will be communicated to local residents and
specialist cleaning will be carried out to remove any trace of
anthrax from the property.

"We have also been following up any contacts of this patient who may
have been exposed to the anthrax spores by being in the same room
when the animal skins were being prepared when the drums were made.
We have so far given antibiotics to 7 people as a precautionary
measure, and no-one else has developed any symptoms of anthrax. It is
important to stress that it is the making of animal skin drums that
is the risk for coming into contact with anthrax rather than playing
or handling drums.

"We have stressed to all residents throughout this incident that
there is no risk to their health as a result of the case of anthrax,
or the testing that will be carried out. We are however keen to
reiterate to all individuals who make drums from imported animal
skins that there is a risk of coming into contact with anthrax and
that they should ensure they are aware of this and take precautions
to protect themselves when making these drums."

1. Anthrax is a disease caused by spores that live in the
environment. It can cause a skin infection (cutaneous anthrax) or as
in this case, inhalation anthrax, when the spores are inhaled into
the lungs. Inhalation anthrax is very rare and is not passed from
person to person. All individuals who may have been exposed to
anthrax spores during the making of these drums have already been
given antibiotics to prevent them from becoming ill. Anthrax is not
passed from person to person.

2. Despite the popularity of African drumming in the UK and
elsewhere over recent years, no cases of anthrax associated with
these activities have been reported. A single case of cutaneous
(skin) anthrax associated with a goat hide bongo drum purchased in
Haiti occurred in 1974: this is the only such case ever reported.

3. A case of inhalation anthrax occurred in 2006 in America in a man
who made drums from dried (but otherwise untreated) animal hides
brought in from West Africa. A recent case (in August 2006) also
occurred in Scotland in a man who made drums from imported animal
hides.

4. Anthrax infections associated with the handling of untanned
animal hides are now extremely rare in the UK. Imported animal hides
from countries where anthrax is endemic in animals (for example, in
Africa and Asia) pose a higher risk for exposure than domestic (UK
origin) hides.

5. Strict regulations are in place for the importation of animal
hides. These can be accessed at:

[Our thanks to Emily Collins for this full report. A question: Has
anyone placed an air-sampler next to these drums while they are being
played? In my day Porton produced a very nice, discreet, robust,
glass chambered air sampling device that needed only 15 lbs of vacuum
pressure and it roughly sorted the particle sizes. I would not be
surprised if a certain percentage -- small maybe -- of African drums
were found to be discharging spores. Anthrax is widespread in West
African countries, where it seems these hides have been coming from.
