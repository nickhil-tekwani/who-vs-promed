Increase in babesiosis cases in New York
----------------------------------------
Babesiosis, a rare and occasionally fatal tick-borne disease caused by
microscopic parasites known as _Babesia_, which infect red blood
cells, is on the rise in the Lower Hudson Valley according to the New
York State Department of Health, including the counties of
Westchester, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, Ulster, Sullivan and Rockland.

Babesiosis is a malaria-like disease most commonly transmitted by
infected deer ticks. It is transmitted in the same way as Lyme disease
and ehrlichiosis and may occur in conjunction with these other diseases.

It can also be transmitted by blood transfusions. "For the most part
human babesiosis is fairly uncommon, but reported cases particularly
here in the Lower Hudson Valley have been on the rise recently," said
Dr Gary Wormser, chief of infectious diseases at Westchester Medical
Center.

"The number of cases reported annually in just this area has increased
from around 5 in 2001 to nearly 120 in 2008. Despite the large number
of Lyme disease cases in the Lower Hudson Valley for many years,
babesiosis has only occurred in this area since 2001.

Some patients can have an asymptomatic infection that is self-limited.
Patients who are older, are immunodeficient, or have had their spleens
removed in the past are most susceptible to more severe clinical
presentations."

The parasite infects the red blood cells and causes anemia. Symptoms
may begin with tiredness, loss of appetite and a general ill feeling.
As the infection progresses, these symptoms may be followed by fever,
profuse, drenching sweats, muscle aches and headache. The symptoms can
last from several days to several months.

Effective treatments are available, and most people who are infected
with _Babesia microti_ respond well.

Complications of the infection include very low blood pressure, liver
problems, severe hemolytic anemia (a breakdown of red blood cells) and
kidney failure. In life-threatening cases, exchange blood transfusion
is performed. In this procedure, the infected red blood cells are
removed and replaced with fresh ones.

In North America, the disease is most notably found in eastern Long
Island, Shelter Island, Block Island, coastal Connecticut and the
islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard off of the coast of
Massachusetts, but can be found in other states and locations.

"Babesiosis should be considered an emerging infectious disease," adds
Wormser. "And while there is no vaccine to prevent it in human beings,
you can reduce your risk of contracting it by taking a few simple
precautions, especially outdoors in known tick infested areas."

Tips for preventing babesiosis:

- During outside activities, in known or potential tick infested
locations, wear long sleeves and long pants tucked into socks.
- Insect repellents containing the compound DEET can be used on
exposed skin except for the face and hands, but they do not kill ticks
and are not 100 percent effective in preventing tick bites.
- Products containing permethrin kill ticks, but they cannot be used
on the skin -- only on clothing. When using any of these chemicals,
follow label directions carefully. Be especially cautious when using
them on children.
- After outdoor activities, check yourself for ticks, and have a
"buddy" check you, too. Check body areas where ticks are commonly
found: behind the knees, between the fingers and toes, under the arms,
in and behind the ears, and on the neck, hairline, and top of the
head. Check places where clothing presses on the skin.
- Remove attached ticks immediately. Removing a tick before it has
been attached for more than 24 hours greatly reduces the risk of
infection. Use tweezers and grab as closely to the skin as possible.
Do not try to remove ticks by squeezing them, coating them with
petroleum jelly, or burning them with a match.

For inquiries about babesiosis and other tick-borne diseases contact

[An increase in _Babesia_ transmitted by blood transfusion was noticed
by the New York City Health department (reported by ProMED in 2009),
which supports the idea that the increase in diagnosed cases reported
here is a real increase and not just an increase due to increased
diagnostics. The reservoir is not only deer and in order to control
the infection studies into the reservoir are needed. - Mod.EP]
