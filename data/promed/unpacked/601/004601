An outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in 23 districts of Nepal has claimed
28 lives in the past one and a half months, the official RSS news agency
said Saturday. The disease, transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, breaks
out in Nepal every year, and has already affected 239 people this year, RSS
said, quoting the Department of Health Services. It said 210 people are
still undergoing treatment at hospitals.
It noted that though vaccine against the disease is available now, Nepal
has not been able to arrange for such vaccination because of its high cost.
However, vaccination will be arranged in the future for children who are
more prone to the disease, it added.

[Recent testing of the Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine produced in
China yielded promising results. Because of its expected low cost, this
vaccine could be a boon to countries without sufficient funds to purchase
current vaccines. - Mod.CHC
