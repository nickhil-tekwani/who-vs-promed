Ascochyta outbreak in Central Queensland
----------------------------------------
Central Queensland's status as the only ascochyta blight-free chickpea
cropping area in Australia is under threat following a confirmed outbreak
of this fungal disease in a few Dawson-Callide crops. Department of Primary
Industries and Fisheries [DPI&F] principal plant pathologist, Dr Mal Ryley,
inspected the suspect crops on 22 Aug [2008] with DPI&F pulse research
scientist, Col Douglas, and Pulse Australia northern region development
officer, Gordon Cumming.

Ascochyta blight (AB) is responsible for serious chickpea production losses
throughout southern cropping areas and this 1st confirmed outbreak [in this
region] has triggered the industry action response plan only launched in
April [2007]. Dr Ryley urged all Central Queensland growers to check their
2008 season crop for any signs of the disease.

Dead leaves and broken stems are usually the 1st indication of infection
with the stems often breaking near the lesion. "This year's [2008] Central
Queensland chickpea crop covers an estimated 50 000 hectares [123 553
acres] so it is imperative that all regional growers are well informed and
well positioned to contain and defuse this confirmed AB outbreak," Dr Ryley
said.

The current chickpea varieties grown in Central Queensland are very
susceptible to ascochyta blight. Dr Ryley said the recommended AB disease
management strategy involves 5 vital steps: farm hygiene; timely fungicide
spray applications; crop management; ensuring that no chickpeas are grown
in the paddock for 3 years; and making sure that planting seed from this
crop is not retained.

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Ascochyta
rabiei_ and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas
worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and is
specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool, wet
conditions. Symptoms include spots and lesions on leaves, stems, and pods,
which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may break off and the
plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled, spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2 years
under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high humidity. It is
seed borne at a high rate of 50-80 per cent. Seed transmission is the
primary mode of spread both locally and worldwide. Disease management
includes cultural methods, seed treatment, prophylactic fungicide
applications, and use of varieties with improved resistance.

_A. rabiei_ has previously caused serious losses to chickpea crops in
southern Australia. _A. lentis_ causes a similar blight in lentils and _A.
pinodes_ in peas.
