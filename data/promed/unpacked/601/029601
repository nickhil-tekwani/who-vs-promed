Mystery disease kills 15 buffalo
--------------------------------
15 buffalo have died because of a mysterious disease during the past 2
days, 12 of them on Tuesday alone, in the Lalru-Dera Bassi belt, sending
alarm bells ringing among the dairy farmers and the dairy industry in the
region.
Confirming the deaths, a senior doctor at the veterinary hospital at Dera
Bassi said the disease is apparently contagious and spreads fast. Among the
symptoms of the disease are laziness, mild fever, and unconsciousness among
the animals. Other symptoms are involuntary watery discharge from the mouth
and increased speed of respiration. The animals die a quick death, the
doctor said.
Sources said that the deaths are putting the dairy farmers to a huge
financial loss because a high-yielding variety of buffalo costs between Rs
15 000 and Rs 18 000 (USD 276-413). Alarmed by the situation, the animal
husbandry department has started a drive to vaccinate the domesticated milk
animals to prevent the further spread of the disease. There are also
apprehensions that the disease could spread to poultry stock as well.
Punjab animal husbandry secretary D S Bains said he was not aware of the
spread of the disease and could confirm it only by Wednesday.

[This is a rather confused and confusing description of the ailment
reportedly affecting dairy buffalo (and threatening poultry?!) in Punjab.
More details, including case fatality rates, data on the vaccine which is
allegedly being considered or applied, and exclusion of possible
non-contagious agents (toxicological feed-related etiology?), would be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
