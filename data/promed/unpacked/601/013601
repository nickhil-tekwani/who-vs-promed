The scale of a _Salmonella_ outbreak in France linked to raw milk cheese has jumped to more than 80 possible cases. Santé publique France, the national public health agency, said 83 people had been identified so far in the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis outbreak, which is up from 14 in the initial announcement. The cheese was also distributed to Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Belgium and Germany have issued recall notices.

A total of 65 patients in France have been interviewed about their symptoms and food consumption history. Of them, 80 percent reported eating reblochon made with raw milk before the onset of symptoms. The French Ministry of Agriculture and Food previously said the outbreak had been traced to reblochon -- a type of cheese -- made by Fromagerie De La Tournette. In late November 2018, the company recalled whole 450-gram packs and half cheeses under a variety of brand names with sanitary mark FR 74.128.050 CE and use-by dates between 17 Nov 2018 and 16 Dec 2018.

Epidemiological, environmental and traceability investigations are continuing to find the origin of contamination. As of early December 2018, there had not been positive sampling of the cheese with _Salmonella_ but the connection was made from consumption history of patients. Santé publique France is investigating with the National _Salmonella_ Reference Center at the Institut Pasteur and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Regional Health Agency (ARS).

Symptom onset dates range from 16 Sep 2018 to 19 Nov 2018 with a peak from 1 to 7 Oct 2018. 15 people were hospitalized for salmonellosis. They have now been discharged and are well with no deaths reported.

The National Salmonella Reference Center identified 71 strains sharing the same results via whole genome sequencing. The strains correspond to sick people living mainly in Rhône-Alpes (n=53) with 18 others being spread across 10 regions in the country. There are 47 men and 24 women, with a mean age of 40. Only 2 children under the age of five are concerned.

An additional 12 strains of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis isolated from people living in Rhône-Alpes received by the National Salmonella Reference Center are being sequenced to see if they share the same characteristics and belong to the same cluster.
