["African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral disease affecting all species of Equidae caused by an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_. 9 different serotypes have been described."

"There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories."
(Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.5.1 "African Horse sickness". https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.01_AHS.pdf)

According to the media report, "After 5 suspected cases of African horse sickness (AHS) were detected on a Cederberg farm, the Western Cape government has taken emergency steps to control further disease outbreak. The Cederberg area of the Western Cape has been established as an African horse sickness outbreak-control area."
