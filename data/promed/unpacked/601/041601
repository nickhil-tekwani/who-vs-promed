the overall case fatality rate, reflecting the overall poor
conditions in the country, remains very high at 5.2 percent.

through the province's health facilities since November 2008.

These cases included 82 people reported over the last day. A total of
11 lives had been lost to the disease in the province.

Vhembe, together with Sekhukhune and Capricorn districts, was
identified by Limpopo health MEC Seoparo Charles Sekoati as having
the highest number of cholera patients with 68 new cases treated in
the areas over the last day.

[The case fatality rate, whether 8/17 or 8/17+8 (it is not clear
which) is abnormally high, suggesting that either many non-fatal cases
are going unreported, or something other than cholera is causing the
outbreak. - Mod.JW
