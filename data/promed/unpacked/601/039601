1st Report of _Fusarium oxysporum_ Causing Yellows on Sugar Beet in the Red
River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota.
C. E. Windels and J. R. Brantner, University of Minnesota, NW Research and
Outreach Center, Crookston 56716; and C. A. Bradley, Department of Plant
Pathology, and M. F. R. Khan, Department of Soil Science, North Dakota
State University, Fargo 58105. Plant Dis. 89:341, 2005; published on-line
as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0341B. Accepted for publication 8 Dec 2004.
In 2002, some sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_ L.) fields in the Red River
Valley (RRV) of Minnesota and North Dakota had symptoms characteristic of
Fusarium yellows (4). In 2004, approximately 5 percent of fields in the RRV
had symptomatic plants. Interveinal yellowing of older leaves typically
began in mid-July and as the disease progressed, younger leaves turned
yellow. Sometimes, one side of the leaf was yellow or necrotic while the
other side remained green. As leaves died, they remained attached to the crown.
Transverse sections of roots revealed a light gray-brown discoloration of
the vascular tissue but no external rotting of roots. Isolations from 35
symptomatic roots collected in 8 fields yielded 25 isolates identified as
_F. oxysporum_ (from single conidia grown on homemade potato dextrose agar
and carnation leaf agar) (3).
Pathogenicity was determined by dipping roots of 5-week-old sugar beet
plants (cv. ACH 9363) in a suspension of 10 000 conidia per ml for 8 min
(12 isolates, 10 to 12 plants per isolate). Plants were planted in
Cone-tainers (3.8 cm diameter x 21 cm; Stuewe and Sons, Inc. Corvallis, OR)
containing sterile soil. 3 known cultures of _F. oxysporum_ Schlecht.
emend. Snyd. & Hans. f. sp. _betae_ Stewart (= _F. conglutinans_ var.
_betae_ Stewart [4]) also were included (13 and 216c from L. Hanson,
USDA-ARS, Fort Collins, CO; 0-1122 from The Pennsylvania State University
Fusarium Research Center). The control was sterile water. Plants were
placed in a greenhouse at 24 to 27 deg C with natural light supplemented
with illumination from high-pressure sodium-vapor lamps for 16 h daily and
lightly fertilized biweekly to avoid chlorosis from nutrient deficiency.
After 6 to 7 weeks, plants were rated for disease on a 0 to 4 scale: 0 =
no disease; 1 = slight to extreme plant stunting, leaves may be wilted; 2
= chlorotic leaves, some with necrosis at margins; 3 = tap root dried and
brown to black in color, leaves dying; and 4 = plant dead (1). The
experiment was repeated. Disease severity differed between trials, but all
isolates of _F. oxysporum_ and _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_ resulted in
disease ratings statistically (P < 0.05) greater than that of the water
control.
In Trial 1, isolates of _F. oxysporum_ averaged a rating of 2.1 (range of
1.8 to 3.3) and _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_ averaged 2.1 (range of 2.0 to
2.2) compared with 0.1 for the water control. One isolate of _F.
oxysporum_ had a statistically higher rating than did the cultures of _F.
oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_. In Trial 2, isolates of _F. oxysporum_ averaged
a rating of 3.3 (range of 2.7 to 3.7) and _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_
averaged 3.1 (range of 2.7 to 3.4) compared with 0.2 for the water control.
Cultures of _F. oxysporum_ (8 of 12) resulted in ratings statistically
higher than that of the least pathogenic culture of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_betae_. Cultures of _F. oxysporum_ and _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_
recovered from inoculated plants were identical to those used to inoculate
plants.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_
on sugar beet in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. The
disease has been reported in California, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska,
Oregon, Texas, and Wyoming (1,2).

[The fact that Fusarium yellows (FY), also known as Fusarium wilt, has been
reported from the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota is not
surprising, given the opportunity for propagules of the fungus to be
distributed on windborne soil aggregates and by physical movement of soil
on farm equipment. _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _betae_ is the pathogen that
causes FY. Disease management utilizes certified seed of Fusarium
wilt-tolerant or resistant varieties, if available, treatment of seed or
furrow with recommended fungicides to delay initial infection of seedlings
by _Fusarium_ spp. and other soil-borne pathogens, manage irrigation to
eliminate moisture stress to the developing plant, avoid excess water which
may deprive roots of oxygen, and dispose of sugar beet tare soil to avoid
introduction of FY propagules (or new races) into the field.
