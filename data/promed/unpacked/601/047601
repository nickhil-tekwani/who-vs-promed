Thousands of stockmen in Kullu [Himachal Pradesh State, India] are grappling with a fern-induced mysterious disease which is causing urinary bladder tumors in cattle, eventually killing it. Stockmen have no idea why their cattle are dying with this disease, which is proving a silent killer.

According to scientists, the main reason for the disease is bracken fern (a grass), which usually grows on higher regions. Stockmen usually spread this fern in cowsheds to keep it warm, mostly in winter season, which is proving a killer for the cattle. A primary sign of the disease is hematuria (presence of blood in urine). Doctors say the disease is incurable. Bracken fern is known as "barn" in local language and the hematuria in cattle is known as "launcha".

"My cow was suffering with launcha for over 3 months and a large quantity of blood was flowing with her urine," a stockman from Nasogi village said. Doctors were not able to cure the disease, so taking advice from other stockmen, he left the cow in grazing land in forest. "Only natural herbs can save her now," he said.

[Removal of the bracken fern should be encouraged.

Bracken fern (_Pteridium aquilinum_) is found throughout the world and is among the 5 most numerous vascular plants. The species includes numerous subspecies and varieties, and plant size varies with frond lengths ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 m. Bracken fern is perennial, with erect deciduous fronds that remain green until they are killed by frost or drought. It spreads primarily through dense rhizome networks and can dominate plant communities, especially those burned or disturbed. Bracken fern may be found in a diversity of sites but is most common in semi-shaded, well-drained, open woodlands.

Enzootic hematuria is the most common result of bracken fern poisoning. It primarily affects cattle and, less frequently, sheep. It is characterized by intermittent hematuria and anemia. Poisoning most often occurs during late summer when other feed is scarce, or when animals are fed hay containing bracken fern. Poisoning requires prolonged exposures; affected livestock must ingest bracken fern for several weeks to years before disease develops.

Affected cattle are weak, rapidly lose weight, and develop pyrexia (106-110 deg F [41-43 deg C]) once clinical effects manifest. Calves often have difficulty breathing, with pale mucous membranes. Hemorrhages vary from minor mucosal petechia to effusive bleeding, and at times large blood clots form that may be passed in the feces. Coagulation is prolonged, and bleeding may be pronounced and excessive even at small wounds such as small insect bites or minor scratches.

Once animals develop clinical disease, poisoning is almost always fatal.

Postmortem examinations usually reveal multiple hemorrhages or bruises throughout the carcass. Necrotic ulcers in the GI (gastrointestinal) tract may be noted. The bladder mucosa often contains small hemorrhages; dilated vessels; or vascular, fibrous, or epithelial neoplasms. Other neoplasms in the upper GI tract of cattle and other species have also been reported. In most cases, mixtures of hemorrhagic and neoplastic lesions are found.

Although not all bracken fern toxins have been completely characterized, the primary cause of enzootic hematuria has been attributed to norsesquiterpene glycosides (ptaquiloside, ptesculentoside, and caudatoside). Ptaquiloside is a potent radiomimetic that initially damages the bone marrow and later is carcinogenic (producing urinary tract neoplasia in ruminants). Both the hemorrhagic syndrome and uroepithelial neoplasms have been reproduced experimentally with bracken fern and ptaquiloside. Although less well characterized, the other norsesquiterpene glycosides, which predominate in some bracken fern populations, probably have similar toxicity and carcinogenicity.

Acute brackenism occurs when animals ingest high doses over relatively short durations of weeks or months. It is characterized by bleeding. This toxicity is attributed to ptaquiloside's radiomimetic damage to proliferating bone marrow stem cells. This is seen as depletion of bone marrow megakaryocytes followed by panhypoplasia. The leukogram often shows a mixed response. In the initial phases, monocytosis may be pronounced and followed by granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Final phases include marked thrombocytopenia with anemia, leukopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Urinalysis generally shows hematuria and proteinuria. Affected animals have both an increased susceptibility to infection and a tendency for spontaneous hemorrhage.

Lower doses of bracken fern for longer duration are more likely to be carcinogenic. The effects seem cumulative, as animals are exposed repeatedly for years. The carcinogenic potential of bracken fern and ptaquiloside has been confirmed not only in livestock but also in rats, mice, guinea pigs, quail, and Egyptian toads.

Initial treatment for all species is to discontinue exposure to bracken fern; however, disease can appear weeks after livestock are removed from the fern-infested area. In acutely affected cattle, mortality is usually greater than 90 percent. Measurement of the platelet count is recommended, because it is the best prognostic indicator for poisoned animals.

Treatment of thiamine deficiency in horses is highly effective if diagnosis is made early. Injection of a thiamine solution at 5 mg/kg is suggested, given initially IV (intravenous) every 3 hours, then IM (intramuscular) for several days. Oral supplementation may be required for an additional 1-2 weeks, although SC (subcutaneous) injection of 100-200 mg daily for 6 days has been successful in some cases. Thiamine treatment should also include animals similarly exposed but not yet showing clinical disease, because signs can develop days or weeks after removal from the source of bracken.

Antibiotics may be useful to prevent secondary infections. Blood or even platelet transfusions may be appropriate but require large volumes (2-4 L blood) to effectively treat cattle.
