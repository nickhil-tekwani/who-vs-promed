SKIN-PREP PRODUCTS CONTAMINATED - USA: RECALL

The Food and Drug Administration today announced that Clinipad Corp. of
Rocky Hill, Connecticut, is voluntarily recalling antiseptic sterile skin
preparations [that is items used to prepare the skin for sterile procedures
- ES] because of a potential for bacterial contamination. The reason for
the recall is that the company has confirmed bacterial contamination in
some lots of its sterile products, including one lot with _Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_ and _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ (recalled in December 1999),
and therefore cannot assure the sterility of products labeled and sold as
sterile. These organisms can cause skin, wound, or other infections that
may be serious or life-threatening in some cases.
The nationwide recall of the Clinipad sterile-products line includes
Povidone Iodine, Tincture of Iodine, Benzoin Tincture, Acetone Alcohol and
Alcohol Antiseptic Products, as well as Sterile Cliniguard Protective
Dressing Labeled as "sterile," manufactured since Jan. 1, 1997. The
products (swabsticks, prep pads, towelettes, ointments and pouches, as well
as protective dressings) are distributed under the names: Cliniswab,
Clinipad, Clinidine, Cliniguard, EZ Prep, Cooper Instrument Corp., Moore
Medical Corp., and Rauscher. They are sold separately or packaged in
various institutional kits and are widely distributed to blood banks,
hospitals, clinics, and retail pharmacies and are used to control and
prevent infection.
In addition to other medical uses, these products are used to prepare the
skin prior to the collection of blood or plasma donations. Although there
have been no known instances of blood contamination traced to the recalled
products, clinicians should remain alert to this possibility. Contamination
of blood collections with bacteria from the skin contributes to rare
bacterial infections from transfusions. Serious bacterial infections occur
in approximately 1 out of 50 000 to 1 out of 500 000 transfusions,
depending on the exact blood product administered. Recent data from CDC
have shown no increase in bacterial contamination of transfused blood
products over a two-year period.
All lots of the sterile products line involved in the recall have a lot
number beginning with 7, 8, 9, or 0, and are labeled as "sterile" on the
unit of use packaging, or "sterile unless opened or damaged." The lot
numbers are also found on the shipping carton or its label. Clinipad Corp.
is sending recall notices to 3000 customers and 100 kit manufacturers.
These customers are being advised to examine stocks and remove the recalled
products, including products in kits, and to promptly destroy them.
Health professionals and consumers who have the product with the involved
lot numbers should destroy the product. To assist blood collection centers
in developing alternative skin preparations, the Food and Drug
Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has posted
information on its Websites at and
. The sites identify alternative products and
procedures that can be used at donor centers.
Health professionals and consumers who have these products can obtain more
information about the recall from FDA's MedWatch Website at
. Also, consumers with questions may contact the
Clinipad Corporation at 860-571-0100.
