Biosecurity officers in Queensland are attempting to contain an anthrax outbreak that has caused the death of 80 head of cattle on a St George farm. Biosecurity Queensland says tests conducted on the dead animals on [Fri 3 Mar 2017] have since confirmed the presence of the bacteria that causes anthrax. "It's believed the cattle deaths were caused by the disturbance of contaminated soil, followed by rainfall that distributed the soil containing the bacteria," chief biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson said in a statement.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said the risk of human exposure to anthrax from the cattle was very low. "The veterinarian (who treated the animals) used appropriate personal protective equipment and eight people, including family and a farm worker, did not have any contact with the dead animals," Dr Young said in a statement.

The last case of anthrax in Queensland was in 2002, and was successfully contained, with the bacteria appearing more frequently in NSW [New South Wales].

About 80 cattle have died in an anthrax outbreak on a grazing property at St George in Queensland's southern inland. Biosecurity Queensland is working with managers at the property, where a biosecurity order is limiting movement in and out of the site. Chief biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson said tests detected the bacteria that cause anthrax.

He described anthrax as a naturally occurring bacterium that arises sporadically in Australia, with a small number of cases each year. "The last incidence of anthrax in Queensland, which occurred in 2002, was successfully contained," Dr Thompson said. "In this latest case, the property owner reported that approximately 80 cattle had died in a short period of time. A veterinarian attending the property on [Fri 3 Mar 2017] took samples from the dead animals in accordance with protocol and sent them to Biosecurity Queensland for testing.

"We commend the veterinarian and property owner for their quick response that will assist us in minimising the risk to the local industry. We have put in place biosecurity orders to restrict the movement of people, stock, and vehicles on and off the infected property, and will commence a vaccination program for the remaining cattle and a disposal and decontamination program for the deceased animals. It's believed the cattle deaths were caused by the disturbance of contaminated soil, followed by rainfall that distributed the soil containing the bacteria."

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said the risk of human exposure to anthrax from animals was generally regarded as very low. "Public health authorities are in contact with people on the property and the veterinarian," she said. "The veterinarian used appropriate personal protective equipment and 8 people, including family and a farm worker, did not have any contact with the dead animals."

Dr Thompson said all stock were vulnerable but it was not a contagious disease, like a virus. "It can affect humans, people have to be very careful around sick animals or those that have died from anthrax, we need to dispose of the carcass and decontaminate those areas," he said.

There has been another confirmed case of anthrax in Victoria in recent days, which caused the death of several sheep, but Dr Thompson said this was a coincidence. He said outbreaks usually occurred in what was known as the anthrax belt, which was linked to old stock routes where the animals were just left after they died. Dr Thompson said the only treatment was prevention by vaccination, but this was not normal practice because the disease was [now] so rare.

It is logical that this outbreak might have been initiated by soil disturbance of a 2002 anthrax cattle burial site. From experience we know that such cattle graves have a sunken surface at the top and that this natural basin will collect rainwater. To have 80 head affected in a very short time suggests that this water was drunk by, say, 10 cows; they died; and provided enough blood, whether from the ground by extravasation to be licked and tasted or to haemophagic tabanid flies from biting moribund or dead cows, feed, and then infect further cows. When the last Queensland outbreaks were in 2002 it is understandable that vaccination had abated in the past 14+ years without an outbreak. And responses tended to be slower as more recent herd problems present themselves as possible causes.

When dealing with anthrax carcasses make sure you are wearing rubber boots, disposable plastic gloves, and heavy duty paper overalls. When you take the overalls off, they can be tossed onto the burning carcasses; spouses object to such bloody dirty clothing going through the domestic washing machine. There is something to be said for wearing plastic bags over your boots as it greatly eases removing any bloody soil. The bags should also go into the fire along with the gloves.

Also, unless one is dealing with just one or 2 dead cows, it is wise to inform the adjoining cattle stations so that they can initiate vaccinating their stock as soon as possible. Sterne vaccine is very cheap, just pennies per dose, and even one case prevented has a high benefit cost ratio.

This cattle station is in the traditional anthrax area for eastern Australia and included in the GARP niche model map discussed in ProMED-mail postings: Anthrax - Australia: (VI) ovine, human exp 20170306.4882640 and Anthrax - Australia: niche modeling of historic distribution 20160622.4302780. - Mod.MHJ]
