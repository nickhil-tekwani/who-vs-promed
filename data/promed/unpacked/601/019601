[As usual, we would like to know the country of origin of the
infection & the strain of cholera involved -- and to remind the
reporting country that notifying at the end of October a case which
occurred on 2 Oct is not fulfilling the obligation to report a
suspected case of cholera to WHO within 24 hours. The previous
case imported to Germany came from India, type still unkown to us.
