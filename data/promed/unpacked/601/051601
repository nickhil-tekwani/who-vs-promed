The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has detected a deadly virus
in a fish processing plant in Tasmania. Ganglioneuritis is deadly to
abalone, small snails (also referred to as ear-shells), and sea ears,
as well as muttonfish or muttonshells.

A number of abalone have tested positive to the virus at the plant in
Stanley and are believed to have come from wild stocks around King
Island, the ABC reports.

Wes Ford from the DPI told the ABC they are currently undertaking work
to prevent the spread of the disease at the plant.

"The facility itself has to stop discharging water and is able to
treat its water under its biosecurity plan," he said. "Some of the
animals have been shucked out and put into the canning system, and
some of the animals that are okay will go into the normal live
processing system."

Earlier this year [2011], the recreational abalone fishery was closed
due to an outbreak of ganglioneuritis on Tasmania's east coast.

[Abalone virus ganglioneuritis is caused by a highly contagious
herpesvirus. This disease was reported for the 1st time in May 2006 in
a population of wild abalone in Taylors Bay, Victoria, Australia. The
virus only infects abalone, and it does not pose a risk to public
health. So far, it has only been reported in 2 species, blacklip
abalone (_Haliotis rubra_) and greenlip abalone (_Haliotis
laevigata_). It does, however, cause economic losses.

The virus causes inflammation of the nervous tissue, resulting in the
edges of the foot curling inwards, swelling and protrusion of the
mouth, and excess mucus production. Infected animals lose muscle
control and slide or fall off their home scars on the reef. The virus
is transmitted horizontally through direct contact between infected
and healthy abalone. Portions of this comment were taken from
