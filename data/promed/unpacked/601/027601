[The 1st cases of CCHF in this area appeared in ProMED reports last
year on 4 May 2007. The case was in Astrakhan oblast. This year
[2008], the infection appeared half a month earlier, which indicates
early tick activity. The 1st report of CCHF in the Southern Federal
District concerned a single case of CCHF in the Stavropol region and
was posted in ProMED-RUS on 21 Apr 2008. There was a warning letter
from G. Onishentko, the Head of Rospotrebnadzor [The Trade and
Sanitary Inspection Authority], about the necessity for preventive
measures in the Southern Federal District from the beginning of this
year. A more extensive outbreak of CCHF is imminent. - Mod.NP]
