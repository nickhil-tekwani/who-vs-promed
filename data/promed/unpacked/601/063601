A 4th death linked to gastroenteritis outbreak
----------------------------------------------
La Cire Ocean Indien [Cellule interregionale d'epidemiologie La Reunion et Mayotte] has announced a 4th death associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis affecting the island of Reunion. Since the beginning of August [2012], a severe epidemic of gastroenteritis has affected the island of Reunion. 3 young children under 2 years of age with an inflammatory infection of the digestive system have died.

In its latest bulletin, the Indian Ocean Monitoring Institute identifies a new death. The victim was a man of 75 years who died of acute gastroenteritis. La Cire Ocean Indien indicates that the patient had aggravating factors. The latest information from the medical authorities in Reunion indicates that the epidemic had been stabilised by the end of the 1st week of October [2012]. However, continued surveillance will be required.

The mean values observed are indeed well above the seasonal averages. The Indian Ocean Regional Health Agency has emphasised the importance of maintaining strict hygiene measures to prevent further transmission of the virus. The vulnerable groups are children, the sick, and the elderly. Between 1 and 7 Oct 2012, more than 200 cases of gastroenteritis were treated in doctors' offices and hospital emergency rooms.

During the last week of September [2012], more than 7500 consultations for acute diarrhea were identified. Hand hygiene, cleaning of surfaces, and monitoring of care workers and catering staff are essential. In the case of children, the use of rehydration salts is recommended strongly by to prevent debilitating diarrhea, which can cause death.

[No specific causative agent, bacterial or viral, has been identified but the gastroenteritis is assumed to be viral in origin. A norovirus or a rotavirus might be a likely candidate. Further information is awaited.
