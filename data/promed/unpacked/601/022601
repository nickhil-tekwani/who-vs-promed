Mumps epidemic forces French to postpone games
----------------------------------------------
The rough and tumble of macho French league rugby has been curtailed
by an unexpected source -- an epidemic of mumps. The virus, normally
associated with children, has forced the French rugby union league
(LNR) to postpone next weekend's Basque derby between Biarritz and
Bayonne after another Top 14 game was called off for the same reason.

"Because of an epidemic of mumps within the Lyon squad (...) the LNR
has decided, as a precaution, to postpone the Biarritz v Bayonne
game," the LNR said in a statement on Monday [31 Oct 2011]. The LNR
explained it made the decision to avoid possible contamination by the
Biarritz players as they [had] faced Lyon on 22 Oct 2011.

The Bordeaux versus Lyon game was postponed last week because Lyon
players were suffering from mumps.

[Mumps predominately, but not exclusively, is a disease of childhood.
The classic symptoms of mumps include parotitis in about 50 percent
either unilateral bilateral, which develops an average of 16 to 18
days after exposure. Swelling can also be seen in the submandibular
and sublingual gland in a small percentage of cases. Nonspecific
symptoms including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade
fever may precede parotitis by several days. As many as 40-50 percent
of mumps infections are associated with nonspecific or primarily
respiratory symptoms.

Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose,
or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs,
sneezes, or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as soft
drink cans or eating utensils, can also be contaminated with the
virus. In addition, the virus may spread when someone with mumps
touches items or surfaces without washing their hands.

Most mumps transmission likely occurs before the salivary glands begin
to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling begins. The incubation
times can range from 12-25 days.

Mumps occurs sporadically among young adults due to absence of
vaccination in childhood or diminishing immunity. It might be expected
that infection would be associated with contact sports such as
American and rugby football. However, it is curious that this mumps
outbreak is associated with the League version of Rugby football,
which involves fewer players and less contact than rugby Union
football. It may be that MMR vaccination in childhood has been less
comprehensive in the South and West of France than elsewhere.
