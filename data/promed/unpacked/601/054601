A total of 9 people have died in recent weeks in Vanuatu of extreme dehydration due to an outbreak of diarrhea.

The Vanuatu Daily Post reports the outbreaks have been confirmed in Malampa, Penama and Sanma provinces. Parents have been advised to seek medical attention if their children reveal early symptoms of diarrhoea.

An officer with the Ministry of Health, George Worwor, said parents were not seeking medical care early enough. He said medical surveillance officers were out promoting basic hygiene and investigating the source of the outbreak.

[Vanuatu is a South Pacific Ocean nation made up of roughly 80 islands that stretch 1300 kilometers.

The above report does not specify if any laboratory tests for the cause of these outbreaks have been conducted or are in process.

An earlier report in the same newspaper in June [http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/306240/severe-diarrhoea-outbreak-in-vanuatu-kills-one] reported nearly 100 cases of gastroenteritis.
Any updates on the epidemiology and clinical course of the cases in the outbreaks from relevant public health personnel or health care workers would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
