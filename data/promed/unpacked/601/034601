Stripe rust has been confirmed in Victorian barley trials, for the first
time. The disease has been detected in the barley variety Skiff before in
New South Wales, and also in barley grass in Victoria for years.
David Moody, from the Grains Research and Development Corporation, says the
finding may spell the end of the Skiff cultivar. He said that rust has
been found on barley grass in Victoria for a number of years, but
significant levels of the disease had not been seen on barley before. It
probably means growers should avoid growing the most susceptible varieties.
Fortunately only a fairly limited number of cultivars are quite
susceptible. Moody said that most of our cultivars have quite good levels
of resistance to the fungus.

[Stripe rust of barley in Australia is caused by either of two broad groups
of _Puccinia striiformis_. According to Colin Wellings of the University
of Sydney, Plant Breeding Institute at Cobbitty, the most common is _P.
striiformis_ f.sp. _tritici_ which causes wheat stripe rust disease. Since
the introduction of _P. striiformis_ to Australia in 1979, there are now at
least 20 mutant derivatives from the original pathotype, some of which
cause significant disease in wheat. Additional hosts include grasses such
as weedy barley grass (_Hordeum leporinum_), triticale and certain barley
cultivars. Much less important is _P. striiformis_ f.sp. _dactylidis_
which infects cocksfoot, but not wheat.
During the annual survey of cereal pathogens in 1998, an unusual variant of
stripe rust appeared on grassy weeds, mainly _H. leporinum_ and _H.
glaucum_. This variant is largely avirulent in wheat except for the
cultivar Chinese 166. What is interesting is that virulence on this
cultivar has been associated with _P. striiformis_ f.sp. _hordei_, which
causes barley stripe rust disease in Europe and the Americas, but which has
not been recorded in Australia. Subsequent research has demonstrated that
the stripe rust of barley grass in Australia is caused by a new pathotype
of _P. striiformis_ which will be described as a new forma speciales.
According to Wellings, greenhouse studies show that certain barley
cultivars, which were previously resistant to wheat stripe rust, are now
susceptible to 'barley grass stripe rust', including the cultivar Skiff
which is an important feed grain cultivar in northern New South Wales.
During the 1999 cropping season, 'barley grass stripe rust' was frequently
isolated from barley grass, and it was detected on Skiff in trial sites and
farmers' fields central New South Wales to northern Victoria. Several
advanced breeding lines in barley trials have been shown to be more
susceptible than Skiff.
Although Skiff is rated as moderately susceptible to susceptible to 'barley
grass stripe rust', barley growers are unlikely to abandon it quickly
because there is no evidence of significant yield loss and there are no
suitable replacement cultivars on hand.
The take-home message is that a new variant of _P. striiformis_ has adapted
to wild barley grass and it is capable of causing significant levels of
disease in commercial cultivars. The new variant, referred to as 'barley
grass stripe rust' is NOT the classical barley stripe rust which occurs in
Europe and the Americas.
My thanks to Colin Wellings for providing this information. - Mod.DH]
