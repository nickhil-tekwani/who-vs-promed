Plague has struck a 2nd Boulder County prairie dog colony, and officials
say this could be the early stages of a widespread die-off of the rodents.
Joe Malinowski, a consumer protection coordinator for Boulder County Public
Health, said Wednesday plague was confirmed in prairie dogs on private
property northeast of Boulder. 2 weeks ago, plague was confirmed in a
colony in northwest Boulder.
"Just going off of the ones we have confirmed, we expect that there is more
activity out there," Malinowski said.
Malinowski has said the primary public health threat from plague in prairie
dogs is that fleas will transmit the disease to humans or pets. University
of Colorado researchers have been studying the new outbreak for clues about
how plague spreads and how human development affects its movement.
Sharon Collinge said evidence she and her research assistants have compiled
appears to support the theory that deer mice are a reservoir for the
disease because it does not seem to affect them.
In both the infected colony and a healthy colony nearby, the deer mice
population is about the same, suggesting the mice haven't been hurt by the
disease, she said.
The plague outbreak comes as Boulder city officials are struggling to
develop a policy for dealing with prairie dogs. Attempts to kill the
animals often provoke protests in the city.
Alice Guthrie, who is heading the city's effort to draw up a policy, said a
plague die-off would buy some time but would not eliminate the need for a
policy because the animals' population will recover.
"We know that we can't really depend on plague coming through really often
to control populations, so we have to have other tools and accepted
methods," she said.

[Because Prairie dogs are very sensitive indicators of the presence of the
plague organism, _Yersinia pestis_, they are often considered sentinel
animals. Domestic cats are also sensitive to the plague agent.
