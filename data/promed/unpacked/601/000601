Foot-and-mouth outbreak hits Zimbabwe
-------------------------------------
HARARE: An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has hit Chivi and
Gutu districts in Zimbabwe's Masvingo province, forcing the
Department of Veterinary Services to suspend the movement of
livestock.
The outbreak that comes at a time when new farmers are still moving
their cattle from their old homes has severely affected Chivi where
farmers were allocated land outside the district.
Chivi has no farms and all new farmers were resettled in Mwenezi,
Zaka, Masvingo and Chiredzi districts.
Chief animal health inspector in Masvingo Ben Tigere confirmed the
outbreak on Monday, saying a critical shortage of vaccines was
hampering efforts to control the disease.
"We suspended the movement of livestock in the two districts after an
outbreak of FMD that was first reported at the beginning of this
month," he said.
Tigere said the current shortage of fuel was aggravating the
situation because it was hindering the movement of animal health
inspectors.
Masvingo has about 850 000 head of cattle and the outbreak of the
disease could affect the country's beef export.

[The FMD situation in Zimbabwe, aggravated by the unstable,
deteriorating political situation there, is a serious threat to the
entire Southern African region. According to the data published by
the OIE/FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, FMDV
types SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 have been identified in Zimbabwe since
1990. The virus type identified there during 2002 was SAT2. A
trivalent vaccine is the one to be applied. - Mod. AS].
