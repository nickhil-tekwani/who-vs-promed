A mysterious disease, which broke out in the south of Zambia, killing
4 people, is now suspected to be pneumonic plague, the health
ministry said Friday [30 Nov 2007].

Ministry of Health spokesman, Canicius Banda, said preliminary
findings indicate that the disease that has killed 4 people and
affected over 60 patients could be pneumonic plague but the findings
were not yet conclusive. "Our preliminary findings point to pneumonic
plague," Banda said.

A total of 4 people died and 64 others were put under quarantine last
week following the outbreak of the disease in Namwala, a small town
in the Southern Province of Zambia. Banda said the movement of people
in the area had been banned with immediate effect in order to contain
the disease, which had symptoms of vomiting and backache.

Medical experts had also begun spraying all the houses in the area to
get rid of fleas and rodents suspected to be spreading the disease.
The government has also urged people in Namwala to be calm after word
went round that the disease could be the deadly Ebola virus,
prompting panic.

"We have carried out the tests and it is not Ebola. People should not
panic, the situation is under control," Health minister Brian Chituwo
said.

Pneumonic plague, which is fatal if left untreated, develops when
plague bacteria infect the lungs, and can cause a public health
emergency due to its high degree of contagion.

[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague
presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in
infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are
pneumonic complications (secondary plague pneumonia) in bubonic or
septicemic plague. It is, importantly, the form of the disease that
would be most likely if _Yersinia pestis_ were to be used in an
aerosol as a biological weapon. Such an aerosol would likely be used
in an indoor setting to avoid the outdoor UV radiation inactivation
of the organism.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness, and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 feet) as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through
air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy.
