BACOLOD [300 miles/450 km south-east of Manila - Mod.JW The City
Government noted a significant decrease in the number of dengue cases for
the month of April, although fogging and anti-dengue operations are still
ongoing. Irving Ginson, executive assistant for Social Services told
Sun.Star Bacolod Daily that contrary to reports, there is no dengue
epidemic in the city... "We have eight cases of dengue for the month of
April and no confirmed deaths so far."
Ginson also stressed that in 1991 to 1992, there were months when dengue
cases reached almost 100 or more but the City Health Office did not even
declare an epidemic. Statistics given by the City Mayor's Office showed
that last January, about 37 dengue cases were recorded.
The figure steadily decreased as only 11 cases were recorded in the months
of February and March.
