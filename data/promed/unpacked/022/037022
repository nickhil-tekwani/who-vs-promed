[1] USDA update

On [Thu 15 Aug 2019], the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said 6 states have confirmed cases of VS [vesicular stomatitis]: Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming.

Since its previous Situation Report on [Sat 10 Aug 2019], no new states have been confirmed positive for VS. However, counties within previously affected states have been confirmed newly positive:

Colorado: Arapahoe, Gunnison, and Mineral counties
Nebraska: Scottsbluff County
Texas: Bosque and Dallas counties
Wyoming: Albany and Sweetwater counties
For a full listing of affected states and counties with corresponding numbers of affected (confirmed and suspect) and quarantined premises, see the APHIS-published PDF at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/vsv/sitrep-8-15-19.pdf.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The south western and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for their requirements.

A highly contagious livestock virus causing lesions in horses and cattle has appeared in 2 Utah counties, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food announced Wed 21 Aug 2019. Several farms in Uintah and Emery counties have been placed on a 14-day quarantine after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana type, was diagnosed, officials said in a news release.

"Four more premises are currently under investigation," the release stated. "Samples recently submitted for testing should yield results before the end of the week." With confirmed cases in the state, the release added, "It is essential veterinarians and livestock owners be on the alert for animals displaying clinical signs of the disease."

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease primarily affecting horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas and alpacas. Rarely, humans can become infected with the disease when handling affected animals.

Excessive salivation often is the 1st sign of the disease. Close examination of the mouth initially reveals blister-like lesions on the inner surfaces of the lips, gums, tongue, and dental pad. Lesions also can form on the lips, nostrils, coronary band, prepuce, vulva, and teats. [Often the animal, especially horses, are seen dribbling their grain due to the pain of the blisters in the mouth. - Mod.TG] The blisters swell and break, which causes oral pain, discomfort, and reluctance to eat or drink. Lameness and severe weight loss may follow. Diagnosis requires testing of samples at an approved facility.

Good sanitation and quarantine practices on affected farms usually contain the infection. When a definite diagnosis is made, the following procedures are recommended:
- Separate animals with lesions from healthy animals. Animals on pastures tend to be affected more frequently with this disease.
- As a precautionary measure, do not move animals from the premises until at least 14 days after lesions in the last affected animal have healed.
- Control insects by eliminating or reducing breeding areas; use insecticide sprays or insecticide-treated ear tags on animals.
- Use personal protective measures when handling affected animals to avoid human exposure.

Veterinarians and livestock owners who suspect an animal may have vesicular stomatitis or any other vesicular disease should contact the state veterinarian at 801-5638-7162 or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Services at 801-525-5010.

Editor's note: Figures have been updated to reflect data provided by the Texas Animal Health Commission on 16 Aug 2019.

A viral disease, known to primarily affect horses and cattle, has arrived in Gonzales County after nearly a month of spreading across the region. As of 16 Aug 2019, there has been one confirmed case of vesicular stomatitis [virus] (VSV) in Gonzales County, and the premises were subsequently quarantined.

According to the Texas Animal Health Commission, VSV causes blisters, erosions in the mouth, excessive saliva, or crusty sores around an animal's muzzle, teats, or hooves. Though it's mostly known to affect horses and cattle, the virus can also infect sheep, goats, llamas, alpacas, swine, deer, and some other species, including bobcats, raccoons, and monkeys. Though rare, it is possible for humans to become infected with the virus when handling affected animals. Infected humans may develop a flu-like illness that last 4-7 days.

VSV is curable and rarely fatal, but infected animals can lose condition due to not eating and drinking when ulcers and blisters near the mouth are present. Lesions on the hooves may limit an animals' mobility, and infected dairy cows often see a steep drop in milk production.

Infected animals are quarantined for at least 2 weeks to reduce risk of further spreading. Depending on the severity of the case, healing may take longer than 2 weeks, or the owner may opt to euthanize the animal in especially severe cases.

The disease is thought to be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects like sandflies and black flies. Outbreaks typically occur in warmer months in areas along waterways. The last major VSV outbreak in Texas happened in 2014.

As of 16 Aug 2019, there are no new confirmed or suspected cases in Gonzales County. However, there is one more suspected case in neighboring Bastrop County and another suspected case in Guadalupe County.

Bastrop has had a total of 8 confirmed VSV-positive and ongoing quarantine cases with a suspected 49 more. In total, 10 premises are under quarantine in Bastrop County, which is the highest in the state. Currently 64 cases have been confirmed and quarantined in Texas.

The 1st case of VSV this summer [in Colorado] was reported 3 Jul 2019 in Weld County. In late July [2019], officials from the Dolores County Rodeo cancelled the annual event because the virus was showing up in the area. They were worried the disease would spread during the rodeo.

As of 2 Aug 2019, the disease was confirmed in 14 Colorado counties, including Adams, Archuleta, Boulder, Broomfield, Conejos, Delta, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Montezuma, Montrose, Morgan, and Weld. As of last week, the CDA has confirmed additional cases of VSV in the counties of Alamosa, Arapahoe, Douglas, Gilpin, Grand, Mineral, and Ouray too. It's in 21 Colorado counties now, and many believe San Miguel County is probably next.

There are more than 250 infected animals statewide in quarantine, with approximately [sic] 277 that have been released from quarantine. So far, all cases are equine, with the exception of one bovine case in Delta County and another in Boulder County.

The CDA is updating its website in order to provide accurate information and resources on VSV weekly (http://colorado.gov/aganimals/vesicular-stomatitis-virus-vsv). A map of infected counties is also on the website, so people can plan travel accordingly.

Prevention is key
Because there is no vaccine for VSV, experts believe the best prevention lies in dealing with flies. This means fly-spraying livestock animals and also staying on top of manure maintenance, since flies are attracted to dirty pens and pastures and multiply quickly. The state veterinarian's office also says to avoid sharing feed, cleaning, and health tools with livestock for the time being, and to weigh the risks of transporting horses to destinations where VSV may be more active.

The state vet's office requests all cases be reported. Animals testing positive for VSV must remain in quarantine for roughly a month. "It is of utmost importance livestock owners report VS occurrences and comply with hold or quarantine orders to limit the potential for disease spread in this VS outbreak," Dr Keith Roehr, the Colorado state veterinarian, has said in multiple press releases.

To show or not to show?
Some horse shows/rodeos are canceling. Most horse shows are requiring a vet check at least 2 days before entering the show premises. Their show will still go on, at least for those who have the right paperwork in order for competition. Other horse shows in Colorado are requesting a health certificate at least 5 days in advance of competitions.

Those traveling out of state for shows or competitions or to sell animals may run into trouble, though. Colorado vets and livestock owners are supposed to contact any "state of destination" to let officials know they're coming from another state affected by VSV.

The outlook
Many on the Western Slope agree it's been a good water year. As a result, the bugs have been bad. The flies will last until the fall, when cooler temperatures arrive. That means VSV will linger and spread until then.Since VSV is a virus appearing in various years, sometimes annually, it will come back again.

Carl Wood, owner and operator of Double Tree Horse Farm in Delta County, has worked in the horse business for decades. His farm houses up to 30 horses at a time for breeding, training, and boarding purposes. No doubt, over the years he's seen bad "bug years" and his share of disease outbreaks in equine populations. Wood said he thinks people need to "calm down" about VSV. "People get too worried about it," he said this week. "Fly spray your horses. Don't let them drink after other horses, and keep a distance from other horses when at events. I've seen it this bad before, and this, too, will pass."

[Several of these pieces came out after the USDA weekly update (section [1]), so it will be interesting to see if all of these counties are listed in the next USDA update.

VSV is exciting to regulatory agencies because it initially appears so similar to foot and mouth disease (FMD), a transboundary or foreign animal disease (FAD) that can impact trade and result in the death of animals. Also, FMD does not affect horses, but VSV does affect cattle, other ruminants, and swine.

Please use horse-approved fly and mosquito spray to help protect your animal. There is no vaccine against VSV. - Mod.TG
