Health officials in Johnson County say they've seen an increase in mumps cases in recent weeks, just as thousands of students begin returning to the University of Iowa.

Doug Beardsley, Director of Johnson County Public Health, said there have been 15 cases of mumps reported in Johnson County in 2015. State disease tracking information suggests most of those reports have come within the last couple of weeks. Typically there are zero to one cases of mumps reported a year in Johnson County, Beardsley said. "It is unusual," Beardsley said. "It's an unnecessary illness."

Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is administered to most kids in the United States during the first few years of their lives. The MMR [mumps measpes and rubella] vaccination is a requirement for kids in Iowa's public education system, licensed child care centers and at public universities. Exemptions are granted for religious and health reasons.

Last week the University of Iowa urged students to get up-to-date on their vaccinations before returning to campus after 6bb cases of the mumps were reported among UI students in the past few weeks.

Beardsley said it's possible for the disease to spread even among people who have been vaccinated. "Even if you have been vaccinated you should stay away from someone [infected with mumps]," said Beardsley.

Mumps is a viral disease that includes fever, muscle pain, headache, tired feeling and swelling of the throat. Symptoms are usually benign, but can last for a couple of weeks.

[Mumps is a contagious infection caused by mumps virus, a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Mumps is most common in children over the age of 2 who have not been vaccinated, and also causes disease in unvaccinated teenagers and young adults, although older people may contract the disease as well.

Once a person has become infected with mumps, it takes 2-3 weeks for the symptoms to appear. However, an infected person can spread the infection even when they do not have any symptoms -- the disease is contagious from 7 days before and up to 9 days after the onset of symptoms. It can be a potentially serious disease for children and young adults.

The virus causes salivary glands to become swollen and tender on 1 or both sides of the face, resulting in enlarged cheeks. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, and can last up to 10 days. For teenagers, getting mumps can cause swelling in the testicles or ovaries, and can lead to sterility. Swelling of the brain can occur in the most serious cases, albeit rarely.

In adolescents, mumps is most common among students beginning their higher education due to inadequate vaccination in their earlier years. The MMR vaccine is generally highly effective in recipients of all ages. - Mod.CP
