Three cows from an anthrax-infected herd in Slovakia were sold to a Polish abattoir in late September 2012.

Poland's chief veterinary officer, Janusz Zwiazek, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that a team has been dispatched to the slaughterhouse in the Malopolska region of southern Poland to carry out inspections. "Our specialists are at work there at the moment," he said, noting that all slaughtering has been suspended at the site for the time being.

The infection of the Slovak herd was only discovered on Monday [12 Nov 2012, presumably when Polish authorities were informed], and it is unclear whether the animals sent to Poland had caught the disease. However, once an animal has contracted the disease, it typically perishes within 30 days, sometimes within a week. The animals from the Slovak herd came to Poland on 27 Sep 2012, over 30 days before the disease was detected.

Four cows have died in Slovakia as a result of the disease, and the farm in question, at Staskovce in the north east of the country, has been closed.

Authorities in Slovakia stress that the situation should not be regarded as an epidemic, noting that the surviving cows from the herd are currently being vaccinated. Meanwhile, a ban has been introduced on the sale of all meat and milk from the herd.

[The report has a picture of a mature Holstein cow, so we might be able to assume that the 3 which ended up at a Polish abattoir were the result of the normal late summer or autumn/fall cull in dairy herds. If 3 Slovak cows ended up in Poland, there will have been others. The incubation period for anthrax is dose dependent, and the coincidence of the 4 deaths would indicate a normal LD50 or higher -- that is, the acute deaths are past. Therefore, incubating Slovak animals at risk would have had to have been sold in the 1st 2 weeks of November 2012 before the movement standstill was in place. This might be kept in mind by those having to handle recent, unexpected deaths in transit of cows from eastern Slovakia. The probability of having a further anthrax case is very slight, granted, but early recognition will minimise any negative impact. - Mod.MHJ
