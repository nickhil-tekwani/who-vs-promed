From [26 Apr to 20 May 2021] 109 total, confirmed and suspected human Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases were reported in 4 regions of Madagascar (Vatovavy Fitovinany, Haute Matsiatra, Alaotra Mangoro, and Analamanga), according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

A total of 10 cases were laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths were recorded. This followed reports from the Institut Pasteur in Madagascar which confirmed RVF by PCR in animals following alerts of abortion cases in ruminants on [1 Apr 2021].

Rift Valley fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that causes illness in animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels). Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. A small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Most people recover within one week. Approximately 1% of people who get RVF die.

[Rift Valley fever continues to spread in Madagascar this year (2021) with both humans and livestock affected. The report above indicates that there are 2 deaths, however Mod.MPP points out that the 16 Apr 2021 ProMED post states that there were 5 people who died with RVF symptoms but were not then laboratory confirmed (see Rift Valley fever - Madagascar (02): livestock, human 20210416.8311501 and Rift Valley Fever - Madagascar: (TL) livestock, OIE 20210405.8288655). This discrepancy may be clarified when laboratory results become available.

Mod.AS commented about the report above, "Madagascar is considered as one of the many sub-Saharan African countries in which RVF is endemic. The 1st RVF cases in Madagascar's livestock during 2021 date back to 24 Feb [2021], the most recent cases (females with abortive syndrome) to 9 May 2021. The animals involved were small ruminants (goats and sheep) and cattle. Out of 22 regions, 8 have reportedly been affected."
