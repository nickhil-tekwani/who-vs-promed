Thank you very much for your collaboration in sharing information published in our EpiSouth network weekly bulletin (eWEB).

We would just like to inform you that a slight mistake appeared in the text related to the number of cases in Italy: the correct number of cases is the following:

On 13 Sep 2012, the National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion reported one confirmed cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in Treviso province, and 2 in Venice province (Veneto region, cf. map 4).

The revised version of the eWEB is available on the EpiSouth website http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_235_20_09_12_0.pdf
