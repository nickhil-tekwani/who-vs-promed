As reported by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in January [2021], a 10 year old boy was bitten by a dog in Umbumbulu in November 2020. No medical consultation was sought until the child experienced nausea, vomiting, confusion, and restlessness, and died on 7 Jan 2021. Rabies virus antigen was detected in a postmortem brain specimen, collected on 12 Jan 2021.

"In 2020, a total of 7 cases of human rabies were laboratory-confirmed in South Africa, 6 of which originated in KZN and one in Limpopo. This compares to 10 laboratory-confirmed human cases in 2019," the NICD statement said. "In addition, 3 children were identified in 2020 who had dog bites/exposure and died of clinically compatible rabies disease. These cases could not be confirmed in the laboratory and were classified as probable cases in the provinces of KZN, Limpopo and Eastern Cape."

The statement also said that there was a report of suspected rabies encephalitis in a 10 year old child in KZN based on symptoms (disorientation, confusion, delirium, aggressiveness, anxiety, agitation) and a history of dog bite in December 2020. For this case, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) delivery was adequate, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than rabies was confirmed as the cause of encephalitis after laboratory testing. Fortunately, the child survived, whereas rabies is inevitably fatal once symptoms appear [see comment].

Rabies encephalitis is an acute infection involving the central nervous system in humans and other mammals caused by an RNA virus of the rhabdovirus family. Transmission is through dog and wild animal bites.

Children were playing safely in the streets of a village in Qena governorate in southern Egypt, when a dog came running over, and suddenly jumped high and swooped onto the neck of one of the children, dropping him to the ground, knocking him down, and then biting into him. Then the rabid animal attacked everyone he met, until he tried to wrest a child from his father's hands, local media reported.

Egyptian media said that surveillance cameras monitored the attack that took place in the Haswiya area, east of Qena, Upper Egypt, which resulted in 10 children being [bitten], which caused a state of panic among the people, who sought help from the emergency police and veterinary officials.

In a telephone interview with the Egyptian DMC TV, Dr Mohamed Al Qirsh, a spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture revealed the details of the dog attack on a number of children in Qena Governorate. He said: "The people and the Civil Defense Forces caught the animal and eliminated it, and veterinary doctors dissected it, and it turned out that it was an [unowned, stray] dog."

Article 357 of Egypt's Penal Code imposes jail time of 6 months or less or a fine of 200 Egyptian pounds for anyone found to have intentionally killed a domesticated animal, according to lawyer Khaled Mohamed. Stray dogs and other animals are common throughout Egypt and can usually be seen digging through garbage or trotting along city streets. Regarded by many as a nuisance, public health issue, or even dangerous, some individuals have taken the matter into their own hands, poisoning stray animals or harming them in other ways, a trend the law seeks to address. Mohamed clarified that the article applies to dogs, cats, poultry, and other types of domesticated animals, as well as wild animals that have been trained or who live in captivity, like big cats and other types of birds.

Mahmoud Shalaby, the fatwa secretary of Egypt's Dar Al Iftaa, a government Islamic educational institute, also said that killing stray dogs is not permissible, stressing that Islam does not sanction harming animals in this way. Shalaby added that it is not permissible to kill stray dogs or other animals unless they represent a direct threat to human beings, adding that any danger associated with stray animals should be dealt with via a complaint to Egyptian authorities.

Al Azhar [I think this refers to the university in Cairo. - Mod.SH] explained the rule against killing stray dogs, noting that the Sharia, or Islamic law, understands animals' relationship with people in a realistic way, whether based on their importance in sustaining life or other benefits to humans. The Holy Qur'an, it said, asks human beings to honor animals, and does not sanction causing them unnecessary harm. "The fundamental principle is (showing) charity towards animals, and, therefore, it is not permissible to kill dogs or other stray animals except if they pose a threat (to people), such as if they threaten the security of local communities and the safety of citizens," Al Azhar noted. It went on to explain that the killing of animals should be done in a way that does not include unnecessary harm or torture, "provided that (putting an animal down) is the only way to stop the threat (it poses to human beings)."

In November last year [2019], citizens in the Egyptian resort town of Hurghada had been reported as complaining about attacks from stray dogs involving women, the elderly, and schoolchildren, a phenomenon that some officials at the time said could threaten tourism in the Red Sea Governorate. Ibrahim Abu Ali, a lawyer in Safaga, said that an Italian tourist, 55, and a German tourist, 40, filed 2 claims with police stations in Safaga after being bitten by stray dogs. The issue left officials stumped as to how to control the stray dog population, especially considering that foreign-led animal welfare societies and rights groups oppose the use of violence to get rid of stray dogs.

According to a report from Ahram Online, Egypt's agriculture Ministry reported about 400 000 cases of dog bites in 2017, a 100 000 increase compared with numbers in 2014. Moreover, 231 people have died in the last 4 years from complications related to dog bites. Most of the deaths were caused by rabies. Around 60 people die each year from rabies in Egypt, which is incurable if not detected early, according to statistics provided by the World Health Organisation in 2017.

In the past 2 days, 9 people have attended the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya after being bitten by jackals. None of the casualties who arrived at the hospital were in a serious condition, and most of the injuries involved the limbs, but the concern is rabies. [A video posted at the URL above, captured on security cameras in a factory yard, shows a jackal approaching one of the workers unexpectedly, starting to attack, eventually biting and tripping the worker to the ground. - Mod.AS]

The Nature and Parks Authority said: "We estimate that these are rabies-infected jackals because of their behavior and the fact that they are approaching humans. We hope to locate and eradicate them so that they do not continue to spread the disease."

Dan Alon, an ecologist at the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, explained that "The size of the jackal population in Israel as a whole, and in the north of the country in particular, is very high, directly resulting from surplus food available to them, in both open and urban areas. Unfortunately, this is the result of improper management of the waste economy in Israel, such as agricultural waste, which is not transferred to proper and orderly treatment and is thrown in open bins and in places that are not suitable for it."

The Nahariya Municipality stated that it operates in accordance with the guidelines of the Nature and Parks Authority: "These are protected wildlife, which come from the open areas around the city. The only authority authorized to deal with the actual phenomenon are the inspectors of the Nature and Parks Authority." However, they called on residents to keep their yards clean, dump garbage in closed bags into garbage cans, and to keep the bins closed in order to prevent jackals from continuing to arrive in the city.

[Nahariya, the town in and around which the above events took place, is in the Western Galilee, an area in northern Israel bordering southern Lebanon. The regions bordering Lebanon have been suffering rabies in spite of the oral vaccination scheme for wildlife (foxes and jackals), operational throughout Israel in the past 20 years. Apparently, rabid animals penetrate the border fencing and infect local wild and stray animals, which have evaded the immunization since. Due to security reasons, the application of airplanes for the dispersal of oral baits with vaccine cannot be applied close to the border. Oral vaccination is not applied in Lebanon.

The abundance of rabies cases in stray dogs and wildlife assumed to prevail in south Lebanon (Janoub/Nabatieh governorates), challenging the local population, warrants control and preventive measures to be urgently applied. According to a recent review (ref 1) addressing human rabies in Lebanon, the Nabatieh governorate suffered the highest rate of human bites in the country (56.31/100 000).

An interactive map, presenting the animal rabies cases in Israel during 2020, indicating the species involved (jackals light blue, foxes brown) is available at https://moag.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a6d8aae5cbc04c958d5efefd2724318f. Note the absence of rabies elsewhere in Israel. Coordinated application of oral vaccination on a regional basis would benefit all.
