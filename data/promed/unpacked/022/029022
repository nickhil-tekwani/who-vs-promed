Veterinarians at Kansas State University say they're dealing with a large number of cases of an infectious disease in horses caused by bacteria found in the soil.

Dr. Laurie Beard, Clinical Professor for Equine Medicine at K-State's Veterinary Health Center, says the staff at the facility has treated numerous horses with the illness, called pigeon fever, throughout the fall months [2012], and they continue to handle current cases.

"The most typical clinical signs that we see with the disease are abscesses, which we refer to as external abscesses in muscles. The most common muscle that we see affected are the pectoral muscles, and that's why the disease is called pigeon fever, because the pecs [pectoral muscles] get big and swollen like a pigeon's breast might be. We also see the abscesses in other muscle groups as well," she explained.

The abscesses are lanced and drained. "It's certainly painful while they have the abscess, and once we get it drained, the pain subsides," Beard told WIBW.

The disease does not have a high mortality rate and is treated with anti-inflammatory medication. There have been rare cases of horses getting internal infections, Beard said.

Pigeon fever is most commonly seen in the southwest and California due to the arid conditions that allow the bacteria to thrive. Veterinarians believe that the unusually hot summer and severe lack of rainfall and continued dry conditions provided the perfect conditions for the organism to grow.

"We previously will have seen this once or twice a year. We're seeing it in numbers that we haven't ever seen before, and so we believe we're seeing this organism because of the drought. We know this organism actually lives in the soil and grows in the soil for a number of months," Dr. Beard said. She says an animal can be infected with the disease for several weeks before displaying signs and that not much can be done to limit the spread because of the environmental factors at play.

"We don't know exactly how it's transmitted to horses. There has been some evidence that it's probably flies. Flies get contaminated with the organism, feed on the horses' skin, and then the organism enters the horse that way. We're certainly seeing it in horses in the Manhattan area. I know, talking to other veterinarians in Kansas, that they're seeing it as well. We're not the only place in Kansas, for sure," she added.

The Veterinary Health Center has seen anywhere from 5-20 cases of pigeon fever per week during the outbreak.

The staff hopes that the cold weather will help cut down on the growth of the bacteria and that they will start to see fewer cases.

[Pigeon fever, pigeon breast, breastbone fever, dryland distemper, dryland strangles, false strangles, or false distemper are names by which this disease -- caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ -- is most frequently known. Geographically, it was at one time considered to be a disease of California, where it is regarded as endemic. However, it is much more widespread now, especially in the western states of the USA, but it has a worldwide distribution. It is a seasonal disease, usually appearing in late fall, but it can appear sporadically at any time of year.

The signs of pigeon fever can also initially resemble those of other diseases such as strangles. Sometimes the only initial signs are lameness and a reluctance to move. It can strike a horse of any age, sex, or breed, but usually attacks young adult animals. There is a low incidence in foals.

It has also been diagnosed in cattle, and a similar disease affects sheep and goats. The disease is not transmissible to humans, although humans can carry the infectious agent on shoes, clothing, hands, or barn tools and transfer it to another animals.

Clinical signs include lameness, fever, lethargy, and weight loss, usually accompanied by very deep abscesses and multiple sores along the chest, midline, and groin area, and, sometimes, the back. Abscesses also can develop internally.

The disease is called pigeon fever because infected animals often develop abscesses in their pectoral muscles, which swell to make it resemble a pigeon's chest. Although the disease is considered seasonal, with most cases occurring in early fall, a number of cases have been confirmed during winter months and other times of the year as well.

The causative bacteria live in the soil and can enter the animal's body through wounds, broken skin, or through mucous membranes. In addition, some researchers believe pigeon fever may be transmitted by flies.

Of the types of disease (external abscesses, internal abscesses, or limb infection [ulcerative lymphangitis]), ulcerative lymphangitis is the commonest form worldwide and rarely involves more than one leg at a time. Usually, multiple small, draining sores develop above the fetlock.

The commonest form of the disease in the United States is external abscessation, which often forms deep in the muscles and can be very large. Usually, it appears in the pectoral region, the ventral abdomen, and the groin area. After spontaneous rupture, or lancing, the wound will exude liquid, light tan-colored, malodorous pus.

The commonest forms are external abscess and lymphangitis, with the prognosis of a full recovery being generally good. Internal abscesses can occur and are very difficult to treat.

The contagious nature of the disease means an accurate diagnosis is imperative, and treatment should be initiated as well as control of insects and the rigid practice of biosecurity.

Horse owners should be aware of the clinical signs and understand that veterinary care must be timely. Infected horses should be isolated, the abscesses properly treated, and the drainage properly disposed of. The area where the infected horse is kept must be properly cleaned and completely disinfected because this is a very hardy bacterium. Bacteria in the pus draining from abscesses on infected horses can survive from one to 55 days in the environment. They have also been shown to survive from one to 8 days on surface contaminants and from 7 to 55 days within feces, hay, straw, or wood shavings. Lower temperatures prolong the survival time.

Pest control is extremely important. The bacteria may be transported between animals by flies.

Horses may become infected but not develop abscesses for weeks. The disease usually manifests in younger horses but can occur in any age, sex, and breed.

A different biotype of the organism is responsible for a chronic contagious disease of sheep and goats, caseous lymphadenitis (CL). Either biotype can occur in cattle.

Treatment in horses often consists of hot packs or poultices applied to abscesses to encourage opening. Open abscesses should be drained and regularly flushed with saline solution. Surgical or deep lancing may be required, depending on the depth of the abscess or the thickness of the capsule, and should be done by your veterinarian. Ultrasound can aid in locating deep abscesses so that drainage can be accomplished. External abscesses can be cleaned with a 0.1 per cent povidone-iodine solution. Antiseptic-soaked gauze may be packed into the open wound. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as phenylbutazone, can be used to control swelling and pain.

Antibiotics are controversial. Their use in these cases has sometimes been associated with chronic abscessation and, if inadequately used, may contribute to abscesses, according to one study. The most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of this condition are procaine penicillin G, administered intramuscularly, or trimethoprim-sulfa. In the case of internal abscesses, prolonged penicillin therapy is necessary.

Buckets or other containers should be used to collect pus from draining abscesses, and this infectious material should be disposed of properly. Consistent and careful disposal of infected bedding, hay, straw, or other material used in the stall is vitally important. Thoroughly clean and disinfect stalls, paddocks, all utensils, and tack. Pest control for insects is also very important.

With treatment, recovery usually takes place between 2 weeks and 77 days. Although some animals may have recurrences, recovery is generally complete, and the prognosis is good. - Mod.TG]
