In the last 3 months, visceral leishmaniasis, the most aggressive
form of the disease, has caused 17 confirmed cases with 6 deaths in
the city of Rondonopolis (220 km (137 mi) from Cuiaba, capital of
Mato Grosso state).
This is half the cases registered there in the whole of 2007, and
twice the total cases registered in the city from 2001-2006. Before
November 2007, the average was one case a year, with no deaths. In
just the 1st 20 days of 2008, there have been 4 cases, 2 of them
fatal. The latest victim, a 56-year-old man, was confirmed today [22 Jan 2008].
The disease is caused by a protozoan transmitted by sandflies,
_Lutzomyia longipalpis_ and _Lutzomyia cruzi_, and affects mainly
the liver and spleen. If not treated early, it is 90 percent fatal.
According to the adjunct municipal secretary of health, Rosana Zucato
Juliani, the reason for the upsurge in cases is infected people
moving from rural areas to live in the city, and bringing their
infected dogs with them, which are the reservoir.

[The main reservoir of _L. brasiliensis_ is dogs and other canine
species, and of _L. amazonensis_ wild rodents, but other species like
wild foxes and opossums have been reported infected. The main vector
is the sandfly _Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l._. It is therefore not
likely that the current surge in VL (visceral leishmaniasis) is
caused by the movement of people as suggested here, but rather lack
of control of the animal reservoir and the vector. It is important to
have the _Leishmania_ typed, which will give an idea of the reservoir
host. - Mod.EP]
