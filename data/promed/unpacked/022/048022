A series of 6 falciparum malaria cases have occurred in travellers recently
returned from The Gambia. 2 cases are known to have died, and a further 2
are seriously ill. The cases, aged between 31 and 61 years, all returned to
the United Kingdom (UK) and became ill in the second half of November 2005.
5 had been on holidays of 1-2 weeks, all in resorts within 20km of the
Atlantic coast, with some cases having been on fishing or bird-watching
excursions. The 6th case had visited the Gambia several times on business
and had travelled a little further inland than the other cases. All of the
cases had taken either no or inadequate chemoprophylaxis."

Health experts have issued a warning about malaria after 4 people from
northwest England contracted the disease during holidays overseas. The
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said they caught a deadly form of
malaria in Gambia, West Africa, after travelling without proper protection.
2 of the victims remain seriously ill in hospital.
Dr David Lalloo, the school's clinical director, said unnecessary deaths
from malaria continue to rise among Britons. He said thousands of UK
travellers were putting their lives at risk by ignoring the threat of
malaria when they go on exotic holidays. 2 Merseyside men fell ill with the
mosquito-borne disease following a fishing trip 4 weeks ago. One has since
been discharged from a Liverpool hospital, but the other is still very ill
in intensive care.
A Merseyside woman who went on holiday to Gambia in November 2005 also
returned with malaria, but has now been discharged from the same hospital.
A 4th tourist remains very ill in another North West hospital. "As we
understand it, none of these 4 tourists had taken adequate protection,"
said Dr Lalloo. "This underlines the importance of seeking medical advice
before travelling to malaria-endemic countries."
He said the number of people returning to Britain with the potentially
fatal form of malaria has grown from about 250 cases in 1977 to up to 1500
annually in recent years. Malaria is an infectious disease carried by
mosquitoes, which pass on a parasite into their victim's bloodstream.

[West Africa -- including The Gambia -- has the highest malaria endemicity
in the world. The information available at the home page of the UK Health
Protection Agency shows that the number of malaria cases imported to the UK
has decreased from 121 in 2000 to 31 in 2004. This does not, however,
provide information on the actual risk of infection, because we do not know
how many people visited The Gambia. The case fatality rate is high --
between 1.4 and 6.5 percent (reported to be 12.5 percent in 2005, based on
a limited number of samples, and clearly not all cases have yet been reported).
A strong recommendation of malaria prophylaxis is part of any country's
advice to travellers visiting West Africa, and these cases show that it has
not been followed. Travel agencies in particular have a responsibility to
make sure that their customers are properly informed about health risks at
the destination. - Mod.EP]
