In the northern portion of the state of South Australia, a third case of
Johnes disease has been discovered in red deer. The commercial deer herd
was tested following reports of escaped animals grazing with sheep. This is
worrisome for local landholders who are concerned their livestock are at
risk of infection from escaped red deer.
South Australian Farmers' Federation chairman Chris Parker says a
regulation introduced in February, which allows deer owners 14 days to
collect escaped animals, may need to be reviewed. Chris Parker said: "I
think this 14-day period certainly needs to be looked at and negotiated
maybe at a local levels, because it seems the possibility of some of these
animals wondering around for that period of time might cause a considerable
disease risk."
