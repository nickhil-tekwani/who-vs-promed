[1] Canada (Toronto): cases, meat production facility
Date: Mon 8 Feb 2021 12:02PM EST

Another 7 cases of the COVID-19 variant first found in the UK [B.1.1.7] have been linked to an outbreak at a Toronto meat production facility.

Toronto Public Health first notified the public of the outbreak on [1 Feb 2021], saying that 78 workers at Belmont Meats in North York had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Of those infections, 2 were positive for the B.1.1.7. variant.

At the time, officials said there was evidence of "secondary transmission of the variant in a household member" and that there was no indication that the positive cases or their close contacts had travelled recently.

Belmont Meats voluntarily closed on [28 Jan 2021] after Toronto Public Health started an investigation into the outbreak.

On Monday [8 Jan 2021], Toronto Public Health confirmed that there were now 95 positive COVID-19 cases associated to the outbreak at Belmont Meats. Of those confirmed cases, 9 are now confirmed to be the B.1.1.7. variant.

Five of those cases live outside of Toronto, officials said.

The B.1.1.7. strain is believed to be more easily transmissible than the original strain and health officials project that it will be the dominant source of infection in Ontario by March [2021].

On Sunday [7 Jan 2021], Toronto Public Health confirmed its 1st case of the P.1. COVID-19 variant first reported in Brazil, as well as its 1st case of the B.1.351 COVID-19 variant first seen in South Africa.

[Meat packing plants have demonstrated a "strong positive relationship" with "local community transmission," suggesting the plants act as "transmission vectors" and "accelerate the spread of the virus" both within the plant and the surrounding population.

See Taylor CA, Boulos C, Almond D. Livestock plants and COVID-19 transmission. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Dec 15; 117(50):31706-31715. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2010115117. Epub 2020 Nov 19. PMID: 33214147; PMCID: PMC7749337.

Enhanced transmission will be especially true with the more transmissible variants. Workers in these facilities should be prioritized for vaccination because of their high risk. The same report was also submitted by Mary Marshall - Mod.LK]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants raises concerns about their resistance to neutralizing antibodies elicited from previous infection, or from vaccination. Here we examined whether sera and monoclonal antibodies from convalescent donors, prior to and following a single immunization with the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and a variant, B.1.351 from South Africa. Prevaccination sera weakly neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351. Immunization with either vaccine generated anamnestic B and CD4+ T cell responses and a 1000-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers against both strains and SARS-CoV-1. Neutralization was likely due to anti-RBD and anti-S2 antibodies. Our study highlights the importance of vaccination of both uninfected and of previously infected subjects, as the elicited immune response will neutralize distinct viral strains.

[These results are very reassuring, that is, that boosting pre-existing antibody responses to the spike protein not only following 2 doses of vaccine but also natural infection followed by a single dose of vaccine, leads to significant increases in serum neutralizing antibody responses against vaccine-matched and emerging variants. This enhanced response included the ability to neutralize highly divergent neutralization-resistant viral variants, such as SARS-CoV-1 and B.1.351. While this has been reported previously, this preprint includes the variant first detected in South Africa. - Mod.LK]

[B] Side effects of 2nd dose of vaccine
Date: Tue 2 Feb 2021

The 2nd COVID-19 shot is a rude reawakening for immune cells
Side effects are just a sign that protection is kicking in as it should.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At about 2 a.m. on Thursday morning, I woke to find my husband shivering beside me. For hours, he had been tossing in bed, exhausted but unable to sleep, nursing chills, a fever, and an agonizingly sore left arm. His teeth chattered. His forehead was freckled with sweat. And as I lay next to him, cinching blanket after blanket around his arms, I felt an immense sense of relief. All this misery was a sign that the immune cells in his body had been riled up by the 2nd shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, and were well on their way to guarding him from future disease.

Side effects are a natural part of the vaccination process, as my colleague Sarah Zhang has written. Not everyone will experience them. But the 2 COVID-19 vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, already have reputations for raising the hackles of the immune system: In both companies' clinical trials, at least 1/3 of the volunteers ended up with symptoms such as headaches and fatigue; fevers like my husband's were less common.

Dose No. 2 is more likely to pack a punch -- in large part because the effects of the 2nd shot build iteratively on the 1st. My husband, who's a neurologist at Yale New Haven Hospital, is one of many who had a worse experience with his 2nd shot than his 1st.

But much like any other learning process, in this one repetition is key. When hit with the 2nd injection, the immune system recognizes the onslaught and starts to take it even more seriously. The body's encore act, uncomfortable though it might be, is evidence that the immune system is solidifying its defenses against the virus.

"By the 2nd vaccine, it's already amped up and ready to go," Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told me. Fortunately, side effects resolve quickly, whereas COVID-19 can bring on debilitating, months-long symptoms and has killed more than 2 million people.

When the immune system detects a virus, it will dispatch cells and molecules to memorize its features so it can be fought off more swiftly in the future. Vaccines impart these same lessons without involving the disease-causing pathogen itself -- the immunological equivalent of training wheels or water wings.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines accomplish that pedagogy via a genetic molecule called mRNA that's naturally found in human cells. Once delivered into the upper arm, the mRNA instructs the body's own cells to produce a coronavirus protein called spike -- a molecule that elicits powerful, infection-fighting antibody responses in people battling COVID-19.

To ensure safe passage of mRNA into cells, the vaccine makers swathed the molecules in greasy bubbles called lipid nanoparticles. These strange, fatty spheres don't resemble anything naturally present in the body, and they trip the sensors of a cavalry of fast-acting immune cells, called innate immune cells, that patrol the body for foreign matter. Once they spot the nanoparticles, these cells dispatch molecular alarms called cytokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of injection. Marshaling these reinforcements is important, but the influx of cells and molecules makes the upper arm swollen and sore. The congregating cells spew out more cytokines still, flooding the rest of the body with signals that can seed system-wide symptoms such as fever and fatigue.

The mRNA itself might also tickle a reaction out of the immune system, simply because of how unusual it looks. "All of a sudden, you have a lot of new RNA that the cell didn't make," says Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, who got her 2nd of Moderna's vaccine last month [January 2021], with very few side effects.

The provocative nature of mRNA might help explain why Moderna's shot, which contains 3 times as much of the genetic material as Pfizer's, was linked to more side effects in clinical trials.

The innate immune system acts fast. But its actions aren't very long-lived or discerning: These cells just clobber anything that looks a little weird. Within a day or 2 of the injection, they start to lose steam. Cytokine production sputters; side effects start to fade. Around this time, innate immune cells start to pass the baton to another division of the immune system, called adaptive immunity, which includes sniperlike molecules and cells, such as antibodies and T cells, that will launch an attack on specific pathogens if they try to infect the body again.

T cells and B cells, the cells that make antibodies, need several days to study the spike's features before they can respond. But by the time the 2nd injection rolls around, adaptive cells are raring to go, and far faster to react. Some of these cells have even been lingering at the site of injection, out of suspicion that their target would return. Stimulated anew, these sentinel cells will blast out their own cytokines, layering on an extra wave of inflammation. In some people, like my beleaguered neurologist husband, these complex reactions can manifest in fevers, aches, and prolonged exhaustion.

My husband had side effects after his 1st dose too: a headache, some fatigue, a touch of dizziness -- all of which I can safely blame on his innate immune system. Those same innate responses return for another round of inflammation after the 2nd shot. But the ruckus raised after the 2nd injection might be a double whammy: The expected innate cells might be further egged on and amplified by a less sluggish surge of adaptive cells, concentrated near where the needle goes in.

That's a big part of why vaccine boosts are so important, Slifka said. Although the 1st shot stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity, the 2nd injection reminds B and T cells that the threat of the coronavirus cannot be taken lightly, and ensures that the sharpest and strongest immune players will be used for any subsequent response.

"They're asking, 'Why is this happening 21 or 28 days later? I thought we took care of this 4 weeks ago,'" Slifka said.

People shouldn't be perturbed by a lack of vaccine side effects either. As our bodies churn through new information, "some people's immune systems are louder than others'," Marcelin said. But the quiet ones are still hard at work.

My husband's immune system certainly fell into the diva category. The night after his 2nd shot, he pinwheeled between cold and hot, alternately bundling himself in blankets and tossing them away. The flux seemed to bleed a bit into his emotional valence too. After snoozing on the couch for several hours, he perked up and couldn't stop laughing at a picture of an orange cat curled up next to a box of similarly crescent-shaped croissants.

But within 24 hours of his shot, he was feeling well enough to run (yes, run) to work and finish an 11-hour shift. In a couple of weeks, he'll join the millions of other Americans who, thanks to a pair of injections, will be cloaked in an extra layer of armor against the coronavirus.

As he told me Wednesday night, shivering through the cushion of 2 comforters: "This is a million times better than getting COVID."

[3] Vaccine administration route
Date: 9 Jan 2021
From: Zhiru Guo <guozhiru@yahoo.com> [edited]


Given the huge demand for COVID-19 vaccines and limited production capacity, are there studies or clinical trials exploring intradermal (ID) vaccination instead of intramuscular? There are more antigen-presenting cells inside the skin, and there are reports of different other vaccines (including mRNA vaccine) have been tested in animals or humans with ID inoculation can induce the same protection with much lower dose input. Some vaccines only need 10%-20% of the IM dose to induce equivalent protection. If some or all of the COVID vaccine can be inoculated intradermally with lower dose requirement, then the same amount of vaccine would vaccinate more people and alleviate the manufacturing pressure.

ProMED thanks Dr Guo for submitting this question/comment.

Intradermal (ID) inoculation has been compared with intramuscular inoculation with generally favorable results for influenza vaccine, rabies, hepatitis A and B, inactivated poliovirus, and yellow fever, among others using lower doses and various devices to facilitate ID inoculation.

Dr Guo included the URLs of a few papers including a good review by WHO, addressing this route of inoculation. I haven't read anything on clinical trials administering the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by the ID route either in humans or non-human primates. If there is information available, please submit it to ProMED.

Because the dermis and epidermis of human skin are rich in antigen-presenting cells, it is correct that the ID route might be a better route where a lower dose could be equally or more effective, but delivery devices are still being developed to assure injection of vaccines into the right location. In addition, some of the results are inconsistent and further evaluation needs to be conducted. With time, the ID route may become the preferred route of administration of the vaccine. - Mod.LK]

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [7 Feb 2021], 10 am CET

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
For the 4th week in a row, the number of global new cases reported fell, with 3.1 million new cases last week, a 17% decline, and the 4th consecutive week showing a decline in cases compared to the previous week (Figure 1). This is the lowest figure since the week of [26 Oct 2020] (15 weeks ago). Although there are still many countries with increasing numbers of cases, at the global level, this is encouraging. The number of new deaths reported also fell for a 2nd week in a row, with 88 000 new deaths reported last week, a 10% decline as compared to the previous week. All WHO regions reported a decline in new cases, with 5 out of 6 regions reporting more than 10% decreases (Table 1). Europe and the Region of the Americas saw the greatest drops in absolute numbers, with together nearly 0.5 million fewer new cases reported last week (153 000 and 320 000 fewer new cases reported, respectively). New deaths also declined in all regions except the Western Pacific, where mortality rates remained similar to the previous week.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be the United States of America (871 365 cases, a 19% decrease), Brazil (328 652 cases, a 10% decrease), France (136 154 cases, a 4% decrease), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (133 747 cases, a 25% decrease), and the Russian Federation (116 842 cases, an 11% decrease).

Special focus: how COVAX is distributing the 1st COVID-19 vaccines to prioritized countries in all 6 WHO regions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) was formed 10 months ago with 2 aims: first, to develop COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics fast, and second, to distribute them fairly. The 1st aim has been achieved. As WHO Director-General Dr Tedros said in his opening remarks at the High-Level Finance Ministries' Meeting for the ACT Accelerator on [29 Jan 2021]: "The development and approval of safe and effective vaccines less than a year after the emergence of a new virus is a stunning scientific achievement, and a much-needed source of hope."

However, in opening remarks at a media briefing on COVID-19 on [5 Feb 2021], he highlighted that around 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, were yet to administer a single dose. More than 90% of the countries now rolling out vaccines are high- or upper-middle income countries. 75 percent of doses have been deployed in only 10 countries. At the 148th session of the Executive Board [18-26 Jan 2021], Dr Tedros stressed that "Vaccine equity is not just a moral imperative, it is a strategic and economic imperative." The International Chamber of Commerce Research Foundation found in a study that "the global economy stands to lose as much as USD 9.2 trillion if governments fail to ensure developing economy access to COVID-19 vaccines, as much as half of which would fall on advanced economies." Once countries with vaccines have vaccinated their own health workers and older people, the best way to protect the rest of their own population is to share vaccines so other countries can do the same. The longer it takes to vaccinate those most at risk everywhere, the more opportunity the virus has to mutate and evade vaccines.

COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator with 190 participating economies, is supporting the fair distribution of vaccines and has secured 2 billion doses from 5 producers, with options on more than 1 billion more doses. A total of 44 bilateral deals were signed last year [2020], and a further 12 signed this year [2021]. In this Special Focus, we present how COVAX is receiving and distributing an exceptional 1st round allocation of 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the 1st quarter of 2021 to prioritised participants, and 336 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine.

Following a letter sent to the 190 COVAX participants, as of the deadline of [18 Jan 2021], 72 expressions of interest were received for the exceptional 1st round allocation of the ultra-cold chain vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech. 6 regional review committees (composed of staff from WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and members of Gavi's Independent Review Committee) undertook a technical assessment of the applications. Due to the limited quantities of the 1st wave of vaccines, the list of participants was then narrowed down based on the following considerations; priority was given to COVAX participants that had not started COVID-19 vaccination (as of [29 Jan 2021]), met all of the readiness criteria (including being able to manage the ultra-cold chain vaccine storage at -70°C [-94 deg F]) and, for self-financing participants, were within the Pfizer price point; this left a total of 51 participants. Participants were then grouped by WHO Region and advance market commitment/self-financing status to ensure all Regions/groups would be represented. Participants in each group were ranked by their 28-day mortality rate as a proxy for the risk of health care worker exposure (that is, high COVID-19 mortality = high exposure). Eligible COVAX participants were selected from each group up to the 18 maximum that could be covered and supported by the 1.2 million doses. The doses will be delivered in the 1st quarter of 2021. For more details on the selection factors and countries chosen for the initial COVAX vaccine distribution see the interim distribution forecast. This document complements the recently published COVAX global supply forecast.

A further 336 million AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine doses (240 million doses produced by the Serum Institute of India and 96 million doses produced by AstraZeneca) will be delivered in the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2021. The combined population coverage of these initial doses will cover, on average, 3.3% of the total population of the 145 participants receiving doses. This is in line with the COVAX target to reach at least 3% population coverage in all countries, territories, and areas in the 1st half of the year [2021], enough to protect the most vulnerable groups such as health care workers.

COVAX is aiming to have 2 billion doses distributed, including at least 1.3 billion doses to 92 lower income economies, by the end of 2021, protecting at least 20% of each participating population (unless a participant has requested a lower percentage of doses). However, to achieve this, there needs to be prompt and equitable dose sharing, and support to close the funding gap of USD 26 billion for the ACT-Accelerator this year [2021], including USD 7.8 billion for COVAX. This year the theme for World Health Day is 'health inequality.' The WHO Director-General has challenged Member States to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on [7 Apr 2021], COVID-19 vaccines are being administered in every country. To support Member States in this endeavor, WHO has a COVID-19 vaccine country readiness and delivery portal, which includes guidance and tools, training (including 2 free online courses on https://openwho.org/), and answers to frequently asked questions.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO is closely monitoring the public health events associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and continues to provide updates as new information becomes available (see: Disease Outbreak News and Weekly Epidemiological Updates; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). WHO is working with member states, external partners, and experts to evaluate the available evidence around transmissibility, severity, and to assess the potential impacts on countermeasures including vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, and public health and social measures (PHSM). Here we provide an update on ongoing studies and the geographical distribution of 3 variants of concern (VOCs) as reported by countries, territories, and areas (hereafter countries) as of [8 Feb 2021]. Emerging evidence is summarized in Table 3 below.

The reported geographical extent of VOC detections has continued to increase as local and national surveillance activities are adapted and strengthened to include strategic sequencing to detect cases with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Since our last update, an additional 6 countries have reported cases of variant VOC202012/01, 3 additional countries reported variant 501Y.V2, and 5 additional countries reported variant P.1 (Table 3, Figures 3,5,7). In many countries, detections remain limited to imported cases only; however, VOCs are increasingly being identified among a subset of community-based samples with no direct links to travellers. Local transmission of VOC202012/01 has been reported in a growing number of countries in the European Region and in some areas of North America. Similarly, there is evidence to suggest that 501Y.V2 transmission is occurring in several countries in the African Region, with clusters of cases or ongoing local transmission suggested in countries in other regions.

On [2 Feb 2021], the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group convened a meeting with GISAID, Nextstrain, and Pango (3 prominent systems for tracking the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2) and other experts to discuss a mechanism for designating variants of concern and labeling these with unbiased, easy to pronounce names. While work is ongoing to establish standardized nomenclature for VOCs, WHO urges authorities, researchers, media, and the general public to use non-stigmatizing nomenclature and language for describing VOCs. The group met again today [9 Feb 2021] to further discussions and propose a nomenclature.

The emergence of new variants has highlighted the importance of countries continuing to strengthen the PHSM (for more information, please see our technical guidance; https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/considerations-in-adjusting-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19-interim-guidance). As countries work to prepare for and rollout COVID-19 vaccines while continuously adapting other PHSM, it is essential to incorporate studies to investigate potential impacts of emerging VOCs on transmission, disease, and the effectiveness of countermeasures, and to continuously share findings with the global community.

Table 3: Summary of emerging information on key variants of concern, as of [8 Feb 2021]

1. Variant VOC 202012/01
As mentioned in previous publications, the VOC 202012/01 variant has shown increased transmissibility, including increased secondary attack rates, and some evidence of increase in disease severity based on preliminary findings. More recently, results from a Phase 3 trial conducted by Novavax demonstrated an efficacy of 85.6% against this variant in the United Kingdom.

While previously mentioned preliminary studies showed post-vaccination sera with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had limited to no significant change against the VOC202012/01 variant, recently, the E484K mutation in the spike protein has been detected in 11 sequences within the B.1.1.7 lineage in the United Kingdom. This mutation is also found in 501Y.V2 and P.1 variant, but the three variants have arisen separately and are not linked to each other. Mutation E484K has been identified as an "escape mutation," which has shown the ability to reduce the neutralising activity by monoclonal antibodies or convalescent sera. A preliminary study has shown further reduction in neutralization activity by vaccine elicited antibodies if E484K mutation is present alongside the VOC202012/01 variant. The detected E484K mutation within this lineage is currently limited to a small number of cases, and these are all preliminary findings which require further investigation involving larger sample sizes.

In the United Kingdom where this variant was initially identified, the proportion of cases with VOC202012/01 among tested samples has increased from 63% in week commencing [14 Dec 2021], to 90% in the week beginning [18 Jan 2021]. This high rate of detection of VOC202012/01 has persisted in recent weeks while the case and death counts are showing a declining trend. From [11 Jan 2021] through [7 Feb 2021], a decreasing trend has been observed, following the implementation of stringent public health and social measures (Figure 4).

Similarly, in other European countries such as Ireland and Denmark, a marked increasing trend in the number of new COVID-19 cases was detected in late December 2020 as the countries were reporting local transmission of VOC202012/01. In Ireland, local authorities have reported the proportion of cases with VOC202012/01 among tested samples reached over 63% in the week starting on [25 Jan 2021] and over 7% in Denmark the week starting [11 Jan 2021]. Implementation of more intensive public health and social measures at the end of December and beginning of January led to marked declines in COVID-19 case and death incidence in both countries.

Figure 4: Weekly COVID-19 cases per 1 million population in the United Kingdom, as of [7 Feb 2021]

2. Variant 501Y.V2
As mentioned in previous publications, the 501Y.V2 variant has shown increased transmissibility, and laboratory-based studies noted a small reduction in the neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variants in individuals vaccinated with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, although the neutralizing titers still remained above the levels expected to confer protection.

New preliminary results of Novavax, Johnson & Johnson, and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines have shown potentially reduced effectiveness against 501Y.V2. Phase 3 trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine found 66% effectiveness in preventing moderate to severe infections, 28 days after vaccination; however, the efficacy varied across the three trial locations: the South Africa efficacy (57%) was lowest, and reflects 95% of the disease causing strains were the variant. Similar preliminary results from Novavax have shown 60% efficacy against 501Y.V2. In a small trial of approximately 2200 subjects in South Africa, a 2-dose regimen of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine resulted in a non-significant efficacy of 21.9% against mild-moderate COVID-19 which included a period when the majority of cases were caused by 501Y.V2; however, efficacy against severe COVID-19, hospitalizations and deaths was not studied. Serologic neutralization was substantially reduced compared with original strains, based on the small number of samples analysed. Notably, primary analysis of data from Phase 3 trials in the context of viral settings without this variant have shown that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine offers protection against severe disease, hospitalisation, and death; therefore, it remains vitally important to determine the vaccine's effectiveness for preventing more severe illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant.

It is important to note that these are preliminary findings which require further investigation including the need for assessment of vaccine performance against severe disease, assessment of neutralizing activity in a larger number of samples and for other vaccines against this strain, an evaluation of changes in neutralization on clinical efficacy and eventually, an estimate of the effectiveness of these vaccines on the current emerging variants. Manufacturers are concurrently exploring potential ways to improve protection against emerging VOCs, such as augmenting dosages and dosage intervals, introducing booster doses or booster vaccines, and beginning work to adapt vaccines and optimize production pipelines to allow for rapid strain changes, should this become necessary.

In South Africa, where this variant was initially identified, a progressive decreasing trend in case and death incidence (Figure 6), has been observed following the implementation of stringent PHSM. Here, studies have shown that the 2nd wave (predominated by 501Y.V2 circulation) was associated with a higher incidence, faster increases in cases and hospitalizations, and increased mortality risk in weeks with high rates of hospital admission reflecting increased pressure on the health system. However, it was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality -- suggesting disease severity may be similar to previously circulating variants.

3. Variant P.1
In Brazil, where the P.1 variant was initially identified in addition to detection in a group of travellers from Brazil to Japan, a 2nd wave of cases and corresponding deaths was observed with increasing trends beginning late November 2020 but has shown early signs of waning this week (Figure 8). In Manaus, Brazil, the proportion of cases with P.1 among tested samples have increased from 52% in December 2020 to 85% in January 2021. Based on preliminary investigations, the mutations detected in P.1 variant could potentially reduce antibody neutralization; however, additional studies are required to assess if there are changes in transmissibility, severity, or antibody neutralizing activity as a result of these new variants.

Key weekly updates
------------------
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros' remarks
- Do not rush to reopen. Now as we begin to roll out vaccines, we must remember that vaccines alone will not control this pandemic. It is vital that governments do not rush to re-open, and that they continue public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
- Sharing vaccines to protect the population. Once countries with vaccines have vaccinated their own health workers and older people, the best way to protect the rest of their own population is to share vaccines so other countries can do the same. That's because the longer it takes to vaccinate those most at risk everywhere, the more opportunity we give the virus to mutate and evade vaccines.
- Scaling-up the manufacturing process. We need a massive scale-up in production. Manufacturers can do more: having received substantial public funding, we encourage all manufacturers to share their data and technology to ensure global equitable access to vaccines.
- Sharing dossiers with WHO for emergency listing. We call on companies to share their dossiers with WHO faster and more fully than they have been doing, so we can review them for emergency use listing.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (99 317), Brazil (53 955), and France (18 870) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 548 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 8 Feb 2021 to late 9 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Spain (16 402), Russia (15 019), UK (12 364), Italy (10 612), and India (10 510). A total of 49 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 49 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 15.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 23.9% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases almost 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 107.38 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.34 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
