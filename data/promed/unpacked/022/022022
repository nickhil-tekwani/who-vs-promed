[The previous posting on ProMED-mail contained some of this information but
not all. It is worth noting that the Malaysian government is hoping that
ribavirin will be as useful as it appears to be (we all do) but, at the
same time, is recommending vaccination, one assumes with Japanese
encephalitis (JE) vaccine, for people who have symptoms of high fever and
dizziness. The [brackets] below contain my comments. - Mod.CHC]

Malaysia struggled on Monday to determine the origin of a newly detected
virus which, along with another discovered six months ago, has killed 63
people in the central pig-breeding region. Health authorities said they
knew little about the new virus except that it was similar to Hendra virus,
a member of the Paramyxo [Paramyxoviridae] family, which caused the deaths
of two people and 15 horses in Australia in 1994-95.
The new virus causes symptoms similar to those caused by JE virus, which
was first detected in Malaysia in October and was also harbored in pigs,
officials said. [Pigs were not found dying of JE virus last October.]
Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is marked by
high fever, headaches, dizziness, convulsions and loss of consciousness
leading to death if untreated [and sometime even if treated]. But the new
virus is different in that it was believed to be spread by direct contact.
It can, however, be killed by soap, detergent and disinfectant.
Authorities said they had no idea where the new strain came from or how to
wipe it out. The Malaysian Minister of Health indicated that the
Government is trying to answer questions regarding origin of the virus,
route of transmission, and pathogenicity for animals other than pigs. In
that way, he suggested, it might be possible to improve control efforts.
The discovery of the new strain 10 days ago has complicated efforts to
battle the viral epidemic which has prompted a health scare in two central
regions. Authorities initially blamed the deaths on Japanese encephalitis,
which is endemic in Malaysia and many other Asian countries.
In an effort to contain the outbreak, authorities have killed 139 000 pigs
of a target population of about a million. Other efforts have focused on
vaccinating residents and pigs against [JE], and spraying the two regions
where the outbreaks occurred to kill _Culex_ mosquitoes, which transmit
[JE] from pigs to humans. But the presence of the Hendra-like virus
required a fresh strategy as it is believed to be transmitted by direct
contact with live, sick pigs.
Fewer than one third of the 63 deaths have been confirmed as encephalitis
cases and authorities have blamed the new virus for at least some of the
deaths.
The epidemic has harmed the country's lucrative pig business and posed
political headaches to the government. Sales of pork have dropped 70%
while a ban of Malaysian pork imports by Thailand, Singapore and the
Philippines has badly hit the 1.5 billion ringgit ($395 million) industry.
Live pig exports are valued at 400 million ringgit a year. Almost all pig
farmers and consumers belong to the ethnic Chinese minority, who eat pork,
but the majority Muslim Malays, who make up more than half the 22 million
population, revile the animal, which Islam considers unclean.
Authorities have said that the best weapon against the [Hendra-like] virus
so far seemed to be found in simple cleansing solutions, such as soaps and
disinfectants.
A team of eight experts from Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is now on site. They are working with experts from [Malaysia],
Australia and Taiwan to help find ways to fight the epidemic. The U.S.
experts brought sophisticated equipment and have set up a makeshift
laboratory at a government hospital to study the new virus.
Authorities hope that ribavirin would be as effective in battling the new
virus.
The minister urged those with symptoms of high fever and dizziness to get
vaccinated at once. The government has prepared to jab 250 000 people but
only about 65 000 had come forward until Friday.
The Health Ministry issued a list of precautionary measures to those
working in the pig-breeding industry, asking them to be covered head to toe
and to use soap liberally, and released a statement on Monday listing
precautionary measures for the nation's estimated 300 000 pig farmers as
well as thousands of farm helpers, truck drivers and slaughterhouse
workers. It advised the use of eye goggles, face masks, boots, plastic
aprons, and water-proof gloves when handling pigs. It also recommended
refraining from treating or touching sick animals, and suggested spraying
disinfectant on dead pigs.
