Leishmania in Capital, northern Argentina
-----------------------------------------
The leishmaniasis outbreak occurring in Capital
has 13 cases already confirmed in 3 different
communities, and it worries persons in charge of
PROMEBA (Program for Improvement in Communities,
according to its Spanish initials) in La Olla community.
Technical personnel from PROMEBA alerted about
the critical situation in La Olla community with
respect to leishmaniasis, since there are some
animal species in the area which may act as reservoirs for Leishmania.
Informative workshops were led by officers from
Corrientes municipality. The activities performed
by PROMEBA were part of preventive measures from
the Provincial Government and the Municipality in
order to stop the spread of leishmaniasis.
The 1st prevention workshop was performed in
Carolina Tobar-Garc√≠a Public School, and it
gathered more than 50 persons. Officers who
delivered lectures explained what is
leishmaniasis, how is it transmitted, how can it
affect dogs and humans; and they emphasized on
how to prevent transmission of the disease.
"In such an emergency situation, it is critical
that neighbors know how to take care of their
pets and of themselves; for this reason we
decided to carry on these prevention workshops,
particularly in an area that is considered as
critical for this condition", explained Ms.
Liliana Perez-Chaia, Head of the Environment and Health division in PROMEBA.
The aforementioned officer stated that La Olla is
an area in which there is a significant number of
stray dogs. Also, there are some other animal
species capable of acting as reservoirs for the
disease, such as horses or pigs.

[The new cases underline our previous comments
that Leishmania is spreading in northern
Argentina (see posting from 7 Nov 2009 and 25 Feb
2009 below). As discussed previously, there is an
epidemic potential and the new cases underline
that leishmania is established in Argentina at
least north of a line through Buenos Aires to
Cordoba. La Olla is approximately 125 kilometers,
or about 78 miles, north of Cordoba. - Mod.EP]
