Soybeans: black root rot increases
----------------------------------
For some east Arkansas growers, a switch from cotton to soybeans has
had serious consequences. The culprit is black root rot [BRR], a
disease that has caused serious yield losses in some Mid-South fields.

Prior to its discovery in Arkansas by Scott Monfort, plant
pathologist, BRR -- caused by the fungus _Thielaviopsis basicola_ --
had only been confirmed on soybeans in regions north of the
Mid-South. In the Mid-South, the disease has yet to be found outside
east Arkansas. In 2008, Monfort found it in only one field in one
county. Since then, it has been found in over 10 counties.

The last couple of planting seasons were extremely cool and wet.
"That's one of the reasons why this disease has begun to show up on
soybeans. It's proven to do quite a bit of damage." BRR is a common
pathogen on cotton in Arkansas.

There are some seed treatments that can help in cotton, says Monfort.
"But it doesn't control the disease 100 percent. This disease is
pretty resilient. In cotton, root knot nematode enhances the
problem." However, in soybeans, BRR has been "rather devastating"
even in the absence of nematodes.

Research trials evaluate varieties for potential resistance as well
as seed treatments for potential control. So far, they have shown BRR
to have a significant impact on soybean seedling survival -- 38
percent of plants survived in infested soil compared to 71 percent in
non-infested soil. All surviving plants grown in infested soil were
found positive for BRR.

[The fungus _Thielaviopsis basicola_ is an important soil pathogen
which causes root rot and damping off on a wide range of hosts,
including many vegetable and field crops (especially bean, cucurbits,
and solanaceous species). Symptoms may include wilting, stunting, and
chlorosis of plants, cracks in stems, as well as characteristic root
lesions with dark coloured chlamydospores within the tissue ('black'
root rot). Plants may die from loss of nutrient and water absorption.

In soybean, symptoms may be confused with environmental stress and
other diseases, for example sudden death syndrome (see links below).
The fungus overwinters in plant debris and infects developing plants
when seedlings are 3 to 4 weeks old. BRR is most severe when high
numbers of nematodes are present in the field. It is thought that
these pests provide additional entry points for root infection.
Disease management may include fungicide seed treatments, crop
rotation with non-hosts, and host resistance.

Similar to the situation reported above, it was also found in
Australia that _T. basicola_ isolates from soybean appeared to be
even more pathogenic on cotton, and that rotation of cotton and
soybean crops may result in the carryover of _T. basicola_ between
these farming systems.
