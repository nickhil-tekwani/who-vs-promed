Asian soybean rust was detected on soybean for the first time ever in
Kentucky on Friday, 6 Oct 2006. Between then and now, it was found on
soybeans in 7 counties in the western part of the state.
The infected counties are Caldwell, Christian, Hopkins, Lyon, Marshall,
Todd, and Union. Last year, only Caldwell County had any rust, and that was
on kudzu, discovered 11 Nov 2005.
The U.S. count is now 110 infected counties in 9 states. These new finds
are much farther north than any other U.S. rust locations in 2006.
Don Hershman, plant pathologist with the University of Kentucky, posted
this in today's state commentary on <http://www.sbrusa.net>:
"Soybean rust was detected on soybean for the first time ever in Kentucky
on Friday, 6 Oct 2006. The find was in the corner of an otherwise mature
sentinel plot located at the UK Research and Education Center in Princeton.
Incidence was about 40 percent to 50 percent, and severity around 10
percent. Then, between Sun 8 Oct and Tue 10 Oct, soybean rust was detected
at various levels in six additional counties -- Christian, Hopkins, Lyon,
Marshall, Todd, and Union Counties. All of the finds, thus far, are in the
lakes region of west Kentucky. Finds were in "mobile plots," except for the
Caldwell and Union County finds, which were in sentinel plots," he said.
"Incidence in additional counties was generally low (0.1 percent to 10
percent.) With the exception of the Hopkins County find, which had
extremely low severity (<0.1 percent), severity in the other finds was
around 5 percent to 15 percent.
"For all finds, the stage of pustules was mostly uniform," Hershman said.
"This suggests to me that a large number of spores blew in sometime over
the past 2 weeks and cut a pretty large swath in west Kentucky. We are in
the process of looking to the west and east to see if an even larger area
of spore deposition and infection may have occurred. This find will have
absolutely NO impact on the 2006 soybean crop in Kentucky or anywhere else
for that matter," Hershman said. "In fact, soybean rust will 'go away' from
Kentucky as soon as there is hard frost. It simply cannot survive this far
north. However, these finds are of great importance to the soybean rust
predictive models. Thus, we are making great effort to know the extent of
infection before the frost hits (maybe tonight) or until there are no
soybean leaves in which the rust can survive (the disease has NOT been seen
in kudzu here). I am hoping to find a location that has decent infection
that would provide for an educational opportunity or two."
"The bottom line is this: The soybean rust finds will not impact soybean in
Kentucky or the U.S. this year. But, they will help us to refine soybean
rust predictive models, which will help greatly with SBR management in
future crops," Hershman said.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen which causes
defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese
arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in southern
states of the USA.
This is the 1st report of ASR on soybean in Kentucky, USA, though it was
found on kudzu in that state in November 2005. This is the most northern
detection of ASR in USA in 2006. The article notes that at this late stage
of the soybean crop season the impact will be minimal. This report will be
added to a subsequent posting which will summarize all finds of ASR in USA
since the last summary (20060915.2611) which was posted on 15 Sep 2006.
