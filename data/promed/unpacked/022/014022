The Department of Animal Health in Viet Nam believes that the
outbreaks of blue ear pig disease are due to the unusual weather
conditions being experienced, together with insufficient knowledge of
farming practices. Hai Duong's Binh Giang district saw the 1st case
on 28 Mar 2010, and the virus has spread with 650 pigs infected, and
100 have died. It has been reported on voice of Viet Nam that farmers
have been selling infected pigs, and now mobile checkpoints have been
set up to prevent the trading and transport of infected pigs.

Pham Dinh Nghi, the deputy head of the department said: "We have
collaborated with the police and market management forces to monitor
sick pigs and cull those seriously infected, and farms have been
disinfected twice a week."

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), popularly
named "blue ear disease," is one of the porcine diseases reportable
to the OIE. The disease is characterised by reproductive failure of
sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs caused by
the PRRS virus, a virus currently classified as a member of the order
_Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. The
primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of the
pig.

Two major antigenic types of the virus exist, type I and type II. The
latter is the one identified in Viet Nam and China; the variants in
both countries were found to be identical (see ref. 1). The virus is
primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine,
semen and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world.
The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal
mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the births of weak piglets
that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and
secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of
respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. No
other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV.

Initially reported by Viet Nam to the OIE as starting in March 2007,
PRRS was declared endemic in February 2008. Some investigators are of
the opinion that it had been circulating in the region since 1999. A
summary of the event, including a map showing its distribution
throughout the country, can be found at
