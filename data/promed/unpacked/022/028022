In the past 3 months, there have been 42 malaria cases, "22 inmates and 20 jail staff " reported from the Aguada jail [Goa], but thankfully there has yet been no casualty [meaning death? - Mod.SH].

Herald investigations have revealed that proper procedures were not followed by the Public Works Department (PWD), which is responsible for construction and seeking permissions for the campus, and also by the jail authorities, who seem to have shifted to the jail in a hurry. Investigations have also revealed that the no "objection certificate" from the health department, mandatory for any construction, has not been obtained nor has the occupancy certificate from the panchayat been obtained, deeming the building illegal.

Inquiries also revealed that while the inmates are taken care of by the local health officer, the jail staffers are left to fend for themselves. "There is construction work still under way, and the 3 septic tanks here have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. There is no proper cleaning of these tanks, and fogging is conducted only occasionally," sources said.

The staff at the jail, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that inmates are immediately rushed to Asilo in case of any issues, but the staffers have no such privilege. "There is monitoring of inmates regularly, besides there is an in-house doctor only for the inmates," a source stated. As a result of the sickness, sources said that 20 out of 50 staffers are on sick leave, and others have to do double duties. "There is absolute shortage of staff right now," the sources explained.

The inspector general of prisons, Elvis Gomes, when informed that 42 people in less than 3 months have been infected by malaria, stated that he is aware of this. "I am not sure of the number, but I know there are a few cases of malaria, and the department is keeping a close watch on the situation. We have an in-house medical officer who is looking after the inmates, while the Colvale health officer is regularly monitoring the situation," Gomes said. When pointed out that staffers are left to fend for themselves, he said: "The staff get all benefits like reimbursements etc., and they don't stay here like in other states where the staff quarters are within the jail premises."

On the very important issue of not obtaining the NOC from the Health department, he said it is the duty of the PWD not the Prisons department. "The PWD is responsible for the construction and NOC, and our job is to take care of the inmates; we can't do both," he said. Attempts to contact the PWD principal chief engineer for his comments proved futile. Colvale jail superintendent Melwyn Vaz said the inmates were moved from Aguada in a hurry due to the High Court directions. "The jail is partly commissioned and HC monitoring committee was after us to move fast, so what can you expect?" he asked. He added that "a health centre is in place, and regular preventive measures are being taken. Regarding the malaria cases, you should ask the PWD; it was only after they gave us a go ahead that we moved here."

Deputy chief minister Francis D'Souza, who is also the health minister, said he has no knowledge of the issue. "Many a times, government departments do not follow rules; secondly, the jail is not complete, so they must have not applied for it," D'Souza said.

[Malaria is endemic in many parts of India, but Goa is regarded as a low endemic area. In the newswire, it is alluded to that "the septic tanks here have become breeding grounds." Anopheles mosquitoes usually prefer clear water, and it is not certain that the mosquitoes breeding in the septic tanks are anopheles.

To understand the situation, it is important to know whether the inmates are from malaria endemic areas of India and thus could be a reservoir for local transmission.

A map of malaria in India can be found in the 2014, WHO World Malaria Report at http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf?ua=1. - Mod.EP
