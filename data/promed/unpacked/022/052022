Animal with rabies found in Tel Aviv; first such case since '93
--------------------------------------------------
A case of rabies was discovered in the Tel Aviv region on Mon, 29 Mar 2004,
the first such case in the area since 1993.
A resident of the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon recently saw 2 animals
fighting and notified his city hall. The city dispatched personnel to the
area, and found the body of one of the animals. The results of an autopsy
found it was a jackal infected with rabies.
The Tel Aviv municipality declared the area as possibly rabies-stricken.
The said area is bordered by the Glilot and Kfar Hayarok junctions in the
north, Bnei Efraim Street in the east, Kakal Street in the south, and the
Ayalon Freeway in the west [appx 6 square km].
Dr. Zvi Galeen, veterinarian for the Tel Aviv municipality, along with
other municipality workers searched the area for stray animals, including
the 2nd jackal that was seen fighting with the infected animal. The
municipality will publish in the media an announcement to the public
regarding the case of rabies, and request that citizens be alert to any
changes in the behavior of house pets.

[Official confirmation on the laboratory investigation and of the
declaration of "rabies-infected area" is pending. In fact, endemic cases of
rabies have not been recorded in Tel Aviv for several decades (a case in
October 1993 was recorded in a pup imported from another area).
An officially declared "rabies-infected area" is, according to
Israel's Rabies Ordinance, liable to severe measures. In urban areas (such
as the currently affected area), these measures include the compulsory
muzzling of dogs and keeping them leashed whenever taken off their
premises. The State Veterinary Officer "must order", in a declared area,
that "any dog in the public domain without a muzzle on its mouth and any
dog, which does not have a license", be put to death. Licenses are issued
by the municipalities only to vaccinated dogs.
The main problem with which the Tel Aviv authorities will have to cope is
the abundant feral cat population. It is estimated that in Tel Aviv alone,
more than 50 000 feral cats -- and probably many more -- are roaming the
streets. Obviously, those unowned cats are not vaccinated. There are more
than 25 000 owned, licensed, and annually vaccinated dogs, and at least the
same (estimated) number of owned cats kept indoors. - Mod.AS]
