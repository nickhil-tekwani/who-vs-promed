Human Rabies - New Hampshire, 1996:
On August 20, 1996, a 32-year-old resident of New Hampshire died in a
Massachusetts hospital from an illness characterized by rapid neurologic
deterioration. Rabies had been clinically suspected on the date of her
transfer from a New Hampshire hospital (August 14) and was confirmed by
CDC on August 17. This report summarizes the investigation of this case
by the state health departments of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania, which implicated a dog in Kathmandu, Nepal,
as the probable source of exposure.
