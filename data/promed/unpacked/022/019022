More than 3000 common eider ducks found dead on Nunavut's South
Hampton Island this summer were infected with avian cholera, a
scientist with the Canadian Wildlife Service says.
Although avian cholera is a naturally occurring disease in birds, it
has never been detected that far north, Grant Gilchrist told CBC News Friday.
"It's pretty grim when you consider the island is only 800 metres
long and there's over 3000 dead birds and these are large birds,"
Gilchrist said. "The smell is awful and it attracts a lot of herring
gulls and it's a mess."
As far as intervention, Gilchrist said there is really nothing that
can be done to help the birds. "It really has to take its course and
we're trying to monitor it to see how widespread it is and whether
the problem is growing in Nunavut," he said.
Gilchrist is concerned because it is not known where the disease is
coming from or how fast it is spreading.
The disease was first detected in northern Quebec 3 years ago when
about 200 dead birds were found.
Gilchrist said they plan to hold meetings in northern Quebec to
inform people there about the growing problem. More comprehensive
research will be conducted next summer, he said.
Avian cholera is not the same as avian flu and cannot be passed on to
humans. The disease spreads quickly when a large population of birds
gathers in one area.

[There are several types of the bacterium _Pasturella hemolytica
(multocida)_, but the type most often affecting wild birds is Type 1.
In soil or water the bacteria have been known to survive for up to 4
months. Consequently the bacteria can be ingested through food or
water, or may be passed between birds by direct contact, or through
feces from infected birds. The bacteria may also be transmitted by
aerosol, especially if birds are in close proximity to each other.
Die-offs are most often seen in ducks and geese, although coots,
crows, and gulls may also be affected in these die-offs. Death is
usually very acute, to the point that birds may literally fall from
the sky. As a consequence of this rapid onset, large numbers of
well-fleshed birds may be found dead.
If illness is observed, the birds are lethargic, or may have
convulsions, swim or fly erratically or in circles, or they may
appear to try and fly upside down. Illnesses are not often observed
as the onset is so acute. Fecal droppings range from pale yellow to bloody.
Avian cholera (also sometimes called fowl cholera) is a disease to be
differentiated from Avian influenza. But lesions and testing can
provide that difference. Avian cholera, caused by _Pasteurella
multocida _, is not to be confused with the cholera that affects
humans, caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Fowl cholera or
avian cholera is not zoonotic and has no public health significance.
