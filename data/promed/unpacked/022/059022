13 _E. coli_ illnesses in California linked to recalled apple juice
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 6 Nov 2015, there were 13 confirmed cases of _Escherichia coli_ O111 infection being linked to unpasteurized apple juice from High Hill Ranch near Placerville, CA. An investigation by state and county health and environmental officials is continuing into the source of the problem. According to the Sacramento County Department of Health & Human Services, 11 of those sickened reside in Sacramento County, 1 lives in Yolo County, and 1 is from Contra Costa County. 1 person was hospitalized. They reportedly became ill in mid-October 2015 after buying the raw apple juice for home consumption or being served it at the ranch.

"The California Food and Drug Branch is looking into it, and basically we are also working with them, but in terms of the environmental sampling that was done, sampling of the juice, that was all done by the state," Greg Stanton, director of the El Dorado County Environmental Management Division, told Food Safety News. (Placerville is in El Dorado County.)

Ron Owens, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health, said on Fri 6 Nov 2015 that more information about the state's role in the outbreak investigation would be available next week.

On 23 Oct 2015, High Hill Ranch recalled its own brand of unpasteurized apple juice sold after 6 Oct 2015 and substituted a flash-pasteurized brand of apple juice. While an 11 Oct 2015 sample of the ranch's unpasteurized apple juice tested positive for _E. coli_, other tests of the product by the California Department of Public Health were negative.

Meanwhile, on 5 Nov 2015, the El Dorado County Health Department in Placerville released the following timeline in a fact sheet about the outbreak investigation:

- On 23 Oct 2015, according to the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services, there were at least 7 cases of _E. coli_ illness among residents of Sacramento County who consumed unpasteurized apple juice either sampled at or purchased from High Hill Ranch between 10 and 12 Oct 2015.
- On 23 Oct 2015, High Hill Ranch voluntarily discontinued the processing, sale and distribution of unpasteurized apple juice currently in stock. Unpasteurized apple juice was replaced with a flash pasteurized apple juice product produced and bottled by another local vendor.
- On 23 Oct 2015, the County of El Dorado issued a press release advising the public of a voluntary recall of unpasteurized apple juice initiated by High Hill Ranch due to suspected contamination with bacteria, likely a strain of _E. coli_. Consumers were advised not to consume unpasteurized apple juice purchased on or after 6 Oct 2015, and to dispose of any remaining product.
- On 29 Oct 2015, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) notified the county that there were 13 ill patients associated with the consumption of unpasteurized apple juice from High Hill Ranch. 3 of these patients were laboratory confirmed with _E. coli_ 0111. 2 additional patients were subsequently confirmed to have _E. coli_ 0111.
- On 30 Oct 2015, High Hill Ranch notified the county that they had submitted samples of unpasteurized apple juice to an independent laboratory for testing for _E. coli_ 0111. The juice samples tested were from a separate and subsequent production run after the suspected processing period that may have contained harmful bacteria.
- On 4 Nov 2015, the county was notified by the CDPH that a sample of unpasteurized juice obtained from 1 of the ill Sacramento County patients had tested positive for _E. coli_ 0111.
- On 5 Nov 2015, the county was notified by the CDPH that all laboratory samples collected from High Hill Ranch on 21 Oct 2015, by CDPH were negative for the presence of _E. coli_ 0111.

High Hill Ranch has voluntarily discontinued the production and sale of unpasteurized apple juice indefinitely. No other High Hill Ranch products are being investigated. High Hill Ranch continues to fully cooperate with local and state health officials during this ongoing investigation."

[Although fruit juices, such as apple juice and orange juice, do not have the same relationship with cattle that milk does, contamination can occur, especially in the field -- which can be best dealt with by pasteurization of the products. - Mod.LL
