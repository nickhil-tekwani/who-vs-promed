5 million Ugandans face risk of sleeping sickness
-------------------------------------------
Tsetse flies have spread to 70 percent of the territory of Uganda, putting
5.1 million people at risk of catching sleeping sickness.
This was revealed on Monday by Minister of State for Animal Industry Mary
Mugenyi when she was opening a one-day sensitization workshop for district
leaders in Kampala, according to a report from the Monitor newspaper on
Tuesday.
Mugenyi said in her written speech that the tsetse flies and the diseases
they cause are spreading to areas that were formerly free of such diseases,
adding that sleeping sickness and nagana were spreading to Kumi, Soroti,
and Kaberamaido districts in eastern part of the country, where they had
not been known before.
The disease is fatal if it is untreated and causes abortions, sterility,
and other gynecological problems among women, she said.
She said 40 percent of cattle in Uganda risk catching nagana, adding that
the government is fighting the disease, but it is being hampered by lack of
enough money.

[The trypanosomes that cause tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis (sleeping
sickness) in man, _T brucei rhodesiense_ and _T brucei gambiense_ , closely
resemble _T brucei brucei_ from animals; the animal isolates of _T brucei_
are lysed by human serum.
Nagana, the related complex in cattle, has occurred over enormous areas
estimated to be as great as one quarter of the African continent. The
disease is fatal to horses, mules, camels, and dogs. Cattle, sheep, and
goats usually survive, except when parasitized by certain strains. Many of
the wild ungulates native to Africa show no evidence of harm. - Mod.AS]
[As mentioned in a prior posting (Trypanosomiasis - Uganda (03)
20010826.2029), it is now well recognized that the human illness due to
trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) has a reservoir in wild and domestic
animals (see Fevre EM, Coleman PG, Odiit M, Magona JW, Welburn SC,
Woolhouse MEJ. The origins of a new Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping
sickness outbreak in eastern Uganda, Lancet 25 Aug 2001. 358: 9282 online
at:
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol358/iss9282/full/llan.358.9282.original_research.17371.1>)
The authors conclude: "Public health measures directed at controlling the
infection in the animal reservoir should be considered to prevent the
spread of sleeping sickness." The identification of the vector, the tsetse
fly, in 70 percent of districts in the country, along with the now
documented spread of nagana in livestock, is of significant concern for
spread of disease in humans. - Mod.MPP]
