European health officials have reported a typhoid outbreak that has sickened at least 4 people since the summer that has been linked to the European Rainbow gathering that took place in Tramonti di Sopra, Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, Italy, from [23 Jul 2017 to 21 Aug 2017].

To date, French authorities have reported 3 cases and Germany has reported 1 case. European authorities say additional cases are possibly associated with this event.

Typhoid fever, a rare disease in Europe, is a life-threatening bacterial infection caused by the bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. _S._ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed _S. _ Typhi in their feces.

You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding the organism or if sewage contaminated with the bacterium gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.

Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials, and persons given therapy usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, often has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more common types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the frequently high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm [0.78 in] in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

A number of enteric infections are known to be at higher risk related to MSM sexual behavior, such as hepatitis A but there are certainly others including giardiasis and typhoid. - Mod.LL
