CLINICAL HISTORY: A 57-year old Indonesian woman from East Java was seen at
the CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center in Kathmandu, Nepal on 3 Sep 1999
with 4 days of high fevers and 2 days of mental confusion. She came to Nepal
on 10 June 1999 with her daughter and son-in-law and stayed in the heart of
Kathmandu at a 5 star hotel without any trips to rural areas or to the
Terai, a known Japanese encephalitis [JE-endemic area. Her travel history
included a trip to Australia 18 months prior to arrival in Nepal. She had
received no immunization for JE virus and was taking ciprofloxacin for 2
days when seen at the clinic. Her past medical history was significant for a
history of previous dengue infections. Her clinical presentation was
consistent with encephalitis.
Acute serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained. CSF showed 35 WBC's
with 75% polymorphs and 25% lymphocytes, RBC's - 6, CSF protein was 100mg/dl
with 63 mg/dl of glucose. The patient was medically evacuated to Bangkok,
Thailand where convalescent sera and CSF were obtained. She recovered and
was discharged to home with a clinical diagnosis of mild encephalitis.
LABORATORY: Acute and convalescent sera and CSF were sent for analysis to
the Department of Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical
Sciences (AFRIMS) in Bangkok, Thailand. An anti-dengue, anti-JE IgM/IgG
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed with the following results (EIA
Units):
Dengue IgM*Dengue IgG*JE IgM*JE IgG
acute sera 0 * 8 * 4 * 9
acute CSF 0 * 73 * 20 * 59
convalescent sera 11 * 120 * 17 * 56
convalescent CSF 8 * 185 * 55 * 161
Based on these results she was given a tentative diagnosis of JE infection
and probable JE encephalitis. Because of the lack of IgM response there
was concern that another flavivirus might have been causing the infection.
HAI [hemagglutionation-inhibition was then performed against all 4 dengue
serotypes, JE, and West Nile viruses with the following results (HAI,
reciprocal titer):
den-1*den-2*den-3*den-4*JE*West Nile
acute serum 20*20*80*80*40*>10,240
convalescent serum 320*160*640*640*320*>10,240
Pending are viral isolation and HAI to Kunjin virus. Further laboratory work
will be done to confirm the etiology of this patient's illness.
DISCUSSION: Japanese encephalitis has been demonstrated to be endemic in
parts of Nepal close to the Indian border. JE has recently been found to
have occurred in Kathmandu in the local population but to date, no
travelers or expatriates have been reported with this disease. West Nile or
other flaviviruses in the JE complex have also not been described in Nepal
to date. If this patient is proven to have been infected with West Nile
virus, it will be the first case of WN encephalitis described in Nepal.
