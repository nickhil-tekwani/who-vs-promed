USA: Southeast Michigan Has Had 20 outbreaks
--------------------------------------------
Norovirus, a potent gastrointestinal virus that caused thousands of cruise
ship passengers to fall ill in 2002, is making its way through southeast
Michigan, local health officials said. Southeast Michigan has seen 20
outbreaks of norovirus infection. Most of the outbreaks have been in
institutional settings such as nursing homes and correctional facilities
where people are in close contact with one another. But local health care
workers said on Fri 24 Jan 2003 that it seems more widespread than ever.
The increase echoes what health officials are seeing nationwide. Federal
officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
announced on Thu 23 Jan 2003 that noroviruses appear to be on the rise in
the United States. The CDC also reported that about 41 percent of the
samples of noroviruses tested last year were from the same strain, marking
the first emergence of a predominant strain since 1994 [see ProMED-mail post
archived as: "Norovirus activity 2002 - USA 20030123.0206"].
Rebecca Cook, a supervisor with the Livingston County Health Department,
said that although there have been no confirmed outbreaks in Livingston
County, she has heard of sporadic cases. In Washtenaw County, however, there
have been 3 outbreaks since November 2002, county epidemiologist Laura
Bauman said. The current strain in Washtenaw County, called the "Farmington
Hills strain" because it was identified there in April 2002, has been
particularly prevalent. According to the CDC, that suggests the Farmington
Hills strain might spread more readily than other strains. "That strain has
just been dominant across a lot of the country," Bauman said. "What's
unusual is usually we see more variety (of strains) than that."
Noroviruses are typically spread through sharing food, water, or eating
utensils with infected people or ingesting contaminated foods or beverages.
The viruses cause violent vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain, often for 24
to 48 hours, but they are not life-threatening. Named for the Ohio town
where the virus first surfaced in 1968, Norwalk was little known to the
general public until the series of outbreaks on cruise ships put it under a
national spotlight. The virus also been called the "winter vomiting disease
virus." But noroviruses do not have a seasonal nature, said Dr. Mark
Fendrick, an associate professor in the University of Michigan Department of
Internal Medicine. However, they might be transmitted more easily in cold
winter months when people spend more time indoors, he said.
Verifying noroviruses as the cause of an illness requires a molecular test
that can be performed only at state laboratories, so county health
departments test only during an outbreak, local officials said. Michigan
also does not keep records on noroviruses because federal law does not
require it. The CDC reports, however, that there are an estimated 23 million
cases of this virus infection each year. Health officials across the nation
believe they saw more than usual in 2002, but just how many isn't known.
"There is a genuine feeling that clearly we are seeing a lot more than we
expect," said Dr. Marc-Alain Widdowson, a CDC medical epidemiologist. The
CDC did document multiple outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes in
Vancouver (Washington state), New Hampshire and New York City, in addition
to the outbreaks aboard the cruise ships. The agency investigated more than
20 outbreaks on cruise lines in 2002, more than it saw during the 4 previous
years combined.

[Viruses similar to the Farmington Hills strain were identified earlier than
stated above. During the period from 1995 to 1997, surveillance data
suggested the emergence of a globally common strain that accounted for 55
percent of all norovirus outbreaks investigated by CDC at that time (Noel
JS, Fankhauser RL, Ando T, Monroe SS, Glass RI. Identification of a distinct
common strain of "Norwalk-like viruses" having a global distribution. J
Infect Dis 1999;179:1334--44). This "common strain" of 1995 to 1997, like
the Farmington Hills strain, is classified as a GII/4 strain. Such strains
have been associated previously with outbreaks in closed settings, and it is
possible that this GII/4 predominant strain of norovirus has characteristics
of infection that increase person-to-person transmissibility, such as an
increased prevalence of vomiting. - Mod.CP]

Scotland: Outbreaks of Undefined Illness Affect Schools in Aberdeen Area
-------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of Scots schoolchildren have been struck down by [outbreaks of
undefined illness]. Teachers fear the virus [infection] is reaching epidemic
proportions with more than 700 children developing flu-like symptoms in the
last 2 weeks in the Aberdeen area alone. At Kincorth Academy in Aberdeen,
225 children have phoned in sick in the past 2 weeks.
Headteacher Hugh Bryce, said: "We have never seen anything like this -- the
[virus] is spreading like wildfire. "About 30 percent of the pupils have
been off within the past 2 weeks and it just seems to be getting worse."
Teaching staff have also been struck down with the virus, and dozens of
supply teachers have had to be drafted into schools to provide cover.
Assistant Head Jenny Cranna at the city's Torry Academy, which has had up to
70 children a day missing, said: "It is difficult to find supply teachers
when everyone is looking for the same thing for the same reasons. "There
have been some classes which are almost empty. A lot of pupils have come to
school, but have had to be sent home because they are too ill."

[In this area, and elsewhere, many schools are dependent on supply teachers
(called substitute teachers in the US) for maintenance of their normal
commitments throughout the year. The relative availability of supply
teachers is a novel epidemiological index. It can be presumed that the
"flu-like" symptoms may be indicative of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis
in the absence of evidence of influenza virus infection in the area. -
