In Maricopa County and across the state, 2 diseases -- West Nile [fever] virus and a little-known disease called St. Louis encephalitis -- are creating a health scare. The diseases are very similar in terms of symptoms, and both come from mosquitoes.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine said it's unusual to have these 2 outbreaks at the same time. "We don't know exactly why they're happening at the same time," she said. "We've never seen that before."

So far, 46 cases of West Nile have been reported statewide, including 3 deaths. At the same time, 12 cases and one possible death from St. Louis encephalitis have been reported.

Health officials say it's extremely rare for both diseases to spread at the same time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating to determine why it's happening.

"It may have something to do with the amount of rain we have had and the level of general water that is around for for mosquitoes to breed," Sunenshine.

The best way to protect yourself, according to Sunenshine, is to get rid of standing water around your home. Standing water is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Experts also recommend that you wear clothes with long sleeves and long legs and use bug spray [repellant].

[These are the 1st cases of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection in Arizona that ProMED-mail has posted since 2003, which were also in Maricopa County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20031015.2601). Biologically, it is not surprising that both West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses are being transmitted in Arizona. Although no mosquito information is provided in the above report, the same species of _Culex_ mosquitoes is the vector of both. When West Nile virus 1st arrived in the USA in 1999, it was speculated that it would not become established in areas endemic for St. Louis encephalitis virus in the southern USA states, because they are antigenically very similar, being in the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses, and wild bird hosts would already be immune. This hypothesis proved not to be the case, and the current outbreak in Arizona further illustrates that. Although the southwestern states of the USA are experiencing a drought, it is obviously not so severe in Arizona that vector mosquito populations are significantly decreased enough to prevent virus transmission. Since clinical disease represents a small fraction of individuals who are infected with either virus, there are almost certainly many more infected people than are reported above.

ProMED thanks Caitlin Rivers for submitting this report.
