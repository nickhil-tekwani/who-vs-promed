KENYA: Livestock vaccination stems spread of RVF
-----------------------------------------------
An ongoing livestock vaccination campaign against an outbreak of Rift
Valley Fever (RVF) has stemmed the spread of the disease in Kenya,
where the mosquito-borne illness, which affects both animals and
humans, has killed 154 people since December 2006, officials said on
Tuesday [6 Mar 2007].
"We have not received any new (livestock) cases, although our
extension officers are still carrying out surveillance in the
affected districts," said William Maritim, senior veterinary officer
with the disease control unit of the Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries.
At least 1.5 million livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) are
targeted for vaccination in the ongoing campaign in 33 districts
where RVF cases have been reported. The worst affected districts were
Garissa, Ijara and Wajir in Northeastern Province, Tana River and
Kilifi districts in Coast Province, and Kirinyaga and Maragwa
districts in Central Province.
"We are also in the process of procuring an additional 750 000 doses
of vaccine to sustain the exercise," Maritim said.
The vaccination project, which began in Garissa on 8 Jan 2007, is
moving towards the Rift Valley Province, where the disease was 1st
reported in 1931. RVF causes spontaneous abortions and death in
animals.
Most of the vaccines have been imported from South Africa, at
approximately USD 0.37 a dose.
The RVF virus is spread to humans from livestock via the aedes
mosquito, which breeds rapidly during floods [and by direct contact
of humans with infected animal tissues - Mod.AS]. The Northeastern
Province, inhabited by nomadic pastoralists, was hit by devastating
floods in the last 3 months of 2006 after heavier than normal
rainfall.
It can be transmitted through contact with infected animal material,
such as blood or other body fluids, or organs. Consumption of milk, a
staple for many pastoral people, is also thought to lead to
infection. Symptoms in humans include bleeding through the nose and
mouth and liver failure.
The government imposed a ban on the slaughter of livestock in the
affected areas when RVF was 1st reported, leading to the closure of
livestock markets in a region where people depend on animals for
income and food. The ban has since been lifted, but a restriction on
livestock movement is still in force.
