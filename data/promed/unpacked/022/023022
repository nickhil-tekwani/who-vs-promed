The number of children suffering from deadly hemorrhagic dengue fever
in Bago division's Min Hla township has escalated dramatically in the
past few weeks [15-26 Jul 2007], according to residents.
While it is unclear how many have been killed in the area by the
disease, local doctors told DVB that more than 10 children suffering
severe fevers were being admitted to hospital every day.
"My clinic receives about 10 children with hemorrhagic dengue fever
every day," a doctor from a private clinic in Min Hla said. "But
there are a lot of clinics like mine in town so it's difficult to
tell how many children have been suffering with the fever. Children
from the villages suffer from the disease more than children in the
cities because of the higher numbers of mosquitoes," the doctor said.
In a recent statement, Burma's Ministry of Health said that 30 of the
estimated 3000 children who suffered from hemorrhagic dengue fever in
the first half of this year [2007] died. If correct, the estimates
show that death rates from the disease are higher than in 2006.

Dengue fever downs 678 in Caraga Region
---------------------------
At least 678 persons, most of them minors, reportedly fell ill and
got confined at sentinel hospitals in 3 cities and 4 provinces of
Caraga Region, the Department of Health (DOH) Caraga Regional Office said.
Hard hit are 2 provinces and one city: Butuan City with 173 cases,
Surigao del Sur, 175 cases, and Agusan del Norte with 84 cases,
according to official records obtained from the Regional Epidemiology
and Surveillance Unit (Resu) office of the DOH regional office.
Surigao City has 38 cases of dengue, Bislig City has 18, while
Surigao del Norte has 30 cases. But the same office said they still
have to further evaluate reports on the number of deaths inflicted by
dengue, said Sheryll Plaza of the Resu office.
Plaza explained that it will be Resu Office chief Dr. Jerna May-as
Manatad who will release the data. Plaza said the reported dengue
cases are from January 2007 to 14 Jun 2007 alone.
But official records from Resu stated that from 8-14 Jun 2007 alone,
there were 13 persons who got sick because of dengue. Plaza added
that the 678 cases of dengue that were reported only come from
reports of 18 DOH sentinel hospitals in the region.

The number of dengue cases in Vietnam has soared by 40 percent this
year to 32 900, including 34 fatalities.
Experts have feared that this year [2007] could be the worst year on
record for the mosquito-borne disease as hot weather and rising
rainfall have created thriving mosquito populations.
Most cases have been reported in the country's southern Mekong Delta,
where sticky weather and large number of home water containers have
proved conducive to the insect.
The delta's Tien Giang province has seen 4800 infection cases,
including 5 deaths.
Out of Dong Thap province's 4600 infections 4 people have died while
Kien Giang's 3200 cases have included 6 deaths.
According to statistics, Viet Nam is recording 3000 new dengue
infections every week, an increase of over 33.3 percent year-on-year.
Vietnam reported over 77 800 cases of dengue fever infections last
year [2006], including 68 fatalities. The southern region accounted
for up to 84 percent of the infections and 91 percent of the deaths.

The number of confirmed dengue fever cases has increased in American
Samoa, but there have been no confirmed deaths, according to the
government-run LBJ Medical Center. Hospital legal counsel Terry
Lovelace said the center has confirmed 63 cases of dengue fever since
1 Jan 2007.
The American Samoa Department of Health said in a 10 Jul [2007] press
release that there have been 51 confirmed cases and a death
previously believed to be dengue fever was not, according to the
results of off-island tests.
Lovelace late Friday [27 Jul 2007] confirmed the Health Department
figures. He said those cases have been reported to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Lovelace said in a media advisory that for the period of 1 Jan - 17
Jul [2007], there have been 63 confirmed cases of dengue fever in
American Samoa and of those case, 23 were hospitalized: 9 children
and 15 adults.
"The remaining 40 cases were treated on an outpatient basis. We can
report there were no confirmed deaths of dengue fever during this
period," he said. "Of the 63 people who tested positive, 39 were from
the Western District and 24 were from the Eastern District. Tafuna
and Nuuuli had the most cases."
During the last dengue fever outbreak from July through October 2001,
there were 237 hospital admissions, 1646 hospital visits and 3
confirmed deaths by dengue hemorrhagic fever, he said.
Department of Health, LBJ Tropical Medical Center, Office of Samoan
Affairs, the local EPA, ASCC Land Grant and CDC are involved in
monitoring the situation and a campaign to eradicate mosquitoes is in
place, he said.
