Brazil's Health Ministry says more than 1000 people have been infected and 5 have died in a measles outbreak linked to cases imported from neighboring Venezuela. The ministry says on its website that 1053 cases of the disease have been reported so far in 2018. All but 31 of these cases have been registered in the northern jungle states of Amazonas and Roraima that share borders with Venezuela, where health services have collapsed amid political and economic turmoil. A total of 4 died in Roraima and one in Amazonas. Hardship in Venezuela has sent more than one million people fleeing to neighboring countries, sometimes bringing diseases with them.

[2] USA (New York City) 2013 outbreak

New York's largest measles outbreak in decades was caused by haredi refusal to vaccinate, a JAMA Pediatrics report said. The 2013 outbreak began when a haredi teenager visiting London returned home carrying the nearly extinct virus, which spread in Borough Park and then to Williamsburg [both in the New York City borough of Brooklyn - Mod.LL].

The virus infected 58 people between March and June 2013, 45 of whom had not been vaccinated due to "parental refusal or intentional delay". Another 12 of the patients were under the age of one year -- too young to have received the vaccination. One infected woman miscarried at 38 weeks after being infected with the disease. The JAMA reported noted that "Orthodox Jewish persons accounted for 100 per cent of the case patients."

According to WNYC, report co-author Dr Jane Zucker credited the relatively small scope of the outbreak to overall vaccination rates, noting that over 3000 were exposed to the virus. She also emphasized that "over 90 per cent of people who are not immune will get infected when they are exposed."

[Haredi Judaism is a broad spectrum of groups within Orthodox Judaism, all characterized by a rejection of modern secular culture. The report of this totally preventable cluster of measles in New York City is: Rosen JB, Arciuolo RJ, Khawja AM, et al. Public health consequences of a 2013 measles outbreak in New York City. JAMA Pediatr. 2018 Jul 30. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.1024 (Epub ahead of print). The abstract is shown below and underscores the financial burden when vaccine refusals and delays occur. - Mod.LL

Abstract
----
Importance: Internationally imported cases of measles into the United States can lead to outbreaks requiring extensive and rapid control measures. Importation of measles from an unvaccinated adolescent in 2013 led to what has been the largest outbreak of measles in New York City, New York, since 1992.
Objective: To describe the epidemiology and public health burden in terms of resources and cost of the 2013 measles outbreak in New York City.
Results: Between 13 Mar 2013 and 9 Jun 2013, 58 persons in New York City with a median age of 3 years (range, 0-32 years) were identified as having measles. Among these individuals, 45 (78 per cent) were at least 12 months old and were unvaccinated owing to parental refusal or intentional delay. Only 28 individuals (48 per cent) visited a medical health care professional who suspected measles and reported the case to the DOHMH at the initial clinical suspicion. Many case patients were not immediately placed into airborne isolation, resulting in exposures in 11 healthcare facilities. In total, 3351 exposed contacts were identified. Total direct costs to the New York City DOHMH were USD 394 448, and a total of 10 054 hours were consumed responding to and controlling the outbreak.
Conclusions and relevance: Vaccine refusals and delays appeared to have propagated a large outbreak following importation of measles into the United States. Prompt recognition of measles, along with rapid implementation of airborne isolation of individuals suspected of measles infection in healthcare facilities and timely reporting to public health agencies, may avoid large numbers of exposures. The response and containment of measles outbreaks are resource intensive.

Dubliners are being warned by the HSE [Health Service Executive; Ireland's national health service] to be extremely vigilant after it was confirmed that there had been 2 cases of measles in the capital. It was first confirmed 2 weeks ago [20 July 2018] that one adult and one child had been diagnosed, but the HSE has confirmed that there have been 4 more cases in Dublin. According to the HSE, these 4 individuals are likely to have developed measles from contact with one of the 2 earlier cases at hospitals in Dublin. The HSE is requesting people to continue to be vigilant about measles.

More than 35 people have died because of measles in Europe in 2018 according to the BBC. A spokesperson for the HSE said, "Measles is highly contagious and is spread easily. The time between exposure to measles and developing the rash is usually 14 days (range 7-21 days). People are infectious from 4 days before rash starts until 4 days after. Measles can cause chest infections, fits (seizures), ear infections, swelling of the brain and/or damage to the brain."

[4] China (Macau) ex Thailand

The Health Bureau (SSM) said in a statement Thursday, 2 Aug 2018, that it has recorded the 2nd imported case of measles this year. According to the statement, the patient is a 41 year old local man who visited Phuket with his family on 18-24 Jul [2018]. After returning to Macau, he came down with a fever on 25 Jul 2018 and a rash all over his body last Saturday, 28 Jul 2018. He went to the Island Emergency Station of the public Conde de S. Janu√°rio Hospital Centre in Taipa for treatment the next afternoon [29 Jul 2018].

He consulted a doctor at the private Kiang Wu Hospital where he was hospitalized in the morning on Monday [30 Jul 2018]. He was confirmed to have measles by the bureau's public health laboratory yesterday [2 Aug 2018], according to the statement. The statement said that the patient had never been vaccinated against measles, but he has meanwhile recovered with no major complications. The statement added that his family members have not had any similar symptoms to date.

According to the statement, the bureau suggests that parents should avoid taking babies who have not been vaccinated against measles, especially those between the ages of 6 and 12 months, out of Macau because they will not have enough antibodies to protect them against measles.

[5] North Korea -- elimination report
Date: Sun 4 Aug 2018

In a significant win against an expanding disease, North Korea was verified for eliminating measles, announced the World Health Organization (WHO) in a press release. On 2 Aug 2018, the Regional Verification Commission verified that North Korea had interrupted transmission of indigenous measles for more than 3 years. In 2014, WHO South-East Asia announced the elimination of measles by 2020 as a flagship program.

In total, more than 16 million people living in North Korea were vaccinated for measles at a cost of approximately USD 6.3 million. The North Korea vaccination campaign came in rapid response to a significant measles outbreak that began in November 2006. The 1st cases in this outbreak were initially thought to be rubella, as measles had not been reported in North Korea since 1992, said WHO.

With today's [4 Aug 2018] WHO announcements, 4 of the 11 member countries of WHO South-East Asia have now eliminated measles. WHO is the lead technical agency responsible for coordination of immunization and surveillance activities supporting all countries to achieve the 2020 goal.

"This achievement by [North Korea] demonstrates the commitment and resolve of countries in the Region towards the health of women and children, and for universal health coverage", said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia. Nearly 400 million children are planned to be vaccinated through mass campaigns with measles vaccine in 2018-2019 in the Region, said WHO. "We are moving towards a brighter and healthier future for all -- one that is free of vaccine-preventable diseases and the unnecessary death and suffering they cause," Dr Singh said.

In North Korea, measles was declared eliminated in 2006. However, a measles outbreak occurred in 2013. Most measles cases in South Korea have been associated with imported measles virus.

Current measles outbreaks are being reported throughout the EU, in South America and in various cities in the USA. In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests visitors to North Korea ensure various immunizations are verified, including measles.

[Measles seems to be making a major comeback worldwide in both developed and developing countries. Under-vaccination through unavailability or anti-vaccination choices contributes to the rise of cases of this potentially fatal viral disease that can cause encephalitis or pneumonia and have bacterial superinfections as a contribution. An excellent recent review on measles is: Moss WJ. Measles. Lancet 2017;390:2490-2502. The article's abstract follows. - Mod.LL

Abstract
----
Measles is a highly contagious disease that results from infection with measles virus and is still responsible for more than 100 000 deaths every year, down from more than 2 million deaths annually before the introduction and widespread use of measles vaccine. Measles virus is transmitted by the respiratory route, and illness begins with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis followed by a characteristic rash. Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication. However, urgent efforts are needed to increase stagnating global coverage with 2 doses of measles vaccine through advocacy, education, and the strengthening of routine immunization systems. Use of combined measles-rubella vaccines provides an opportunity to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Ongoing research efforts, including the development of point-of-care diagnostics and microneedle patches, will facilitate progress towards measles elimination and eradication.]
