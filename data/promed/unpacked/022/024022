In some provinces in Syria, rabies is an increasing concern in a deteriorating political climate. This year [2013], Spana-Syria conducted a campaign of free dog vaccination at its premises in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Al Baath University, Hama, vaccinating strays as well as owned dogs.

Over 1000 animals were vaccinated. The group also raised awareness about the dangers of rabies by distributing posters and leaflets and an illustrated story for children. Professor Darem Tabbaa, Director of Spana-Syria, said that the information they distributed helped healthcare personnel, policy makers, scientists, school teachers and students, small children and villagers to be more aware of the risk of dog bites and the dangers of rabies.

[There is little doubt that rabies circulation in animals, especially dogs, is increasing in Syria, with an expected increased risk of rabies in the human population too.

Rabies in dogs seems widespread, as is apparent from information gathered on the Israeli side of the Syrian border (David D. et al. Emergence of dog rabies in the northern region of Israel. Epidemiol Infect. 2009;137:544-8).

A map of lab-confirmed rabies cases in Israel, 2012, shows that almost all rabid dogs were found close to the border with Syria http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2012.html.

The following information on rabies in dogs in Syria was found via the OIE WAHID interface (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation):

2005 - 16 outbreaks 21 dogs
2006 - 2008 no data available
2009 - 2 outbreaks, 6 dogs
2010 - 4 outbreaks, 3 cattle, 2 dogs
2011 - 7 outbreaks, 6 dogs, 6 cattle
2012 - 4 outbreaks, 9 dogs

During the 4 years of 2008-2011, 16 human cases were reported to the OIE; data for 2012 are not yet available. - Mods.AS,EP
