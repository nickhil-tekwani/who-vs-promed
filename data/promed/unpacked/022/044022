TUBERCULOSIS, HOSPITAL EXPOSURE - USA (WISCONSIN) (02)

I found an additional source of information
<http://www.madison.com/tct/news/index.php?ntid=208107>, which said,
"She was then tested and found on 20 Aug 2007 to have peritoneal TB,
a relatively uncommon form of the disease that is better known in
Africa and Asia."
The same article also noted, "Fortunately, due to effective screening
methods and treatment, there has not been a single case of TB
exposure that resulted in active disease to patients or employees in
35 years at UW Hospital." The rest of the information was redundant.
In WA State where I practice, state law dictates a two step PPD for
new hires in licensed inpatient health care facilities. I checked WI
law and unfortunately it did not require 2 step testing.
[Wisconsin law ref.] HFS 124.07(2)(c)
"(c) A Mantoux tuberculin skin test consisting of 5 tuberculin units
(TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD) and, if necessary, a chest
roentgenogram to determine whether disease is present, unless
medically contraindicated. Persons with positive findings shall be
referred to a physician for evaluation."
The employee was noted to work at both the UW hospital and the VA
hospital. The VA hospitals in the US follow OSHA regulations and not
state regulations. OHSA requires current CDC guidelines be followed,
and issued this interpretation letter in 1997 which I believe is
still in effect:
"Your second question pertains to tuberculosis skin testing and which
employees are required to be tested. OSHA's position is that
employers, in covered workplaces, shall offer Mantoux TB skin tests
(at no cost to employees) to all current potentially exposed
employees and to all new employees prior to exposure. A two-step
baseline shall be used for new employees who have an initially
negative TB skin test result and who have not had a documented
negative TB skin test result during the preceding 12 months"
(<http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=22479>).
This of course does not confirm that the particular rule was followed.
Regarding the Mod comment: "The rapid progression in hospital
employee in the above news release from latent infection acquired
less than 6-8 weeks before, or at some time after, her negative skin
test in November 2006." While the report said the woman had been ill
only a few weeks, with TB's insidious onset and patient histories
being unreliable, this may not represent rapid progression. Also,
from 6 Nov 2006 to 7 Jul 2007, (assuming onset was at least a month
before diagnosis) is 8 months not 8 weeks. So I am confused about
this Mod comment. Could you please clarify it, thank you.

[I thank Ginger Switzer for her comments. The U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention "Guidelines for Preventing the
Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities,
1994," can be found at the following site:
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00035909.htm>. These
guidelines say that healthcare workers (HCWs) who potentially are
exposured to _M. tuberculosis_, including those with a history of BCG
vaccination, should have baseline tuberculin skin testing performed
during the pre-employment physical or when applying for hospital
privileges. Tuberculin skin test-negative HCWs should undergo repeat
tuberculin skin testing at regular intervals; the frequency of
testing is determined by the risk for transmission of _M.
tuberculosis_ in the particular work area of the healthcare facility.
These guidelines address the issue of "2-step testing" to detect the
boosting phenomenon that might be misinterpreted as a skin-test
conversion: "For HCWs who have not had a documented negative PPD test
result during the preceding 12 months, the baseline PPD testing
should employ the 2-step method; this will detect boosting phenomena
that might be misinterpreted as a skin-test conversion. Decisions
concerning the use of the 2-step procedure for baseline testing in a
particular facility should be based on the frequency of boosting in
that facility." Thus the CDC guidelines leave the decision to employ
2-step testing to the discretion of the healthcare facilities, the
decision likely dependent to some degree on the prevalence of latent
tuberculosis in the local population and on local regulations.
The postulated mechanisms by which tubercle bacilli reach the
peritoneum are: (i) direct hematogenous [blood-strean] spread to the
peritoneum from a primary lung focus or (ii) spread from an
intra-abdominal site of tubercular disease, such as the intestine,
ovaries, or lymph nodes, whose source is also a primary lung focus. A
review of published single cases and case series of abdominal
tuberculosis, including peritoneal tuberculosis, reveals that the
majority of patients do not have evidence of concomitant active
pulmonary tuberculosis, the abdominal site having reactivated at some
interval of time after the primary pulmonary site healed. The
healthcare worker in the news release had concomitant active
pulmonary and peritoneal tuberculosis, which suggests uncontrolled
progression without a period of immune suppression of the tubercular
process. - Mod.ML]
