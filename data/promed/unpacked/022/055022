Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the dog was bitten at least twice
by free-roaming dogs during its stay in North Africa between 15 Nov and 19
Dec 2003.
B. Other epidemiological details: the dog's rabies vaccination had expired
and was therefore not valid when it entered European Union territory.
Control measures:
- The dog that was acknowledged to be affected, and the 2 animals that had
been in direct contact with it were euthanised.
- All persons who had been in contact with the dog since the disease was
suspected were directed to rabies centres.
- In accordance with the regulations concerning urban rabies, the districts
of Lorient (place of residence of the dog's owners and of the veterinary
surgery) and Lanester (where the animal had spent a few hours), which are
both in Morbihan department, were declared by prefectural decree to be
infected with rabies, for a period of 3 months, which led to the following
measures being adopted on the territory of these 2 districts:
- free movement of identified dogs validly vaccinated against rabies under
the direct supervision of their owners;
- dogs not validly vaccinated against rabies, and cats, even when
vaccinated, to be kept tethered or confined;
- ban on owners disposing of their dogs if they have not been vaccinated
against rabies or of their cats, even when vaccinated;
- stricter measures to control free-roaming animals;
- ban on shows and other gatherings of domestic carnivores in the zone;
- ban on the participation of domestic carnivores from the zone in shows or
gatherings outside the zone.
