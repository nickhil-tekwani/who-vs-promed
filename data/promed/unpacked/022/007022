Port Moresby: An outbreak of influenza in the Bogia district of Madang
Province has claimed 38 lives, according to reports presented to Madang
provincial health authorities. Former Madang MP Peter Barter said a team
led by Dr. Philip Kame had done an intensive report after visiting the
areas and was preparing for it to be presented to the health secretary.
Mr. Barter said he would present the report during the meeting of the
National Drought Committee this week here. He said that the most immediate
concern was acute shortages of medical supplies in all health centres and
aid-posts that were visited.
