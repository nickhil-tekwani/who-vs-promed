Background on Tick-borne Encephalitis in Sweden
------------------------------------------------
The male/female ratio is 2.1/1; and the median patient age is 41.5 years.
Disease rates peak during July to August.
A total of 1402 cases was registered during the period 1955 to 1993, with a
case/fatality rate of 0.5 percent. During this period, the disease rate in
Stockholm County was 3.4/100 000/year. 65.3 percent of cases reported
during 1992 to 1996 were acquired in Stockholm, 15.2 percent in
Sodermanland, 6 percent from Ostergotland or Gotland, and 4.9 percent from
other countries (primarily Finland). Prevalence is greatest on the East
Coast (particularly on the Stockholm archipelago), the eastern region of
Lake Malaren and the Gotland island region.
