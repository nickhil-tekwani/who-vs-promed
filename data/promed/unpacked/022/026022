[In July 2012, Croatia reported its 1st case of West Nile fever (WNF). The event was resolved on 8 Nov 2012. 11 outbreaks were reported. See detailed information and a map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012550_20121109_153739.pdf.

Based on information reported during the 2012 event, one might expect that the disease will follow a similar course.

The WAHID disease time series analysis shows that between January 2012 and July 2014, 39 outbreaks were reported to the OIE: 12 in Croatia, 25 in Greece and 2 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (http://tinyurl.com/ng79otu).

Also, in 2013, Italy reported 36 outbreaks of WNF. This information is available in their annual report (January to December 2013) submitted to the OIE: http://tinyurl.com/o8e7meh (Note: go to Section 3 of the report, "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present," to see detailed information on these events).

West Nile fever is a zoonosis (an animal disease affecting humans). People are susceptible to the disease; however, most have no symptoms. About 20 per cent have mild flu-like symptoms of fever, headaches and rashes. In rare cases it can cause encephalitis. However, less than 1 per cent of infected people will go on to develop severe symptoms. In 2007 in the United States, 121 people died due to West Nile fever (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/WNV-EN.pdf).

According to the information provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of 24 Jul 2014, no human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU. However, 17 cases have been reported in neighbouring countries since the beginning of the 2014 transmission season. During the past week, EU member states and neighbouring countries have not reported any new cases of West Nile fever in humans.

In addition, information on recent infection of West Nile virus in birds and/or mosquitoes in Italy (Parma, Brescia and Catania provinces) is available in the Bollettino Epidemiologico WND; see http://tinyurl.com/q7q437y. Additional information and a map with distribution of WNF cases by affected area is available at http://tinyurl.com/q3wf4us.
