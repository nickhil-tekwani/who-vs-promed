The Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries is warning citrus farmers and home gardeners to be on the lookout for any symptoms of citrus canker which has been declared a notifiable pest. Of concern is the international movement of the disease. Potentially, seedlings or citrus bud wood brought into the country by travellers could carry the disease.

The Ministry can test samples in their laboratory. In 2021, a survey in all eight counties of Trinidad did not detect the bacterium. A similar survey is being planned for Tobago. Vigilance must be maintained via strict border control, quarantine, and sanitary measures.

The Ministry is also alert for citrus leprosis.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (Xac; synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ (Xaa), depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus-growing areas worldwide.

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family Rutaceae. Different Xac strains can vary in host specificity, for example lime-specific strains that do not affect orange or grapefruit (ProMED post 20170920.5330396). CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches, leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bacteriocidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves, which can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry, may also be used to reduce CC incidence. Research on developing biocontrol methods is being carried out (for example, see link below).

Antibiotic sprays are used occasionally for CC management but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.

The other disease mentioned above, citrus leprosis, is caused by viruses, currently including 3 different species: cytoplasmic citrus leprosis viruses C and C2 (genus _Cilevirus_); and nuclear citrus leprosis virus N (genus _Dichorhavirus_). The viruses are spread by mite species and occur in the region (e.g. Mexico, ProMED post 20171015.5382601; for further information see previous ProMED posts in the archives).
