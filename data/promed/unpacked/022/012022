[The above summary report includes a map indicating the location of the described continuing event in west-central Egypt, remote from the densely populated Nile valley. The absence of dogs among the reported cases is remarkable; the rabies reservoir in this region might be foxes. Notably, animal rabies was not reported by Egypt to the OIE between 1990 and June 2017. - Mod.AS

The incidence of rabies in Israel has quadrupled this month [December 2017], compared to December last year [2016], breaking records and sparking fears that the outbreak could spread to humans.

Avi Tsarfati, head of the Veterinarians Association, said 16 cases of rabies were discovered during December 2017 alone, compared to 4 in December 2016, the Hebrew-language Ynet news website reported on Tuesday [26 Dec 2017].

Of the infected animals, 13 were jackals, 2 were dogs, and one was a calf.

Also this month [December 2017], a man and a woman were attacked by rabid jackals in 2 separate incidents, Tsarfati said. The infected jackals were not caught and were presumably still wandering around, infecting other animals. There are likely many more infected animals that have yet to be detected, he said.

The 16 incidents took place in the Gilboa region, the Valley of Springs in the Jordan Valley, the Jezreel Valley, Megiddo and Yokne'am, all in the north of Israel.

The incidents are "very worrying," Tsarfati said. "Every day, there are encounters between people and wild animals, and in rabies-infected areas these encounters can lead to disaster."

During a Knesset Economic Affairs Committee discussion of the issue on Monday [25 Dec 2017], Oved Nur, head of the Gilboa Regional Council, warned the committee that human lives were in danger.

"Everyone's saying it's an emergency, but nobody is doing what one does in an emergency," he said. "We're at a breaking point. We don't have enough staff, and we urgently need additional funds."

Nur expressed concern that stray cats could be infected. Whereas those bitten by a jackal are likely to seek medical attention, people are less concerned by a cat scratch and don't get treatment, increasing the danger that the victim will develop rabies, he said.

Shlomo Garazi, [acting] director of the veterinary services at the Agriculture Ministry, said the issue falls under the responsibility of several authorities, including local authorities, the Israel Nature and Parks Association, the Health Ministry, and veterinarians.

"We are working on a few levels," Garazi said, according to the Hebrew-language Walla website. "We are raising the vaccination coverage by scattering oral vaccinations from the air, encouraging vaccinations of house pets and of cattle and sheep."

Boris Jacobson, director of the rabies laboratory at the Agriculture Ministry, said the outbreak has been brought to Israel from Jordan by animals that cross the border. "We are making an effort to [prevent its] spillover to dogs and cats," he told the committee.

Representatives from local authorities told the lawmakers the outbreak was impacting the quality of life of local residents, who are afraid to leave their homes for fear of encountering a diseased animal.

Since the beginning of the year [2017], there were 68 identified cases of rabies, while in 2016 just 29, the Walla report said [In the meantime, Israel's Veterinary Services have reported 2 additional rabid jackals, lab confirmed on 26 Dec 2017. - Mod.AS].

[Following its meeting, the Knesset's Economic Committee issued a press release (available, in Hebrew, at http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/committees/Economics/News/Pages/pr_2512172.aspx).

The annual operation of rabies vaccine baits dispersion started in early November 2017, covering the entire territory of Israel and of the Palestinian authority. We are informed from professional sources that the number of vaccine baits, disseminated this season, has been significantly increased to face the current density of the jackal population. According to the said source, it was expected that within 2 weeks after the completion of the operation, young, hitherto unvaccinated jackals will become immune, and the number of new rabies cases is expected to fall. If all goes well, this decline is expected to become factual in early 2018; the further evolution of this unusual event will be followed with interest; lessons might be useful for other countries in applying oral wildlife vaccination. In this context, the following comment has been received from Merritt Clifton:

"Jackals are basically the Eurasian variant of the same animal known in the Americas as the coyote, with almost identical behaviors, habitat preferences, etc., at least to the extent of my observation in quite a few places."
