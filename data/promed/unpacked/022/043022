Update. Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (6 May 2009)
Epidemiological Alerts 6(22)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 6 May 2009, the total of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1)
recorded is 1761 including 31 deaths, in 7 countries of the Americas
(Mexico, United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, El Salvador,
and Guatemala).

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 642 human cases
of influenza A (H1N1) in 41 States: 4 in Alabama, 48 in Arizona, 67
in California, 17 in Colorado, 4 in Connecticut, 33 in Delaware, 5 in
Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in Hawaii, 1 in Idaho, 122 in Illinois, 15
in Indiana, 1 in Iowa, 2 in Kansas, 2 in Kentucky, 7 in Louisiana, 1
in Maine, 4 in Maryland, 45 in Massachusetts, 8 in Michigan, 1 in
Minnesota, 2 in Missouri, 4 in Nebraska, 5 in Nevada, 2 in New
Hampshire, 7 in New Jersey, 3 in New Mexico, 97 in New York, 7 in
North Carolina, 5 in Ohio, 1 in Oklahoma, 15 in Oregon, 1 in
Pennsylvania, 2 in Rhode Island, 16 in South Carolina, 2 in
Tennessee, 61 in Texas, 1 in Utah, 3 in Virginia, 9 in Washington,
and 6 in Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are being investigated. 2
deaths have been registered in Texas.

From [17 Apr 2009 to 5 May 2009], Mexico has reported 949 confirmed
cases of influenza A (H1N1), including 31 deaths. The states with the
highest number of confirmed cases are Distrito Federal, Estado de
Mexico, San Luis Potosi, and Hidalgo. The majority of these have
occurred in previously healthy young adult people. 12 percent of the
confirmed cases have been in children under 5 years old and 71
percent of the confirmed cases in persons under 30 years old.

In Canada, to date 165 human cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been
confirmed (26 in Alberta, 46 in British Columbia, 2 in New Brunswick,
48 in Nova Scotia, 4 in Quebec, 1 in Manitoba, 36 in Ontario, and 2
in Prince Edward Island), some of them with recent travel history to
Cancun, Mexico. All the cases developed a mild form of influenza-like
illness. Some of the cases presented, in addition, gastrointestinal
symptoms. Indigenous transmission is not discarded since not all the
confirmed cases have trip history to Mexico.

On [2 May 2009], Costa Rica notified 1 confirmed case of influenza A
(H1N1). On [3 May 2009], Colombia reported 1 confirmed case of
influenza A (H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1). On [5 May 2009], Guatemala notified 1 confirmed
case of influenza A (H1N1) in a person that has travelled to Mexico.

Various countries of the Region are reporting suspected and probable
cases. This indicates that surveillance enhancement is producing results.

[The document above also has graphs with predictive modeling of the
outbreak as well as an epidemic curve for confirmed cases and is
definitely worth reviewing. It clearly highlights that in April 2009
there were more cases of severe pneumonia in ages 15-54 than in the
past 3 Aprils (2006, 2007, 2008) and in February of 2009 --
highlighting the impact of the H1N1 circulation. Similarly, the
comparative graphing highlights how the 20-49 year old group had
unusually high P & I (pneumonia and influenza) associated mortality
during the H1N1 outbreak (during the month of April 2009 when
compared with April 2006, 2007, and 2008). - Mod.MPP]

[To summarize the current situation, as of 6 May 2009 there have been
a total of 1893 cases and 31 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection
officially reported to WHO/PAHO coming from 23 countries, up from
1490 confirmed cases and 30 deaths from 21 countries yesterday (5 May
2009). Newly added countries include Sweden and Guatemala.

The USA has officially reported 642 laboratory confirmed cases from
41 states (compared with 403 cases from 38 states on 5 May 2009), and
2 deaths (one in a Mexican child visiting in the USA and a 2nd in a
resident of Texas with known pre-existing illness). Canada has
reported 201 cases from 8 provinces with no deaths, up from 165 cases
from 8 provinces on 5 May 2009. Mexico has reported 1112 confirmed
cases with 42 deaths (compared with 866 cases and 26 deaths on 4 May 2009.

Continued analysis of the information related to fatalities
highlights that the 20-29 year old age group is disproportionally
represented among the fatalities. Results of further studies on the
fatal cases are not presently available to permit a better
understanding of what may have transpired in Mexico.
