["The country situation is quite stable. The outbreaks in the formerly free zones did not provide positivity in [wild boar], both hunted and dead ones. In the affected zones, it is quite high instead in the dead [wild boar] (almost 26 percent), very low in the hunted (0.1 percent). Different is the situation in the case of the domestic population, as positivity has been detected in previously free zones in backyard farms and also in commercial and backyard farm in areas which were previously affected."
