Following the increase of Q fever cases in humans reported in 2008 and
in particular in the last months of 2009 in some EU Member States, the
European Commission asked EFSA to provide urgent scientific advice to
inform possible EU risk management measures in this area.

EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) will lead the work
with the support of the Biological Hazard Panel (BIOHAZ) and in close
collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC).

A scientific opinion is expected by the end of April 2010. The Panel
will look at the occurrence and spread of Q-fever in farm animals and
humans across the EU, assess the risk factors related to the disease,
as well as evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of disease
control options. These may include vaccination, animal movement and
biosecurity restrictions and pharmaceutical treatments.

In the context of their work on gathering and sharing information on
zoonoses in different EU Member States, EFSA and ECDC collected data
on occurrence of Q fever in animals and humans. The information is
published in the Annual Community Summary Report on Zoonoses and
Food-borne outbreaks for 2008.

The report gives an overview of zoonotic infections shared by humans
and animals and disease outbreaks caused by consuming contaminated
food, based on data provided by Member States.

The report also identifies Q fever cases in humans and animals
(cattle, sheep and goats) notified in the EU. It highlights that the
number of reported cases in humans has increased in 2008, with 1594
cases compared to 585 in 2007. In animals, the highest infection rates
were reported in goats, increasing from 9.7 percent in 2007 to 15.7
percent in 2008.

[The Community Summary Report on trends and sources of zoonoses,
zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union in
2008: <http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/1496.htm>]

EFSA is inviting Member States to provide the latest information on
the occurrence of Q fever in animals in their respective countries.

EFSA will also issue in spring 2010 guidance for Member States on
monitoring and reporting of Q fever in animals.

Directive 2009/99/EC on the monitoring of zoonotic agents requires EU
Member States to monitor and report on cases of Q fever in animals
warranted by the epidemiological situation. Furthermore, Commission
Decision 2000/96/EC, as amended by Decision 2003/534/EC, lists Q fever
in humans as a communicable disease to be monitored and controlled in
the EU.

In 2007, 18 Member States [MSs] and in 2008, 17 MSs and 2 non-MSs
provided information about _C. burnetii_ in animals [See Table QF1 at
the above source URL.]. The majority of samples were [collected] due
to clinical suspicion or after abortion and were examined using
serological tests; most of the samples originated from cattle (Table
QF3).

The proportion of positive cattle samples was 7.4 percent in 2007 and
10.0 percent in 2008. Poland reported the highest increase in positive
cases from 2.2 percent in 2007 to 40.1 percent in 2008, whereas
Belgium reported a large decrease from 33.2 percent to 8.0 percent in
2008. However, the results do not necessarily reflect the situation in
MSs, since most data originate from sampling based on suspicion. In
goats, the proportion of positive samples increased from 9.7 percent
in 2007 to 15.7 percent in 2008. All MSs providing data from both
years reported more positive samples in 2008 compared to 2007 in
goats; and the Netherlands reported a 3-fold increase in 2008.
Furthermore, the Netherlands also reported an increase of positive
samples from 0 to 10.1 percent in sheep. Denmark was the only MS to
provide information at herd level for both years, with prevalence
around 50 percent, which is by far the highest level in the EU. During
the last couple of years, Denmark has focu!
sed especially on the sampling of animals suspected of being infected
with _C. burnetii_. This fact may, in part, explain the high number of
positive findings.

Additionally, in 2008, Germany, Italy, Slovakia and Switzerland
analysed samples from buffalo, dogs, solipeds [equine animals], and
water buffalo; one German sample from a soliped was positive. For
additional information on data, please refer to Level 3 tables.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality organises in
February 2010 an international conference on Q fever cooperatively
with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

This was written by Minister [of Agriculture] Gerda Verburg to the
Parliament. Minister Verburg has requested to include Q fever in the
agenda of the due February 2010 meeting of the Council of the European
Union (Agriculture and Fisheries), where she will request attention to
the status of Q fever on the European level.

[The conference is to be held on 25 and 26 Feb 2010 in Breda, south
Netherlands under the title "One Health in relation to Q-fever, in
humans and animals". Reportedly, the purpose of the conference is to
collect and discuss information and experience from those countries
around the world which have experienced Q-fever outbreaks themselves.
The plenary session is planned to include contributions from a number
of scientists from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Hungary and the
Netherlands, as well as presentations of EFSA and ECDC. The following

The international farmers organisation IFAP [International Federation
of Agricultural Producers] has requested the World Animal Health
Organisation's (OIE) support in relation to the Q fever issue.

David King, General Secretary of IFAP sent a letter requesting OIE's
help in obtaining replies to the many questions concerning Q fever.
IFAP acted upon a request from LTO Netherlands (the Dutch Organisation
for Agriculture and Horticulture).

IFAP stated that there is no international protocol for the control of
Q fever. The disease is not included in the worldwide recognised and
valid animal health code of the OIE. IFAP declares, inter alia, that
there is need for an affordable and reliable disease detection method
[See commentary.].

[Q fever is included in OIE's list of (notifiable) diseases (under
"Multiple species diseases"). However, as stated by IFAP, OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which includes recommendations
applicable to OIE listed diseases and other diseases of importance to
international trade, does not include a chapter on Q fever. This is
probably due to the fact that Q fever has been regarded as endemic in
most countries and was not regarded of significance for international
trade. This attitude may have to be reviewed in view of the rather
unusual recent developments in the Netherlands.

On the other hand, OIE's "Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals" includes chapter 2.1.12 "Q fever" (12 pages),
which covers the issues of Diagnostic techniques (Identification of
the agent, serological tests), and Requirements for vaccines and
diagnostic biologicals; available on-line at
