[1] Cholera - Myanmar-China border displaced persons' camps

Children and elderly people in Kachin refugee camps along the Sino-Burmese border have contracted cholera because of unsafe drinking water, according to workers with the Relief Action Network for IDP and Refugees (Ranir). More than 30 children have contracted cholera and one child has died of the disease at the Pajau Refugee Camp, Ranir said.

A total of 3 refugee camps in Mansi Township and the Pajau Camp in Waimaw Township in Kachin State are all experiencing a lack of sanitary drinking water, Ranir official La Rip told Mizzima. The camps are located in mountainous areas making access to clean drinking water and toilet facilities difficult.

In China, the Ruili District adjacent to Kachin State has also experienced a cholera outbreak, according to the Wunpawng Ning Htoi group (People's Light), which works to provide food and medicine to Kachin refugees. No estimates of how many cases have occurred were available.

May Li Aung, a worker with the Wunpawng Ning Htoi, told Mizzima that drinking water is unsafe and there are few sanitary toilets in the mountainous areas. Workers said the refugee camps near towns have enough water and sanitary toilets.

According to the Kachin refugees' relief committee, there are 19 refugee camps in China for Kachin war refugees. In Kachin State, more than 40 refugee camps are located in townships including Laiza, Mansi, Mai Ja Yang, Lweje Waimaw and Manwingyi, with up to an estimated 44 000 people living in the camps.

The camps are operated by the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). Burmese citizens inside and outside the country, local and foreign aid groups, religious organizations and social organizations have donated food and medicine to the camps, according to Dwe P Sar, a refugee worker. However, large international groups have not been allowed access to the area by the government to assess the conditions and the needs. Relief supplies including food, shelter, bedding, clothes, tents and medicine are badly needed, say aid workers.

[2] Diarrhea, displaced persons - Cambodia (Kandal province)

Hundreds of evicted Borei Keila [a large poor urban community in Phnom Penh] residents living at a relocation site in Kandal province are suffering from diarrhea, as well as skin ailments and fever after consecutive days of rain, an NGO doctor said yesterday [31 Jan 2012].

Dr Nhean Sarin, a medical officer with rights group Licadho, told the Post yesterday [31 Jan 2012] that Borei Keila residents relocated to Ponhear Leu district's Srah Po village in early January [2012] were also at more risk of catching malaria and cholera.

"The raining over a few consecutive days caused them to develop fever, chills, and diarrhea due to them having inadequate sleep because their plastic, no-wall tents cannot stand the rain," he said, adding that many were also suffering from a shortage of food.

Cholera cases have soared in the Democratic Republic of Congo in recent weeks, the UN said on Friday, 27 Jan 2012, bringing the number of people infected in the year-long outbreak to 22 000 with 584 deaths. Aid agencies have been trying to halt the spread of the water-borne disease that has ravaged 8 of the country's 11 provinces since January 2011.

"There has been a spike in cases" since mid-December 2011, with figures on the rise in the capital Kinshasa in particular, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. Cholera, a contagious intestinal infection, has taken its heaviest toll on eastern regions however, with a quarter of all cases reported in Sud-Kivu province.

[5] Shigellosis - USA (Kentucky)

Shigellosis [dysentery] cases continue to rise in Louisville, with 18 laboratory-confirmed cases last week. That's the highest number in any week so far during the current outbreak, which has seen 84 confirmed cases in 13 weeks.

Shigellosis is a highly-contagious diarrhea illness caused by _Shigella_ bacteria. Symptoms include watery or loose stools for several days, and in severe cases abrupt onset of fever, nausea, abdominal cramping and vomiting. For the past 5 years, Louisville has had an average of 62 confirmed cases annually.

To prevent the illness, health officials are urging people to wash their hands carefully with soap and water, including under the fingernails. This is especially important after handling items such as diapers, after each bowel movement, after helping children use the toilet and before preparing or eating food, health officials said.
