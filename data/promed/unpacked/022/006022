Anthrax epidemic in Uvalde, Kinney, Real and Edwards Counties, Texas
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From discussions with ranchers and veterinarians in west Texas it is clear
that this outbreak has reached epidemic status within this 4 county area. I
have been informed of specific outbreaks affecting livestock and deer in
Comstock to the west, Carta Valley in the north, to 15 miles west of Rock
Springs, and at Camp Wood, Montell, and near Brackettville. Some affected
ranches have not had anthrax previously, or so it is claimed, indicating a
possible eastern spread beyond the usual endemic areas.
Deaths were first noted in cattle, horses, and bison, and latterly occurred
in white-tail deer and other domestic and exotic browser species. Many
affected animals are demonstrating severe subcutaneous edema, especially in
dependent parts; this differs from the 1997 series when it seemed to start
in deer and many were found dead without obvious external lesions or
swellings. There are excessive numbers of tabanids (horse flies, locally
known as "charbon flies") bothering all stock.
Browsers usually get infected by eating leaves where blow flies, after
feeding on an affected carcass, have landed and deposited spores in their
vomit and feces while grooming themselves.
At this time I am informed of one human case with a severe cutaneous lesion
to his arm. He apparently got infected while skinning a dead plains bison
on a ranch that had already suffered 5 horse deaths and sundry deer & elk
deaths. While skinning the bison he was bitten by a horse fly. The lesion
is at the site of the fly bite. Infection could have been either from the
horse fly or by scratching the bite site with bloody fingers or both. On
seeing his physician he was prescribed oral antibiotics but it is unclear
whether he promptly took the full dose as prescribed. He is currently in
hospital with a typical black eschar and radiating small vesicles.
A number of ranchers are attempting to orally vaccinate their deer using
Sterne vaccine mixed in karo syrup and cracked corn. The value of this is
uncertain.
At this time I have had no reports of anthrax in the Laredo area -- another
area in Texas with endemic wildlife anthrax.
