Following last year's West Nile virus outbreak in New York City and
surrounding counties in September, Health Canada's Travel Medicine Program
has been closely monitoring West Nile virus activity in the States of New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New
Hampshire. This year, the West Nile virus has been detected in dead birds
and mosquitoes in a number of counties in these states and in one dead
horse on Staten Island. To date, 8 human cases have been confirmed: 6 cases
on Staten Island, New York City, one case in Brooklyn, New York City and
one case in Jersey City, New Jersey. In these cases, there are 6
individuals age 61 or older, one 52-year-old individual and one 43-year-old
individual. One person is in hospital, and 7 people are recovering at home.
Although infected dead birds and/or positive mosquito pools have been
reported by a number of counties in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, it is likely that the virus
is now more widespread in those States than the reports suggest. _Culex
pipiens_, _Culex restuans_ and _Culex salinarius_ mosquitoes, which are
dusk-to-dawn biters, and _Aedes japonicus_ and _Aedes triseriatus_
mosquitoes, which are daytime biters, have been shown to be infected.
In spite of active surveillance, West Nile virus has not been detected in
Canada to date. It is difficult to predict whether the virus will move into
northern ecologies in Canada where appropriate mosquitoes are
well-established. Nevertheless, Health Canada and provincial, territorial
and municipal authorities have implemented surveillance programs to
identify the presence of West Nile virus in dead birds, sentinel chickens
and mosquitos before disease is detected in humans. At this time, provinces
bordering areas in the United States where infected dead birds have been
found are intensifying surveillance.

On 11 Sep 2000, the State of Connecticut announced 2 additional crows from
2 new towns as testing positive for West Nile virus. They were collected
between 24-28 Aug 2000 from Orange and Suffield. To date, 245 birds have
tested positive for West Nile virus this year, 241 crows and two robins,
one dove, one bluejay, in 41 communities over six counties.

The New York City Health Department announced this morning that evidence of
West Nile virus has been confirmed by the New York State Department of
Health in 3 new birds and 7 new mosquito pools in New York City. These
findings, reported to the City yesterday by the New York State Department
of Health, necessitate spraying in sections of St. Albans, Queens, Marine
Park, Brooklyn, and East Tremont, in the Bronx. Deputy Commissioner of
Health Benjamin Mojica, M.D., made this announcement at a news conference
at City Hall with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Dr. Mojica said, "As the
mosquito season continues, New Yorkers should continue to take personal
protection measures against mosquitoes, including wearing protective
clothing, using mosquito repellent containing DEET, and making sure that
window screens fit tightly to keep mosquitoes from entering people's homes."
