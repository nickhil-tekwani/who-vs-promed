*Data in WHO as of 15 Nov 2011 for 2011 data and 13 Nov 2012 for 2012 data.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 27. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2012] (WPV1 from Paktya province).
- The campaign in November [2012] will be held in border areas with Pakistan, and will use a combination of trivalent OPV and bivalent OPV (depending on the area, in response either to recent WPV1 cases in the area, or in response to detection of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 outbreak -- cVDPV2 -- across the border in Pakistan).

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 101. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [15 Oct 2012] (WPV1 from Katsina).

Pakistan
--------
- 6 new WPV cases were reported in the past week (one WPV1 from Federally Administered Tribal Areas -- FATA -- and 5 WPV1s from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- KP), bringing the total number of cases for 2012 to 54. The most recent case was one of the newly reported WPV1 cases from KP with onset of paralysis on [27 Oct 2012].
In addition to transmission of WPV, the country is also responding to a cVDPV2 outbreak (5 cases, all from the greater Quetta area of Balochistan). The most recent NIDs [national immunization days] held in October [2012] had been conducted with trivalent OPV.

Angola
------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The country reported a total of 5 cases in 2011, and the last case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2011] in Uige in the country's north.
- Planned subnational immunization days were postponed because of government transition.

Chad
----
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recently reported WPV case occurred in the Lac region (WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012]. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 5.
- Staggered NIDs with trivalent OPV are ongoing in Chad, officially launched by the Prime Minister. The 1st wave (in the south and east) was held on [27-29 Oct 2012], to be followed by the 2nd wave in the north and west on [9-11 Nov 2012]. Staggering the activities allows the deployment of all available technical support to key high-risk areas. Trivalent OPV is used, including to boost immunity levels to type 2 level, in response to the recent confirmation of the cVDPV2 outbreak affecting the country (5 cases in N'Djamena and 2 close to the border with Sudan). Activities are also planned in the Darfur provinces, Sudan, to minimize the risk and consequences of potential spread across the border.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
--------------------------------------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 is 93 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2011] in Maniema province.
- Although the country has not reported a WPV case since December 2011, it has been affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in Katanga province in 2012, with 17 cases reported (most recent case: 4 Apr 2012). Efforts are focused on ensuring the cVDPV2 outbreak is fully stopped.
- In some regions, immunization activities have been postponed because of an ongoing Ebola outbreak.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- Efforts are continuing to stop an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Kenya and parts of Somalia (in a Somali refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya, and Kismayo, south-central Somalia).
- Immunizations of older age groups have taken place in Dadaab. In Somalia, campaigns have been conducted in border areas with Kenya and Ethiopia, and in some areas of central Somalia (access allowing).

West Africa
-----------
No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 in West Africa remains 51 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 5 from Niger). The most recent case from the region (WPV1 from Niger) had onset of paralysis on [22 Dec 2011].

[2] Pakistan: challenges

Polio fighters in Pakistan struggle against myths and realities
---------------------------------------------------------------
They gathered in a small room in one of this city's worst slums, a dozen mothers sitting cross-legged with toddlers and newborns on their laps, listening to advice about polio prevention. "Keep your children from playing in garbage cans and sewer drains," said Saddaf Malik, a brightly dressed young woman from UNICEF.

Simple enough, but then came the questions, spiked with suspicion and indicative of why Pakistan remains one of 3 countries in the world where the paralyzing disease still thrives despite constant campaigns in recent years to defeat it.

Why, some mothers wondered, were the vaccination teams coming back once a month, instead of every 3 months, as they used to? Were the repeated doses meant to induce sterility in Muslims?

The polio fighters looked crestfallen. They thought this dangerous myth was dead in Lahore -- a sprawling city with an estimated 1.5 million young children that logged just one polio case a year ago [2011] and none since.

"This is really alarming," the district's chief health officer, Muhammad Saeed Akhtar Ghumman, said in his office later when a UNICEF staffer reported the women's concerns to him.

Troubling, too, was the confirmation of the polio virus in 16 of 28 sewage samples taken so far this year [2012] in Lahore, a marked increase over 2011. And 3 successive positive samples -- in July, August, and September [2012] -- have raised worries about the virus's "silent circulation," as World Health Organization officials call it.

"We take it very seriously if there is even one positive sample," said Ni'ma Abid, a WHO senior medical officer. "It means you have polio in the community."

Still, overall trends in Pakistan, where nearly 30 million children have been vaccinated in recent years, are encouraging. In 1994, when the nation began to fully engage the scourge, polio killed or paralyzed at least 1500 children, by conservative estimates.

Last year's [2011] cases numbered 198 nationwide. This year's tally is 54.

But the intractability of other social ills, including insurgency, poverty, illiteracy, and inadequate sanitation, have conspired to ensure that the country remains years away from meeting its goal of polio eradication by the dawn of 2013.

Last week [11 Nov 2012], a new setback emerged in Balochistan, where doctors reported 5 cases of polio-crippled children in the restive province, which had seen only 4 cases this year.

The new cases are significant because they resulted from the vaccine itself. WHO officials called this extremely rare, but it can happen in places where the level of immunization is exceedingly low and the sanitation poor.

Polio drops contain a weakened polio virus that provides immunity. Once excreted, it has a slim potential to mutate into a strain that can cause paralysis.

The 5 cases of "vaccine-derived polio" -- the 1st seen in Pakistan -- could give skeptical parents another reason to refuse to vaccinate their children, some officials fear.

While refusals have been dropping nationwide, rumors abound that the drops contain religiously proscribed ("non-halal") ingredients or are part of a Western plot to spread infertility and limit Muslim population growth.

A CIA-paid Pakistani doctor's hepatitis immunization campaign, launched to try to collect Osama bin Laden's DNA before his killing last year [2011], also gave a boost to conspiracy theorists and religious leaders who advise parents not to vaccinate their children.

"The problem we already have is trust," said one health official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity. "The last thing we need right now is giving people another reason to distrust the vaccination campaigns."

Despite significant progress elsewhere in Pakistan, polio has risen in the militancy-hit northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In North Waziristan and South Waziristan, tribal areas where the Taliban this summer [2012] banned vaccinations in response to US drone strikes, the inoculation teams have no access to 210 000 children. An additional 40 000 in risky frontier zones near the Afghan border also are out of reach.

One key to reducing outbreaks, UN health workers say, is to educate parents such as those at the session in Lahore this month [November 2012]. Those attending were ethnic Pash­tuns, the descendants of Afghan refugees who came to Lahore in the 1980s, along with millions of others who swarmed across the border after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

Pashto speakers have accounted for 85 percent of the nation's polio cases in the past 3 years, officials report. These include transients from the tribal region who relocate to enclaves here -- and in other cities, such as Karachi -- bringing the virus with them. (Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only other 2 countries where polio is endemic.)

In Lahore, UNICEF dispatches "social mobilizers" to comb flyblown streets and refugee hovels over and over, trying to account for what they term "missed children" -- the still-unvaccinated ones who are potential polio time bombs.

To help find them, Mayor Noor-ul-Amin Mengal hired 34 Pashto-speaking college students to bridge communication gaps in a recent inoculation campaign. He said he also recruited 30 religious leaders to support the effort.

Is it working?
"Parents do not object to the drops," said a 20-year-old teacher leading a class for Afghan children in a 3-walled brick structure. He said all 40 of his pupils younger than 5 had been vaccinated.

Nearby, a frail, thin mother peeked from behind a worn tarp and nervously greeted the vaccinating team -- 2 plump women in nicely pressed Pakistani-style chemises and a young man in Western office wear. They were checking on the 11 children under the age of 3 who lived in the refugee compound and would need follow-up doses.

The thin woman reported a new arrival, a 4-day-old baby. The mobilizers said they would be back to administer drops. She darted quickly back inside.

That morning, the team also visited a preschool drop-in center in search of 5 missed children. The staff provides free breakfast and said they sometimes give polio drops without parental permission. The 5 children weren't to be found.

A few yards down the street, a little girl climbed into a garbage bin in search of nourishment. She found a wrapper containing a morsel, gnawed at it, then skittered off into an alley reeking of sewage.

Insecurity scares anti-polio officials from Kaduna communities
--------------------------------------------------------------
For fear of being attacked by armed robbers and other criminals, anti-polio officials have declined rendering their services in 16 communities in Birnin Gwari Local Council of Kaduna State, cutting off the children from assessing oral polio vaccination.

It was learnt that the local council has been under the invasion of rampaging robbers in the past few months, with the last bloody attack on Dogo Dawa community where over 20 villagers were allegedly killed and many injured recently.

Already, the state has recorded 14 fresh cases of polio infection between January to November this year [2012], with Northern part of the Kaduna State leading with 13 cases due to non-vaccination of the children for political and religious reasons.

Addressing participants at a workshop organised by Journalists Against Polio (JAP), Sunday [18 Nov 2012], the representative of the State Ministry of Health who is the Secretary, State Action Committee on immunization, Alhaji Lawal Abubakar urged health officials and vaccinators to be responsive to their professional callings by penetrating the so-called danger zones to immunise the children against polio.

According to Abubakar, "if war-torn countries like Somalia and Sudan were in the forefront of immunising children despite the ravaging crises, Nigeria, particularly the Northern part of the country, has no excuse to ward off any danger for the sake of saving children from the transmissible disease.

"Communities not reached by vaccinators because of insecurity due to fear of attack by armed robbers include Kuyello, Magajin Gari 111, Dogo Dawa, and Gayam with 16 settlements under them."

He expressed regrets that Northern Nigeria was dragging the country back in the fight against polio, pointing out that if parents in the zone subject their children to routine vaccination, the scourge would have been kicked out of the country because, "if one child is infected with the virus, it can be transmitted to over 200 children."

The Health Ministry official argued that out of 179 global polio cases, "Nigeria is leading with 100 cases with the entire Northern zone nursing the whole 100 cases of polio infection in the country."

Abubakar advised parents to allow their children to take polio vaccination, saying the rumour that the vaccine is a calculated attempt by western world to reduce population is a campaign of calumny by people who do not want the polio programme to succeed.

Said Alhaji Abubakar: "There is need for immunization against polio as long as children are being born, vaccination will continue even if it is one child that is being born because it is a huge cost to keep a child with polio infection than to prevent it. The parents who are kicking against this immunization usually take the vaccination themselves when they go on pilgrimages. So why take what you prevented your child from taking?"

He therefore urged journalists to help in educating and enlightening the people in the state about importance of vaccination against polio, noting that lack of communication between the vaccinators and parents was one of the reasons for non compliance on the part of the benefactors.

Meanwhile, Governor Patrick Ibrahim Yakowa has lamented the prevalence of polio cases in the country, expressing regret that Nigeria has become the most entrenched reservoir of the wild polio virus in the world.

[4] SAGE meeting: OPV2 phaseout
Date: Wed 14 Nov 2012
Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [excerpted, edited]
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx


- The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) met last week [week of 5 Nov 2012] in Geneva, Switzerland. During this meeting, the draft polio eradication and endgame strategy for 2013-2018 and current status of the global polio eradication programme were presented to SAGE.
- SAGE endorsed the 4 major objectives and milestones in the new strategic plan. SAGE also recommended that all countries should introduce at least one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in their routine immunization programmes to mitigate the risks and consequences associated with the eventual withdrawal of the type 2 component of OPV (OPV2). SAGE will review progress on achieving the pre-requisites for OPV2 withdrawal, including the availability of affordable IPV products, every 6 months to ensure the earliest possible date for OPV2 withdrawal but with sufficient advance notification to ensure programmatic readiness and vaccine availability.

[For more information on the SAGE meeting, follow the links provided at http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2012/november/news_sage_ipv_opv_nov2012/en/index.html. Links to all the background documents presented to the SAGE at the 6-8 Nov 2012 meeting can be found at http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2012/november/presentations_background_docs/en/index.html. Mod.MPP]

[The reports above paint a picture that is filled with good news and bad news. The exceptionally good news deals with the record low number of reported cases of poliomyelitis in the world -- with the current case count (as of 14 Nov 2012) of a total of 187 cases compared with 520 cases reported during the same time period in 2011. The other good news is that only 4 countries have reported polio cases during 2012 -- Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Chad -- of which Chad is the only non-polio endemic country reporting cases, the date of onset of the last case was 14 Jun 2012, suggesting that the outbreak in Chad may have been contained, and that the other non-endemic countries remain polio free in 2012.

The bad news in the reports above involves the continued obstacles and barriers to vaccination activities and vaccine acceptance in the endemic countries. The safety issues confronting the vaccination teams in the endemic countries and the continued rumors surrounding the safety of the vaccine or rumors speculating nepharious intentions on the part of "the West" to administer sterilizing agents to children.

The other disturbing information in the reports above is the continued appearance of cases of polio associated with infection with circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2(cVDPV2) in 6 countries during 2012 -- Pakistan, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, DR Congo (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx for a table showing the number of cases of polio due to infection with cVDPV by virus type, year and country.) As cases of polio due to infection with cVDPV occur in areas with low vaccination coverages where the vaccine virus is/was able to continue circulation for prolonged periods allowing reversion of the vaccine virus to a more neurovirulent virus, the occurrence of these cases highlights areas that are at risk of WPV circulation if the virus is introduced due to a high number of susceptibles in the population. The recommendation of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) that "all countries should introduce at least one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in their routine immunization programmes to mitigate the risks and consequences associated with the eventual withdrawal of the type 2 component of OPV (OPV2)" is a recognition that the risk of disease associated with OPV2 is greater than the risk of disease from WPV2 (the last case of polio associated with WPV2 infection in the world was in 1999).
