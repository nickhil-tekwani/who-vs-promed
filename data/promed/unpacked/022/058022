[1] _Wheat streak mosaic virus_
Date: April 2009

In August of 2005, seeds of wheat (_Triticum
aestivum_) breeding line 6065.3 tested positive
for _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus
_Tritimovirus_) by a WSMV-specific reverse
transcription (RT)-PCR assay. The sequence of the
200-bp amplicon was 99 percent identical with
WSMV isolates from Turkey and the United States,
and 96 to 97 percent identical to isolates from Australia.

As a result, an extensive survey of 3 cereal
experimental trials and 105 commercial wheat
crops grown on the South Island of New Zealand
was conducted during the 2005Â­2006 summer to
determine the distribution of WSMV. Wherever
possible, only symptomatic plants were collected.
Symptoms on wheat leaf samples ranged from very
mild mosaic to symptomless. In total, 591 leaf
samples suspected to be symptomatic were tested
for WSMV by a double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-
ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]. Of the
591 symptomatic samples, 81 tested positive.
ELISA results were confirmed by RT-PCR [reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction]. The
expected size fragment was amplified from each of
the 81 ELISA-positive samples. The positive
samples represent 30 of 56 wheat cultivars (54
percent) collected from 28 of 108 sites (26
percent) sampled in the growing regions from mid-Canterbury to North Otago.

These results suggest that WSMV is widespread in
New Zealand both geographically and within
cultivars. WSMV is transmitted by the wheat curl
mite (_Aceria tosichella_), which had not been
detected in New Zealand despite repeated and
targeted surveys. WSMV is of great economic
importance in some countries, where the disease
has been reported to cause total yield loss.
Although WSMV is transmitted by seeds at low
rates (0.1 to 0.2 percent), it is the most likely
explanation of the spread of the disease in New Zealand.

[2] _Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_
Date: January 2009

_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV) was
identified using transmission electron
microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in 2 out of 5
samples collected from a wheat (_Triticum
aestivum_) plant showing severe leaf mosaic. The
plant was also infected with _Barley stripe
mosaic virus_ and _Barley yellow dwarf virus_-MAV
and -PAV [strains of BYDV].

A further 28 out of 200 wheat samples
tested positive for SBWMV using ELISA. A
comparison of 11 New Zealand SBWMV isolates
indicated that they were all identical and had 98
percent nucleotide sequence identity with SBWMV
isolates from the United States, subgroup New
York-Illinois. At the location of the SBWMV
outbreak the vector, _Polymyxa graminis_, was
detected by PCR and the identity was confirmed by
sequencing. This is the 1st report of SBWMV in New Zealand.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus
_Tritimovirus_) is prevalent in North America,
Russia, Eastern Europe, and has also been
reported from Australia and Argentina. It can
infect wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses,
and also oats and barley in experimental
inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause
complete crop failure in wheat. The virus is
spread by the wheat curl mite, but can also be
mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at
a very low level. Control of the mite vector is
difficult but disease management may include
controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to
minimise inoculum. However, it is particularly
noteworthy that WSMV appears to have been spread
throughout New Zealand in the absence of its mite
vector and entirely by contaminated seed. This
illustrates once more the importance of seed
certification, even for pathogens where seed
transmission occurs only at low levels.

_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV; genus
_Furovirus_) occurs in many countries from
various parts of the world. It causes one of the
few diseases of winter wheat that can destroy an
entire crop of a susceptible cultivar. Symptoms
vary and may include mild green to prominent
yellow leaf mottling, rosetting, and moderate to
severe stunting of plants. SBWMV is transmitted
by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa
graminis_, an obligate parasite in the roots of
many grasses. It survives in soil and crop
residues protected by the fungus, and can be
spread in contaminated soil, by water, and
mechanical means. It is not seed-transmitted.
Disease management relies mainly on use of resistant wheat cultivars.

Since for both viruses the New Zealand isolates
are reported to be most closely related to
isolates from the USA, this must be suspected to
be the origin of their introduction.
