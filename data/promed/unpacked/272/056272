Defra update on foot-and-mouth disease situation
------------------------------------------------
Defra has today [5 Oct 2007] published a further report on ongoing
epidemiological work into the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak
[see item 2].
At day 63 of the FMD outbreak there are currently 8 confirmed
Infected Premises. Evidence continues to indicate that this outbreak
is likely to be confined to a relatively small area of the country
and not become geographically extensive and that the risk of spread
outside of the FMD risk area remains very low.
Fred Landeg, deputy chief veterinary officer said, "The cases since
21 Sep 2007 have all been within the existing Protection Zone. Our
detailed investigations indicate that they all derived from other
infected premises within the zone. That is why we again stepped up
our surveillance.
"We took the decision to cull 4 Dangerous Contacts for Infected
Premises 8. Final laboratory tests are awaited but the initial
results are negative, which provides reassurance that disease has not
spread from the last infected premises (IP8).
"The evidence indicates that spread is local. While the exact
mechanism cannot be firmly established, it is most likely to be
windborne or mechanical transmission.
"It remains the case that the outbreak is most likely to be confined
to this small area in the south east of England, but our intensive
surveillance work continues. That does not mean that we can become
complacent about FMD in the rest of the country. Animal keepers must
continue to be vigilant in checking stock."

unfortunately does not allow copying, subscribers are referred to
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/pdf/epidreport300907.pdf>.
The report (17 pages) includes a correction to the descriptive
epidemiology of IP4 (regarding its notice and reporting by the
owner), and separate epidemiological descriptions of IP6, IP7, and
IP8. The epidemiology of IP5 is still under investigation.
The report includes additional epidemiological data, a review of
potential for future cases or spread of FMD in the UK, and detailed,
useful maps. The previous epidemiological report covered the events
until 21 Sep 2007. - Mod.AS]

The latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is unlikely to spread
outside Surrey, government vets have said.
Defra said epidemiological studies of the latest cases confirmed the
belief that the disease is unlikely to spread outside the area.
Evidence suggested that in the newest cases, the disease was
transmitted by the wind or carried by machinery, the report said.
Deputy chief vet Fred Landeg said, "We hope that we will not discover
any further new cases." The report showed that the latest outbreak
was "most likely to remain small and not become geographically
extensive," he added.
Dr Landeg also said the only potential link between Pirbright -- the
source of the 1st outbreak in August [2007] -- and the secondary
outbreak in September [2007] was through human or vehicle movement.
It will be at least 30 days from the last confirmed case, discovered
last weekend [29-30 Sep 2007], before the surveillance zone in Surrey
can be lifted, he said.

Foot-and-mouth Review: 2007
---------------------------
Following the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease identified in
Surrey in August 2007, the Prime Minister has asked Dr Iain Anderson
to look at the Government's response to the outbreak (Dr Anderson
chaired the previous inquiry into the 2001 outbreak). The terms of
reference for Foot-and-mouth Review: 2007 are:
To conduct a review of the Government's handling of the outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease during 2007, in order to:
- establish whether relevant points from the Lessons to be Learned
Report on the 2001 outbreak were implemented;
- establish whether new lessons might be drawn from the handling of
the 2007 outbreak;
and to make recommendations by the end of 2007 to the Prime Minister
and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs on the future handling of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.
The independent Review is now beginning its formal programme of work.
Dr Anderson will be supported by a small secretariat of staff chosen
from across Government and externally. The Review welcomes views from
everyone about the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The Review will be independent. Its central objective is to establish
those areas where lessons identified in the 2002 inquiry were learned
and implemented as well as whether new lessons might be drawn from
the handling of the 2007 outbreak.
Comments via e-mail about the outbreak and its handling should be
sent to <fmdreview@cabinet-office.x.gsi.gov.uk>.
Written comments should be sent to:
The Secretary
Foot and Mouth Review: 2007
Room 3.21
26 Whitehall
London SW1A 2WH
The closing date for receipt of information is Fri 16 Nov 2007.
