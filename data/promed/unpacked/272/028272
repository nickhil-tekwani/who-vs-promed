Russia's Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service,
Rosselkhoznadzor, dismissed reports Saturday about an outbreak of the
cow disease, otherwise known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in
one of the country's southern provinces.
"The information released by some media that there is a suspected
presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the [Krasnodar]
region is false," the agency said in a news release.
It was the recent death of 97 calves at one local farm that is
believed to have given rise to such speculations. Tests at the
Krasnodar region's central veterinary laboratory showed that all
fallen cattle had been infected with the rabies virus. But
Rosselkhoznadzor said the findings are "preliminary" and that further
testing will be needed to establish the actual cause of the outbreak.
All animals that may have been in contact with the sick calves have
been slaughtered to prevent the spread of the disease, and cattle at
nearby farms have been vaccinated, the agency said, adding that no
new cases have been registered.
The well-being of homegrown livestock is an increasingly sensitive
issue now that Russian authorities are considering banning meat
imports from the EU. They may impose such a ban starting next January
when Bulgaria and Romania, both of which have recently suffered from
outbreaks of swine fever, are slated to join the 25-nation bloc.

[The linguistic-based confusion -- in Russian media -- between rabies
and BSE, was discussed and clarified earlier [see 20020714.4752].
Clearly, the above outbreak is not BSE. Rabies, as the candidate
diagnosis for the mortality of 97 calves in one farm, deserves
careful investigation.
Since BSE and rabies have been mentioned in this case, it may be
assumed that CNS symptoms were observed. Rabies is one of several
possible causes for such symptoms in bovines. It may, at times,
affect large numbers of bovines in a shed, following their common
exposure to an intruding rabid carnivore (remarkably, minor bites on
snouts of curious/nosy bovines will be seen). However, the clinical
symptoms will not commence in all infected animals simultaneously but
rather protractedly over a period of several days or weeks, at the
termination of their respective incubation periods. More information,
and particularly laboratory tests of brains from affected animals,
will provide final diagnosis. If rabies is excluded, bacterial, viral
and toxicological etiologies should be considered. - Mod.AS]
