So far, Oregon has confirmed 23 cases of Salmonella [serotype Muenchen in
13 counties. The exposure dates of the confirmed cases range between 6-13
and 6-20. Orange juice consumption is being investigated, but so far over
half of the number of cases have had some brand of Sun Orchard orange juice.
If interested, please go to our web page for press release information and
case updates including an epi-curve.

[This indicates a substantially higher number of cases identified in Oregon
than was indicated in the (03) message in this thread. Nice website, also.
