The death toll from cholera in war-torn Yemen has increased to 923 since 27 Apr 2017, with the total suspected cases passing 124 000, the WHO said on [Mon 12 Jun 2017]. The death toll from cholera epidemic rose to 923 until late [Mon 12 Jun 2017], up from 789 reported on [Thu 8 Jun 2017], which means that 134 Yemeni people have been killed by the spreading epidemic in the past 4 days, according to WHO data.

The number of suspected cholera cases has increased up to 124 002 reported from 20 out of 22 Yemeni governorates, up from 101 820 on [Thu 8 Jun 2017], with an increase of 22 182, according to WHO. Last week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) expected suspected cases could hit 130 000 in 2 weeks, while in May 2017 WHO expected they could reach 300 000 in the next 6 months. The outbreak has spread fast in 20 governorates in just 6 weeks, since [27 Apr 2017].

Yemen is facing total collapse as the war continues. 2/3 of the population, around 19 million, need some humanitarian or protection aid. About 10.3 million people are close to famine and 14.5 million people lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Less than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational at the moment, but even those operational ones are coping with huge challenges, on top of which is the lack of medications, medical equipment, and staffs.

The blockade on Yemen, part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country which used to import most of its basic needs. And there is another problem: not much aid is given to address the crisis, especially cholera outbreak.
