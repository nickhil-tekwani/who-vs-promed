A dog-owner has warned the public not to let their pets near water if blue-green algae may be present after her 4-month-old puppy died.

[A resident] of Willington, regularly walked her Labrador pup at Foremark reservoir but was unaware of the presence of the algae, which is actually a toxic bacteria which multiplies in summer. She said: "We went for our normal walk on Friday evening [21 Aug 2015] and I was aware of him messing about around the beach area and nibbling on something. "I called him away but within about 30 minutes of reaching home he began to vomit and I took him to the vets, where unfortunately they weren't able to save him and he died this morning [24 Aug 2015].
"They carried out blood tests and confirmed it was blue-green algae which had poisoned him. "I knew nothing about this algae at all and I don't want anyone else's dog, or even a child, to suffer like [my dog]."

[The woman] has been in touch with Severn Trent Water, which owns the reservoir, to ask why notices do not spell out the problem more clearly. She said: "There are notices saying about not going in the water but [my dog] did not go in. What seems to have happened is that the water level has fallen leaving the blue-algae exposed on the shoreline, which is easily accessible to dogs and people. This either needs clearing or warning signs need to be put up." The Severn Trent website carries a warning about the blue-green algae. It says: "Some common species of blue-green algae can produce toxins but research suggests it's only in 50 percent of blooms. "The amount of toxin being produced and whether the bloom is producing toxin or not, is unpredictable. "The toxins released by dying cells can be harmful to humans, animals, and other aquatic life if ingested and may cause skin irritation upon contact."

It also recommends anyone seeing a water body with a bloom on its surface or signs displayed at any of their public reservoirs should be extra careful.

A spokesman for the firm said: "We're very sorry to hear about the death of the dog on Friday evening [21 Aug 2015]. We're in contact with [his owner] to understand what has happened and why. "As a precaution in the meantime, we have put additional signs up around the reservoir to warn visitors about the algae, which occurs naturally in the water and can be more common at this time of year."

[There are a number of species of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals.

Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as "pond scum." Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly in number. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats or may even appear as a blue-green (some say slightly iridescent) sheen on the water. When this happens, we call this a "blue-green algae bloom." Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.

Generally blooms form when the waters and weather are warmer, but when the nutrient level in the water is appropriate for bloom growth as well.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur in waters, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp., _Aphanizomenon_ sp., _Microcystis_ sp., and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species present can change over the course of the season.

Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals. If the organisms are seen microscopically in the water, then to be safe, animals need to be kept from drinking from that body of water. The same is true for people.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appeared clear, if a "bloom" is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface, and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, which occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin, microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the USA; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also require sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in [rapid multiplication causing] blooms.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people that consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people that frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing _Microcystis_ or through ingesting algal mats.
