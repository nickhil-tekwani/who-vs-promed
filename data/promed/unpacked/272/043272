Researchers have identified the disease that killed hundreds of
double-crested cormorants in Lake Champlain and Oneida Lake.
High numbers of sick and dead cormorants began showing up on
the 2 lakes this summer, prompting wildlife officials in New York and
Vermont to investigate the mysterious disease. New York State
Environmental Commissioner Erin Crotty on Tuesday identified the
disease as Cormorant Newcastle Virus, which she said was known
to exist in wild cormorants in other parts of the country.
Crotty said the disease is not considered a threat to humans or to
farm animals.
While Crotty said the disease appears to be self-limiting, she said
the state Department of Environmental Conservation will see what
can be done to mitigate the impact on the birds.
The agency estimated that a few hundred cormorants died on Lake
Champlain. Sick and dead cormorants showed up around Young
Island off the west shore of Grand Isle and the Four Brothers
islands on the New York side of the lake in late July and August
2003.
Another 50 cormorants were believed to have succumbed on
Oneida Lake, which is near Syracuse and more than 125 miles
west of Lake Champlain.
Crotty said the diagnosis was a cooperative effort between New
York, Vermont and federal officials.
