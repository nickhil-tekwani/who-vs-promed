MALARIA - TANZANIA: (MBEYA), CLIMATE CHANGE

Tanzania's southern highlanders have long worried about pneumonia and
other respiratory illnesses brought on by the cool, wet weather. But
as climate change contributes to warmer temperatures in the region,
residents are facing a new health threat: malaria.

In Rungwe, a highland district in the south-western Mbeya region
bordering Malawi and Zambia, malaria is fast replacing coughs, fever
and pneumonia as the most serious local health problem.

The change has taken by surprise the region's residents, who live
over 1000 metres (3200 feet) above sea level and outside Tanzania's
traditional malarial zones. A 32-year-old woman of Isebe village had
no idea she had contracted malaria when she was sent to Makandana
District Hospital in late December 2010.

In 2009, health centres in Rungwe district reported 100 966 malaria
cases, a jump of 25 percent from 2006, hospital records show.

Malaria is now the biggest public health threat facing Rungwe
district, which lies about 940 km (590 miles) southwest of Dar es
Salaam, according to the Tukuyu Medical Research Centre, part of the
National Institute for Medical Research.

1/3rd of outpatients visiting the hospital were diagnosed with the
mosquito-borne illness in 2007, according to records from that year,
making it the most common disease for outpatients. Most highland areas
in the east African country are experiencing a growing burden of
malaria cases, officials at the Tukuya Centre said.

Climatic changes brought on in part by local environmental
degradation are contributing to the growing prevalence of malaria in
the district, said Gideon Ndawala, Rungwe district's malaria
coordinator. "People have cleared the forests, rain has decreased,
temperatures have risen," Ndawala said in an interview.

"(When) I 1st reported on the district in 1983, it was very cold, and
it rained throughout the year except from mid-September to early
November. The weather was not favourable for mosquito breeding," he
said.

Now, however, temperatures are higher and rain more erratic, he said,
and mosquito populations -- which thrive on warmer temperatures and
breed in pools of stagnant water -- are on the rise.

Worst hit by the surge in malaria are Tukuyu district town, Ikuti,
Rungwe Mission and Ilolo, according to district health officials. Half
a century ago, these traditionally cool areas saw no mosquitoes and
did not register any malaria cases, but now the weather is warmer,
said Ambakisye Joram Mwakatobe, a 76-year-old man from Bulyaga village
in Rungwe.

"In the past, we never saw mosquito nets here. I saw a net for the
1st time at the age of 20, when I joined Butimba Teachers College in
1957," he said in an interview at his village home.

Mwakatobe said cases of malaria began to appear several decades ago,
but residents did not relate them to warming temperatures, believing
the mosquitoes instead were arriving on buses from lower regions.

"It was in the 1970s when we started getting malaria here. I thought
it was the buses from Kyela and Usangu that brought mosquitoes," he
admitted. But "the weather also started to change in those years," he
said.

A half-century ago, "it was very cold here, and it rained throughout
the year. Three things were compulsory: a sweater, pullover or heavy
jacket; an umbrella or raincoat; and gumboots," he added. "There was
frost all day long, and cars had to put their lights on. "But today,
things have changed," he said. "Look, now we even put on light shirts.
There is no need for sweaters, gumboots or umbrellas."

Scientists agree that the changing weather is feeding into Rungwe's
worsening malaria problem. "Up until 1960, districts like Rungwe,
Mbeya, Mufindi, Njombe, Makete and Iringa in the southern highland
regions were malaria free. Today is quite different; malaria
prevalence is high," said Akili Kalinga, a research scientist at
Tukuyu Medical Research Centre.

Malaria accounts for 30 percent of the burden of disease in Tanzania
and is a huge drain on productivity, according to a report produced by
research scientists for the Sixth Africa Malaria Day in 2006.

In response to the rising malaria caseload, the government is taking
steps to stem the disease's expansion. Measures include public health
education in newly vulnerable districts on home cleanliness and water
storage, how to eliminate the places of still water where mosquitoes
live and breed, and the use of mosquito nets and fumigation, said Dr.
Sungwa Ndagabwene, Rungwe's medical officer. "The government is taking
serious measures to fight malaria. We started with a 'mosquito nets
for all' campaign, saying every person should sleep under bed nets,"
Ndagabwene said.

The government also has begun spraying the inside of homes with
insecticide, 1st in the Kagera region and now throughout the Lake
zone, near Lake Victoria, he said. It plans to expand the spraying
program, which has helped cut malaria transmission in Zanzibar, to the
rest of the Tanzania's malaria-affected regions.

Such spraying programs aim to kill mosquitoes that land on the inside
walls of homes. Spraying can protect homes for between 4-10 months
depending on the insecticide, according to the World Health
Organisation (WHO).

WHO has approved 12 insecticides it considers safe for such spraying
programs, including DDT, a controversial endocrine disruptor that has
proved one of the most effective ways to control mosquito populations
but that has also been linked to environmental damage and health
problems, including cancer. Ndagabwene said spraying the chemical only
indoors limited its environmental impact. WHO officials have said they
believe the benefits of using the pesticide outweigh its risks.

The Stockholm Convention bans the use of DDT but exempts countries
that choose to use the chemical to control malaria. Tanzania is one of
the world's worst malaria-affected countries, recording 14 to 18
million clinical cases annually and 60 000 deaths, 80 percent of them
in children under 5 years old, according to a 2010 malaria reduction
plan put together by U.S. AID. Children under 5 and pregnant women are
most affected by the disease, Tanzanian health figures show.

[Tanzania is regarded as a high burden country for malaria, and 100
percent of the population is considered at risk (World Malaria Report
2010, WMR2010,
<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241564106/en/>.

25 percent of children sleep under insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)
(WMR2010). Overall, the number of hospital admissions due to malaria
and reported malaria deaths have decreased by 90 percent in Tanzania
over the past 6 to 8 years (Fig. 6.10; WMR2010). For the ProMED
