Although up until now there have been 3200 confirmed dengue cases in
Valle del Cauca, the departmental [state or province equivalent]
secretary of health, Hector Fabio Useche, said that the situation is
complex but not critical. As of today [12 Mar 2010], the dengue
outbreak has left 9 dead in the department, 6 in Cali, 2 in Palmira,
and one in Jamundi.

"The outlook in Valle is worrying because people are dying of dengue;
it is a disease that exists, the mosquito is always going to exist,
[but] there shouldn't be mortality [because of it]," said the official.

The secretaries of health of Cali and Valle del Cauca are carrying
out various cultural prevention campaigns so that people detect
symptoms, avoid the presence of "white-footed" _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes, and receive timely treatment.

In Cali, the secretary of health has already carried out 4 shifts for
visiting various neighborhoods during the weekends in order to
orient, house-by-house, the Cali residents about how to confront
dengue. "Stating at 8:00 in the morning we go door-to-door in an
informative prevention campaign as part of a "crash" [action] that
has been developed for the whole municipality," said Marcelo
Castillo, environmental planning technician for Candelaria.

In total, there are 7 infected individuals with classical dengue
[virus] in the [Galapagos] archipelago: 6 in San Cristobal and one in
Santa Cruz, where an epidemiological barrier has been applied to
contain the disease.

The classical strain of the virus, transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_, appeared for the 1st time in the Galapagos in 2002. Then,
215 [dengue] cases were confirmed and the health authorities combated
dengue until the number of infections was reduced to 0 in 2004.

"People come form the mainland with the virus and only a few come to
be tested," explained Santiago Robles, coordinator of the Galapagos
Disease Service. This would constitute an obstacle for control of the
number of infected individuals.

Brigade members of the National Malaria Eradication Service (SNEM)
are fumigating areas where it is presumed that the vector mosquitoes
are found. In addition, they carry out control of new foci of
infection. However, the concern is the possibility that DHF will
appear, considering the limited [local] capacity to react [to that].
"An infected individual cannot stay in this unit. We have to move the
patient to a hospital with greater capacity on the continent," said
Ramiro Lopez, director of the Republic del Ecuador Hospital. He
indicated that the constant arrival of people and the intense rains
in recent weeks could have contributed to the reemergence of dengue.

[One hopes that this small dengue outbreak will be quickly contained
and eliminated in this very popular tourist destination.

The Guaruja government yesterday [12 Mar 2010] declared a dengue
epidemic in this coastal Sao Paulo municipality, which registered 962
cases of the disease, with 7 deaths. Another 996 people await the
results of [laboratory] tests from the Instituto Adolfo Lutz. The
Secretariat of Health bulleting issued on 27 Feb [2010] indicated
that there were 7594 reports of the disease in the state since the
beginning of year [2010].

The neighborhood with the greatest dengue incidence is Pae Cara,
located in the Vicente de Carvalho district. In an attempt to
eliminate the mosquito vector of the disease [virus], trucks with
[insecticide] foggers were sent to the region. Jardim Enseada also
has had an increase in the number of infected individuals, with 100
confirmed cases.

In order to accelerate medical attention, the municipality decided to
adopt a measure similar to that of Praia Grande municipality.
Starting today [13 Mar 2010], people will have access to tents
installed in front of emergency units to carry out diagnoses. In
addition to this, nurses and nursing technicians have emergency
contracts to work in medical posts in bus stations, where people come
to sit on the floor waiting for [medical] care.

in the northwest part of the state, with 1721 recorded [cases]. The
other registered [cases] are distributed in 55 municipalities in the
same region. The head of the office, Osmar Terra, admitted to G1 that
the number of infected individuals could reach 5000 in coming days,
but stated that the trend is to decline in a month, because of the
fall in temperature.

More than half of the 78 municipalities in Mato Grosso do Sul failed
to send the data sheets for the dengue situation since last week
[week of 1 Mar 2010]. Despite this failure, which represents 58
percent less information, the epidemiological bulletin released today
[12 Mar 2010] by the state Secretariat of Health shows alarming data.
Up to the last day, 6 [Mar 2010], a total of 11 [dengue] deaths were
registered this year [2010] in Mato Grosso do Sul, with 32 225
reported [dengue] cases.

"The epidemic of the disease is considered alarming in 8
municipalities," stated the information [bulletin]. With 20 250
reported [cases], Campo Grande has an incidence of 2682 cases per 100
000 population, among other cities with "a very high" index, such as
Jardim with 1299 cases, Angelica with 2518, Corguinho with 1875,
Ivinhema with 2122, Nioaque with 2198, Pedro Gomes with 1942, and Rio
Brilhante with 3369 cases per 100 000 population.

There are 672 confirmed dengue cases in the country. To this number,
2 confirmed cases in Cordoba must be added -- 2 people who traveled
to Venezuela and Brazil, where they contracted the virus [infection].
The majority of the [locally acquired] cases occurred in Misiones and
Chaco [provinces], where there is an outbreak with 536 and 103
patients, respectively.

Since December 2009 until the present, the National Reference
Laboratory (INEVH) "Julio I Maiztegui", has confirmed the circulation
of dengue [virus] serotype 1 (DEN-1) in Argentina. A total of 672
dengue illnesses have been recorded in the country since 1 Jan 2010
up to today. In Misiones [province] there is an outbreak with a total
of 536 cases detected in 2010. In Chaco [province] 103 dengue
patients have been recorded. Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe,
Entre Rios and Salta provinces, between 2-3 cases of patients with
this disease have been confirmed.

Data provided by the national Ministry of Health do not include the 2
confirmed cases in Cordoba, since they include [dengue] patients
reported from 1 Jan-9 Mar [2010]. The minister of health, Oscar
Gonzalez, made the formal announcement last [Thu 11 Mar 2010].

It is worth noting that in the outbreak areas response activities are
continuing: strengthening of service networks, their reorganization
such as the actions that the technical teams are in charge of, and
health personnel of the affected municipalities, the provinces and
the national Ministry of Health. The control actions include trash
cleanup, barriers around foci [of virus transmission] -- fumigation
around the blocks adjoining houses of infected people -- and search
for febrile patients with dengue symptoms.

The Ministry of Public Health in Paraguay on Monday [8 Mar 2010]
raised an alert in the face of the 1st 2 dengue deaths since the
beginning of the [dengue] epidemic in September [2009] and warned
about a worsening situation due to the simultaneous circulation of 3
[of the 4] serotypes of the virus.

The director of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry, Ivan
Allende, said that the administration of the office under his
direction registered some dengue 800 cases in the last half [of the
year 2009], an epidemic of low magnitude compared to previous years,
but more complicated due to the simultaneous circulation of the 3
[dengue virus] serotypes in the Concepcion and Amambay departments
[province or state equivalents] in the northern part of the country.
According to this official, this situation implies a greater risk for
possible appearance of serious cases "with hemorrhagic manifestations
in some cases or with visceral effects and multi-organ failure in others."

"While at the moment the [dengue virus] circulation is contained in
just 2 departments, given the mobility of the population we could
have it in all departments in a short period of time," he said.

Paraguay suffered its worst dengue epidemic in 2007, when 17 people
died and nearly 20 000 were infected.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits the disease [virus],
reproduces in catchments of clean water and in hot, humid climates in
Paraguay, which creates an environment propitious for its multiplication.

"We still have at least 2 months for the epidemic [to go], the months
of March and April, when serious [dengue] cases will continue to
appear," added Allende.
