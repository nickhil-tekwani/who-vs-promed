Cholera kills man in Belmopan
Confirmed reports this week from the Ministry of Health say that cholera
has killed one elderly man in a rural area near Belmopan, but that four
others, also infected with cholera, are on their way to full recovery.
The discovery of cholera in Belize, has been jolting news for health
authorities here, following reports of 29 deaths in Guatemala, on the
heels of Hurricane Mitch.
The areas of infection are the villages which have sprung up around
Belmopan - Salvapan, San Martin and Maya Mopan: refugee communities where
living conditions are still somewhat primitive.
