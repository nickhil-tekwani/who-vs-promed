Indonesia: 2 more suspected cases under treatment
-------------------------------------------------
Two more people from a bird flu-hit area in Indonesia's West Java have been
admitted to hospital on suspicion of contracting avian influenza, health
officials said.
The 1st patient, 17 years old, was taken on Tue 29 Aug 2006 to the hospital
in Garut, West Java, from the hamlet of Ranca Salak in the subdistrict of
Cikelet, where 3 people have already been infected by bird flu, said Iman
Firmanullah.
Birds in Ranca Salak tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the disease,
but no information was obtained on whether Ridwan had been in contact with
them, said Firmanullah, who heads the contagious disease section at Garut's
health office.
The Garut general hospital overnight received a 39 year old man from the
nearby hamlet of Cigadog who showed symptoms of bird flu, Firmanullah told
Agence France Presse.
Three other people from Cikelet are also suspected of having died as a
result of avian influenza virus infection.
The district animal husbandry office has culled a total of 4697 birds,
including chickens, ducks, geese and doves in the 6 villages in Cikelet in
the past few days, said Dida Kardiana, an official from the office in
Garut. He said his office was awaiting further instructions from the
central government before carrying out more culling in Cikelet.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation, has 60 confirmed cases of
infection so far, 46 of them fatal, the highest number in the world. While
the H5N1 virus that causes bird flu does not spread easily among people,
the chance of a mutation occurring which will allow it to do so is
heightened as more humans catch it from infected birds. Scientists fear
that if this occurs, a global flu pandemic with a massive death toll could
result.

[These suspected cases are part of an apparent "cluster" of cases centered
on the village of Cikelet in West Java. A similar apparent cluster of cases
was identified earlier in North Sumatra. In neither cluster has there been
any indication of human-to-human transmission of infection. As well as
these 2 clusters of suspected cases, sporadic suspected or confirmed human
cases of avian influenza virus have been recorded in the provinces of
Banten, Central Sulawesi Jakarta, West Java, East Java, Lampung, West
Sumatra, North Sumatra.
