Swiss recall German eggs due to salmonella
----------------------------------------------
The Swiss health authority recalled batches of imported German eggs on
Monday after 5 people contracted a salmonella infection upon eating
tiramisu -- an egg-based desert.
A spokesman for the company that packs and distributes the eggs for
supermarket chain Migros, said the eggs came from a farm in North Germany.
"We have taken sample tests and out of 70 eggs tested there was indeed one
that carried the salmonella bacteria,'' he said, adding that the possibly
contaminated batch made up a "very small'' percentage of imported eggs.
He said that Migros, the biggest food retailer in Switzerland, had bought
the eggs directly from the producer.
The health authority urged consumers to use only fresh eggs and keep them
refrigrated. It added that despite strict checks, the salmonella bacteria
could also appear in Swiss eggs.
The official from the exporting company said the German farm had 6000
chickens which were kept in semi-liberty and were therefore able to forage
and eat things beyond their regular feed. "It is absolutely ruled out that
the salmonella was in the feed,'' he said.
