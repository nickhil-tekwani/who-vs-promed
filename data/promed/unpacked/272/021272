Germans cull 1000 domestic fowl after H5N1 detected in goose
-------------------------------------------------------------
German authorities ordered about 1000 domestic fowl slaughtered after
the bird flu virus was detected in a goose in the eastern state of
Thuringia, officials there said Saturday [7 Jul 2007].
Culling of all domestic birds within a 3-km (2-mile) radius of the
remote town of Wickersdorf, where the H5N1-infected goose died, began
late Friday [6 Jul 2007], the Thuringian state health ministry said.
Veterinarians were sent door-to-door to ensure that all animals at
risk could be properly disposed of, the ministry said.
Officials at Germany's Friedrich-Loeffler Institute determined Friday
[6 Jul 2007] that a goose in the town of Wickersdorf had died of the
H5N1 virus. They said the danger of infection spreading in the
surrounding area was small because the infected bird lived on a small
farm in a remote area.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall
[As expected, the domestic goose from the smallholding near
Wickersdorf has been confirmed as an H5N1 positive case. The
subsequent control and eradication measures are prescribed by EU
legislation. It remains to see if such steps will suffice in
preventing additional cases in similar settings to occur, or that
vaccination -- at least in hobby-birds and other fowl which cannot be
kept indoors -- will have to be applied. Keeping the widely spread
fauna virus away from domestic birds is a complex objective, so far
impressively carried out. Let us wish the authorities and those
engaged in surveillance, diagnosis and control, in the field and the
laboratories, continued success. - Mod.AS]
