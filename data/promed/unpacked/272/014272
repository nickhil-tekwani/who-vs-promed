[State surveillance programs have run down. New York State is the only
state to release a new update, reporting one new human case. All other
reports and test results remain as posted in West Nile virus surveillance -
USA (47). The United States Department of Agriculture site which records
the overall totals has not been up-dated beyond 31 Oct 2000 as yet and
remains as posted in West Nile virus surveillance - USA (46). The November
24, 2000 edition of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report contains an
Update of West Nile Virus Activity for the Eastern United States, 2000
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4946a2.htm>. The Update
presents surveillance data reported to CDC from 1 Jan 2000 through 15 Nov
2000. The analysis of mosquito pools in this report notes that several
species formerly classified in the genus _Aedes_ have been transferred to
the genus _Ochlerotatus_. - Mod.CP

This week (25 Nov 2000 - 1 Dec 2000), the New York State Health
Department's Wadsworth Center laboratories reported one new human West Nile
Virus case in Manhattan. [No other details are given. - Mod.CP
Note that the text report and the New York State summary map
<http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/westnile/update/today.pdf> report
West Nile virus positive results. Encephalitis or severe neurologic
symptoms were not present in all of the human, bird, and mammal positive
"cases". A number of the birds and mammals had no clinical signs of West
Nile virus infection at all; they were asymptomatic surveillance specimens.
The total number of West Nile virus positive specimens from New York State
for this year is 1271 dead birds, 357 mosquito pools, 2 sentinel chickens,
8 live wild birds, 14 bats, 24 horses, 2 cats, 2 raccoons, 3 domestic
rabbits, 3 squirrels, one chipmunk, and 14 human cases.

West Nile virus infection of horses
-----------------------------------
I would like to point out that New York State's latest surveillance
numbers, cited in WNV surveillance - USA (49), bring the total of equine
West Nile virus confirmations to 64 for the year; horses by far being the
most frequently affected mammal. Interesting to note that cases did not
appear as early as might have been expected by the early viral activity.
Also positive test results for the horses continue to mount this year even
while the bird numbers are dropping precipitously. Does this implicate
different mosquito vectors for horses than humans? Longer incubation? Any
other ideas as to the reasons for this pattern?

[Dr. Kellon raises some interesting questions. West Nile virus infection
has been confirmed in 65 horses with neurologic disease from 26 Counties in
7 States, whereas 18 (now 19) human cases with severe neurologic disease
were recorded in the States of New Jersey and New York, plus one mildly
symptomatic case in Connecticut. Data presented graphically in the MMWR
Report of 24 Nov 2000 show that the incidence of disease in horses peaked
and persisted after the human illnesses. The report concludes that horses
may not be a sensitive sentinel for the prediction of human illness. - Mod.CP
