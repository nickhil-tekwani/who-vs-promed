For the 2nd time in 3 months, CDC is warning people who might have consumed contaminated raw milk and milk products to visit their doctor. People who bought and drank raw milk from a company called Udder Milk may have been infected with a rare but potentially serious bacterium called _Brucella abortus_ RB51. While brucellosis can cause anyone to become sick, women may suffer miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, making it critical for pregnant women who may have consumed the raw milk from Udder Milk to seek medical care immediately.

In late September 2017, a New Jersey woman became ill after drinking raw milk from the company. CDC confirmed that her illness was _Brucella_ RB51 in late October 2017. Because Udder Milk has not provided information about the farms that supply their milk, it has not been possible to trace the source of the woman's infection. CDC scientists have been collaborating with state health officials on the investigation. The Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are working with state health and agriculture officials to trace the source of the contaminated raw milk and raw milk products.

Until more information is available about which farms may be supplying contaminated milk or until officials can test milk from the farms, CDC recommends that anyone who drank raw milk or consumed raw milk products from Udder Milk in the past 6 months visit their doctor for antimicrobials to prevent illness. Information suggests that the company delivers milk in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.

"Because health officials have no direct way to let people know they may have drunk contaminated milk, everyone who consumed milk from Udder Milk in the past 6 months should receive therapy now to avoid having long-term health effects from the bacterium," said William Bower, MD, team lead for the CDC group that investigates brucellosis, the illness caused by RB51.

The New Jersey patient is the 2d known domestically acquired illness caused by _Brucella_ RB51 in raw milk in the USA in 2017; the other was in Texas in July 2017. The Texas and New Jersey incidents are not connected.

The locations of the farms supplying Udder Milk are not known. Neither are the places where the company sells and distributes raw milk and other products. Online information about Udder Milk points to members-only websites through which people purchase raw milk online and delivery sites that shift to avoid detection by public health officials. Selling and distributing raw milk and raw dairy products is illegal in New Jersey, and selling it outside of the farm that produces it is illegal in New York. Farms that sell raw milk in New York also must have a permit to sell it.

All people who consumed raw milk and raw milk products from Udder Milk should seek medical care and start treatment to prevent future chronic disease from RB51. The RB51 strain is resistant to some antimicrobials that would normally be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. Therefore, people who consumed raw milk from Udder Milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to this particular strain. Doctors can learn more about testing patients for RB51 and which antibiotics to employ to prevent or cure infection at https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html.

People who have consumed the milk and other products made from Udder Milk raw milk should check themselves daily for fever for one month after they last drank the milk and watch for other brucellosis symptoms for 6 months. These symptoms include muscle pain, lasting fatigue, arthritis, depression, and swelling of the testicles. Untreated _B. abortus_ RB51 infection can result in long-term health problems like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems like meningitis. RB51 can cause severe illness in people with weakened immune systems and miscarriages in pregnant women.

RB51 is a weakened strain of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria used to vaccinate young female cattle. Intensive vaccination campaigns have nearly eradicated _B. abortus_, which can cause abortions in cattle. The bovine vaccine reduces the risk of people contracting brucellosis from infected cows. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure to RB51 is to drink pasteurized milk. The heat of pasteurization kills RB51, other types of _Brucella_, and a variety of other disease-causing bacteria.

Human brucellosis cases in the USA have fallen from about 3000 per year in the 1950s to 100-150 per year in recent years. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA are caused by strains other than _B. abortus_ and occur in people who traveled to countries where the bacterium is more common and drank contaminated milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases who acquired brucellosis in the USA, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposures among lab workers testing samples from ill people.

[Since the initial report of the Texas case, little information has emerged about other cases in Texas or other states, although CDC published "Exposure to RB51 through Raw Milk or Milk Products: How to Reduce Risk of Infection" (https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html):

"People who have consumed raw milk or raw milk products that are potentially contaminated with RB51 are at high risk for brucellosis infection. For these people, symptom monitoring and antibiotics to prevent infection (also called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)) is recommended.

"PEP for RB51 should include:
- doxycycline, in addition to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or another suitable antimicrobial, for 21 days. Those with contraindications to doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should consult with their health care provider.

"Prophylaxis for exposure to _Brucella_ species other than RB51 routinely consists of a combination of doxycycline and rifampin. RB51, however, is resistant to rifampin in vitro and to penicillin, so rifampin and penicillin are not recommended.

"Symptom monitoring
------------------
Routine serologic tests for brucellosis are not effective for diagnosing or monitoring RB51 infections. So those at high risk should be monitored for the development of symptoms of brucellosis. Monitoring should include:
- for 4 weeks from last exposure, check temperature for fever
- for 6 months from last exposure, watch for broader symptoms of brucellosis

People potentially exposed to RB51 who develop symptoms should consult a health care provider.

If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results."

The RB51 vaccine is called an attenuated strain; it is not clear to me how this relates to humans. The following publications seem to address this point, but more recent information seems lacking, ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard and how it relates to the illness presenting in people infected with RB51:

Ashford DA, di Pietra J, Lingappa J, et al. Adverse events in humans associated with accidental exposure to the livestock brucellosis vaccine RB51. Vaccine. 2004 Sep 3;22: 3435-3439.

Abstract:
_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live _Brucella_ vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 per cent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 per cent), and spray exposure of an open wound in 1 (4 per cent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 per cent) people, including 3 (12 per cent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. Seven cases reported no adverse event associated with accidental exposure. Nine cases reported previous exposure to _Brucella_ vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis.

CDC: Human exposure to Brucella abortus strain RB51--Kansas, 1997. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1998 Mar 13;47: 172-175.

Abstract:
On 26-27 May 1997, 9 persons (a farmer, 4 veterinary clinicians, and 4 veterinary students) in Manhattan, Kansas, participated in an attempted vaginal delivery, a caesarean delivery, and a necropsy on a stillborn calf that died because of _Brucella abortus_ infection. The infection was confirmed by isolation of _B. abortus_ from placental and fetal lung tissue cultures. The National Animal Disease Center, Department of Agriculture (USDA), identified the _B. abortus_ isolate from the calf as the RB51 vaccine strain. RB51 is a live, attenuated strain that was licensed conditionally by the Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Before 1996, vaccine was made by using the S19 strain. This report describes occupational exposure to animals infected with the RB51 strain and emphasizes the need for surveillance of unintentional exposure of humans to RB51 to assess outcomes of such exposures.
