Serbia confirms 1st case of H5N1 in rooster
-------------------------------------------
Serbia on Saturday [25 Mar 2006] confirmed its 1st case of the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu in poultry, in an area close to the Bosnian border,
officials said. The rooster was found 10 days ago in the Bajina Basta area,
south west of Belgrade. The results were confirmed by the European Union
reference laboratory in Weybridge, the Serbian Agriculture Ministry said.
The affected area has already been declared a risk zone within a 10 km (6
mile) radius, and veterinarians are monitoring all wild fowl and domestic
poultry within it. Over 30 people in the area were under medical
supervision as a precautionary measure.

1.2 million fowl culled in Israel; PA to kill 80 000 birds in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------
[Israel's] Agriculture Ministry inspectors and Defense Ministry contractors
completed the culling and burial of about 1.2 million fowl suspected of
contracting bird flu in 13 agricultural settlements in the western Negev,
the Lachish region, the Jerusalem corridor, and the Jordan Valley over the
weekend. Culling of poultry on Moshav Amioz in the western Negev is to be
completed on Sunday [26 Mar 2006].
Israel's veterinary services are preparing for the possibility that the
disease could cross over from the Gaza Strip, where the Agriculture
Ministry of the Palestinian Authority [PA] is preparing to cull 80 000 fowl
in the center and the south of the Strip.
Infected fowl were found in 3 different locations in Gaza. [On Sun 26 Mar
2006, 2 additional suspected outbreaks have been added; see item 3, below.
- Mod.AS]
PA officials have taken no concrete steps to deal with avian flu due to
farmers' objection to having their flocks killed without economic compensation.
International officials promised to provide USD 2 million to help the PA
deal with the disease, but it could take several days for the aid to arrive
and the necessary steps to be taken. The World Bank announced it also plans
to continue efforts to raise funds that would offset the losses in the
Palestinian poultry sector, Israel Radio said.
Jordan Valley farmers [in the Kingdom of Jordan] were put on alert after
the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus was confirmed in turkeys being raised
in a backyard in Ajloun, about 65 km north of Amman [For exact location,
see below].
[Israel's] agriculture minister Zeev Boim spoke on Friday [24 Mar 2006]
with his Jordanian counterpart, who informed him of the developments in
Jordan. The heads of the Israeli and Jordanian veterinary services will
meet later this week at the Hussein Bridge to discuss cooperation on the issue.

UN calls for urgent bird flu aid for Palestinians
-------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization urged international donors to provide urgent
aid to the Palestinian Authority to contain an outbreak of bird flu in the
Gaza Strip. "The WHO is gravely concerned about the uncontained outbreak of
avian influenza in poultry farms in the Gaza Strip," said a statement
released by the UN agency in Jerusalem.
It called on the "international community and Israel to promptly support
the PA with financial resources in order to immediately begin the culling
of birds, assist in the provision of compensation for affected farmers and
the procurement of anti-viral drugs as well as to facilitate the import of
alternative sources of protein."
WHO said that in addition to 2 confirmed cases in Juhr al-Deik in the
center of the territory and Rafah in the south, there were a further 2
suspected cases in El-Bureij in the center and Beit Lahia in the north.
"According to the international guidelines, the local authorities should
start containment measures, which include culling birds within a radius of
3 km (2 miles) around the location of the outbreak," it said. There also
needed to be "health monitoring of cullers and individuals with known
exposure to infected poultry farms and administration of antiviral drugs."
"Although the Palestinian Authority has been working on a national
preparedness emergency plan to implement in the event of an avian influenza
outbreak, culling has not started 3 days after the outbreak was confirmed."
The statement blamed both "lack of appropriate equipment" and "lack of
funds within the Palestinian Authority to implement the compensation policy
to affected farmers." It called on the "Palestinian authority to take all
necessary actions to begin implementation of the avian flu containment
measures."
"There are strong reasons to be concerned about the uncontained spread of
the outbreak and the consequences that this could bring to the population
in the Gaza Strip in terms of the economic, environmental and nutritional
consequences," said the agency's head of office for the Palestinian
territories, Ambrogio Manenti.
The deputy agriculture minister in the outgoing Palestinian government,
Azzam Tbeileh, laid the blame squarely on Israel Thursday [23 Mar 2006].
"It's the occupation's responsibility. We don't have vaccines and
protective suits," Tbeileh said. "We are going to maintain the highest
degree of coordination and cooperation with the Israelis, but there are
huge difficulties."
In an interview on Friday [24 Mar 2006], Israeli acting prime minister Ehud
Olmert said every assistance was being offered to the Palestinians in order
to help them deal with the bird flu outbreak. "I have instructed the
foreign and defense ministries to be in touch with the Palestinians and
offer them assistance, including medicine and equipment. I have also turned
to the UN and other international bodies such as the World Bank," he told
the daily.
But cooperation is likely to be hampered by the swearing in on Wednesday
[29 Mar 2006] of a new Palestinian government dominated by the Islamic
militant group Hamas, with which Israel has vowed to have no dealings.

[The 5 outbreaks in the Gaza strip, 3 of which have already been confirmed
by the laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan, Israel,
have affected large commercial poultry farms. Following the expected
culling, such farms might be protected by appropriate measures. But the
main concern, from a public health perspectives, is the presence,
throughout the Gaza strip, of numerous (thousands of) households which keep
backyard (and sometimes in-house) fowl. These are exposed to infection from
various sources, including wild birds, and in close contact with the human
population. - Mod.AS]

Over 20 000 chickens in Kufranjeh to be culled today [26 Mar 2006]
-----------------------------------------------
No new cases of the avian flu were reported in the Kingdom until late
Saturday [25 Mar 2006], after the deadly virus was detected in 4 turkeys in
Ajloun Governorate on Friday [24 Mar 2006], a senior Health Ministry
official said.
The government decided yesterday [25 Mar 2006] to include the entire
Kingdom in the deadline issued to Jordan Valley residents.
Last Thursday [23 Mar 2006], the government gave families in the Jordan
Valley who raise poultry in their backyards one week to get rid of them,
after which the authorities will start collecting these birds and culling
them, Khalid Abu Rumman, head of the technical committee told The Jordan Times.
The infected turkeys were found in a house in the Kufranjeh area of Ajloun.
Teams from the ministries of health and agriculture and municipalities are
destroying birds within a 6 km radius of Kufranjeh. In addition, they are
vaccinating birds within a 10 km radius of the village. So far, more than
2500 birds in the area have been culled.
Stressing that there were no cases of human infection, Abu Rumman said 22
people who lived in the farm and had direct contact with the birds tested
negatively for the H5N1 virus.
At a press conference on Saturday [25 Mar 2006], Minister of Agriculture
Akef Zu'bi said the possibility of discovering more cases of the virus in
Ajloun Governorate will decline by Monday [27 Mar 2006] morning, the Jordan
News Agency, Petra, reported.
"The incubation period of the virus is 72 hours. Therefore, if no new cases
are reported in the governorate by Monday [27 Mar 2006], it means there is
no spread of the virus in the area, Abu Rumman explained.
Referring to the collection and culling of birds, Zu'bi said pet birds kept
indoors would not be included. Only chickens, doves and turkeys will be
affected because they live in open places and are not well-protected;
therefore they are the most likely to come into direct contact with
migratory birds and contract the virus, Zu'bi said.
Ajloun Governor Ahmad Shayyab said that more than 20 000 chickens in 4
poultry farms in Kufranjeh, would be culled today [26 Mar 2006], Petra
reported. In central Jordan Valley, the Public Works and Housing
Department, in cooperation with local municipalities in the area, have
started digging trenches (3 metres deep, 15m long, 10m wide) close to
poultry farms in the area, which contain more than 100 000 chickens,
officials said.
"We are making advance preparations so if the deadly virus is detected in
the area, we will cull the poultry and bury them in these trenches," Petra
cited Central Jordan Valley district governor Hakam Faouri as saying.
In the capital, the Greater Amman Municipality decided to close its 3 bird
gardens in Amman: Prince Hashem Bird Garden in Shmeisani, Prince Hamzah
Bird Garden in Marka and the Hitteen Bird Garden in Ras Al Ain. Meanwhile,
Amman governor Saed Wadi Manasir took a decision on Saturday [25 Mar 2006]
to prohibit the breeding of poultry and doves in houses and on rooftops,
Petra reported.

Palestinians cull chickens to contain H5N1 bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
Palestinian agriculture officials began poisoning 15 000 chickens in the
Gaza Strip on Monday following an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus. The culling began after the World Bank offered to donate USD 2
million to compensate the farmers, who had been reluctant to put down their
chickens without recompense. Israeli agriculture officials were assisting
their Palestinian counterparts with equipment and professional advice.
Israel has put down more than one million turkeys and chickens in the past
2 weeks after an outbreak of the virus at 6 farms, most of them near the
Gaza Strip. Israel says the virus has for the time being been contained on
its side of the border.
"There will be compensation but I hope it will be fair and enough to make
up for my loss," farmer Samir al-Masri told Reuters by telephone. The
chickens would be poisoned and their carcasses dumped in deep pits,
officials said.
There have been no confirmed cases of the virus infecting humans in Gaza or
the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians seek statehood. An outbreak in
the West Bank has so far been limited to a Jewish settlement under Israeli
control.

[The Jordanian authorities are to be commended for their rigorous disease
control activities, which -- it is to be hoped -- will lead to H5N1
eradication.
Kufranjeh (synonyms: Kefrenji, Kefrenjy, Kufrinja, Kufrinjah, Kufrinje,

south west of Ajloun, 14 km east of the Jordan valley, at 23 km
air-distance from Beqaot, the Israeli settlement on the opposite, west side
of the Jordan river, where avian influenza was detected in turkeys on Wed
22 Mar 2006. The relative proximity of the 2 locations, among which no
contacts are known, both located within the Jordan valley -- a major flyway
-- might give room for speculation that a common, migratory-birds origin of
the infection might be in the background. This could be further
investigated by molecular sequencing of the isolates from both outbreaks,
comparing them with other recent isolates from the region. So far, no
isolates have been obtained from wild birds in Israel, Jordan or the
Palestinian Authority territories. - Mod.AS]
