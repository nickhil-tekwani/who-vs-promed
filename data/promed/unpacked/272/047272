A 6-month-old baby succumbed to a deadly mosquito-borne disease in Bihar on Thursday [9 May 2013], taking the toll from the disease to 3 in 2013, and 16 children have been admitted to hospitals in Muzaffarpur, officials said. The 6-month-old died of suspected acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), at Sakra Referral Hospital, Muzaffarpur Civil Surgeon Gayan Bhusan said.

AES is a severe case of encephalitis characterised by inflammation of the brain. The mosquitoes transmit the infection causing high fever among the children. All the 3 deaths have taken place in Muzaffarpur.

Earlier this week, a 4-year-old boy died of suspected AES at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, about 70 km from here. Bhusan said the situation is under control and that there was no need to panic. Last week, a one-year-old girl died of suspected AES at the hospital in Muzaffarpur. It was the 1st death suspected to be caused by AES reported in Bihar.

Bhusan said that, so far, 16 children with symptoms of AES were admitted to various hospitals in the district in the last 10 days. "Every year, encephalitis hits Muzaffarpur, Gaya and other neighbouring districts in May or June. But this year [2013] it seems to have hit a little early," a health department official here said. Last year [2012], AES killed nearly 240 children in Muzaffarpur and Gaya districts. In April [2013], the state government launched a special vaccination drive to cover 1.8 million children against encephalitis.

Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral form of encephalitis. Only about 0.4 percent of cases of Japanese encephalitis result in acute encephalitis. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The patient's central nervous system is affected. This results in fever and/or a sudden onset of mental issues like seizures, confusion, disorientation, etc. Mortality is usually high among children.

Acute encephalitis syndrome is a severe case of encephalitis characterised by inflammation of the brain. The effect on the patient's central nervous system results in fever and/or sudden onset of mental symptoms like seizures, confusion, disorientation, etc. It can be caused due to bacterial or viral infections of the brain, toxic substances or increased complications of an infectious disease.

[Encephalitis cases can be expected to increase significantly over the coming 3-4 month period in northeastern India. Encephalitis cases normally increase during the monsoon season. So far this year (2013), acute encephalitis (AES) has claimed 38 lives and affected 118 people even before the onset of the usual disease season.

Interestingly, cases of encephalitis have occurred this year (2013) in several locations in eastern India. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20130402.1615081) stated: "Encephalitis cases have already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year [2013], totalling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as Japanese encephalitis [virus infections]." There have also been cases in neighboring Bangladesh this year (2013).

AES has been attributed in part or entirely to Japanese encephalitis [JE] virus infections in northeastern India, as indicated in the above report. However, in some instances, JE virus infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. The above report does not indicate whether the 3 reported cases have been laboratory confirmed as JE virus infections. Without knowing the specific etiology of the encephalitis cases above, targeted control measures will not be possible. Fortunately, the effective Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine provides an opportunity for prevention of some of these cases if applied before the main transmission season arrives.
