Nearly 1000 birds have died at wastewater treatment plants in Canterbury after an outbreak of botulism. Hundreds of waterfowl including ducks, teal, and geese have been found dead at a [wastewater] treatment plant in Kaiapoi, with more discovered at other sites in Waimakariri and Christchurch.

The Kaiapoi plant's shallow ponds and wetlands are home to between 5000 and 6000 birds, including mallards, paradise shelducks, black swans, teal, and the New Zealand shoveler. Officials estimate around 960 birds have been killed by the disease over the past month, accounting for almost 20 per cent of the population.

Authorities insist they are doing all they can to manage the situation and maintain the plant is safe, but say there is nothing they can do to halt the disease's impact. Gerard Cleary, utilities and roading manager at Waimakariri District Council, said the council was looking at whether there was more it could do to reduce future risk. "It is a natural process and is certainly not something for people to be alarmed about. It is just an ongoing issue in New Zealand and we are not the only region that has it."

Outbreaks of avian botulism are often sparked by warm temperatures and shallow water with low oxygen content. The disease, which can paralyse and kill birds but cannot be contracted by humans, occurs both across New Zealand and worldwide.

Numerous cases have been recorded in the North Island this year [2018], from Auckland down to Matamata and Lake Rotokawa, near Taupo. Cleary said the Kaiapoi outbreak first occurred in late January [2018], with botulism found in the plant's 6 oxidation and wetland ponds. "Birds eat the maggots of other birds that have got it and then they have it. That is the biggest risk, so removing birds is the best practice. For the last fortnight we've been removing them daily other than when we couldn't because of the weather during the ex-tropical cyclone. Prior to that we were removing them several times per week."

Specialist contractors catch the birds and incinerate the carcasses, but are often hampered in their efforts when birds move out onto the water. Netting the ponds was impractical, Cleary said, and ecologists had advised against driving birds away because of the site's importance as a habitat. "It's a great environment and ecologically a very important environment for flocking, mating, and moulting of some birds," Cleary said. "If we were to actually try to exclude the birds from the treatment plant overall we would be doing them a disservice. It would actually reduce the environment that's available for them."

MB, who took footage and complained to the council about the issue, claimed there was "no excuse for it. In this day and age in a man-made environment we shouldn't have botulism, not with the technology we have got. They have got the technology to make [the water] drinkable," he said. "Nothing happens quickly, and in the meantime our bird life carries on dying. I just want something done, to make people sit up and then do something."

A Christchurch City Council spokeswoman said "a number" of dead wildfowl had been found at its oxidation ponds, and staff were removing the birds in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease.
