You should add the following information to the Bali rabies notes:

Human or equine rabies immunoglobulin is, for all practical purposes,
not presently available in Bali. The supply of WHO-approved tissue
culture rabies vaccines also cannot be assured. Travelers likely to be
engaged in high risk activities for potential exposure should consider
receiving pre-exposure rabies vaccine prior to their departure.

If a traveler does incur a rabies exposure in Bali, the nearest
facilities that are able to provide reliable post-exposure treatment
are in Singapore, Bangkok and Australia, All of these can be reached
by direct daily flights.

***Post exposure prophylaxis (treatment) is an emergency and should be
undertaken as soon as possible after exposure.***

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Wilde for providing this additional
practical advice for travelers intending to visit the island of Bali
in the immediate future, and we fully endorse this statement. - Mod.CP]
