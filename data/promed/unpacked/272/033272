Classified in the notifiable diseases category, measles has resurfaced and is causing concern to the population.

Already in the Prefecture of Labé during the 7th epidemiological week, 6 cases have been recorded, (Samples from) 3 were taken and sent to the central level, and are awaiting to be sent to Conakry. The epidemic has not yet been confirmed. The measles virus is mainly passed in the air so that the population is, therefore, recommended in case of cough or cold not to face people, and to put a handkerchief in front of the mouth.

The majority of the cases are in children but we have cases in adults as well.

For the time being, the 6 cases listed are in Hafia, Noussy; 2 under prefectures affiliated to Labé, and the 2 remaining cases have signaled themselves in the heart of the urban commune notably in Pounthioun and Donghol.

[Labé is the main city and administrative capital of the Fouta Djallon region of Guinea. It has a population of about 200 000. It is the 2nd largest city in the country after the capital Conakry in terms of economic importance. Labé is situated some 450 km [279 m] northeast of Conakry close to the geographic centre of Guinea.

There is no information in this report on vaccination status in the country. - Mod.LK]

A total of 4 more cases of measles have been confirmed by health officials in the Halifax area, bringing the total number of known cases in Nova Scotia to 7.

Last week [week of 12 Feb], the Nova Scotia Health Authority notified the public about 3 people who had become infected, saying it was the 1st time in 9 years that the highly contagious infection had been reported.

In an update [Thu 23 Feb 2017], the medical officer of health, Dr. Trevor Arnason, said all of the current cases involve young adults. Arnason said it's not surprising that more cases have been found given how contagious the virus is. "At the same time, it's a positive sign that the number remains low and we've had good success following up with contacts of individuals who have contracted measles," Arnason said in a news release. He said the risk to the general public remained low and that most people are protected by being vaccinated. The authority said of those people identified, "some were immunized fully or partially and some were not," although no numbers were provided.

It noted people born in the 1970s to early 1990s may have received only 1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in childhood and are eligible for a 2nd dose of the vaccine at no cost through a publicly funded immunization program. Arnason said that as part of the authority's investigation, some organizations and businesses have been made aware of information they can share with their staff and clients about measles symptoms and about what to do if they develop into an infection.
"It's important to quickly identify those who have symptoms so that precautions can be taken to prevent the spread of measles and follow up with as many people as possible who may have been exposed," he said. "This also gives us an opportunity to look at immunization history and support individuals in getting vaccines up to date."

In an e-mail, the authority said vaccination has been shown to be highly effective, with the efficacy of a single dose given at 12 or 15 months of age estimated to be 85 to 95 percent. With a 2nd dose, the effectiveness for children approaches 100 percent.

It said outbreaks do occur in populations with high immunization coverage rates, and at least 95 percent of the population needs to be immunized to develop herd immunity.

Measles symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, sleepiness, irritability, small white spots on the inside of the mouth and throat, and a blotchy rash on the face that spreads down the body.

Pakistan Pediatric Association President Dr Jamal Raza told Geo News measles is a fatal disease which can be prevented by getting the affected child vaccinated 1st in 9 months and for the 2nd time in 15 months.

According to health experts, measles is a contagious disease which can spread from one child to the other through touch, which is why parents should be careful.

The officials of Pakistan Pediatric Association have alerted the authorities concerned, saying if an anti-measles drive is not started at the earliest, the disease will take the shape of an epidemic as a majority of the areas in Karachi have a child affected by measles or any other disease.

Although measles outbreak occurs every now and then in the region, no programme has been carried out since the past one year in interior Sindh or Karachi to prevent children from being affected by the disease.

Switzerland is on track to see the most cases of measles in years in 2017. Vaccinations are on the rise, but the government recently admitted its eradication strategy has failed.

In 1987, the Federal Health Office announced a vaccination strategy that it hoped would eradicate measles by the year 2000. Seventeen years after that deadline, the vaccination rate lies at 87 percent, below the 95 percent that the World Health Organization deems a target for eradication.

Daniel Koch, head of the infectious disease unit at the Federal Health Office, told swissinfo.ch that "the number of people who are vaccinated has been consistently rising, but we're not yet where we want to be".

Over the past several decades, Switzerland has had significant outbreaks roughly every 4 years. In a long-term outbreak between 2006 and 2009, Switzerland reached the highest measles rate in Europe with 4371 registered cases.

To date, Geneva is the only canton [cantons are member states of the Swiss Confederation] to have reached a 95 percent vaccination rate. French-and Italian-speaking cantons have generally been more successful than the German-speaking part of the country at increasing the vaccination rate and reducing cases, a fact that Koch partially attributes to lasting effects from anti-vaccine movements several decades ago.

"There were more vaccine critics active in German-speaking Switzerland in the 1980s who very strongly resisted vaccinations," he said. Children born at the time may not have received the measles vaccine as a result. Koch points out that, today, more than half of measles cases are in adults older than 20. "It's hard to motivate young adults to go to the doctor and get vaccinated," he said. However, the vaccination rate among young adults did rise from 77 percent in 2012 to 87 percent in 2015.

Measles is the most contagious infectious disease known in humans. There is no cure but a vaccine has been available since the 1960s. In 2000, the disease killed more than 700 000 people worldwide, but by 2010 that number had decreased to 160 000 because of better preventative measures.

Still, a look at measles cases worldwide shows that the disease continues to affect countries all over the world.

[Measles is a highly transmissible disease. As long as individuals choose to forego vaccination of their children for unsubstantiated reasons perpetuated by anti-vaxxers, there will be cases of this vaccine-preventable disease. Up to 90-95 percent of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population. According to the WHO, by the end of 2015, 85 percent of the world's children had received 1 dose of measles vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 160 countries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/). Up to 61 percent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to national immunization schedule. This is not sufficiently high to prevent transmission. - Mod.LK
