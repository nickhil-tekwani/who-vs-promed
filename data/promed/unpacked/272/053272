[ProMED-mail posting "Bluetongue - Europe (41): BTV-8, Netherlands,
France" included the following moderator's comment:

"The BTV-8 season has already started in Germany (where, as we have
unofficially noted, several additional outbreaks have been recorded
since 21 Jul 2008), Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. Allegedly,
the virus has been maintained in culicoid vectors, which have
overwintered, mainly indoors. Does/will this happen on the British
Isles as well?! Information from there will be welcomed, as well as
an update from Spain, where BTV-8 was initially recorded (in the
northern province of Cantabria) in January 2008."

The following response has been received from the Entomology and
Modelling group, Arbovirology Programme, Institute of Animal Health
(IAH), Pirbright, Surrey, UK. - Mod.AS]

In reply to the request for information:

The concept of the "seasonal-free" period is discussed at length in
the EFSA document Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Animal Health
and Welfare (Question No EFSA-Q-2007-201), which was adopted on 19
Jun 2008
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/cs/BlobServer/Scientific_Opinion/ahaw_op_ej735_bluetongue2008_en,0.pdf?ssbinary=true>.

In the UK during winter 2007/8, the "vector-free" period (VFP) was
maintained from 20 Dec 2007 - 15 Mar 2008. In 2008, over 350 clinical
report cases of disease suspicion have been negated by the community
reference laboratory at IAH Pirbright, and no further evidence of BTV
transmission by _Culicoides_ in the UK has arisen (as of 13 Aug
2008). In addition, conformation of ELISA-positive samples detected
during the VFP as part of pre-movement testing yielded RT-PCR CT
values that were consistent with historic infection prior to the
declaration of the VFP.

The only country to declare a new case of bluetongue virus (BTV)
infection during the winter of 2007/8 was Germany, where a single
animal was found to develop clinical signs of bluetongue (BT) and
subsequently tested positive for the virus on 10 Feb 2008 (see EFSA
document for further information). This animal was kept indoors, and
it is assumed that infection occurred as a result of transmission via
_Culicoides_ surviving indoors during the winter. Various aspects of
this single case are at present unclear, including the degree of
enclosure when stabling, the number of animals kept in the stables,
the infection prevalence within the housed ruminant populations and
the abundance of vector _Culicoides_ present in close proximity to
livestock. These details would be useful in assessing how this risk
might translate to other scenarios in other countries. It is clear,
however, that the ability to declare a VFP in the UK led to a huge
but as yet un-quantified benefit to stakeholders in reducing both
economic impact and animal welfare issues associated with movement
restrictions [See comment]. At present, the impact of adult vector
_Culicoides_ survival inside stables upon the likelihood of BTV
overwintering remains unknown, as does that of reported
transplacental transmission, and both these potential routes require
further investigation.

On the website, in addition to providing wing photographs of all
_Culicoides_ species commonly found in the UK and an introduction to
their taxonomy, distribution maps of the species have also recently
been provided in most cases. These are largely historical, being
recorded by Dr John Boorman as part of the IACR Rothamsted moth
trapping survey during the 1980's, but additions have also been made
as part of current vector surveillance schemes operated in the UK by
IAH.

[The above authoritative, firsthand response is gratefully
acknowledged. It is a relief to note that, in contrast to the 2008
situation in continental Europe, no renewed BTV-8 circulation has
been recorded on the British Isles so far.

The advantages related to VPF declaration may deserve a short
explanation. Trade in animals is restricted during the vector
activity period because the introduction of viraemic animals into
BTV-free areas will enable the establishment of virus circulation
through the infection of vectors feeding on the introduced carrier
animals. Only animals testing negative to infection are allowed
movement. However, during the VFP, such restrictions and conditions
are alleviated or discontinued, leading to significant economical
benefits, benefits to trade, as well as to the animal welfare aspects
related to such restrictions.

It remains to be seen whether the current favorable situation in
Britain, namely the absence of BTV-8 circulation, prevails throughout
2008. - Mod.AS]
