The people living in El Geneina camps for the displaced in West Darfur are complaining about the spread of malaria, along with a shortage of affordable medicines.

A joint Sudanese-UN medical team arrived in West Darfur last week to assess the outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) in the state. Speaking to Radio Dabanga, an elder of El Riyadh camp said that about 10 months ago, malaria began to spread in the El Geneina camps, "especially among children."

"The health centres in the camps receive about 30 patients per day. Dozens of more patients return home each day without having seen a doctor. Those examined do not find the required medicines in the camps and are not able to pay for the expensive medicines at the commercial pharmacies."

The camp elder appealed to the West Darfur authorities, the Sudanese Ministry of Health, and the UN World Health Organization (WHO) to "support the displaced people's fight against the mosquitoes, and provide affordable medications to the patients."

A joint team from the Sudanese Ministry of Health and the WHO arrived in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, on Thursday [5 Nov 2015] to assess the health situation in the state, which has recorded 210 VHF [viral haemorhagic fever] patients since 29 Aug 2015. 83 of them died.

[We assume that the reported illness is malaria, but with basic diagnostics, it could be a mixture of infections. The last paragraph mentions VHF (viral haemorhagic fever), and camps in Darfur saw an outbreak of yellow fever in 2013 (See ProMED reports below).

There is no reason to doubt that malaria is common; without insecticide treated nets and adequate drugs for treatment, the burden will build up, and a huge reservoir will create further increasing transmission. The use of expired and counterfeit medicines for malaria, as reported by ProMED from Sudan in December 2014 (see below), could play a role in the increasing number of cases. - Mod.EP
