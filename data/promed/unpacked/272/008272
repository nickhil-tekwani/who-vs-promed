The members of 2 families are being treated for trichinellosis in
Baranovichi [Brest Province] hospital. They all experienced malaise, fever,
and face swelling after eating wild boar meat.

The father of one of the families is an amateur hunter and he shared the
game with his friend's family. The specialists said that final confirmation
of the diagnosis is still awaited, but the clinical and epidemiological
leads are persuasive.

[Information is scarce. Wild boar is probably the commonest species of game
causing trichinella infections in humans in Russia. Trichinella infections
in humans are seen throughout Russia and are now also reported from
Belarus. - Mod.EP
