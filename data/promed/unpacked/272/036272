PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (04)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease [abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.)
in ProMED-mail] in the human population, it has been decided to broaden the
scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include other prion-related
diseases. These updates supersede the previous update thread.
The definitions of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, can be found by accessing the Department of Health website
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm> or by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.
Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in these
updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic,
familial, and GSS Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also
when they have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD.
In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living animals
may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - 6 Aug 2007
---------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Aug 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD). This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the
disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK as of Mon 6 Aug 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 161
Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166
(The next table will be published on Mon 3 Sep 2007.)
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on 2 Jul 2007, the
total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains 161. The number of
probable vCJD cases still alive has increased by one, and the overall total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) now becomes 166.
These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in
2006, and so far 3 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 6 Aug 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been 67
referrals, 22 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3
deaths from vCJD, one from GSS and none from familial CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was first diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 992 deaths from all forms of CJD, including the
161 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data are

[2] SEAC position statement
Date: Wed 1 Aug 2007

statement, Jul 2007 [edited]

New forms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy - SEAC position statement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SEAC considered the implications of scientific research on recently
identified novel forms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Background
----------
2. Very low numbers of cattle with abnormal prion proteins (PrPsc) with
different biochemical properties from those normally associated with BSE
have been detected in active surveillance programmes in a number of
countries. SEAC considered (SEAC 97, May 2007) published and unpublished
research relating to these putatively new forms of BSE.
Characterisation of cases
-------------------------
3. Different forms of BSE were initially identified and distinguished from
classical BSE on the basis of their PrPsc profiles in biochemical tests.
All BSE cases identified to date conform to one of 3 different PrPsc
profiles on western blot tests. The European Union (EU) Community Reference
Laboratory has suggested that cases be classified on the basis of these
profiles as classical, L- or H-type BSE. The key distinguishing features in
western blot tests are the lower concentration of the diglycosylated band
and the slightly lower molecular mass of unglycosylated band of PrPsc in
L-type BSE, and the higher molecular mass of the unglycosylated band in
H-type BSE, compared with classical BSE. A western blot method to
discriminate between the 3 types of BSE has been developed.
4. All the reported cases of L- (4,5,6,7) and H-type (7,9,8,9) BSE have
been detected during active surveillance of healthy slaughtered animals or
fallen stock. In the majority of cases, retrospective investigations
indicated tha these animals either showed no clinical signs of BSE or
showed non-specific signs such as ataxia and recumbency. As these cases
have been detected following active rather than passive surveillance, it
has not been possible to observe the clinical signs associated with L- or
H-type BSE in sufficient detail to assess whether there are differences in
the clinical features between L-type, H-type and classical BSE. However, a
significant distinction between classical BSE and L- and H-type BSEs is the
age distribution of cases as L- and H-type BSE are found in older cattle
with an age range of 5.5 to 19 years. One putative L-type BSE case was aged
2 years (6), however the BSE typing of this case has not been verified.
Around 85 percent of L- or H-type BSE cases have been found in animals more
than 10 years old, which is much older than most cases of classical BSE.
5. Neuropathological investigations suggest that PrPsc may be more widely
distributed, with a different brain distribution pattern for L- and H-type
BSE, compared with classical BSE. However, these investigations are limited
by the very low number of animals for which a complete brain has been
available for analysis. There are no data on the peripheral distribution of
PrPsc or infectivity of L- and H-type BSE or on the pathogenesis of these
diseases. However, studies to assess the tissue distribution of infectivity
and PrPsc in animals throughout the incubation period following
intracerebral challenge are underway.
Prevalence
----------
6. As there is no regulatory requirement to specify the type of BSE when
notifying the EU or the World Organisation of Animal Health [Office
International des Epizooties] of BSE cases, it is not possible to
accurately quantify the number of H- or L-type BSE cases that have occurred
worldwide. Information presented to SEAC indicated that at least 37 cases
of L- and H-type BSE have been identified worldwide to date. These cases
are widely distributed geographically with L-type cases identified in a
number of European countries and Japan, and H-type cases identified in a
number of European countries and North America.
7. Due to the different approaches to surveillance between countries,
proportions of animals tested and methods used, which do not necessarily
include systematic molecular typing, these surveillance systems are not
equally capable of detecting L- and H-type BSE. Furthermore, surveillance
procedures, including the most appropriate brain region to sample, have not
been optimised for the detection of L- and H-type BSE. Therefore, it is not
possible to accurately assess and compare the prevalence of L- and H-type
BSE in different countries.
Origins and causes
------------------
8. It is not known whether L- or H-type BSE are newly emerging forms of BSE
or whether they have existed for some time and have only come to light
following extensive active surveillance programmes in the EU and elsewhere,
together with the introduction and development of new biochemical tests.
Studies using historic frozen brain samples from cattle collected from
passive surveillance during the early years of the UK BSE epidemic are
under way to investigate whether L- and H-type BSE existed in the UK in the
past. However, if the prevalence of these BSE types was low, these studies
may not identify many, if any, cases.
9. Genetic analyses of a few L- and H-type BSE cases (4,5,8,9) have not
identified associations between the occurrence of such cases and known
genetic polymorphisms in the prion protein gene. There are no mutations in
the prion protein gene open reading frame in all, but one, sequenced case.
However, the analyses conducted to date are limited by the small number of
cases and controls analysed. Thus, a genetic cause of the disease cannot be
ruled out.
10. No detailed epidemiological investigations have been conducted to
investigate the possible causes for, or links between, L- and H-type BSE
cases. No geographical clusters of L- and H-type BSE cases have been found
to date. Therefore, it is not possible to rule out feed related,
environmental or spontaneous causes for these types of cases.
Transmission studies
--------------------
11. Transmission studies (5,10,11) have demonstrated that both L- and
H-type BSE are transmissible to other species by the intracerebral route.
No studies have assessed the transmissibility by the oral route. Thus, the
available information shows that it is possible for species other than
cattle to develop these diseases upon infection. However, these data do not
allow an assessment of the susceptibility to infection from the most likely
natural route of exposure.
12. L-type BSE has been transmitted to wild-type, bovinised, ovinised, and
humanised mice as well as to cattle and a cynomolgus macaque by
intracerebral inoculation. Incubation periods, clinical signs,
neuropathology as well as the neurological distribution of PrPsc were
distinct from classical BSE (13,12). With the exception of transmissions to
wild-type mice, primary transmissions resulted in clinical disease.
Although primary transmission to wild-type mice did not result in clinical
disease, secondary transmissions from some of these animals resulted in
clinical disease. Sub-passage of L-type BSE in wild-type (12) and ovinised
mice (13) suggests that L-type BSE may be converted to an infection of a
similar phenotype to classical BSE. However, further experiments using
serial sub-passages of infections in a range of species are required to
more fully investigate whether L-type BSE may convert to a disease with a
classical BSE phenotype.
13. H-type BSE has been transmitted to wild type, bovinised and ovinised
mice by intracerebral inoculation with incubation periods, neuropathology
and neurological distribution of PrPsc distinct from classical and L-type BSE.
14. Studies of intracerebral transmission of H-type BSE to cattle and
cynomolgus macaques. To date, clinical disease has developed from one
intracerebral inoculation of H-type BSE to cattle. Oral transmissions of L-
and H-type to cynomolgus macaques are underway.
Human and animals health implications
-------------------------------------
15. There are too few data to enable an assessment of the natural
transmissibility of L- and H-type BSE between cattle, or to sheep or goats.
The present feed control measures which prevent feeding of mammalian meat
and bone meal to ruminants would limit the spread of these forms of BSE to
cattle, sheep and goats should they be transmissible to these species by
theoral route.
16. Similarly, the lack of data on the oral transmissibility of L- or
H-type BSE to humanised mice or non-human primates does not allow an
assessment of the human health implications of ingestion of meat from
animals infected with L- or H-type BSE. The differing clinical features of
L-type and classical BSE in the cynomolgus macaque suggest that if L-type
BSE were ever to be transmitted to humans, its clinical presentation may
differ from that of vCJD. It is possible, therefore, that, if transmitted
to humans, it could be identified by continuing surveillance of unusual
neurological conditions in place in the UK.
Conclusions
-----------
17. L- and H-type BSE have not yet been fully characterised, however data
from biochemical, neuropathological and transmission studies suggest that
L- and H-type and classical BSE may be distinct strains of prion disease.
In contrast to classical BSE, L- and H-type BSE infections are mostly
detected in animals of older age with most of the infected animals
identified to date over 10 years of age. Although L- and H-type BSE may be
diseases that predominantly affect older cattle, it is possible that
infections may occur at a young age and develop over a long period of time.
The origins and possible routes of transmission, if transmissible under
natural conditions, of L- and H-type BSE are not known. Due to the older
age of the cases identified, wide geographical distribution and is possible
they may have arisen spontaneously, however feed borne or environmental
transmission cannot be ruled out.
18. As data on the oral transmissibility of L- and H-type BSE are lacking,
it is not possible to fully assess the animal and human health
implications. However, as the occurrence of L- and H-type BSE appears to be
low, and due to the feed control measures in place, the risk of spread to
other cattle, sheep and goats is likely to be very low assuming that, as
with classical BSE, environmental transmission is negligible. For these
reasons, and because of the BSE control measures in place to protect the
food supply, assuming that the specific risk material controls are
similarly effective for L- and H-type and classical BSE, the risk to human
health is likely to be very low to negligible. However, given the paucity
of data on L- and H-type BSE, a close watching brief should be maintained
on the findings of research in this area.

Source of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease outside United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------------------------
[extracted from the abstract and introduction of a paper by Pascual
Sanchez-Juan, Simon N Cousens, Robert G Will, Cornelia M van Duijn]
In 1996 a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was described in
the United Kingdom. By September 2006, 196 cases had been reported
worldwide; most (162, 83 per cent) occurred in the UK. Laboratory and
epidemiologic studies provide strong circumstantial evidence for a causal
link between vCJD and the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epizootic
in cattle with the most likely route of primary human infection.
In recent years, vCJD has been identified in a number of European countries
with indigenous outbreaks of BSE, including 20 cases of vCJD in France, 4
in Ireland, 2 in the Netherlands, and single cases in Portugal, Italy, and
Spain. A growing number of cases of vCJD have also been identified in
countries outside Europe that have minimal incidence of BSE, including
Japan, the United States, and Canada, and also in Saudi Arabia, a country
in which BSE has not been identified. Several of the non-UK patients,
notably 2 Irish, 1 Canadian, 2 American, and possibly the Japanese patient,
may have been infected during periods of residence in the UK, but most
cases (28 of 34) occurring outside the UK were in persons who had never
visited the UK. Although vCJD cases have occurred in countries with very
low incidence of BSE, no cases have been reported in countries with higher
incidence of BSE, such as Switzerland (460 reported cases of BSE) and
Germany (395 cases). This fact raises questions as to the source of
infection in the vCJD cases outside the UK. Were the patients exposed to
indigenous cases of BSE or to infected bovine material imported from the
UK? An analysis of infection risk in France suggests that the most likely
source of vCJD in that country is imported infected material from the
United Kingdom. In the Republic of Ireland, the transmission of BSE to
humans was estimated to be equally likely from indigenous BSE or from UK
imports. Given the apparently weak association between the occurrence of
indigenous BSE and vCJD in some countries, we studied the occurrence of
vCJD cases outside the UK in relation to the level of imported bovines and
bovine products from the UK during the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.
Accordingly, Sanchez-Juan and colleagues have analysed the occurrence of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) outside the United Kingdom in
relation to the incidence of indigenous bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) and to the level of live bovines and bovine products imported from
the UK during the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Evidence is
presented that a country's number of vCJD cases correlates with the number
of live bovines it imported from the UK from 1980 to 1990 (Spearman rank
correlation coefficient [r/s] 0.73, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI]
0.42�0.89, p<0.001). Similar correlations were observed with the number of
indigenous BSE cases (r/s 0.70, CI 0.37�0.87, p = 0.001) and carcass meat
imported from the UK from 1980 to 1996 (r/s 0.75, CI 0.45�0.89; p<0.001).
Bovine imports from the UK may have been an important source of human
exposure to BSE and may have contributed to the global risk for disease.
