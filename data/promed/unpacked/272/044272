Rift Valley fever outbreak in South Africa
------------------------------------------
Currently there is an extensive outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF)
affecting livestock in South Africa with animal cases reported on
farms predominantly in the Free State Province but also in the
Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga Provinces.
Considerable rainfall has created conditions favourable for breeding
of the mosquito vectors over much of the country, and preliminary
molecular epidemiological findings suggest that the outbreak involves
spread of one of 2 genotypes of the virus which have emerged locally
over the past few years.

As of 15 Mar 2010, there have been 42 human laboratory-confirmed
cases including 2 deaths, with 37 cases from the Free State Province,
2 cases from the Northern Cape and 3 cases from the Eastern Cape. It
is likely that there are more human cases, given that the typical
infection is mild and persons may not present to health centres or be
tested. Contact with infected animal tissues has been identified as
the likely route of transmission with farmers, farm workers,
veterinarians and assistants, and slaughter men being affected.

All patients, with the exception of the 2 fatal cases have had mild
disease with self-limiting febrile illness and myalgia. The 2 fatal
cases presented with multi-organ failure, notably with severe hepatic
dysfunction and markedly raised hepatic enzymes, and profound
thrombocytopenia and bleeding. Investigations are ongoing to identify
any co-morbidity.

The RVF outbreak has occurred in areas where Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) [a tick-transmitted disease - Mod.CP] is
well documented and considering the overlapping clinical and
clinico-pathological features it is clearly critical to consider this
in the differential diagnosis and management of patients, especially
regarding infection control issues.

CCHF was confirmed in 2 patients in the past week. The 1st case, a
farmer from the Free State Province, was confirmed by RT-PCR and
serology. He presented with an acute febrile illness, myalgia,
haemorrhage with profound thrombocytopenia and transaminitis, and had
a good response to ribavirin treatment. The 2nd patient was from the
Northern Cape with a reported tick bite exposure. CCHF was confirmed
by RT-PCR. This patient passed away.

Intensive health promotion and active case finding is ongoing in the
affected areas as well as areas with the potential for spread of the RVF.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Jacqueline Weyer and colleagues for
providing this update on the progress of the current outbreak of Rift
Valley fever in South Africa. Previous reports indicated that the
outbreak was confined to the Free State, but human cases have been
recorded now in Eastern Cape and Northern Cape provinces. In addition
animal cases have been recorded in Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces
and human cases may follow.

Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever are associated characteristically with
persistent heavy rainfall with sustained flooding and the appearance
of large numbers of mosquitoes, the main vector. Localised heavy
rainfall is seldom sufficient to create conditions for an outbreak;
the simultaneous emergence of large numbers of 1st generation
transovarially infected mosquitoes is also required. After virus
amplification in vertebrates, mosquitoes act as secondary vectors to
sustain the epidemic.

Genome analysis has confirmed that this outbreak is associated with
one of the 2 strains of Rift valley fever virus that have emerged
locally in South Africa in recent years. According to Bird et al.
(Journal of Virology, 2007 Mar;81(6):2805-16) Rift Valley fever virus
strains isolated within an epidemic have exhibited little diversity,
whereas those in enzootic settings can be highly diverse. Virus
genetic diversity within epidemics was low (approximately 5 percent)
and primarily involved accumulation of mutations at an average of 2.9
x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year, and with some evidence of sub-unit
reassortment.

Interestingly their Bayesian analysis of Rift Valley fever virus
genetic diversity placed the most recent common ancestor of these
viruses in the late 1800s, the colonial period in Africa, a time of
dramatic changes in agricultural practices and introduction of
nonindigenous livestock breeds.
