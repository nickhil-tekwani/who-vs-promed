[Concern about yellow fever (YF) vaccine availability has been increasing following the large outbreak in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and more recently in Brazil. Because YF vaccine supplies were not adequate to provide full 0.5 ml doses during those outbreaks, a 1/5th fractional dose was used. The abridged report below reviews the situation and proposes measures to be taken. - Mod.TY]

Daniel R Lucey, Kristen R Kent. Boosting global yellow fever vaccine supply for epidemic preparedness: 3 actions for China and the USA. Virol Sin. (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-019-00129-w

In 2016, 2 unprecedented events occurred regarding yellow fever flavivirus infection and vaccine. 1st, in China, 11 persons were diagnosed with yellow fever virus after being infected while working in Angola and returning to China in March-April 2016 (WHO 2016a; Wang et al, 2016; Chen et al, 2016). No transmission within China occurred (Chen and Lu 2016). These were the 1st persons anywhere in Asia known to have laboratory-documented yellow fever infection. 2nd, a global shortage of yellow fever vaccine resulted in the 1st-ever use of a fractional (1/5th) normal dose of yellow fever vaccine anywhere in the world when it was given to 7.5 million people in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in August 2016 (Monath et al. 2016; WHO 2016b).

These 2 events catalyzed multiple reports about the potential risk and implications of yellow fever epidemics occurring for the 1st-time ever in China or anywhere else in Asia where the _Aedes aegypti_ vector for yellow fever and dengue exists - for example, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia and beyond (Wasserman et al, 2016: Baumgaertner 2016; The Economist 2016; Schlagenhauf and Chen 2017; Wilder-Smith and Leong 2017; Lucey and Donaldson 2017; Brey et al, 2018; Shearer et al, 2018; Musso et al, 2018; Wilder-Smith and Massad 2018; Brent et al, 2018). Moreover, this fractional dosing of vaccine in Kinshasa in 2016 signified that if additional outbreaks occurred soon after anywhere in the world - for example, Africa, Latin America or Asia, then shortages of full-dose vaccine would likely occur as well.

WHO created the 1st-ever "Global strategy for eliminating yellow fever epidemics (EYE) 2017-2026" program in September 2016 (WHO 2016d). This program estimated that 1.38 billion doses of yellow fever vaccine would be required to eliminate yellow fever epidemics from endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean (WHO 2016d). This projected 1.38 billion doses of vaccine did not include any doses for Asia, a continent with no prior yellow fever transmission or vaccination campaigns, and, therefore, immunologically-susceptible to yellow fever epidemics.

Of concern, in Brazil throughout 2018 and into 2019, a YF vaccine shortage required use of the fractional (1/5th) dose involving at least 21 million persons (PAHO 2018, 2019). Due to their national vaccine shortage, Brazil was no longer able to export YF vaccine, as they had done for use in Angola and DRC in 2016. Of note, only the Brazilian vaccine has been used for fractional dosing. Thus, vaccine being used outside of Brazil - for example, sub-Saharan Africa, in 2018 was full-dose vaccine.

Actions to boost YF vaccine supply by China and the USA:

We advocate for 3 actions to be taken by the USA and China to help boost global supply of YF vaccine and increase epidemic preparedness and response. 1st, both nations would work with the WHO to have their YF vaccines prequalified. Thus, their vaccines could be used outside their own borders as part of the international stockpile of YF vaccine as traditionally administrated by the WHO, UNICEF and other members of the multi-partner International Coordinating Group (ICG). 2nd, production of this vaccine would be sharply scaled up by both countries. These vaccines could be made available nationally, regionally, and globally through the ICG - for example, to help stop and prevent epidemics anywhere in the world. 3rd, clinical studies would be coordinated with the WHO to assess the efficacy and safety of fractional dosing using 1/5th normal dose and, if needed, even a 1/10th dose.
