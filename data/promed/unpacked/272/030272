The dog flu has been confirmed in the Greater Cincinnati [Ohio] area.

Petsmart [pet store] told WLWT in a written statement there have been "several confirmed cases of canine influenza" at its Mason Petsmart location, also home to Banfield Pet Hospital. The animal superstore began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process and expects to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp Wednesday [29 Jul 2015].

A Mason resident took her 6-month-old dog to the Petsmart location on Mason Montgomery Road last week and was told about dog flu. She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. "[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious," she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. "I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything," [the dog owner] said.

Branstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.
"Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing," Branstutter said. "Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it."

Experts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:
- Coughing
- Eye or nose discharge
- Loss of appetite
- Loss of energy

The dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.

Petsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:
"We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.

"Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.

"Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.

"The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and will continue to take precautionary action as appropriate."

Banfield Pet Hospital also released a statement:

"At Banfield Pet Hospital we are a full service general practice that treat pets for a variety of reasons, including respiratory symptoms, and have had a few confirmed cases of canine influenza. This is a highly contagious disease that has hit several regions across the country this year, and we recommend pet owners call their veterinarian to discuss treatment if their dog has symptoms that could be related to canine influenza. In line with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medicine Association, we have taken all appropriate and necessary cautions to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for any potentially contagious illness. The dog flu has been confirmed in the Greater Cincinnati area."
