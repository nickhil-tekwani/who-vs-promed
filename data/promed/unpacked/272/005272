Animal and public health experts will test fruit bats for Ebola
Reston [virus infection] in June [2009] to determine the source of a
non-lethal virus that was transmitted to hogs, an Agriculture
official said on Friday [14 Mar 2009]. The government expects
authorities of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World
Organization for Animal Health (also known by its French acronym OIE)
and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations
to return [at the] end of May 2009 and conduct the tests, Davinio
Catbagan, Director of the Bureau of Animal Industry, said in a briefing.

Mr. Catbagan said the University of the Philippines in Los Banos,
Laguna province and the University of Tokyo had recently tested fruit
bat samples from Polillo island in Quezon province, Mount Makiling in
Laguna, Diliman in Quezon City and the province of Aklan for
[evidence] of Ebola [Reston virus infection]. "That was an initial
investigation, but they did not see any [evidence of Ebola Reston
virus infection]. For now, there should be a lot of studies under the
premise that fruits bats might carry Ebola Reston [virus]," he added.

Early this year [2009], international public and animal health
experts conducted a joint risk assessment on the virus outbreak and
collected blood and tissue samples from hogs in the towns of Pandi in
Bulacan and Manaoag in Pangasinan, both north of Metro Manila and the
virus's suspected source. The team might also collect bat samples
[from hogs] from Palawan and Bulacan, Mr. Catbagan said.

In a separate interview, FAO country representative Kazuyuki Tsurumi
said tests on fruit bats are one of the recommendations of
international experts after a 10-day mission to monitor government
efforts to contain Ebola Reston [virus infection]. Mr. Tsurumi said
fruit bats were suspected as carriers of [other] lethal strains of
Ebola virus. Ebola Reston, which is only found in the Philippines,
had been confined to monkeys, and the latest detection is the 1st
time it has jumped species. Soe Nyunt-U, country representative of
the WHO, said earlier that they suspect fruit bats to be the carriers
of the virus. He added that the Health, Agriculture and Environment
departments would also study the virus's nature and habitat. The
virus, a sub-type of Ebola virus [_Ebola Reston virus_ is now ranked
as a distinct virus species in the genus _Ebolavirus_. - Mod.CP], was
1st discovered in the Philippines in 1989 among crab-eating macaques
being exported to the Hazleton Laboratories in Reston, Virginia.

The government last week completed the 1st large scale
disease-related culling of some 6200 hogs in a Bulacan farm following
a confirmed outbreak.

[Fruit bats have been implicated in the transmission of the African
Ebola viruses, which are responsible for outbreaks of lethal
hemorrhagic disease in the human population. It is not yet certain,
however, that bats are the ultimate reservoir of these viruses.
Nonetheless, it is logical to suspect fruit bats to be the source of
the Ebola Reston virus infection of pigs in some regions of the
Philippines. So far, testing of fruit bats in the Philippines has not
yielded evidence of Ebola Reston virus infection. However, more
systematic and comprehensive surveys, such as those in prospect, are
clearly required.
