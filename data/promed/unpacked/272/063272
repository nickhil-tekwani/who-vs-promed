PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (08)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. These updates supersede the previous
update thread.

The definitions of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, can be found by accessing the Department of Health website
(<http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm>)
or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.

Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in
these updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial, and GSS Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease)
are included also when they have some relevance to the incidence and
etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics -- as of 30 Nov 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJD
referred to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 30 Nov 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 162

Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 4

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, and the number of patients alive is also unchanged.

These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, and so far 4 in 2007.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2007 so far
---------------------------------------------------------
As of 2 Nov 2007 in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been
100 referrals, 44 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic
CJD, 4 deaths from familial CJD, one from GSS, and 4 deaths from vCJD.

CJD surveillance in the UK -- 15th annual report 2006
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The national surveillance programme for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in the UK was initiated in May 1990. In 1999, the National CJD
Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) became a WHO Collaborative Centre for
Reference and Research on the surveillance and epidemiology of human
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In September 2001
the National Care Team was formed, which currently comprises a care
coordinator and a secretary. It is based within the NCJDSU and was
formed in response to concerns regarding the care of CJD patients.

The information provided in this 15th report continues to provide
evidence of a good level of case ascertainment. There has been a
lower number of referrals since 2003 but analysis suggests that much,
if not all, of the decline is due to changes in the number of
referrals who turn out not to be CJD cases. The number of sporadic
cases remains relatively stable (the data for 2006 may still be
incomplete). Detailed clinical and epidemiological information has
been obtained for the great majority of patients. Although the post
mortem rate for patients with suspected CJD has declined, in line
with general autopsy rates in the UK, it remains high (around 60
percent). The number of brain specimens examined in the
neuropathology laboratory for sporadic CJD declined from 52 in 2003
to 32 in 2004 but has remained stable (at 32) in both 2005 and 2006.

In 1990-2006 mortality rates from sporadic CJD in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland were, respectively, 0.89, 0.95, 0.95
and 0.57/million/year. The differences between these rates are not
statistically significant (p greater than 0.6). The mortality rates
from sporadic CJD in the UK are comparable to those observed in most
other European countries and elsewhere in the world, including
countries that are free of BSE. The highest and lowest [standardised]
mortality rates [SMR] from sporadic CJD were observed in the South
West (SMR=132) and Northern Ireland (SMR=77). The variation in the
observed mortality rates between the different regions within the UK
is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.1).

Up to 31 December 2006, there were 158 deaths from definite or
probable variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK. Of these, 112 were confirmed
by neuropathology. A further 7 probable cases were alive on 31 Dec
2006. The clinical, neuropathological and epidemiological features of
these cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent with our
previous descriptions. Risk factors for the development of vCJD
include age, residence in the UK and methionine homozygosity at codon
129 of the prion protein gene -- all 145 clinically affected cases of
vCJD with available genetic analysis have been methionine
homozygotes. The incidence of vCJD is higher in the north of the UK
than in the south. Analysis of the incidence of vCJD onsets and
deaths from January 1994 to December 2006 indicates that a peak has
been passed. While this is an encouraging finding, the incidence of
vCJD may increase again, particularly if different genetic subgroups
with longer incubation periods exist. The identification of
disease-related PrP in the spleen of a clinically unaffected blood
recipient of PRNP-129 MV genotype is not inconsistent with such a
hypothesis. This case, along with the report of the prevalence of
abnormal PrP in the large study of appendix and tonsil tissues,
suggests the possibility of a greater number of preclinical or
subclinical cases in the population than might be indicated by the
present numbers of confirmed clinical cases.

The only statistically significant geographic cluster of vCJD cases
in the UK was in Leicestershire. All geographically associated cases
of vCJD are considered for investigation according to a protocol,
which involves the NCJDSU, colleagues at the HPA [Health Protection
Agency], HPS [Health Protection Scotland], and local public health physicians.

The activities of the NCJDSU are strengthened by collaboration with
other surveillance projects, including the Transfusion Medicine
Epidemiology Review and the study of Progressive Intellectual and
Neurological Deterioration in Children. The collaboration of our
colleagues in these projects is greatly appreciated; the
effectiveness of this collaboration allowed the identification in
2003 of a case of vCJD associated with blood transfusion and the
identification in 2004 of PrPres in the spleen of a recipient of
blood donated by someone incubating vCJD. In 2006 a further 2 cases
of vCJD associated with blood transfusion were identified.

The success of the National CJD Surveillance Project continues to
depend on the extraordinary level of co-operation from the
neuroscience community and other medical and paramedical staff
throughout the UK. We are particularly grateful to the relatives of
patients for their help with this study

[3] Science Magazine paper: A general model of prion strains and
their pathogenicity
Date: Fri 9 Nov 2007

<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5852/930>


[Dr. Mark A. Jensen has drawn attention to the publication of 'A
'general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity.' This
document cannot be summarized here, but interested readers are
recommended to consult this excellent review by Collinge and Clarke.
The abstract and 2 final sections of the paper are reproduced here to
give an indication of the content. - Mod.CP]

A general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity
--------------------------------------------------------
The Abstract of the paper reads as follows:

"Prions are lethal mammalian pathogens composed of aggregated
conformational isomers of a host-encoded glycoprotein and which
appear to lack nucleic acids. Their unique biology, allied with the
public-health risks posed by prion zoonoses such as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, has focused much attention on the molecular basis of
prion propagation and the "species barrier" that controls
cross-species transmission. Both are intimately linked to
understanding how multiple prion "strains" are encoded by a
protein-only agent. The underlying mechanisms are clearly of much
wider importance, and analogous protein-based inheritance mechanisms
are recognized in yeast and fungi. Recent advances suggest that
prions themselves are not directly neurotoxic, but rather their
propagation involves production of toxic species, which may be
uncoupled from infectivity."

The following passages from the text have been selected by the
Moderator to give a flavour of the content and persuade the reader to
read the whole document.

Prion strain stability and mutation
-----------------------------------
"The phenomenon of strain mutation has been recognized for many years
by biological strain typing methods
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF50> 50).
Classically, this occurs when a strain does not "breed true" on
passage in a new host and a distinct strain is propagated. Mutation
may (but does not necessarily) occur on crossing between species and
also on intraspecies transmission where the PrP primary sequence of
the host differs from that of the inoculum, for example, as a result
of intraspecies PrP polymorphism at residue 129 in humans
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF5> 5,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF6> 6,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF49> 49).
In human PrP, residue 129 places constraints on which prion strains
may propagate, but has no measurable effect on the folding, dynamics,
and stability of PrPC, suggesting that its effect is exerted through
conformation of PrPSc, its precursors, or on the kinetics of their
formation
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF51> 51).
Strain mutation may also occur on intraspecies transmission where
host and prion donor have identical Prnp genes: This suggests an
additional effect of background genes on strain selection
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF52> 52,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF53> 53).
Strain mutation can be accommodated within the conformational
selection hypothesis by selection of a novel PrPSc conformer as a
result of host PrPC not being able to adopt the donor PrPSc
conformation. However, the phenomenon poses an important question
about strains. It has been long argued that strains can be
biologically cloned
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF50> 50).
This is performed by serial passage at limiting dilution of an
inoculum such that infection in the next host is initiated by a
single prion. However, some strains are intrinsically unstable,
readily reverting to another strain type, for example, the hamster DY
strain
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF23> 23).
In addition, more than one strain has been isolated from some natural
prion isolates, for example, sheep scrapie
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF54> 54),
and multiple PrPSc types are seen in a sizable fraction of CJD brains
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF55> 55,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF56> 56).
Certainly, a natural isolate shows considerable diversity in terms of
N-terminal cleavage site, and its glycosylation is highly complex and
diverse. Heat-inactivation studies also suggest heterogeneity of
infectious species with thermostable subpopulations within a defined
strain
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF57> 57).
2 (not mutually exclusive) possibilities can be envisaged
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#FIG2> Fig.
2B): (i) A strain can exist as a molecular clone and strain mutation
involves generation of a distinct PrPSc type; (ii) strains consist of
an ensemble of molecular species (containing a dominant PrPSc type
recognized on Western blot and preferentially propagated by its usual
host) from which a less populous subspecies may be selected by an
alternative host (whose propagation is most favored in that
environment), resulting in a strain shift. Given the degree of
molecular diversity observed in prion isolates, (ii) seems more
plausible. The degree of diversity may also be strain dependent, with
some strains approaching clonality in some hosts. Different cellular
populations within a single host would also offer different
environments for strain selection. It has long been argued that
infection of a host with a "lymphotrophic strain," which rapidly
colonizes lymphoid tissues with a long latency before neuroinvasion,
is in part due to the need for selection of a "neuroinvasive strain"
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF58> 58).
Indeed, differences in PrPSc type in different peripheral tissues are
well described in vCJD, in which prion colonization of lymphoid
tissues long precedes neurological disease
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF59> 59,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF61> 61).

"Essentially, a "prion" may be considered a rare subtype of PrP
polymer that has the appropriate properties and replication kinetics
to overcome and evade host defenses and propagate exponentially.
Other, nascent prions are rapidly degraded in vivo and disappear. The
crucial role of host selection on the ensemble that exists in a prion
inoculum may be why it remains so difficult to demonstrate generation
of synthetic prions. In vitro-generated "synthetic prions" may
consist overwhelmingly of species that will be rapidly eliminated in
a host. This would explain why highly purified PrP amyloid fibrils
are apparently of low specific infectivity."

Can prion infectivity and toxicity be uncoupled?
------------------------------------------------
"What is the cause of cell death in prion neurodegeneration? PrPC
loss of function is not a sufficient cause: PrP-null mice (Prnp0/0)
are essentially normal
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF62> 62).
That adaptation during neurodevelopment in Prnp0/0 mice might
compensate for loss of PrPC function, while loss of PrPC function in
the developed brain by its sequestration to PrPSc might still be
deleterious, is excluded by targeted PrPC depletion in neurons of
adult mice
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF63> 63).
However, conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is clearly central to
pathogenesis because Prnp0/0 mice are resistant to prion disease and
do not propagate infectivity
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF64> 64,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF65> 65).
So, is PrPSc neurotoxic? In vitro neurotoxicity of PrPSc and short
PrP peptides has been reported
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF66> 66,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF67> 67),
but several lines of in vivo evidence argue against direct toxicity:
There are prion diseases in which PrPSc levels in the brain are very
low (<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF68>
68, <http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF71>
71); the distribution of PrPSc deposits does not necessarily mirror
clinical signs, and PrPSc is not directly toxic to neurons that do
not express PrPC
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF64> 64,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF65> 65,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF72>72,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF73> 73).
Furthermore, knockout of neuronal PrPC expression during established
brain infection completely protects mice from development of clinical
disease, prevents neuronal loss, and reverses early spongiform
neuropathology and behavioral abnormalities
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF74> 74,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF75> 75).
Notably, this recovery occurs despite continued PrPSc production and
prion replication in glial cells, such that PrPSc and prion titers in
brain reach levels seen in end-stage disease in conventional mice
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF74> 74).
So, do neurons need to express PrPC and/or replicate prions
themselves for toxicity to occur? Various mechanisms have been
proposed, including aberrant signaling mediated by cross-linked cell
surface PrPC and altered PrPC trafficking and topology
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF76> 76,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF79> 79).
These alternatives are challenged, however, by the phenomenon of
subclinical prion infection in wild-type animals. Such carrier states
are sometimes established on prion inoculation of a 2nd species
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF80> 80,
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF82> 82).
Wild-type mice, with normal neuronal PrPC expression and topology,
inoculated with Sc237 hamster prions propagate mouse-adapted prions
and yet live a normal life span without clinical disease. Prions
propagate slowly but eventually reach titers (and levels of PrPSc)
seen in end-stage conventional clinical disease
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF80> 80).
However, 2nd passage of these prions in mice or hamsters results in
conventional transmission with short incubation periods and 100
percent lethality
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF80> 80)."

General model
-------------
"How may all these phenomena be brought together? The recent
experimental evidence for these emerging concepts now allows a
general model for mammalian prions to be proposed (table S1), which
accommodates the known phenomena of exponential propagation of
infectivity, strain diversity and mutation, transmission barriers,
and the uncoupling of infectivity from neurotoxicity, while remaining
within the constraint of requiring only a single polypeptide to
constitute all strains of infective and toxic species.

"Essentially, the phenomena of prion disease pathogenesis can be
explained in terms of the kinetics of prion propagation, determined
by interplay between prion strain type (dominant PrPSc polymer and
its ensemble) and tissue/host environment (PrP sequence and
expression level, modifier genes, and clearance mechanisms);
selection of preferred conformers determines transmission barriers.
Neurotoxicity is mediated by a PrP species, PrPL, distinct from PrPSc
but catalyzed by it, and occurs when PrPL concentration passes a
local toxic threshold. Rapid propagation (with a host-adapted strain
and normal or high levels of host PrPC expression) results in severe
neurotoxicity and death at strain-specific incubation periods. Slow
propagation (after infection across a transmission barrier or with
low host PrPC expression) results in low neurotoxicity and prolonged
and more variable incubation periods or a persistent carrier state.

"The concept of prion strain originated from biological experiments,
but at a molecular level there may be quite distinct infectious PrP
polymers (PrPSc types) that cannot be distinguished by transmission
studies in inbred laboratory mouse lines. Although in practice, the
converse situation of biologically distinct prion strains associated
with PrPSc that cannot be biochemically differentiated by current
methods will also be observed, under this general protein-only model
such biochemical or biophysical differences in PrPSc must exist, and
the model would predict that differences would be observed with more
discriminating molecular methods, challenging the historical primacy
of biological classification of prion strains."

Wider implications
------------------
"The impressive advances made in the field of yeast prions have
clearly established a much wider biological importance of prion-like
processes and have allowed direct experimental confirmation of
molecular mechanisms proposed from work with mammalian prions.
Understanding these phenomena will illuminate processes involving
protein misfolding and aggregation, and protein-based inheritance,
which clearly have far-reaching implications in pathobiology, aging,
and the evolution of cellular processes. However, mammalian prions
are distinctive. They are lethal pathogens par excellence -- indeed,
it is hard to think of other examples of infectious diseases with 100
percent mortality once the earliest clinical signs have developed.

"Prions raise troubling questions in evolution. In particular, how
did prions evolve as such potent pathogens, complete with the ability
to infect from the environment and travel to the brain? Conventional
pathogens have evolved complex mechanisms to enable pathogenesis and
evade destruction. If prions are composed purely of a polypeptide
encoded by the host, how can they evolve? In essence, it seems that
they had to arise de novo as an intact pathogenic system, and it is
tempting to speculate that prions therefore represent malfunction of
an evolved normal activity that has yet to be elucidated. That prions
can encode information required to specify different discrete
phenotypes opens up the possibility, perhaps likelihood, that other
protein-based inheritance systems will have been exploited for
benefit in mammalian evolution.

"The more common neurodegenerative diseases also involve accumulation
of aggregates of misfolded host-encoded proteins. It has long been
speculated that some of these, and indeed other amyloidotic
conditions, might be at least experimentally transmissible. Recent
work has shown that brain extracts containing beta-amyloid deposits
taken from either Alzheimer's disease patients or transgenic mice
expressing beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) induced
beta-amyloidosis and related pathology when injected into the brains
of presymptomatic APP transgenic mice
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5852/930#REF85> 85).
The induced amyloidotic phenotype varied with host and source of
agent, reminiscent of prion strains. It is interesting to speculate
that distinct strains of beta-amyloid may develop spontaneously in
Alzheimer's disease and might contribute to phenotypic variability in
patients. The possibility exists, therefore, that the general model
proposed here may have wider relevance in other diseases involving
protein misfolding and aggregation.

High titers of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy infectivity
associated with extremely low levels of PrPSc in vivo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
-----------
"Diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease
in humans and ruminants relies on the detection in post-mortem brain
tissue of the protease-resistant form of the host glycoprotein PrP.
The presence of this abnormal isoform (PrPSc) in tissues is taken as
indicative of the presence of TSE infectivity.

"Here we demonstrate conclusively that high titers of TSE infectivity
can be present in brain tissue of animals that show clinical and
vacuolar signs of TSE disease but contain low or undetectable levels
of PrPSc. This work questions the correlation between PrPSc level and
the titer of infectivity and shows that tissues containing little or
no proteinase K-resistant PrP can be infectious and harbor high
titers of TSE infectivity.

"Reliance on protease-resistant PrPSc as a sole measure of
infectivity may therefore in some instances significantly
underestimate biological properties of diagnostic samples, thereby
undermining efforts to contain and eradicate TSEs."
