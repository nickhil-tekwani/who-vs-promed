An adult resident of Liberty County, Georgia has died after contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. There is no way to verify exactly where the virus was contracted, and everyone is encouraged to take precautions against mosquito bites.

EEE is a mosquitoborne virus that causes swelling of the brain. In horses, it is fatal 70 to 90 per cent of the time. Horse and large animal owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against the virus and to clean out watering sources, such as buckets and troughs, every 3-4 days to prevent mosquitoes from breeding there.

EEE is rare in humans; however, humans are susceptible to the virus. Previously, there have been 2 cases of EEE in the 8-county Coastal Health District since 2010, with one death in 2018. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most people infected with EEE do not show illness. Symptoms in severe cases of EEE include a sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The primary mosquito that transmits EEE breeds in freshwater swamps.

The Coastal Health District encourages everyone to follow the 5 Ds of mosquito bite prevention:
- Dusk/Dawn. Mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn. If you can, avoid going outside at dusk and dawn to reduce your chance of being bitten.
- Dress. Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin. If the mosquitoes can't get to your skin, they can't bite you.
- DEET. Any skin that is exposed should be covered with an insect repellent containing DEET [N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide], which is the most effective repellent against mosquito bites. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label regarding how to apply and how often to reapply.
- Drain. Mosquitoes need standing water for breeding, so be sure to empty any containers holding stagnant water, such as buckets, barrels, flower pots, and tarps. Be especially mindful after a rain, and toss any standing water to discourage mosquito breeding around your home.
- Doors. Make sure doors and windows are in good repair and fit tightly. If you have screens on your windows and doors, be sure to fix any rips or tears so mosquitoes can't get through the screens and into your home.

One of the best ways to prevent mosquito breeding and the spread of mosquitoborne viruses is to get rid of standing water around the home and in the yard. Residents are urged to clean up around their homes, yards, and communities and get rid of unnecessary items that can hold water and turn into mosquito breeding grounds by using the "Tip 'n Toss" method. After every rainfall, tip out water in flowerpots, planters, children's toys, wading pools, buckets, and anything else that may be holding water. If it holds water and you don't need it (old tires, bottles, cans), toss it out. It's also a good idea to change water frequently in outdoor pet dishes, change bird bath water at least twice a week, and avoid using saucers under outdoor potted plants.

For containers without lids or that are too big for the Tip 'n Toss method (garden pools, etc), use larvicides such as Mosquito Dunks© or Mosquito Torpedoes© and follow the label instructions. These larvicides will not hurt birds or animals. In addition, clean out gutters, remove piles of leaves, and keep vegetation cut low to prevent landing sites for adult mosquitoes.

[There is little specific information about the adult with EEE or the situation in which the infection was acquired. There was evidence of EEE virus transmission in Georgia earlier this year (2021) when the virus was found in mosquitoes in June. Human and equine EEE occur sporadically in Georgia. There were equine cases and a human case in Georgia in 2019.

People should heed the advice offered above by the Georgia Department of Public Health for avoiding mosquito bites. A commercial vaccine is available for equine animals but not for humans. Owners of equine animals should vaccinate them. - Mod.TY
