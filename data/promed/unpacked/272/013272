Apple fire blight hits 90 percent of orchards
---------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia apple growers are fighting an outbreak of fireblight that threatens next year's [2015] crops. The bacterium likely arrived with tropical storm Arthur [in July 2014] and has affected nearly every orchard in the province. Thousands of new trees have been badly damaged.

Chris Duyvelshoff, Crown agency Perennia, said it was a dire situation. "The worst we've ever experienced here in Nova Scotia. Over 90 percent of the orchards are affected in some way," he said.

Pruning in the weeks after Arthur helped limit some of the damage on mature trees but the new ones were too small to survive. "We are talking roughly in the neighborhood of about 10 000 trees industry-wide," he said.

Apple growers hope the worst of the blight is over, and that some of the trees will recover to bear fruit next year [2015].

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind (as reported above), water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers) and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk.

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.
