----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the suggestion by Dr Benjamin, "to look at a hybrid immunization approach which utilizes acellular vaccine for the 1st 3 or even 4 doses (ages 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months) to confer immunity while avoiding the adverse event more common in infancy, with a whole cell vaccine administered at 4-5 years of age, when the vaccine is better tolerated, thus conferring longer lasting immunity", I would like to refer to the excellent study by Sheridan and co-workers (1). These authors show that the 1st vaccine used to prime the infant immune system largely determines the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations. This study suggests that, in contrast to what Dr Benjamin suggests, for the 1st vaccination a WCV [whole-cell vaccine] should be used, or a vaccine (to be developed) which primes the immune system in a similar way as the WCV.

Another important intervention is, of course, maternal vaccination which has been shown to be safe and very effective in the UK (2, 3). Indeed, in the short term, this seems to me the only measure possible to protect infants too young to be fully vaccinated.

Finally, the resurgence of pertussis is probably multi-factorial, whereby the limited duration of immunity conferred by current vaccines is aggravated by pathogen adaptation (4).

Giving DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis] vaccine first and then DTwP [diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis] vaccine is not the solution because this leads to linked-epitope suppression (the recipient will never see the many other protective antigens that are in whole cell vaccines). The 2012 Sheridan paper in JAMA demonstrates this (see http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1273011). In addition, DTwP is less well tolerated with increasing age. There is no available licensed DTwP in the USA.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Mooi and Cherry for their expert comments regarding pertussis immunization. I am honored to have 2 esteemed experts in the field directly comment on current pertussis vaccination and the role it has played in the upswing in _ Bordetella pertussis_ infections.

The Sheridan paper, a letter to the editor in JAMA (Sheridan SL, Ware RS, Grimwood K, Lambert SB: Number and order of whole cell pertussis vaccines in infancy and disease protection. JAMA 2012; 308(5): 454-6; available at http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1273011) is reproduced below:

To the Editor: Due to their lower rate of adverse events, acellular pertussis vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis; DTaP) replaced whole cell vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis; DTwP) in many developed countries during the 1990s. DTaP became available in Queensland, Australia, in 1996 and replaced DTwP for publicly funded primary course immunizations delivered at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months in March 1999. This meant children born in 1998 could receive a primary course consisting of only DTwP, only DTaP, or a mixed schedule.

Similar to North America (1), Australia is experiencing a sustained pertussis epidemic (2) with the highest incidence rates in Queensland during 2011 in children aged 6 to 11 years. The recent changes in pertussis epidemiology may be related to the shift from DTwP to DTaP. To test this hypothesis, we compared pertussis reporting rates by primary course vaccination in the 1998 birth cohort.

Methods
-------
Reporting pertussis cases to the health department is mandatory in Queensland. For children born in 1998, we calculated pertussis reporting rates in both the preepidemic (1998-2008) and outbreak periods (2009-2011), by number and order of DTwP doses given before their first birthday. We linked data from the Queensland vaccination register (QVR) with case reports of pertussis. The QVR is not a population-based register so we could not construct a group of wholly unvaccinated children for comparison. Children were censored following initial reporting. We calculated average annual incidence rates, incidence rate differences, incidence rate ratios, and 95 percent confidence intervals using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). The Queensland Children's Health Services ethics committee approved the study.

Results
-------
Of 58 233 children born in 1998 identified in the QVR, 40 694 (69.9 percent) received at least 3 doses of any pertussis-containing vaccine during the 1st year from a Queensland vaccine service provider and were included in the analysis. Overall, 267 1st pertussis cases were reported from this cohort between 1999 and 2011; 2 2nd reports were excluded.

Children who received a 3-dose DTaP primary course had higher rates of pertussis than those who received a 3-dose DTwP primary course in the preepidemic and outbreak periods (Table and Figure [available at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Among those who received mixed courses, rates in the current epidemic were highest for children receiving DTaP as their 1st dose. This pattern remained when looking at subgroups with 1 or 2 DTwP doses in the 1st year of life, although it did not reach statistical significance. Children who received a mixed course with DTwP as the initial dose had incidence rates that were between rates for the pure course DTwP and DTaP cohorts.

Comment
-------
Infant priming with DTwP was associated with a lower risk of subsequent pertussis than DTaP only primed children in this cohort. This difference persisted for more than a decade, being evident in preepidemic and outbreak periods. A primary course using even a moderately effective DTwP vaccine may be more protective than DTaP (3). In the preacellular era, Australia used a locally produced DTwP vaccine with very good to excellent effectiveness (4). Our findings suggest the most important factor, in this cohort, may be the initial vaccine received.

It is unlikely our findings during the current outbreak are the result of detection bias because this would require health care-seeking behavior, or the likelihood of laboratory testing or reporting, to be associated with the primary course received by children over a decade previously.

Possible explanations for our findings could include antigenic shifts in circulating Bordetella pertussis strains (2) or the different immune responses from acellular and whole-cell priming (5). The lesser protection provided by DTaP, both as the initial vaccine or full primary course, may be due to linked epitope suppression, when the initial exposure locks in the immune response to certain epitopes and inhibits response to other linked epitopes on subsequent exposures (6).

The challenge for future pertussis vaccine development is to address the benefit-risk trade-off highlighted by our study, and to develop vaccines that induce long-lasting protection from the first dose, without the adverse events associated with DTwP use.
