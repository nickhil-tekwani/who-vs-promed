INFECTION CONTROL - TURKEY
==========================
Date: Friday, 14 June 1996 10:04:34 EDT
From: HAKANLE%TROMUNI@vm.ege.edu.tr

My duties include being Associate Professor of Clinical
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Associate Medical Director of
the Ondokuz Mayis University Hospital, and Chair of Infection Control
Committee at the same hospital.
Our hospital is 600-bed teaching hospital. We have two hospital infection
control nurses.

These are the problems which we have:
Gram negs - the multiple resistance pattern of Gram negative organisms
MRSA - the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococci is 34%
- 25% of our community-acquired _S. aureus_ isolates are now MRSA
MDR Tb - the rate of multiresistance to _M.tuberculosis_ (4 drugs) is 4%
PNR - 20% of our pneumococci are penicillin resistant.

I wonder, do we need another listserv for discussing hospital infection control?
I need a hospital infection control program to arrange our data.
If anyone can help me in this matter I will appreciate it.
[WHONet is the WHO software for handling & reporting antibioitic resistance
data -- see WHONET: Drug Resistance Surveillance promed-1994 archive.122094
