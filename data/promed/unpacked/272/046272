Outbreaks of Salmonella associated with Roma tomatoes - USA, Canada, 2004
-----------------------------------------------
3 outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections associated with eating Roma
tomatoes were detected in the USA and Canada in the summer of 2004.
In one multistate USA outbreak during 25 Jun - 18 Jul 2004, multiple
_Salmonella_ serotypes were isolated, and cases were associated with
exposure to Roma tomatoes from multiple locations of a chain
delicatessen. Each of the other 2 outbreaks was characterized by a
single _Salmonella_ serotype: Braenderup in one multistate outbreak
and Javiana in an outbreak in Canada. In the 3 outbreaks, 561
outbreak-related illnesses from 18 states (Figure 1) [for figures,
see original URL - Mod.LL] and a province in Canada were identified.
This report describes the subsequent investigations by public health
and food safety agencies. Although a single tomato-packing house in
Florida was common to all 3 outbreaks, other growers or packers also
might have supplied contaminated Roma tomatoes that resulted in some
of the illnesses. Environmental investigations are continuing.
Because current knowledge of mechanisms of tomato contamination and
methods of eradication of _Salmonella_ in fruit is inadequate to
ensure produce safety, further research should be a priority for the
agricultural industry, food safety agencies, and the public health
community.
Multiserotype salmonella outbreak - multistate
-----------------------------------------------
In July 2004, a total of 429 culture-confirmed, outbreak-associated
salmonellosis cases were identified in 9 states (Maryland, Michigan,
Missouri, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and West Virginia); these cases occurred among persons
eating at delicatessen chain A sites, with symptom onset during 2-27
Jul 2004 (Figure 2). The median age of patients was 35 years (range:
1-81 years); 52 percent were male. No deaths occurred, but 30 percent
of patients were hospitalized. These cases yielded _Salmonella
enterica_ serotypes Javiana (383), Typhimurium (27), Anatum (5),
Thompson (4), Muenchen (4), and Group D untypable (6).
State and local health departments, in collaboration with CDC,
conducted a case-control study, which included 53 case-patients and
53 well meal-companion controls. Of the 53 case-patients, 47 (90
percent) ate Roma tomatoes, compared with 24 (48 percent) of the
controls. Multivariate analysis data demonstrated a strong
association with consumption of Roma tomatoes (adjusted odds ratio =
7.1; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-34). Delicatessen
chain A had purchased pre-sliced Roma tomatoes from a single
processor for all of its 302 stores in 5 states. Serotype Anatum,
with a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern
indistinguishable from that of 5 cases in 4 states, was isolated from
pre-sliced Roma tomatoes sampled at a delicatessen chain A site on 13
Jul 2004.
Roma tomatoes were removed from all delicatessen chain A sites on 14
Jul 2004. A total of 22 (5 percent) patients reported illness onset
after 19 Jul 2004, outside the incubation period for salmonellosis.
These illnesses might be explained by factors such as continued Roma
tomato use, poor recall, low infectious dose, food saved and eaten
later, or secondary transmission.
_S. enterica_ serotype Braenderup outbreak - multistate
-----------------------------------------------
In the summer of 2004, a total of 125 confirmed cases of serotpye
Braenderup infection with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern were
identified from 16 states (Delaware, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa,
Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin); patients had illness onset during 18 Jun - 21 Jul 2004.
The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 0-84 years); 66
percent were female. No deaths occurred, but 20 percent of patients
were hospitalized.
State and local health departments, in collaboration with CDC,
conducted a case-control study among persons aged 15-60 years. A case
was defined as infection with serotype Braenderup yielding the
outbreak PFGE pattern, with illness onset after 15 Jun 2004. Controls
were enrolled through sequential-digit telephone dialing by using
patients' area codes. A total of 38 case-patients and 79 controls
were included. Patients were more likely than controls to have eaten
out multiple times during the 5 days preceding illness onset (53
percent versus 34 percent) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; CI = 1.0-4.7). A
higher proportion of patients than controls ate cheese, lettuce, and
tomatoes outside the home, but these differences were not
statistically significant. Using meal information from 27
case-patients and 29 controls, restaurant managers were asked about
specific types of cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes used in dishes eaten
by customers. Roma tomatoes, which were eaten by 41 percent of
case-patients but only 14 percent of controls (OR = 4.1; CI =
1.1-15.3), were the only exposure significantly associated with
illness. These restaurants purchased whole Roma tomatoes from tomato
distributors.
_S. enterica_ Javiana outbreak - Canada
---------------------------------------
7 confirmed cases of _S. enterica_ serotype Javiana infections with
indistinguishable PFGE patterns, but with patterns distinct from the
multiserotype outbreak, were identified from one Canadian province,
Ontario; illness onset occurred during 4-8 Jul 2004. The median age
of ill persons was 28 years (range: 23-36 years). No deaths were
reported, but 14 percent of persons were hospitalized. All patients
ate at the same restaurant. Although a case-control study was not
conducted, Roma tomatoes were the suspected outbreak vehicle, because
Roma tomatoes were the only common food exposure among all patients.
Traceback and environmental investigation
-------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in conjunction with state and
provincial food regulatory agencies and state health departments,
conducted traceback investigations of the Roma tomatoes eaten by
patients in all 3 outbreaks. For each outbreak, Roma tomatoes were
traced from restaurants back to distributors, packers, or growers in
the USA. Traceback investigation of tomatoes from the multiserotype
outbreak identified one field-packing operation and 3 packing houses
from 3 states as possible sources. Of these 4 sources, Florida
packing house A was also identified as a possible source for the 2
other concurrent Roma tomato-associated salmonellosis outbreaks
(i.e., the Braenderup and Javiana outbreaks).
Quality-control procedures at the tomato-slicing facility associated
with the multiserotype salmonellosis outbreak were inspected while
the facility was in active operation; no source of contamination was
identified. In addition, serotype Javiana is typically associated
with the coastal Southeast, whereas the slicing facility is located
in the Northeast.
Environmental investigation of 4 packers and 5 associated farms in
Florida and South Carolina during August-November 2004 did not reveal
a clear source of contamination, and the packing houses appeared to
be following food-safety guidance. However, of these 9 facilities,
only Florida packing house A and one associated farm were in active
operation at the time of inspection. Investigations will continue
during the corresponding 2005 growing season.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----------------------
Tomatoes originated in South America, were introduced into Europe in
the 16th century, and are now a popular food worldwide. The Roma
tomato was developed in the mid-1950s as a firmer and more
disease-resistant variety (1). Uncooked tomatoes have become an
integral and nutritious component of the daily diet. Approximately 5
billion pounds of fresh market tomatoes are eaten annually in the
USA, and thus the potential for large outbreaks of Salmonella
infections is a concern. This report describes 3 outbreaks in the USA
and Canada in which Roma tomatoes were implicated; as a result of
these outbreaks, 2004 had the highest number of recorded annual
tomato-associated salmonellosis.
In the eastern USA, tomatoes are grown in natural habitats for many
known reservoirs for salmonellosis, including birds, amphibians, and
reptiles. Salmonellosis has been linked to tomatoes since 1990, when
serotype Javiana caused 176 illnesses in 4 midwestern states (2).
Those tomatoes, and those implicated in a subsequent outbreak in
1993, were traced to a South Carolina packing house.
Cross-contamination might have occurred at the packing house, where
substantial numbers of tomatoes passed through a common wash tank (2).
In 1994 and 1995, a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points program
was implemented at this packing house and disseminated to the tomato
industry (3). The key critical-control point implemented was
maintenance of water quality, specifically monitoring chlorine
levels, pH, and water temperature in the wash tank. Of 7 subsequent
tomato-associated Salmonella outbreaks, 6 have been traced to other
packing houses in the southeastern USA (4, 5). Although produce
packing houses are specifically exempt from the requirements of Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), FDA guidance (6) to the produce
industry encourages GMP controls for water used in packing houses.
However, the extent to which FDA guidance has been adopted by the
industry is unknown. Tomato- associated Salmonella outbreaks reported
to CDC have increased in frequency and magnitude in recent years and
caused 1616 reported illnesses in 9 outbreaks during 1990-2004,
representing approximately 60 000 illnesses when accounting for the
estimated proportion (97.5 percent) of unreported illness (7).
Salmonella can enter tomato plants through roots or flowers (8) and
can enter the tomato fruit through small cracks in the skin, the stem
scar, or the plant itself (9). However, whether Salmonella can travel
from roots to the fruit, or whether seeds can contaminate subsequent
generations of tomato plants, is unknown. Understanding the mechanism
of contamination and amplification of contamination of large volumes
of tomatoes is critical to prevent large-scale, tomato-associated
outbreaks. Contamination might occur during multiple steps from the
tomato seed nursery to the final kitchen. Eradication of _Salmonella
sp._ from the interior of the tomato is difficult without cooking,
even when treated with highly concentrated chlorine solution (10).
Public health professionals should be aware of tomatoes as a possible
vehicle when investigating Salmonella outbreaks. Current knowledge of
mechanisms of tomato contamination and methods of eradication of
_Salmonella sp._ in fruit are inadequate to fully define
interventions that will ensure produce safety. Studies into these
concerns should be a priority for the agricultural industry, food
safety agencies, and the public health community.

[This posting from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report is an
excellent review of salmonellosis and the tomato industry. It is
interesting that these produce packing houses are specifically exempt
from the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), and one
wonders why this is the case. - Mod.LL]
