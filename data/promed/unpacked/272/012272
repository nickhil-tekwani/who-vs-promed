SESA confirmed foot and mouth disease in immunized cattle
-----------------------------------------------
Six cattle farms in the northern part of the country (Esmeraldas)
have been declared in quarantine, because a foot and mouth disease
(FMD) outbreak has been detected in 1000 animals. This is the 2nd
outbreak during this year [2006].
Yesterday [6 Apr 2006], the Ecuadorian Service for Agricultural
Sanitation (SESA; according to its Spanish initials) confirmed this
outbreak when delegates from 11 countries were attending a meeting
held in order to determine the situation of this disease in the
region.
In the report from the 33rd Meeting of the South American Commission
for Fighting Against Foot and Mouth Disease (COSALFA, according to
its Spanish initials), which started yesterday [6 Apr 2006] in
Guayaquil, it is stated that this outbreak had not been reported
because, until yesterday at noontime, SESA Director Mr. Abel Viteri
did not know the results of tests performed in cattle.
Mr. Antonio Lopez, SESA local coordinator for Esmeraldas, confirmed
afterwards that 1000 cattle (50 percent of animals from the 6
surveyed farms) -- whose owners produced documents certificating
their animals had been immunized against FMD -- are affected: 25 of
30 samples were reported as positive. In other farms, 01 campos type
was confirmed.
SESA is trying to control the outbreak and is establishing a
quarantine; no guidance has been given regarding cattle mobilization,
and 1400 animals in the affected area are being re-immunized.
Mr. Lopez pointed out that there might have been problems in the cold
chain for the vaccines, and this may explain how immunized animals
got sick.
Mr. Viteri said that the coast region is a primary endemic area.
During the last immunization campaign, which was completed last
January [last being 2005 or 2006?], 54 percent of all cattle in the
country were immunized.
Ecuadorian territory is not free from FMD. Yesterday [6 Apr 2006],
when using a map in which the situation in South America was
described, it was shown that Ecuador occupies almost half of the
region that still does not totally control FMD.
The COSALFA meeting will continue until today [7 Apr 2006] in the Oro
Verde hotel. Reports on the progress of the Ecuador, Venezuela, and
Bolivia national programs for foot and mouth disease eradication will
be read, and the presentation and discussion of final resolutions
will also take place.
On 6 Mar 2006, a 1st outbreak was detected in San Jose de Minas
Parish, within the Quito area.
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are COSALFA members. Only
Ecuador and Venezuela still have a foot and mouth disease problem.
Bolivia has already overcome this condition, said SESA Director, Mr.
Abel Viteri.
