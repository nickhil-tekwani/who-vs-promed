There is little evidence to support the suggestion that _Angiostrongylus
cantonensis_ entered Australia after the Second World War in association
with the extension of the range of the Giant African Snail, _Achatina
fulica_.
Firstly, _A. fulica_ has only once become established in Australia, near
Cairns in northern Queensland, in the early 1970s. When detected, it was
quickly eradicated and is no longer present anywhere in the country.
Secondly, _A. cantonensis_ is very common in rats in regions of Australia
far to the south of Cairns. Its life cycle was described by Josephine
Mackerras and Dorothea Sandars in 1955 (Australian Journal of Zoology,
3(1):1-21), using parasites collected from rats caught in Brisbane.
Subsequently Manoon Bhaibulaya described a second species, _A. mackerrasae_,
also from Brisbane (Parasitology (1968) 58:789-799). In Australia these
nematodes utilise a variety of molluscs, including native land snails and
introduced slugs, as intermediate hosts. Several rodent species are
infected. _A. mackerrasae_ has only been found in _Rattus fuscipes_ (a
native species) and in the introduced _R. norvegicus_. _A. cantonensis_ has
been found in _R. norvegicus_ and _R. rattus_ - it is possible that _A.
cantonensis_ entered Australia along with these recently introduced rodents.
_A. mackerrasae_ is thought to be an indigenous species.
_A. cantonensis_ occurs at least as far south as Sydney, having been found
in dogs which died here in 1991 (Collins et al, 1991, Australian Veterinary
Journal, 69(7):170-171). _A. mackerrasae_ is probably present in Sydney as
well. I personally found a species of Angiostrongylus in _Rattus fuscipes_
collected in northern Sydney in 1969 and, although the specific identity of
those worms was not determined at the time, Bhaibulaya's observations
suggest that _A. mackerrasae_ is the only species of lung worm found in that
rat.
In view of the extended geographic range (at least 3,000 kilometres) of
these nematodes in Australia, and their documented presence well before the
only known introduction of _A. fulica_, it is most probable that they have
been present for a long time. It seems to be implicit in some of the
discussions dealing with _A. cantonensis_ that, because it was described
from rats collected in Canton, that it must have dispersed from there. At
present there is no evidence either for or against that proposition.

Back in 1981 I was involved in looking at rat tissues from Apia [a port in
Western Samoa; - Mod.MHJ [from where 13 out of 14 had evidence of _A.
cantonensis_ infection in sections of lung and/or heart. I think the rats
were collected near the wharf.
I have copies of some papers by Joseph Alicata, which, although quite old
may be of some help to you:
Alicata,& McCarthy 1964. On the incidence and distribution of the rat
lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis in the Cook Islands, with observations
made in New Zealand and Western Samoa. Canadian J Zoology 42:605-611
Alicata 1964. Parasitic infections of man and animals in Hawaii. Technical
bulletin No 61 Hawaii Agricultural experiment Station
I have a reference to ...
Beck, Cardina & Alicata, 1980, Eosinophilic meningitis due to
Angiostrongylus cantonensis in American Samoa. Hawaii medical J 39:245-257.
I may have some more buried deeper in my files. This investigation was
carried out by WHO personal (Dirk Steichmann I think was one person I dealt
with, memory is a bit unclear now). There may still be some records there.
I think many species of mollusks may be involved as may the contamination of
vegetables by these mollusks.
I hope this is some help.

[While this snail and WWII makes for a fascinating and instructive
epidemiological case study, one should not lose sight of the traditional
seafaring rodent. For example, rats regularly trapped and examined during
1962-75 in the port of New Orleans were negative for this parasite. But
during April 1986 to February 1987 Campbell & Little found some 20+/94
_Rattus norvegicus_ and _0+/20 R. rattus_ live-trapped in the New Orleans
wharves. Interestingly in the Audubon Zoo, close to their trapping area, a
howler monkey died in 1987 with a _A. cantonensis_ meningitis after a short
illness. Subsequently, in 1993 an 11 y.o. boy in New Orleans became ill with
myalgia after eating a raw snail on a dare; his blood test for _A.
cantonensis_ was positive. Latterly in September, 1996, we here at the LSU
Vet School were presented with a six month old miniature horse with a
history of progressive paresis ... necropsy showed an aesinophilic
meningitis and subsequently adult _A.cantonensis_ were recovered;
identification was confirmed by Mike Kinsella, U Montana. The foal had got
infected in Picayune, Mississippi; Picayune is 20 miles inland and some 60
miles NE of the area where Campbell & Little found the infected rats.
I am informed that infected rats have also been identified in South American
and West African ports. Mike Kinsella has suggested that parasitologists
near ports, both coastal & riverine, should make a habit of trapping and
examining rats for this nematode. - Mod.MHJ
