Japan's farm ministry said on [Mon 22 Oct 2018] that the highly contagious African swine fever [ASF] virus was detected in the luggage of a traveler from China at a Hokkaido airport,

Sausages in the passenger's luggage at New Chitose Airport tested positive for the disease, and it is the 1st case of the virus being brought to the country from overseas. No domestic case of infections with ASF virus has been reported thus far.

African swine fever is regarded as more lethal than [classical] swine fever, also known as hog cholera, and there is no effective vaccine to protect swine from the deadly pig disease.

The rapid onset of the disease was reported in China earlier this year [2018], and authorities were anxious about the risk of the infectious disease spreading to other Asian countries including Japan.

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] has called for regional collaboration including stronger monitoring and preparedness measures.

According to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, the passenger arriving on [1 Oct 2018] from Beijing was found to have about 1.5 kilograms of sausages which are prohibited from being brought into the country. The passenger was asked to hand the sausages and they tested positive by the state's genetic test conducted later.

It is unclear whether the heat-processed, vacuum-packed sausages contained any pork produced in China, the ministry said [see comment].

China is a major pig producer and accounts for about half the global population of swine, according to FAO.

It is unlikely that food infected with African swine fever virus will cause an outbreak in Japan unless pigs in the country are fed with infected food.

Both African and classical swine fevers pose no direct threat to human health as they are diseases of domesticated pigs and wild boars, but infections can be devastating to the farm industry.

Last month [September 2018], hog cholera infection was confirmed among domestic pigs in Japan for the first time in 26 years, in the central Japan city of Gifu.

[The media report above includes the statement, "It is unclear whether the heat-processed, vacuum-packed sausages contained any pork produced in China, the [Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries] Ministry said". However, since the traveler came on a flight from Beijing and in view of the spread of the ASF virus in north-Eastern China (and Beijing's location in the midst of the infected area), it seems plausible that the source of the ASF viral particles in the confiscated sausages was in China.

As to the risk of ASF spreading from such introduced materials, in case getting incorporated in Japanese swine feeds, subscribers are referred to page 12 in Ref.1: "Table 2: Survival of ASFV in meat and meat products (Adkin et al. 2004)".

More than an actual spread hazard, this event, and the previous case in S. Korea (see 20180826.5988921) may reflect a wider than recorded dissemination of the pathogen in China. Enhanced alertness in international checkpoints, globally, deserves consideration.

A recent (21 Oct 2018) media report from China informed about the confirmation of a new ASF outbreak in the province Zhejiang, the most south-eastern affected province. The positive sample came from a commercial farm in Sanmen County of Taizhou City (map at https://tinyurl.com/y7qzewqx). The cooperative farm included 2280 hogs of which 56 became ill and died.
