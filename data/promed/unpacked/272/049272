The mother of a Southern California girl diagnosed with rat bite fever is sharing her story at a San Diego hospital Fri 31 May 2019 to educate other parents about the danger. Rat bite fever is a potentially deadly infection spread through contact with domestic rats. An 8 year old from Menifee contracted the disease when the rat's saliva came into contact with an open wound, according to Rady Children's Hospital officials. The girl has eczema on her fingers, which may have contributed to the situation, a doctor said.

Rat bite fever is a bacterial disease which can cause a rash, fever, and body aches. The illness started on Friday night, 24 May 2019, said the girl's mother. By Sun 26 May 2019, there was a fever of 104.6 F [40 C]. She lost the ability to use her hands and arms and had a whole-body rash. "Really, really scary. Really hard to watch," said the mother.

The family bought 2 rats, Shell and Onyx, from a feed store about 2 years ago with no warning about the potential of rat bite fever. Doctors recommended the family get rid of their rats. "We didn't want to do it," said Sabrina. "It's not a fun thing to tell your kid you've got to get rid of your best friend." The mother had a recommendation for other parents. "Just know that this can happen," she said. "Wash your hands."

[The organism that usually causes this infection, _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, is part of the normal oral flora of the rat, just as other potential human pathogens such as _Pasteurella multocida_ and _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ are part of the normal oral flora of cats and dogs, respectively. Zoonoses from pets are a fact of life, whether from a rat, an iguana, a turtle, or a dog or cat.

The following is extracted from MMWR 2005; 53(51 & 52): 1198-202 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5351a2.htm) regarding fatalities with rat bite fever (RBF) in adults:

"Although rapidly fatal pediatric cases of RBF have been described previously (2,3), similar mortality among adults has not been reported. Mortality attributed to severe systemic complications (such as, endocarditis, myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, or multiple organ failure) has been documented in certain adult patients (1,4). Both patients described in this report [MMWR report above] died within 12 hours of presentation, allowing little opportunity for assessment and treatment. These case reports demonstrate that infection with _S. moniliformis_ can cause fulminant sepsis and death in previously healthy adults. As a result, prevention of severe disease might depend on increasing the awareness of appropriate risk-reduction activities and possible symptoms of RBF among persons who have exposure to rats. Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications (1). Because rapid laboratory confirmation of infection with _S. moniliformis_ might not be possible, clinicians should consider initiating empiric therapy for patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history.

"Clinicians should consider RBF in the differential diagnosis for unexplained febrile illness or sepsis in patients reporting rat exposure. Initial symptoms might be nonspecific, but a maculopapular rash and septic arthritis commonly develop (1,5). However, as demonstrated by the cases in this report, patients can have severe disease before the onset of typical symptoms. Despite its name, approximately 30 per cent of patients with RBF do not report having been bitten or scratched by a rat (1,5). Risk factors for RBF include handling rats at home and in the workplace (such as, laboratories or pet stores). RBF is rare in the USA, with only a few cases documented each year (1,6,7). However, because RBF is not a nationally notifiable disease, its actual incidence has not been well described.

"In the cases described here [MMWR report above], diagnosis of RBF was delayed in part because of the inability to rapidly isolate or identify _Streptobacillus moniliformis_. If infection with _S. moniliformis_ is suspected, specific media and incubation conditions should be used (8) (See Box at source URL above). In the absence of a positive culture, identification of pleomorphic Gram negative bacilli in appropriate specimens might support a preliminary diagnosis (1). In the event of an unexplained death in a person with rat exposure, performing an autopsy might also be critical to identifying an etiology.

"Because of the high prevalence of colonization and asymptomatic infection with _S. moniliformis_ among rodents, testing and treatment of rats is not practical. Disease prevention should center on risk reduction among persons with frequent rat exposure. Adherence to simple precautions while handling rats can reduce the risk for RBF and other potential rodent-borne zoonotic infections, wound infections, and injuries. Persons should wear gloves, practice regular hand washing, and avoid hand-to-mouth contact when handling rats or cleaning rat cages (1,9). If bitten by a rat, persons should promptly clean and disinfect the wound, seek medical attention, and report their exposure history. A tetanus toxoid booster should be administered if more than 10 years have lapsed since the last dose (9,10).
