Avian influenza situation in Indonesia - update 7
-------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced 2 new confirmed
cases of human infection with avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus.

The 1st case is a 5-year-old female from Bangli district, Bali
Province. She developed symptoms on 27 Sep 2010, and was first
admitted to a local general hospital on 5 Oct 2011. She died on 9 Oct
2011.

The 2nd case is a 10-year-old male, the brother of the 1st case. He
developed symptoms on 30 Sep 2011, and was first admitted to the
hospital on the same day as his sister. He died on 10 Oct 2011.

An epidemiological investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health
and local health officers indicated that the children lived in an area
with poultry, and both household and neighborhood poultry had died
prior to the children's illnesses. Laboratory tests have confirmed
infection with avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus.

Of the 181 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 149 have been fatal.

[This announcement from WHO confirms that 2 siblings (a 5-year-old
girl and a 10-year-old boy), resident in Bangli district (Bali,
Indonesia) died as a result of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection, and
resolves the confusion about their sexes. The close timing of their
hospitalisations and deaths suggests (but does not prove) that they
were infected from a common source rather than by transmission of
infection inter se.

Their mother is suspected also to have died of avian A/(H5N1) virus
infection later (see: Avian influenza, human (62): Indonesia (BA)
fatal, susp 20111018.3116), but this has not yet been confirmed.
