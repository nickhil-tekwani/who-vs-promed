Foot and mouth disease outbreak in Myanmar's Karen State
--------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of throat disease among domestic buffaloes and cowherds
has been occurring in villages in Kyaikdo sub-Township, in Myanmar's
(Burma) Karen State near Thailand, and many of them are dying from
lack of medicines.
The outbreak started at Azin Village in Kyaikdo sub-Township at the
end of January [2006], and local farmers reported it to the township
veterinary office, but still many animals died from the shortage of
medicines, according to some cattle merchants who visited the
Thai-Myanmar border. Moreover, the disease also spread to areas
around Azin Village.
When DVB contacted the veterinary head office in Rangoon, its
director, Dr. Than Tun, told DVB that his department had received no
report of an outbreak and that there are abundant preventative
medicines to curb the outbreak.
When asked whether there were enough medicines in rural areas, as
there were reports of losses of animals due to the shortage of
medicines, Dr. Tun said:
"Foot and mouth disease is not a fatal disease, and you could control
it. It is not among the fatal diseases, to say it roughly. There
could be a little [mortality] among young animals. Normally, it is
not a disease that could kill instantly. There might be a little loss
of work. They could lose some appetite and won't be able to work
[with] this kind of thing. It is not a fatal disease."
When asked whether enough preventative measures have been taken by
the veterinary authorities to prevent the disease from spreading,
Than Tun only told DVB how effectively one could prevent these
diseases from occurring and spreading.
Moreover, local residents said that one of the reasons for the speedy
spread of the disease is due to local military authorities allowing
black marketers to trade the animals across the border without proper
checks on animals.

[The description of the disease, as provided by Myanmar's Veterinary
Services, is rather accurate. Indeed FMD -- in most cases -- is not a
killer, except in young stock; in bovine, ovine and porcine offspring
under the age of 2 months, mortality can sometimes exceed 50 percent.
The main (and serious!) economic damage of FMD is caused by the very
high infectivity of the virus, spreading -- directly and indirectly
-- to many farms, nationally and internationally, affecting
production and causing suffering to the animals, treatment and
quarantine costs to owners and the industry, followed by an extended
convalescence period.
Confirmation of the suspicions, and, if affirmative, details of the
causative agent (serotype) are needed. - Mod.AS]
