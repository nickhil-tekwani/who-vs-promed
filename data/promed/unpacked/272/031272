A few new breeds of mosquitoes have been turning up around San Diego County according to Chris Conlan, Supervising Vector Ecologist for the County. "The reason we're concerned about these new invasive species is that they have the capability to transmit things like Zika or dengue virus. That's the kind of stuff you normally would associate with a tropical trip," Conlan said.

These new mosquitoes are smaller than the native mosquitoes.

The _Aedes aegypti_, also known as the yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes notoscriptus_ or the Australian Backyard Mosquito, and_ Aedes albopictus_ also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, although very few, have been detected in the County of San Diego.

The yellow fever mosquito tends to bite below the knees, so they are commonly called "ankle biters." All 3 invasive Aedes mosquitoes bite aggressively.

These mosquitoes are not native to California and can transmit viruses that cause Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. But there have been no recent cases of these viruses being transmitted locally in California, according to the California Office of Public Health.

"What makes these kinds unique is they're active all day long even in broad daylight, if it's not too hot. They're very good at breeding in tiny containers found commonly throughout people's backyards," says Conlan.

Conlan says the key to reducing the number of mosquitoes is to get rid of any standing water in your yard. He added that even the smallest amount can create a breeding ground.

County Environmental Health also has mosquito-eating fish available for free and continues to spray areas, where appropriate, to reduce the mosquito population.

While these new pests are appearing in greater numbers this summer [2019], Conlan said West Nile virus, which can be contracted through the bite of native mosquitoes, remains a health concern.

In addition to removing standing water, experts suggest preventing mosquito bites by wearing mosquito repellent when you are outside.

The Center for Disease Control has a list of approved repellents, some with and without DEET.

[_A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes have been found previously in San Diego county. The report of _Aedes notoscriptus_ in the county is new. So far, there has been no local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, or Zika viruses, as noted above, probably because the populations of this mosquito have not been sufficiently numerous to support ongoing transmission.

_Aedes notoscriptus_ was 1st found in California in Los Angeles county in 2014. It poses a different type of risk because it can transmit canine heartworm. Local residents in Sacramento County should heed the advice to eliminate breeding sites of these mosquitoes. However, these mosquitoes can be very difficult to control because they can breed in a wide variety of water catchments, many of which are not easy to find. - Mod.TY
