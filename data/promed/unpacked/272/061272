[In Chirang district,] cardamom orchards [are showing] yellowish-brown hues mixed with a green tint. Many plants are affected, forming yellowish- brown to reddish-brown patches. Leaves have dried up. What has affected the crop remains unknown to many farmers. They claim that it has become a common cause of declining yield. Farmers say that the leaves dry after the roots rot.

According to the [local] agriculture official, the cardamom plants suffer from the attack of microbial agents like fungi due to microclimatic conditions prevailing in the cardamom ecosystem. The agriculture extension officer said that no one has informed him about the infection so far. "Management practices and other remedies to resist the disease could be provided." He said that a similar infection was reported in [the area] in the past. Other factors including direct exposure to sunlight and lack of humidity and moisture also make plants susceptible to diseases.

[A farmer] said, "The disease is wiping out my crop." Another farmer said that the disease has started infecting the crop since last year [2019]. Given the widespread infection, they have lost hope to save the crop. The same disease affected the crops once a long time ago.

[Large, or black, cardamom (_Amomum subulatum_; Zingiberaceae) is native to the Eastern Himalayas growing in cool, moist forest areas and is most likely the crop referred to above. It is a clustering plant with flower buds appearing from the base of the rhizome. Black cardamom is an important commercial crop in parts of India's Darjeeling hills, Bhutan and Nepal. Typically, cultivation occurs in woodland areas with overhead shade and access to regular irrigation.

Another type of cardamom (_Elettaria cardamomum_) called small, lesser, true, Malabar or green cardamom, is an Indian native growing in tropical areas. Other related crops in the family are ginger (_Zingiber officinalis_) and turmeric (_Curcuma longa_). All these crops are highly priced spices and have similar cultural requirements.

A number of fungal and bacterial pathogens known to occur in the region (see previous ProMED-mail posts below) can cause rhizome rots, wilts and leaf blights in these crops similar to what is being described above, either on their own or in coinfections. However, reliable diagnosis is needed for effective management of the problems.
