HAMBURGER GILL DISEASE, CATFISH - USA (02)

Put any fish the size of _Pimphales promelas_ (flathead minnows)
in a beaker with an organism it can swallow and it will eat it. Be it a
hair-like worm 1/2 inch long, mosquito larvae, tubifex worms,
whatever. The real proof of a biological control agent's efficacy lies
in field testing where there is a multiplicity of food sources and in
the reduction of damage caused by the pest.
_Gambusia affinis_ (mosquitofish), for instance, is a mosquito
predator but is also an omnivore. The proof of its value lies not in
the number of mosquito larvae it can devour in an aquarium but in
the number of mosquitoes emerging from the habitat they share
with _Gambusia_. _Gambusia_ is native to Florida, but one does
not see any diminution of the mosquito control programs in the
state because of the presence of _Gambusia_.
_Pimphales promelas_, incidentally, is a prolific breeder and would
also serve as a forage fish for catfish in the farm pond, making it a
doubly helpful fish.
