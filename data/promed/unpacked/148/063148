Doctors have been deployed to prisons in Lodwar [Turkana] to deal with an outbreak of hepatitis B. Prisons Commissioner General Isaiah Osugo told Capital FM News that all members of staff and inmates have been injected with a vaccine to protect them from the disease.

Osugo indicated that officials from the [Turkana] County Government are investigating the source of the disease to contain the spread at the congested facilities. "Yes it is true that there was an outbreak in Lodwar but we are handling it. We are working hand in hand with the County Government and they are assisting in containing the situation," he said.

Osugo explained that the pandemic has already been controlled at the Kamiti Prison [Nairobi] where a prisoner already died 2 weeks ago.

[It is unclear from the post if the cases of hepatitis B infection recognized are all acute infection rather than prisoners chronically infected. The presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core is present in acute disease but classically not in chronic infection.

Superinfection of the HBV-dependent delta virus (HDV) on a HBV chronic carrier can also present like acute HBV infection with high aminotransferase enzymes, high bilirubin, and potential fulminant disease. It is likely that if a cluster of acute hepatitis B infection is occurring in the prison, that injection drug use with reused needles is the cause.
