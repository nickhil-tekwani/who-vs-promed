The [Morris model tested 2 different FMD vaccination strategies:
1. FMD vaccination of cattle in a series of rather narrow, mostly East-West
"bands" across the country, positioned to create a barrier between
FMD-affected and FMD-unaffected areas, with 8000 head being vaccinated in
each specified area per day.
2. FMD vaccination of high density zones in combination with preemptive
slaughter of infected farms in 3 areas of more than 50 infected farms per
100 km2. Within each area 8000 cattle were vaccinated per day.
Any veterinarian with some practical experience in the planning and
execution of FMD vaccinations would have predicted that such strategies
would not work. Vaccines will work if applied on a sufficiently large scale
in geographically well defined areas that adequately cover the spread of
the disease. Few if any outbreaks will occur, once a sufficient level of
population immunity is obtained, usually within a week after completion of
vaccination in the area. Of course, if the disease also affects other
species such as sheep, logic dictates that these species should be included
in the vaccination campaign. There is no need for a computer to predict
that "too little too late" does not work!
One can wonder what the results of the model would be with inputs like "FMD
is now endemic in the sheep population" or "FMD spilled over into the deer
population". Would the application of vaccine then perhaps show an
advantage over contiguous cull? Are the modelers conscious that the modern
vaccines protect the vaccinated population close to 100 percent? A model
will give conventional answers when input parameters reflect conventional
dogmas such as "vaccinated animals become carriers" and "carriers spread
the disease". What happens if these dogmas are shown to be false?
The results of the model are based on depopulation of holdings within 24
hours of FMD confirmation and depopulation within 72 hours of farms within
the preemptive slaughter list. Is this not a very different situation from
the present epidemic, which seems to be smoldering among small ruminants
(and possibly deer?) and where the main diagnosis is based on a rather slow
program of bleeding and serological testing?
Computer simulation is entertaining and a good learning experience. But the
old dictum still is "Garbage in, garbage out". However, since policy makers
tend to accept modelling results at face value, particularly if the results
fit their policy, modelers have a serious socioeconomic responsibility to
make sure that their models and the results are transparent and well
qualified.

[Paul Sutmoller spent a number of years at Plum Island before he moved to
the PAHO Pan American Foot & Mouth Centre outside Rio de Janeiro where he
was the senior virologist for many years and a key member of their team in
developing their successful oil-adjuvant FMD vaccine. I first met him in
1975 at PANAFTOSA when I was on detached duty from MAFF and the centre was
running extensive field trials of the vaccine. - Mod.MHJ

[When announcing the chairs of the various UK enquiries, (Foot & mouth
disease - UK (60): formal inquiries, 20010810.1889) Sir Brian Follett's
name was misspelt. Where & how is uncertain but our apologies are
proferred. The scientific review, chaired by Sir Brian Follett, will be
carried out by the Royal Society and will examine questions relating to the
transmission, prevention and control of epidemics. Sir Brian Follett was
until recently vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, whose academic
background is in bird and mammal physiology with much of his work involving
farm animals. - Mod.MHJ
