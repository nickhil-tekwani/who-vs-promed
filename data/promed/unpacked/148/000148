In the July 12 issue of Science, we report the re-emergence of phocine
distemper virus (PDV) infection in harbour seals (_Phoca vitulina_) in
Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Increased mortality was observed in these
areas and diseased animals showed clinical signs of respiratory and nervous
disease. Samples from necropsied animals were examined for the presence of
PDV by RT-PCR [Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction] and for
morbillivirus-specific IgM antibody. The results showed that PDV was
present in both areas. These findings, together with the known severity of
PDV infection in harbour seals, indicate that PDV infection is the cause of
the ongoing mortality in Northern Europe. Monitoring of the seal population
in the Netherlands for the past ten years by serology and RT-PCR indicated
that PDV has not been circulating in this population after the 1988 outbreak.
Since the manuscript was accepted for publication by Science on 28 June,
several new cases of phocine distemper have been identified, and a total of
1160 dead seals have been found along Scandinavian coasts, and over 50 in
the Netherlands. Histologically, the infection is characterized by
broncho-interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid tissues,
and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions.
The mortality of harbour seals during the 1988 outbreak in the above areas
was estimated at 40 to 60 percent of the population. It is hard to predict
how many seals will die during the current PDV epidemic and will depend on
different factors, including acquired immunity (less than 5 percent
seropositive animals in The Netherlands), pollutant load, and general
health status.

Common seals in northern Europe are again succumbing to a virus which
killed thousands of them 14 years ago. More than 1400 dead seals have been
found along the coasts of Scandinavia and the Netherlands in the last 2 months.
The disease, phocine distemper virus (PDV), attacks the animals'
respiratory systems. Researchers believe few seals in the affected area
have acquired immunity to PDV from the 1988 epidemic.
Reporting their work in the journal Science, they say this outbreak began
in early May on Anholt, an island off the east coast of Denmark where the
earlier epidemic started.[We have omitted information presented in the
authors' posting -- see above. - Mod. AS].
There are no reports of unusual seal mortality in Norway or the Baltic. The
1988 epidemic killed more than 18 000 European common seals, including some
in UK waters. Populations affected included those in Orkney and the Moray
Firth in Scotland and the Wash, in eastern England, where about half the
seals died. The disease appeared in the UK about four months after being
found in Denmark.
Grey seals - which are in fact more abundant than common seals - were also
exposed to PDV in 1988, though few died. They are thought able to carry the
virus.
The lead author of the Science article is Professor Albert Osterhaus, of
the Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre in the Netherlands. He and his
colleagues say: "The current sequence of events parallels the early pattern
of the 1988 outbreak.
"The rapid spread of this high-mortality disease may be explained by the
migratory behaviour of common seals, which may travel hundreds of
kilometres within days." They estimate that in the Wadden Sea, off the
Netherlands, "at the very most, one-fifth of the current seal population
may have specific immunity to PDV resulting from the 1988 epidemic". On the
present outbreak, they conclude: "The recent reappearance of PDV in this
largely susceptible northern European seal population may allow its rapid
spread with devastating consequences."
PDV is a morbillivirus, of the same family as measles, and related to
canine distemper. It attacks the white blood cells, which become more
susceptible to chance infections.
Dr Ailsa Hall is a research biologist at the Sea Mammal Research Unit
(SMRU), University of St Andrews, UK. She told BBC News Online: "We don't
think PDV is a risk to dogs, but owners should keep them away from any dead
seals they find. "It's impossible to say whether this will affect UK
animals - it could still go either way. "We're working with other people,
including the Institute of Zoology's dead cetaceans scheme, nature reserve
wardens, and animal and bird charities, to keep an eye out for any dead or
diseased seals. "Their breeding season finishes around the end of July, and
after that they may start moving around much more."
SMRU says vaccinating seals would be difficult "because there is unlikely
to be sufficient vaccine, and it would require the capture of large numbers
of wild animals".
The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told BBC News
Online it had no plans to vaccinate seals.
