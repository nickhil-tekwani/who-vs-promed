Blackleg Threatens Masvingo Herd
--------------------------------
Blackleg disease has killed more than 500 head of cattle in Masvingo
province since May 2005, and the outbreak is threatening to wipe out
more livestock.
Fears among farmers are that if the government, through the
department, does not intervene urgently, the province's herd could be
wiped out by the deadly disease.
The disease is not seasonal and occurs at any time of the year.
Veterinary sources told The Standard that the department was unable
to stretch its resources to buy vaccines and that the farmers would
have to buy the vaccines themselves.
One of the sources said: "Our funds are limited. We can no longer
afford to provide vaccination to farmers. Even outreach programmes
that we used to carry out for free in vaccinating dogs against rabies
have since stopped ... many farmers can afford the price."
The hardest-hit areas include Gutu, Zaka, Chivi and Bikita. Farmers
who spoke to The Standard expressed concern over the issue.
A farmer from Mashoko in Bikita, Taonga Mukuze, said:" I lost 9
cattle because of the Blackleg disease. The veterinary officials told
us that we could buy the vaccine from their offices but when we got
there, we were told that they were out of stock. I do not know what
to do when the planting season comes because that was my draught
power and my sole means of ploughing my fields."
Masvingo provincial Veterinary director, Charity Sibanda, confirmed
the outbreak.
She said: "Yes there is a Blackleg outbreak in the province, which
has so far claimed the lives of several head of cattle. I am still
compiling the statistics but the figure is around 500 cattle which
have died so far. We are struggling to contain the situation due to
lack of vaccines but with the few we have, farmers are coming to buy,
but some go to private institutions since the government is not
buying for the people."
However, another farmer from Gutu who spoke to The Standard at the
veterinary offices in Masvingo insisted that vaccines were out of
stock and said his cattle were the only form of wealth he has. If the
remaining cattle succumbed to Blackleg, which has killed many cattle
in farms around him, he would be left a poor man.

[Blackleg is an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by
_Clostridium chauvoei_, characterized by emphysematous swelling,
usually in the heavy muscles. _Clostridium chauvoei_ occurs naturally
in the intestinal tract of animals; contaminated pasture appears to
be a source of organisms, which can remain viable in the soil for
many years. The pastures in Masvingo seem to be heavily and somewhat
permanently contaminated (see 2002 references).
Prevalent worldwide and not a zoonosis, blackleg is a not an
OIE-listed disease. Most cases occur in cattle from 6 months to 2
years old; vaccination, if performed according to the prescribed
regime, is safe and reliable. For further details on the disease and
its prevention, see moderator's comment in ProMED-mail posting
