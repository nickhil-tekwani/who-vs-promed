Turkey: Death of Boy not Caused by Avian Influenza Virus
----------------------------------------------------------------
A 14-year-old Turkish boy who died at the weekend was not killed by
avian influenza, the country's health ministry stated. The boy was
initially feared to have died from the same virus that has killed
more than 70 people in Asia. Three of his siblings, who were also
taken ill, have also tested negative for the disease, while tests on
two others have still not been returned.
It is still not clear what did kill Mehmet Ali Kocyigit, officials
said. "The disease is not caused avian influenza virus or any other
influenza virus," Turan Buzgan, a health ministry official, said. The
hospital where the boy was on life support before he died said he had
pneumonia, according to CNN-Turk television, but this was not
confirmed by the ministry.
The dead victim had been admitted to hospital on Saturday, along with
his brother and two sisters, aged from six to 15, after they
developed high fever, coughing, and bleeding in their throats. The
children lived on a poultry farm, where some of the birds had become
sick. They reportedly became ill after eating one of them. The eldest
sister was also reported to be in critical condition. Two other
patients, aged five and 35, were also taken to hospital on Sunday,
the Anatolia news agency reported.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu - which has infected and killed dozens of
people in Asia - has been discovered in bird flocks in Turkey, but no
human cases have yet been detected. Turkey lies on the migration path
of wild birds suspected of spreading the flu westwards from Asia. So
far the disease appears only to have infected people who live or work
closely with birds, but health experts fear it could mutate and
spread among human populations as easily as common influenza.
