Three patients who contracted legionnaires' disease at the University of Wisconsin Hospital (UW Health) have died, CBS Madison affiliate WISC-TV reports. The hospital said on Monday [17 Dec 2018] that the 3 had serious, life-limiting health conditions. Ten other patients who contracted the disease have been discharged and are doing well, according to UW Health. The hospital has confirmed a total of 14 cases during the outbreak.

UW Health announced late last month that there were multiple cases of legionnaires' [disease], a type of pneumonia caused by legionella bacteria, and linked the outbreak to a change in its hot-water system. The hospital flushed the system with high levels of chlorine to eliminate the bacteria. A week later, the hospital discovered the outbreak had affected 11 patients.

The hospital said on Monday [17 Dec 2018] that the strain of bacteria in the new cases of legionnaires' [disease] matched the bacteria in the water system, but the hyperchlorination has been effective. "Testing completed so far continues to show the expected reduction in the bacteria," the hospital said on Monday [17 Dec 2018]. "UW Health will continue intensive monitoring of its water system to ensure patient safety."

The hospital said it's working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review and analyze its work in responding to the issue. A report is expected to be out in about 3 months, according to the hospital.

[The prior ProMED-mail post on this nosocomial outbreak of legionnaires' disease at the University of Wisconsin hospital reported that 3 patients remained in the hospital, and one had been discharged (Legionellosis - USA (15): (WI) nosocomial 20181201.6174859). At that time, all 4 were reported to have tested positive on a urine test, a test that only detects _Legionella pneumophila_ serotype 1 (https://www.uwhealth.org/news/university-hospital-addresses-legionnaires-cases/-w/52370).

Now, the above news report says that 3 of a total of 14 patients are dead.

Legionella are Gram negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing legionella. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described [Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356].

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of legionella organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until legionella becomes undetectable by culture of the hospital water.

The above news report says that the strain of legionella in the new cases of legionnaires' "matched" the bacteria in the hospital's water system but fails to say if matching was based on genotyping or only speciation. Genotyping of clinical isolates of legionella can help identify a common-source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Genotyping of environmental isolates of legionella can help identify the source of the outbreak if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. Matching species would suggest, but matching genotype would confirm, the transmission pathway.

University of Wisconsin Hospital is a 592-bed academic medical center in Madison, Wisconsin; it is an American College of Surgeons-designated Level I adult and pediatric trauma center, one of 2 Level I trauma centers in Wisconsin, and has 6 intensive care units (trauma and life support, pediatric, cardiac, cardiothoracic, burn, neurosurgery) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin_Hospital_and_Clinics). - Mod.ML
