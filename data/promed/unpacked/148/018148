There is definitely an outbreak of dengue here in Barbados. 1600 cases have
been reported as suspected and 360 confirmed. There are many hemorrhagic
cases. Three people have died; a 14 year old boy and two women in their
late 30's. The government is doing little to control the vector as most of
the fogging equipment is broken down. This is an outbreak of type 2, and
following so quickly on the heels of the 1995 epidemic, only children under
2 are safe from a second infection that may lead to hemorrhagic fever.
These figures are just over a week old and were taken from a press release
by the Ministry of Health.

[Can anyone provide information as to the dengue type or types of the
preceding outbreaks? This situation, as elsewhere in this hemisphere,
appears ominous. - Mod.CHC
