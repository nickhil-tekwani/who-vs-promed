Four people, inhabitants of the village of Savchuki of the Radivilovskiy
district in the Rovnenskaya (Rovno [CIA World Factbook calls the region
Rivne]) region, have been placed in the resuscitation unit as a result of
mushroom poisoning, according to the news agency UNIAN.
Three adults in one family and a 5 year old boy have been admitted to the
resuscitation department of Radivilov regional Hospital after ingesting
mushrooms.
So far in 2006, 17 people, including 7 children, have been poisoned by
mushrooms in the Rovno (Rivno) region of Ukraine.

[Interestingly, there seem to be a large number of mushroom poisonings in
this part of the world this time of year. Perhaps it is the method of
harvesting or marketing the fungi that leads to misidentification and the
consequent poisonings. This article does not identify the mushroom, or even
mention the clinical signs suffered by the family, so even guesses are not
possible at this time. - Mod.TG]
