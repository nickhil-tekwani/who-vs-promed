Leptospirosis infection in Karnataka villages
-----------------------------------------------
The mystery disease that has affected 258 people, including 156 women, at
Siddammanahalli village in the Bellary district has been diagnosed as Lapto
Psoriasis [as printed; the disease is, of course, leptospirosis, and the
proper spelling will be used below. - Mod.LL]
On Wed 28 Jan 2006, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Deputy
Director and Microbiologist, Dr. Sohan Lal, said that an unclean and
unhygienic environment, a lack of a proper drainage system, and the
drinking of contaminated water led to the outbreak of the disease. Animals
and rodents were the main carriers of the bacteria that cause the disease.
He said the disease was also prevalent at Yadgiri in Gulbarga district,
some villages in Bidar district, Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh, and some
villages in Maharashtra.

53 new cases of leptospirosis reported in Shahapur
-----------------------------------------------
As many as 53 new cases of suspected leptospirosis have been reported in 3
villages of Shahapur taluk in Gulbarga District. Official sources said here
today [23 Jan 2006] that 38 patients from Kumakanur, 12 from Arjungi and 3
from Bilar are undergoing treatment for symptoms of the infection.
Over 170 patients were treated for leptospirosis in the neighboring Badiyal
and Wonegera villages in Yadgiur taluka in December 2005. Although the
incidence of the disease has been brought under control in Badiyal and
Wonegera, it has now spread to new areas. Sources said there are no primary
health centers in Kumakanur, Arjunagi, and patients have to go to the one
at Wadegera, which is 13 km away, or visit the Yadgir government hospital
for treatment.

[The methods for diagnosis of leptospirosis are not stated nor is the
amount of morbidity and/or mortality associated with this sometimes fatal
infection linked to water contaminated with rodent (or other animal) urine.
Karnataka is one of the 4 southern states of India. Before 1973, the state
was known as Mysore state, as it was formed out of the former Kingdom of
Mysore in 1950 and enlarged in 1956 to include the Kannada-speaking regions
of neighboring states. Karnataka's capital Bangalore is the only city in
the state with a population of more than one million. The Gujarat district
is located in the northeastern part of the state while Bellary is
east-central. ProMED has previously posted outbreaks of leptospirosis from
this area of India. A map of the districts in Karnatka state in southwest
India is available at
