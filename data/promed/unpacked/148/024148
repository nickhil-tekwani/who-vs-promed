Rot takes a high toll
---------------------
Omanawa (Bay of Plenty region) passionfruit growers have lost 70 per cent of their vines to crown rot and crop volumes across the industry are expected to be down 40 per cent after a poor growing season.

[A grower] said it was devastating to see 700 out of 1100 vines die from the disease more commonly known as black leg -- a fungal disease that starts during a cold, wet winter and causes the vine to [die] in spring. "It's devastating and this [cropping] year [2014/15], the industry has lost about 25 per cent of its producing vines."

The New Zealand Passionfruit Growers Association said [that] black leg was a constant problem but the industry had taken steps to learn more about its management. [They] said while it would never be eradicated, it could be brought under control. The majority of growers [are] based in Bay of Plenty.

[The cause of crown rot (also called crown or stem canker, black leg) of passionfruit in New Zealand is considered to be the fungus _Gibberella pulicaris_ (Gp, previously _Fusarium sambucinum_). However, other species of _Fusarium_ have also been found associated with crown rot affected passionfruit vines. Symptoms appear predominantly in winter and include purplish spots on the bark leading to cankers on trunk and stems. Eventually, the trunk is girdled resulting in wilting of the vine, root decay and death of the plant. The disease has been reported to kill more than 80 per cent of new plantings of purple passionfruit each year and has become a serious problem for passionfruit producers in New Zealand.

The fungus is thought to enter the host through wounds. Spores are mainly spread by rain splash and mechanical means. The pathogen's disease cycle is not yet known, but it appears to become inactive when temperatures increase in spring and vines start growing vigorously. For disease management, no effective fungicides have been found to control the fungus. Cultural methods to reduce crown and soil wetness in orchards may be beneficial, but effective control measures are urgently needed. Potential disease resistance of passionfruit cultivars or individual vegetative lines is being assessed.

Gp is also known to affect hops and to be associated with dry rot of potatoes.

In other regions, crown and root rot of passionfruit can also be caused by _Phytophthora_ species.
