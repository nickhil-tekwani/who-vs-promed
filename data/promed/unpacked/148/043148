Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Australia
---------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 8 Mar 2013 from Dr Mark Schipp, Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Canberra, Australia

This particular event began on 14 Feb 2013, and the report is dated 8 Mar 2013, which is also the date it was submitted to the OIE.

This is a listed disease, therefore requiring reporting.

The previous occurrence was on 5 Jun 2013.

This is a sub clinical infection of low pathogenic avian influenza virus. Serotype H5 was diagnosed by the national laboratory, Australian Animal Health Laboratory. The diagnosis was made in birds by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

This outbreak pertains to a defined zone within the country, Henley Brook, Western Australia. The epidemiological unit within Western Australia is a village.

The outbreak was an incidental finding in a backyard flock of 96 birds ducks and chickens. Only one duck is affected. One duck died, but 95 others were destroyed. The origin of the virus is currently unknown.

Tracing and testing of contact birds is continuing. A 1 km [0.6 mi] restricted area has been established around the premises. The N type is yet to be determined.

The event is continuing and weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an orthomyxovirus, or influenza virus and can survive for considerable lengths of time outside of the host. Birds are infected through contact with other birds, mechanical vectors such as vehicles and equipment, and personnel travelling between farms, markets, and abattoirs.

Avian influenza is caused by a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Italy in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenza virus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic.

Strains of avian influenza virus may infect various types of animals, including birds, pigs, horses, seals, whales, and humans. However, wild fowl act as natural asymptomatic carriers, spreading it to more susceptible domestic stocks. Avian influenza virus spreads in the air and in manure and there is no evidence that the virus can survive in well-cooked meat.

Clinical signs of AI include ruffled feathers; soft-shelled eggs; depression and droopiness; sudden drop in egg production; loss of appetite; cyanosis (purplish-blue coloring) of wattles and comb; edema and swelling of head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks; green diarrhea; blood-tinged discharge from nostrils; incoordination, including loss of ability to walk and stand; pin-point hemorrhages (most easily seen on the feet and shanks); respiratory distress; increased death losses in a flock; and sudden death.

Outbreaks of avian influenza in the poultry industry cause devastating economic losses and is generally controlled through extensive culling of infected birds. Alternative strategies also use vaccination as a supplementary control measure during avian influenza outbreaks.

Precautionary requirements include cleaning and disinfection of premises and the establishment of a biosecurity barrier to help prevent spread of disease is essential.
