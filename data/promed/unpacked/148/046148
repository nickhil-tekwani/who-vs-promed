2 more rabies cases reported in Greenbrier County
-------------------------------------------------
More rabies cases have been reported in Greenbrier County, which has the
state's highest number this year. The county health department says 2
raccoons tested positive for the disease earlier this week.

One raccoon was killed in the Cordova area. The 2 dogs that fought with the
raccoon are current on their rabies vaccines and will be observed for 45
days. The other raccoon was found in the Vargo area. It exhibited odd
behavior and was submitted to the state for testing.

Greenbrier County has reported the largest number of rabies cases in the
state this year. The state Bureau of Public Health says 43 cases had been
reported as of 30 Nov 2009.

The Columbiana County Health Department announced on Thursday [17 Dec 2009]
that a raccoon found in Elkrun Township tested positive for rabies and came
into contact with an unvaccinated dog before dying.

According to a press release, there were no known human exposures to the
raccoon, but plans call for the dog exposed to the raccoon to be euthanized
to prevent it from developing rabies and potentially exposing people. The
health department issued a reminder to residents about the importance of
vaccinating pets to protect them from rabies.

"Since pet dogs and cats that roam and hunt can come into contact with
rabid animals and potentially transmit the disease to people, it is very
important to make sure all dogs and cats are up-to-date on their rabies
vaccination which is required by law," the press release said.

Columbiana County's only other positive rabies case this year involved a
bat in the Salem area. There have been 45 rabies cases in Ohio so far in
2009. The health department suggested the following precautions to prevent
rabies:

- avoid contact with wild animals, sick or injured animals, and animals you
don't know;
- food and nesting or hiding places for wild animals should be eliminated
from residential areas;
- pet vaccinations should be kept current and pets should not be permitted
to roam.

If bitten or scratched by a wild animal or a pet, the health department
said to follow these guidelines:

- wash all wounds and contact areas thoroughly with soap and water. Contact
your physician immediately for evaluation.
- call the Columbiana County Health Department immediately to report the
incident; provide an accurate description of the animal.
- try to keep the animal confined, but don't risk further injury if the
animal is dangerous or get the name and address of the animal's owner. [If
the owner's information is on a tag on the pet, then this might be
difficult in such a situation. - Mod.TG]
- keep children away from all animals involved in the incident. For more
information, contact Lori Barnes, environmental director for the Columbiana
County Health Department.

8th case of rabies reported in Davidson County
----------------------------------------------
The Davidson County Health Department reports a new case of rabies,
bringing the total to 8 for the year. On 17 Dec 2009, a dog was in a fight
with a rabid raccoon in Lexington, North Carolina. The dog was not properly
vaccinated and had to be killed, according to animal control. No humans
were exposed.

Animal Control says not to handle your animal with bare hands after it has
had contact with a wild animal. Saliva from the wild animal may still be
present on the domestic animal's fur and, by handling the animal, you may
expose yourself to the rabies virus.

[It is fortunate there was no human being exposed in any of these
situations. It is unfortunate a couple of dogs lost their lives, primarily
because they were not vaccinated. Rabies vaccination is a very cheap
insurance against a very deadly disease for you and your pets.

Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, of the genus Lyssavirus and family
Rhabdoviridae. The bullet-shaped RNA virus has 3 major components: surface
glycoprotein (G protein), outer envelope protein (M or matrix protein), and
nucleocapsid. Rabies virus is transmitted by bite or saliva of an infected
mammal. Any mammal can carry and potentially transmit the virus, but
carnivorous species and bats are usually the agents of transmission

None of these reports identifies the stain, although it is probably the
raccoon rabies in these cases. 5 antigenic variants of rabies strains are
recognized in the United States. The single raccoon strain is the
predominant strain.
