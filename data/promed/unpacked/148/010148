Abstract
--------
Objectives: Characterisation of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for serosurveillance purposes and for treatment options such as transfusion with convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin products derived from convalescent plasma. In this study, we longitudinally and quantitatively analysed antibody responses in RT-PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults during the first 250 days after onset of symptoms.

Methods: We measured antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein in 844 longitudinal samples from 151 RT-PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults. With a median of 5 (range 2-18) samples per individual, this allowed quantitative analysis of individual longitudinal antibody profiles. Kinetic profiles were analysed by mixed-effects modelling.

Results: All donors were seropositive at the 1st sampling moment, and only one donor seroreverted during follow-up analysis. Anti-RBD IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels declined with median half-lives of 62 and 59 days, respectively, 2-5 months after symptom onset, and several-fold variation in half-lives of individuals was observed. The rate of decline of antibody levels diminished during extended follow-up, which points towards long-term immunological memory. The magnitude of the anti-RBD IgG response correlated well with neutralisation capacity measured in a classic plaque reduction assay and in an in-house developed competitive assay.

Conclusion: The result of this study gives valuable insight into the long-term longitudinal response of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.... In conclusion, this study provides insight into the individual dynamics of antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 during up to 250 days after symptom onset. Substantial (several-fold) variation in individual half-lives was observed, with median half-lives of about 60 days for both anti-RBD and anti-NP IgG, and a tendency towards slower rates of decline of antibody levels as time progressed.

[This study lends support to those finding infection leads to long-lasting antibody production following SARS-CoV-2 infection. "It will be interesting to continue following the decline in anti-RBD IgG in time and investigate whether the longevity of the antibody response is similar to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV that can still be detected in most individuals 3 years after recovery." - Mod.LK]

ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] -- Public health impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: scoping review protocol

Just over 6 months ago, in mid-December 2020, the 1st COVID vaccines were rolling off the production line and there was suddenly optimism the tide against the pandemic was about to turn. Then, on 14 Dec 2020, the UK Health Secretary announced a new COVID variant (B.1.1.7) had been detected in southern England (https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/12/uk-health-secretary-announces-new-covid.html). Barely a week later, a 2nd variant was announced (see Matt Hancock announces 1st detection of South African COVID variant [501Y.V2] in the UK), and suddenly the UK was going back into lockdown (https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/12/matt-hancock-announces-first-detection.html).

Since then, the number of variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) has grown into the double digits, as large variant-driven epidemics swept across Brazil and India. A quick end to the pandemic seems no longer [ensured], as some of these variants appeared to be more transmissible, or able to evade existing immunity, or both.

Six months later, new variants continue to appear, and what we know about many of the existing variants is limited. Some seem more susceptible to the current vaccine than others, but it is far from clear how much of a threat they pose.

Today [18 May 2021] the ECDC has published a technical document outlining a review protocol for investigating current (and future) variants, with the aim of producing their 1st review results in June 2021.

Note: Although published today, the cutoff date of this document appears to have been 7 May 2021, as a newly recognized VOC (B.1.617.x) is not addressed (https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/05/who-designates-b1617-as-global-variant.html). While B.1.617.x was not specifically addressed in this review (but will presumably be included in this study), the ECDC did publish a threat assessment brief on COVID variant B.1.617.x last week (https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/05/ecdc-threat-assessment-brief-on-covid.html).

While the details of this investigation are probably of greatest interest to public health officials, [the executive summary is reproduced] below. Those who want to take a deeper dive will want to follow the link and download the full 16-page PDF (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/public-health-impact-sars-cov-2-variants-concern-scoping-review-protocol).

"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified. Some of these variants have mutations that (alone or in combination) may provide the virus with a selective advantage, such as increased transmissibility or the ability to evade the host immune response, or cause possible changes in pathogenicity, thus increasing disease severity.

"Executive summary: On 25 Feb 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the following working definitions to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 variants of the greatest public health relevance:

- Variant of interest (VOI) is phenotypically changed compared to a reference isolate or has a genome with mutations that lead to amino acid changes associated with established or suspected phenotypic implications; AND has been identified to cause community transmission/multiple COVID-19 cases/clusters, or has been detected in multiple countries; OR is otherwise assessed to be a VOI by WHO in consultation with the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group (1 [see ECDC pdf for complete references]).

- Variant of concern (VOC) is a VOI that, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with:
** Increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; AND/OR
** Increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; AND/OR
** Decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics; AND/OR
** is assessed to be a VOC by WHO in consultation with the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group (1).

"As of 7 May 2021, the following SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified:

- Variant B.1.1.7, first reported by the United Kingdom on 14 Dec 2020 (2), is defined by multiple spike protein changes (deletion 69-70, deletion 144, amino acid change N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) (3), as well as by mutations in other genomic regions (4). This VOC belongs to Nextstrain clade 20B (5,6), GISAID clade GR (7,8) and PANGO lineage B.1.1.7 (9,10).

- Variant B.1.1.7 with an additional mutation (E484K) is also designated as a variant of concern.

- Variant B.1.351, first reported in South Africa on 18 Dec 2020 (2), is defined by multiple spike protein changes (amino acid change D80A, D215G, D614G, E484K, K417N, N501Y, and A701V) (11). This VOC belongs to Nextstrain clade 20C (5,6), GISAID clade GH (7,8), and PANGO lineage B.1.351 (9,10).

- Variant P.1, first reported by Japan in returning travellers from Brazil, and later in Brazil, has 11 amino acid changes in the spike protein compared to its ancestral lineage B.1.1.28, 3 of which are located in the receptor-binding domain. Spike protein changes for the variant are L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, H655Y and T1027I (12). This VOC belongs to Nextstrain clade 20B (5,6), GISAID clade GR (7,8) and PANGO lineage P.1. (9,10).

"The potential public health implications of these VOCs need to be understood and assessed, since their increased circulation may affect overall prevention and control strategies employed by ECDC and European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries.

"As a result, ECDC will conduct a scoping review on SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, with the purpose of identifying relevant emerging data that could inform ECDC's scientific guidance and risk assessments.

"Objective and review questions:
- Main question: What is the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs on public health?
- Sub-questions: What has been reported on the potential or confirmed negative impact of VOCs (as compared to previously circulating or co-circulating strains) regarding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, transmissibility, disease severity, immune responses following natural infection and following vaccination, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness?"

Citation: Haldane V, De Foo C, Abdalla SM, et al. Health systems resilience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from 28 countries. Nat Med. Epub 17 May 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01381-y

Abstract: Health systems resilience is key to learning lessons from country responses to crises such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this perspective, we review COVID-19 responses in 28 countries using a new health systems resilience framework. Through a combination of literature review, national government submissions and interviews with experts, we conducted a comparative analysis of national responses. We report on domains addressing governance and financing, health workforce, medical products and technologies, public health functions, health service delivery and community engagement to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We then synthesize 4 salient elements that underlie highly effective national responses and offer recommendations toward strengthening health systems resilience globally.

Building resilient health systems: Our review highlights 6 areas requiring urgent action to build resilient health systems globally.

First, COVID-19 responses provide a clear illustration of the importance of governance supported by scientific evidence and leadership willing to learn and adjust course for successful health systems that protect health and well-being.

Second, health systems need appropriate financing, not only to prepare for new pandemics, but also to ensure that at all times, all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship, regardless of ability to pay.

Third, while country capacities varied, the pandemic has demonstrated a need to invest in improving both the quantity and quality of health workers to better prepare for and respond to future pandemics. Our review highlights that resilient health systems are those that not only invest in pandemic-related planning and training of health workers, but also ensure their physical, mental and economic protection in the workplace and beyond.

Fourth, in terms of access to medicines and products, the pandemic has made visible, yet again, the clearly identified and thoroughly debated challenges to global supply chains for medicines and products.

Fifth, health service delivery, including non-COVID-19-related health services, has been directly threatened, and often compromised, at all levels by the demands of the pandemic, even in traditionally high-performing health systems. Our review emphasizes that bolstering system capacity requires strong and well-funded primary care, with a skilled and protected workforce, to ensure that high-quality care is delivered in communities, with strengthened linkages to public health systems.

Finally, public health functions, such as testing and contact tracing, that are delivered in coordination with the health service system, are cornerstones for successful COVID-19 responses. These approaches often depend on innovative digital technologies, which bear their own challenges, including the potential to exacerbate inequalities and be the vehicle for human rights violations. As such, future investments in these technologies requires a more holistic approach -- one that engages communities, particularly the most vulnerable -- that takes into account the potential risks and considers how health systems can minimize harms from their use.

[Lessons have been learned from the Ebola outbreaks, SARS-1 and most recently SARS-CoV-2. These lessons should be acted upon to ensure and improve preparedness for the next outbreak. We are not at all through COVID, but it would be a tragedy not to seriously take to heart what we already have learned and invest in maintenance and strengthening of the public health infrastructure for the future that is inclusive of all people. - Mod.LK]
