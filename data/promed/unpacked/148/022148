As of 1 Jul 2011, 139 cases of patients with symptoms that may
correspond to chikungunya were reported in the PACA region
[Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur], but only one case of chikungunya was
confirmed, said the Regional Health Authority (ARS) on Wednesday [29
Jun 2011].

In 2010, 76 suspected cases were reported, and 32 were confirmed by
laboratory analysis, 2 of whom were indigenous cases of chikungunya,
which means that the patients were bitten in Provence-Alpes-Cote
d'Azur by the tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_, the vector of these
diseases.

Established for many years in French territories overseas (Indian
Ocean), this mosquito has settled in France in the Alpes-Maritimes
(since 2004), in Haute-Corse (2006), Corse-du-Sud and Var (2007), and
in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and the Bouches-du-Rhone (2010).

The medical community is becoming more alert, and as soon as they
have a concern, they report it, said the regional prefect Hugues
Parant, saying the situation is less alarming than last year [2010]
because there are fewer carriers of the disease. But the situation
should be under close scrutiny because the mosquito multiplies, he
added. "The colonies of these mosquitoes will continue to grow both in
the PACA region and also in Languedoc-Roussillon and Rhone-Alpes,"
warned Dominique Deroubaix, director of the ARS.

Yvon Perrin, of the interdepartmental group for mosquito control on
the Mediterranean coast (EID), said that 80 per cent of breeding sites
were located in private households, and eliminating stagnant water in
gardens and on terraces (flower pots, children's toys, etc.) would be
enough to destroy them.

The PACA region is currently at level 1 of 5 on the plan against the
Asian tiger mosquito, which is under entomological surveillance by the
EID and epidemiological surveillance by the regional health
authority.

Chikungunya symptoms are similar to those of dengue and the flu:
fever over 38 C, body aches, joint pain, bleeding, and headaches.

[Because there is no mention of this being an imported case,
presumably the infection was locally acquired, as apparently were
dengue viral infections that were occurring in this region as well.
One hopes that the rapid response to the appearance of this case will
preclude an outbreak similar to the chikungunya virus outbreak in
Italy in 2007 that also was transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_ (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20071210.3980).
