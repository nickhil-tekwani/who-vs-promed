On 7 Jul 2007 and 11 Jul 2007, public health officials in Texas and
Indiana, respectively, reported to CDC 4 suspected cases of foodborne
botulism, 2 in each state. Investigations conducted by state and
local health departments revealed that all 4 patients had eaten
brands of Castleberry's hot dog chili sauce before illness began.
Botulinum toxin type A was detected in the serum of 1 Indiana patient
and in a leftover chili mixture obtained from his home. CDC informed
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the apparent link between
illness and consumption of the chili sauce. On 18 Jul 2007, FDA
issued a consumer advisory, and the manufacturer, Castleberry's Food
Company (Augusta, GA), subsequently recalled the implicated brand and
several other products produced in the same set of retorts
(commercial-scale pressure cookers for processing canned foods) at
the same canning facility.
Examination of the canning facility in Georgia during the outbreak
investigation had identified deficiencies in the canning process. On
19 Jul 2007, the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) issued a press release that announced a recall of
chili and certain meat products from the Castleberry canning facility
and provided recommendations to consumers. That recall was expanded
on 21 Jul 2007 to include additional canned products. A 5th case of
botulism potentially linked to 1 of the recalled products is under
investigation in California.
This report describes the ongoing investigation by members of
OutbreakNet (a network of public health epidemiologists at the local,
state, and federal levels (including employees of CDC, FDA, and FSIS)
who investigate foodborne and diarrheal disease outbreaks) and others
and the measures undertaken to control the outbreak, which is the 1st
outbreak of foodborne botulism in the USA associated with a
commercial canning facility in approximately 30 years. Clinicians
should be vigilant for symptoms of botulism, including symmetric
cranial nerve palsies, especially if accompanied by descending
flaccid paralysis. Consumers should not eat any of the recalled chili
sauce or other recalled products and should carefully dispose of all
recalled products. Information regarding product disposal is
available at: <http://www.cdc.gov/botulism/botulism_faq.htm>.
Case Reports
----------------
Texas. On 7 Jul 2007, the Texas Department of State Health Services
(TDSHS) reported to CDC 2 suspected cases of foodborne botulism in
children who are siblings. On 29 Jun 2007, both patients had onset of
illness that progressed to include cranial nerve palsies and
symmetric, descending paralysis typical of botulism. The children
initially were evaluated at different hospitals, where multiple
diagnoses were considered. After one child was transferred to the
same hospital as the sibling, botulism was identified as the etiology
of the shared symptoms. The 2 children required mechanical
ventilation; botulinum antitoxin was requested on the evening of 7
Jul 2007, released by CDC, and administered the next morning. Patient
stool and serum specimens, collected 9 days after symptom onset, were
negative for botulinum toxin by mouse bioassay. Initial stool
cultures did not yield _Clostridium botulinum_.
The children had shared several meals in the days before symptoms
began. They had eaten Castleberry's Austex Hot Dog Chili Sauce
Original for lunch on 28 Jun 2007. The opened can from this meal had
been discarded and could not be located. However, an unopened can of
this product, produced on 7 May 2007 at the Castleberry's Food
Company canning facility in Georgia and purchased at the same time as
the discarded can, was found in the children's home. The TDSHS
laboratory tested an aliquot from this can using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for botulinum toxin and did not detect
toxin. One child remains hospitalized and is on mechanical
ventilation. The 2nd child has been removed from mechanical
ventilation and begun rehabilitation.
Indiana. On 11 Jul 2007, the Indiana State Department of Health
(ISDH) reported to CDC 2 suspected cases of foodborne botulism in a
married couple. The couple had onset of symptoms on 7 July 2007. Like
the Texas children, the Indiana patients initially were evaluated at
different hospitals, where multiple diagnoses were considered. On 9
Jul 2007, after both were admitted to the same hospital, botulism was
identified as the etiology of the shared symptoms. The man and woman
were hospitalized with cranial nerve palsies and symmetric,
descending paralysis typical of botulism and were placed on
mechanical ventilation. On 11 Jul 2007, CDC released botulinum
antitoxin, and the antitoxin was administered to both patients. Serum
samples collected on 10 Jul 2007 were sent to CDC's Botulism
Reference Laboratory and received on 15 Jul 2007. On 16 Jul 2007, CDC
detected botulinum toxin type A by mouse bioassay in the man's serum
sample. Botulinum toxin also was detected by mouse bioassay in the
woman's serum sample, but the sample volume was insufficient to
determine the toxin type.
During the initial investigation by ISDH, food histories could not be
obtained from the patients because of the severity of their
illnesses. Local health officials collected several foods from the
home of the patients, including an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag of
leftover chili mixture from the refrigerator. On 16 Jul 2007, CDC
detected botulinum toxin type A by mouse bioassay in the chili
mixture. Empty, well-rinsed cans (with no visible signs of food
debris) of Castleberry's Hot Dog Chili Sauce Original and chili made
by another company were found in the couple's recycling bin. CDC
re-rinsed the 2 cans and tested the rinse water for botulinum toxin
by mouse bioassay; both were negative. The label on the Castleberry's
Hot Dog Chili Sauce Original can indicated a production date of 8 May
2007 and a time of 2:23 am, less than 5 hours after the 9:41 pm, 7
May 2007 production time indicated on the can collected from the
Texas patients; the Indiana can had been manufactured in the same set
of retorts as the Texas can. Both patients remain hospitalized and on
mechanical ventilation.
On 17 Jul 2007, CDC OutbreakNet staff members provided information
regarding the production dates and times to FDA; the evidence
strongly suggested that brands of Castleberry's hot dog chili sauce
were the common source of the 4 cases of botulism. On 18 Jul 2007,
FDA issued a consumer advisory. On that same day, after being
informed about the outbreak and findings from FDA investigation of
the canning facility, Castleberry's Food Company issued a voluntary
recall that included limited production dates of Castleberry's Hot
Dog Chili Sauce Original, Castleberry's Austex Hot Dog Chili Sauce
Original, and Kroger Hot Dog Chili Sauce. That recall was expanded on
21 Jul 2007 to include all production dates for 91 types of canned
chili sauce, chili, other meat products, chicken products, and dog
food that were manufactured in the same set of retorts as the hot dog
chili sauce at the Castleberry's Food Company facility in Georgia.
These included Castleberry's brands and products produced by the
manufacturer but distributed under 25 other brand names (e.g.,
Austex, Kroger, and Piggly Wiggly). The recalled products were
distributed in 49 of the 50 United States (all states except Alaska).
A listing of the 91 products recalled as of July 21 is available at:
<http://www.castleberrys.com/news_productrecall.asp>.
California. On 25 Jul 2007, the California Department of Public
Health (CDPH) reported to CDC a case of botulism caused by botulinum
toxin type A with a potential link to one of the recalled products.
On 1 Jul 2007, several days after reportedly eating a recalled chili
product, the patient, a woman, had onset of symptoms that progressed
to include cranial nerve palsies and bilateral generalized weakness.
She was hospitalized on 5 Jul 2007. On 7 Jul 2007, CDPH released
botulinum antitoxin, which was administered to the patient. Botulinum
toxin type A was detected by mouse bioassay from a serum sample
collected on 7 Jul 2007. The product had been discarded and could not
be tested. The patient was hospitalized for 10 days and is now
recovering at home. CDPH is continuing to investigate to determine
whether the patient's illness was associated with the recalled chili product.
Canning Facility Investigation
----------------------------------
The Castleberry's canning facility in Georgia produces both FDA- and
FSIS-regulated products. The outbreak investigation by FDA and FSIS
identified production deficiencies that might have permitted spores
of _C. botulinum_ to survive the canning process. _C. botulinum_
spores are in the environment and can be present in foods that have
not been properly subjected to high temperature and pressure during
the canning process. Anaerobic conditions, low acidity (pH greater
than 4.6), low salt and sugar concentrations, and temperatures
greater than 39.0 degrees F (greater than 3.9 degrees C) allow
germination of _C. botulinum_ spores and subsequent production of
botulinum toxin. FDA officials tested 17 swollen cans of
Castleberry's hot dog chili sauce produced on 8 May 2007 in the same
set of retorts as the cans associated with the Indiana and Texas
botulism cases. 16 of the 17 cans were positive for botulinum toxin
type A by ELISA. Mouse bioassay results were consistent with ELISA
findings. Castleberry's Food Company has closed its Georgia canning
facility and has hired a firm to help recall products from
approximately 8500 retail outlets.

MMWR Editorial Note
----------------
In the USA, foodborne botulism usually is associated with home-canned
foods. During 1950-2005, local and state health departments reported
to CDC 405 events (i.e., single cases or outbreaks) of foodborne
botulism in which an implicated food item was identified. Of these
405 events, 371 (92 percent) were linked to home-processed foods and
34 (8 percent) to commercially processed foods, including foods
prepared in restaurants. Only 4 of the outbreaks associated with
commercially processed foods (i.e., canned tuna, liver paste,
vichyssoise, and beef stew) were associated with deficiencies in a
commercial canning process. The last such outbreak in the USA
occurred in 1974 and was associated with commercially canned beef
stew (1). Although rare, any deficiency in the retort canning process
is a major public health concern because of the severity of botulism
and the widespread distribution of canned products.
Botulism is a nationally notifiable disease. Investigators are
actively seeking additional cases that might be linked to the current
outbreak by issuing health alerts and examining reported botulism
cases dating back to 2005. Clinicians should consider botulism in
patients with symmetric cranial nerve palsies, especially if
accompanied by descending flaccid paralysis. Suspected cases of
botulism should be reported immediately to local or state public
health officials, who should then call the 24-hour CDC Emergency
Operations Center (770-488-7100); callers will be connected
immediately with an on-call CDC botulism specialist. Health-care
providers and public health officials are encouraged to inquire
specifically about consumption of the recalled canned products as
part of the food history of persons with suspected botulism.
Additional information regarding this botulism outbreak is available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/botulism/botulism.htm>. Consumers should check
their homes for any of the 91 recalled products listed by
Castleberry's Food Company at:
<http://www.castleberrys.com/news_productrecall.asp>. Persons with
unopened cans of recalled products should dispose of the cans without
opening or puncturing them, as described at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/botulism/botulism_faq.htm>.

[This CDC report of the ongoing botulism outbreak associated with
commercially canned food confirms that the neurotoxin type was type A
and supplies more information regarding the clinical illnesses of the
Indiana, Texas and California cases. Whether the previous posted
Hawaii cases are botulism and are related to the outbreak is not yet
known. Likewise, more information is needed regarding the 8 Ohio
cases. - Mod. LL]
