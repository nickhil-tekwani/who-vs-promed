If there can be any good news coming out of the African continent regarding this year's [2014] Ebola outbreaks, we have one positive report this morning [2 Sep 2014]. The World Health Organization has just confirmed that the newly-identified cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo are genetically unrelated to the strain currently circulating in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.

A WHO collaborating research center in Franceville, Gabon, the Centre International de Recherches Medicales, had previously identified 6 Ebola positive samples sent to the laboratory. They report today [2 Sep 2014] that "the virus in the Boende district is definitely not derived from the virus strain currently circulating in West Africa." WHO added: "Results from the virus characterization, together with findings from the epidemiological investigation, are definitive: the outbreak in DRC is a distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the outbreak in West Africa."

The finding is worthy of such emphasis because of concerns that the West African outbreak had somehow spread to the DRC, formerly Zaire. The viruses in each outbreak are genetically distinct, but they are both of the Zaire species of Ebola virus, a fact that might be confused as meaning the outbreaks are related.

The new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unrelated to the ongoing West African strain of the disease.

The form of the Zaire virus currently circulating in the DRC is most closely related to one responsible for an outbreak in 1995 in the city of Kikwit. Ebola virus 1st emerged in the DRC and South Sudan in 1976. The current outbreak in the DRC is the 7th on record.

The index case has been clearly identified as a pregnant woman from Ikanamongo Village who died on 11 Aug 2014 after preparing bushmeat that her husband had hunted.

The means of viral spread, as reported by WHO, is typical of most Ebola outbreaks: "Local customs and rituals associated with death meant that several health-care workers were exposed and presented with similar symptoms in the following week."

Thus far, WHO has identified 53 cases consistent with a diagnosis of Ebola, including 31 deaths. Seven of the dead were health care workers. But WHO stressed that the outbreak is primarily occurring in a remote region of the DRC, about 750 miles from the capital of Kinshasa.

[2] Relief web - OCHA update 30 Aug 2014
Date: 30 Aug 2014

http://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/update-ebola-virus-disease-drc-no-5-30-august-2014


The total number of cases identified in the Boende health zone as of [29 Aug 2014] is 53, including 13 confirmed cases. Among the remaining 40 cases, 21 are probable, and 12 are suspected cases and are being followed up by the field teams.

The number of deaths remains 13, no additional death recorded.

Analysis conducted on all samples from Boende which had been sent to Germany reveals the ZAIRE strain, 99 per cent homologous to KIKWIT. [There was an outbreak of EBV in Kikwit Zaire in 1995].

The cities of Boende, Monkoto (Equateur), and Lomela (northern Eastern Kasai) are currently considered to be at risk. One of the patients hospitalised at the HGR Boende had managed to escape before being recovered by the services deployed to the field.

Coordination [activities include]:
- Publication of guidelines for travellers to foreign countries from DRC border posts by the National Programme on Hygiene at the Borders (NPHB).
- Holding of daily meetings of the National Committee on Coordination (CNC) at the office of the minister of health.

Security and logistics:
- Announcement by the Government of the provision of a cargo flight today, 30 Aug 2014.

Results from virus sequencing of samples from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were received last night [1 Sep 2014]. The virus is the Zaire strain in a lineage most closely related to a virus from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC.

The Zaire strain of the virus is indigenous in the country. Ebola 1st emerged in 1976 in almost simultaneous outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) and South Sudan (then Sudan). Confirmatory testing was done at Gabon's Centre International de Recherches Medicales in Franceville, a WHO collaborating centre. Earlier, testing in DRC confirmed Ebola in 6 of 8 samples.

The outbreak is located in the remote Boende district, Equateur province in the north western part of the country.

Results from virus characterization, together with findings from the epidemiological investigation, are definitive: the outbreak in DRC is a distinct and independent event with no relationship to the outbreak in West Africa. As the Gabon laboratory report clearly stated, "the virus in the Boende district is definitely not derived from the virus strain currently circulating in West Africa."

These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa. Epidemiological investigation has linked the index case, who died on 11 Aug 2014, to the preparation of bushmeat for consumption.

This is the country's 7th Ebola outbreak since 1976. The introduction of the virus into the human population following contact with infected bushmeat (usually fruit bats or monkeys) is consistent with the pattern seen at the start of previous outbreaks. The virus is now spreading from person to person.

The response team has, to date, identified 53 cases consistent with the case definition for Ebola virus disease, including 31 deaths. Seven of these deaths were among health care workers. More than 160 contacts are being traced.

The government has rapidly mounted a robust response by reactivating emergency committees at national, provincial, and local levels, setting up isolation centres, and providing community leaders with facts about the disease. The government will ensure that all burials are safe. The WHO team confirmed that collaboration between the government and its key partners is excellent.

The outbreak zone, where the most intense transmission is occurring, is remote, located some 1200 km from the capital city, Kinshasa. No paved roads run from the outbreak zone to Kinshasa. However, cases have been detected or transmission is ongoing at 3 sites, underscoring the need to watch the outbreak's evolution closely.

Motorcycles, canoes, and satellite phones have been supplied to facilitate outbreak investigation and contact tracing. A dedicated helicopter will be made available soon.

[The DRC Ebola virus disease outbreak continues to grow. Though ProMED-mail and its members would appreciate reliable numbers from any available source, the 1st report above indicates 53 cases (suspected plus confirmed?) and 31 deaths including 7 health care workers.

Virologic data that the virus is nearly identical to the Kikwit strain are compatible with epidemiology confirming that the DRC outbreak is unrelated to the West African epidemic. - Mod.LM
