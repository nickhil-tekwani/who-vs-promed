New Zealand's sheep industry is on alert after the discovery of a "new"
form of the brain disease scrapie in a research flock in Britain.

Two cheviot sheep sent as part of a New Zealand flock and a ewe born to 2
cheviots in the "closed" flock developed atypical scrapie, a fatal
degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats.

"A likely explanation for the 3 cases of atypical scrapie is that they
arose spontaneously and were not infected from an exterior source," British
researchers said.

[There has long been heartache among producers, researchers, and regulators
regarding the spontaneous or atypical form of scrapie, and BSE. A
spontaneous form is difficult to regulate, impossible to trace, and almost
defies research. The researchers on these spongiform encephalopathy
diseases are a determined lot and the atypical form does not make their job
easier. However, over the years there has been some sort of loose consensus
that the atypical form is spontaneous and beyond the regulatory grip of
agencies. - Mod.TG
