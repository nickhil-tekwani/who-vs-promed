[Please note, this is NOT Eluru's mystery illness. This is a different location with only 20 hospitalized people, not over 100 hospitalized and more than 600 affected as in Eluru. These individuals have different clinical signs than those in Eluru. - Mod.TG]

As many as 20 people belonging to Bajana thanda of Ayodya village were hospitalised on Fri 25 Dec 2020 after they experienced stomach pain and diarrhoea.

According to sources, around 102 persons belonging to the thanda have not been well for the past 3 days, and the condition of many worsened by Fri 25 Dec 2020, after which they were admitted to a hospital. Meanwhile, a few villagers alleged that this was a result of drinking contaminated water [While approximately 100 felt ill, only approximately 20 were hospitalized. - Mod.TG].

On learning about the incident, local officials informed Collector VP Gautam, and he immediately sent 4 medical teams to the spot.

The officials finally figured out that the villagers had been using vegetables sprayed with pesticides without washing them properly for cooking, which caused the reaction.

Speaking to Express, DMHO Dr D Sri Ram said: "The medical teams tested all the villagers. After the tests, around 20 of them were hospitalised and discharged later, as their conditions improved. Though we collected water samples and sent them for tests, the reports did not mention anything specific.

Meanwhile, we learnt the villagers have been spraying pesticides on red chili and tomato crops for the past 4 days. We soon contacted the agriculture officials, who came and collected samples from the crop. During further tests, it was found that the pesticides caused the reaction, as people had not been washing chilis and tomatoes properly before cooking them."

He also said that the condition of all people is stable.

[There are no specific clinical signs mentioned, nor is there any indication of what pesticides were tested for, or what levels of those pesticides were present. If the individuals were not washing properly, it suggests they may have ingested a low dose over several days. Nevertheless, without clinical signs or a report of what was found, it is impossible to know which chemical or chemicals were being used. Perhaps it was an organophophate which may have caused the signs. However, we are not told the signs.

Symptoms of organophosphate toxicity include increased saliva and tear production, diarrhea, vomiting, pinpoint or very small pupils, sweating, muscle tremors, and confusion. While onset of symptoms is often within minutes to hours, some symptoms can take weeks to appear, especially if it is a very low dose with repeated ingestions. This very low dose may have occurred from not washing the vegetables properly, or perhaps not at all. However, the specific chemical class is totally speculation, as this article does not provide clinical signs or the name of the pesticides. - Mod.TG
