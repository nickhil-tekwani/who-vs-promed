Correction: Maj. James W. Jones was the first (of many) to point out an
error in the comments added by the Moderator of the posting headed "East.
equine enceph. & La Crosse enceph.? - USA (NC)", posted on 7 Jul 2000. It
is incorrectly stated that Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a
flavivirus.
In fact, EEEV is an alphavirus. In the 6th Report of the ICTV it is listed
as a species within the Genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_.
Plant virologists have long advocated the incorporation of the genus name
into the species name, but animal virologists for several reasons have been
reluctant to adopt this convention. In the present instance my unfortunate
error might have been avoided if EEEV was the abbreviation for Eastern
equine encephalitis alphavirus.
None of this excuses the Moderator's error. My apologies.
