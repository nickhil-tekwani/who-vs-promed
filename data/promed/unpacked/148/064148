----------------------------------------------
We have received the following information from a reliable source:
cases, suspected to be FMD, have been identified recently in cattle in Iraq.

[According to the Iraqi page on the WRLFMD (IAH, Pirbright) website,
FMD is endemic in Iraq; see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/irq.htm>.

The following FMDV serotypes have been identified in Iraq throughout
the years:

FMDV-O: 1957, 1959, 1961-1964, 1966, 1969-1970, 1973, 1977, 1985,
1994, 1999-2001
FMDV-A: 1952, 1955, 1963-1964, 1970, 1978, 1985, 2000, 2002, 2009
FMDV-Asia 1: 1975, 1985
FMDV-SAT 1: 1962

The most recent sample from Iraq analysed at WRLFMD (Pirbright), was
collected from cattle on 12 Jan 2009 and received by WRLFMD on 15 Feb
2009. According to the report dated 5 Mar 2009, it was designated as
serotype A, topotype ASIA, genotype/strain Irn-05. The reference virus
strain found to be genetically closest to the said Iraqi serotype A
isolate was the Iranian strain A/IRN/1/2005 (95.77 percent identity).

As apparent from WRLFMD's data, Iraq's neighbors, Turkey and Iran,
have been experiencing during 2009-2010 the circulation of FMDV
serotypes A (topotype Asia, strain Iran-05) and serotype O (topotype
ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2). See also ProMED-mail archive no 20090808.2806.

It will be of importance, for Iraq and for the region, to identify the
FMD virus strain(s) currently circulating in Iraq. Are they similar to
the one(s) in Turkey, Iran, or elsewhere in the Middle East? Have
samples been sent to WRLFMD?

On top of serotypes A and O, serotypes Asia-1 and SAT-2 deserve to be
taken into consideration. FMDV Asia-1 was identified in Bahrain as
recently as 2009, and previously in Iran (2004) and Turkey (2000).
FMDV SAT-2 was identified in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 2000. - Mod.AS]
