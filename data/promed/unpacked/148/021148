In the posting "Echinococcus multilocularis, fox - Sweden: OIE" from
19 Feb 2011, ProMED no. 20110219.0543, one of the moderators (JW)
suggests that "it is probable that an infected rodent, or even fox,
made the crossing [across the sound between Sweden and Denmark] as a
stowaway on a cargo truck."

This statement is not in agreement with how Swedish authorities
regard the situation. Considering the frequency of dog movements
across the border and the geography around the sound, it is regarded
as more likely that the introduction was by a dog, despite the legal
requirement to de-worm dogs before entering the country.

Assessments of the risk of introducing _E. multilocularis_ into
Sweden and the UK (Vagsholm, 2006, Torgerson and Craig, 2009) have
both highlighted dog movements as being highly problematic in this
respect. A further support for this hypothesis is the introduction in
2003 of _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ to the Isle of Sydkoster on the
coast of the same county as the current finding of _E.
multilocularis_.

[ProMED thanks Ann Lindberg for the comments clarifying the official
position of the Swedish veterinary authorities and the references to
the risk assessment of importing _E. multilocularis_ to Sweden with
dogs entering from other countries, and the similar risk assessment
from the United Kingdom.

ProMED received the comment on 20 Feb 2011 and sincerely apologizes
for the delay in posting. - Mod.EP]

[ProMED regrets the delay in posting this comment.]

With interest, I have noticed the 1st observation of a fox positive
for _Echinococcus multilocularis_ in Sweden on ProMED on 20 Feb 2011.

The description of the actual epidemiology of the dwarf fox tapeworm
might be better underlined by a map provided from the Swiss Institute
of Parasitology, Zurich:
<http://www.paras.uzh.ch/index/Bild_em_world_2010.JPG>. Herein,
Denmark is partly involved, since _Echinococcus multilocularis_ was
detected very rarely in foxes (0.9 percent of 340) in an area near
Copenhagen (Saeed et al 2006), and in one out of 169 cats (Dyachenko
et al 2008). Thus, Denmark cannot be described as an "endemic" area
for _Echinococcus multilocularis_ yet.

The link to the life cycle of the parasite provided by the CDC
depicts erroneously the situation of cystic echinococcosis, and only
this disease is also known as hydatidosis. Therefore, it should be
again stressed that different hosts are involved in alveolar
echinococcosis (fox as the final host, but also dogs and cats; rodents
as intermediate hosts). It is, therefore, suggested that the key
reference of the WHO/OIE Manual on Echinococcosis in Humans and
Animals <http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2001/929044522X.pdf> be
provided instead of a link to the OIE website, which has an
abbreviated description of the disease.

As outlined, the disease "alveolar echinococcosis" has a bad
prognosis in humans if left untreated; however, it should also be
noted that that prognosis has been substantially improved during the
past 35 years with combined treatment (medical, surgical as well as
interventional) in centers of Central Europe (Southern Germany,
Switzerland, France) (Torgerson et al 2008). Consensus recommendations
for treatment of alveolar and cystic echinococcosis have recently been
published by Brunetti et al 2010 in Acta Tropica.

[ProMED would like to thank Peter Kern for his comments, and we
apologize for the delay of this posting.

ProMED highly values Peter Kern's expert comments in correcting that
_Echinococcus granulosus_ causes cystic echinococcosis (CE), and only
this disease is known as hydatidosis, which is the form most
frequently encountered.

This current report from Sweden is of _E. multilocularis_, which
causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), with the fox being the most
common final host, but which can also be found in dogs and cats, with
rodents serving as intermediate hosts. The correct life cycle diagram
of _E. multilocularis_ can be found on page 8 of the WHO/OIE Manual on
Echinococcosis in Humans and Animals
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2001/929044522X.pdf>, which is
the definitive reference on echinococcosis for both humans and
animals.

As for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) in humans, the
prognosis has been much improved in recent years. Readers are
encouraged to consult the paper "Expert consensus for the diagnosis
and treatment of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis in humans," by
Brunetti et al, which is excerpted here:

"For AE, early diagnosis and radical (tumor-like) surgery followed by
anti-infective prophylaxis with albendazole remains one of the key
elements. However, most patients with AE are diagnosed at a later
stage, when radical surgery (distance of larval to liver tissue of
over 2 cm) cannot be achieved. The backbone of AE treatment remains
the continuous medical treatment with albendazole, and if necessary,
individualized interventional measures." (Acta Tropica Volume 114,
Issue 1, April 2010, Pages 1-16)
