Wheat is currently under attack by yellow rust in Punjab. The disease has been reported from almost all wheat growing districts. First spotted in February [2019], the disease had affected 20 per cent of the crop within a month.

Punjab's Pest Warning and Quality Control of Pesticides Dr Zafar Yab Haider said most of the crop varieties affected were either unapproved, or approved for sowing in Sindh rather than Punjab. New wheat varieties like FD-8 and Johar remained safe from the fungus, and [he] hoped that the disease would not drastically impact the overall yield.

Dr Javed Ahmad, Ayub Agriculture Research Institute, stressed that wheat growers should sow a new seed variety after a couple of years as repeated sowing allows the Yellow Rust to overcome the plant's resistance. Farmers continued to reuse old wheat varieties contrary to the advice of agriculture experts.

Nervous at the outbreak, farmers in some areas have resorted to spraying fungicides. Experts recommend the use of fungicides at least where the disease is found. But Dr Ahmad warned against pesticides [because] wheat in the country is used raw and [there may be] residues. He advised to avoid irrigating and applying fertilisers as it will aggravate the situation.

Wheat in Yamunanagar district has been affected by yellow rust. According to the Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Department, the disease has been detected on 109.5 acres [44.3 ha] in 5 varieties of wheat so far.

A team from the Agriculture Department along with scientists visited the fields affected by yellow rust. "We are asking farmers to spray [fungicide] in the affected fields," [they] said. A farmer said the government should help and provide [fungicide] for free.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

The Himalayan region, including parts of Pakistan and India, has been identified as a source of most of the aggressive stripe rust races which have arrived in Europe over recent years (ProMED-mail post 20150717.3517395). In India, of the cereal rusts, stripe rust is the most serious constraint to wheat production.
