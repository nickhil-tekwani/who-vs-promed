FOREIGN DIPLOMATS CONCERNED ABOUT VIRAL OUTBREAK
[Excerpts
Taipei, June 22 (CNA) A killer intestinal virus outbreak that has claimed
the lives of 50 young children around the island in recent weeks has caused
concern among foreign diplomats stationed here, Foreign Minister Jason Hu
said on Monday.
A total of 14 foreign ambassadors and 45 representatives from countries
which do not maintain foreign diplomatic ties with the Republic of China
attended the presentation given by Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of the
DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA)...
MOFA Vice Minister David Lee said although many foreign diplomats have
voiced concern about the enterovirus epidemic, none of them has advised
expatriates from his or her home country to leave Taiwan simply for the
outbreak...
Meanwhile, the DOH again demanded all city and county governments from
sponsoring any
large-scale activities for children for the time being as part of efforts
to curb the further spread of the virus...
Hsu also urged local health authorities to intensify sterilization measures
at all swimming pools in their cities or counties to eradicate the virus.
Parents have been advised to discourage their kids from swimming in public
pools.
In related developments, the kindergarten affiliated to Taipei's Chang Chun
Elementary School decided to close for a week starting Monday as two of its
pupils were confirmed to have been infected by the virus last week. It was
the first kindergarten in Taipei to have announced a temporary closure
since the epidemic broke out in May...
