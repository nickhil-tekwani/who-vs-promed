The Information Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced on 11 Dec 2019 that African swine fever [ASF] virus was detected in 3 dead wild boars in Foping County, Hanzhong City, Shaanxi province. The total number of dead boars found and submitted for testing was 9. The test was positive for ASF virus nucleic acid.

After the epidemic was diagnosed, the State Forestry and Pasture Bureau and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs immediately sent a supervision team to carry out epidemic disposal supervision and epidemiological investigation. The local government has started an emergency response mechanism in accordance with the requirements, adopted harmless treatment and disinfection measures for sick and dead wild boars, strengthened inspections of local wild boars, strictly restricting the breeding of nearby domestic pigs, and conducted inspections and comprehensive disinfection of all surrounding pig farms. At present, the above measures have been implemented.

This is China's 2nd outbreak involving ASF in free-roaming wild boars. The 1st report, dated November 2018, came from the province of Jilin (northeast China, bordering North Korea); see ProMED-mail archive no. 20181116.6149559. Later, 2 reported outbreaks involved farmed wild boars.

Wild boars are widely distributed throughout China, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and the region bordering Mongolia. A relatively high density, estimated at a mean of 2.24 head/sq km [5.8 head/sq mi] is reported from some forests in northeastern China, and even higher density in the southeastern coastal areas.

Information on the ASF situation in China's wild boar has, so far, been rather scarce. In view of the high incidence of the disease in domestic pigs throughout the country, The apparent absence of additional cases in wild boar so far has been rather surprising. This was underlined also by the reporting of ASF in the wild boar population of Russian territories bordering northeastern China. That continuing event, which had started 30 Jul 2019 in Russia's far east, bordering China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, is summarised at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31280, including an interactive map indicating the locations of the outbreaks in domestic pigs and in wild boars. The most recent follow-up report, no. 16, reporting 20 new cases in wild boar in the Amur oblast, was published today (Thu 12 Dec 2019). So far, 67 infected boars have been reported. - Mod.AS
