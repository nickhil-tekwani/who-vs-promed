The number of cases of diphtheria among asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the United Kingdom has risen to more than 50, the BBC understands. It comes after it was confirmed that one migrant who died after being held at Manston processing centre in Kent had contracted the disease [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63766770]. The man died in hospital on 19 Nov 2022 after entering the UK on a small boat 7 days earlier [12 Nov 2022].

In 2021, there were 3 of the same strain, according to government data [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/diphtheria-in-england-and-wales-annual-reports/diphtheria-in-england-2021].

Babies and children in the UK are vaccinated against diphtheria, meaning cases are rare. However, the infection is potentially dangerous to migrants who come from countries where this is not the case.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is not known if the more than 50 people who have or have had diphtheria were infected at Manston. The body said that cases have been rising among asylum seekers across Europe and some people reported symptoms before arriving, and so could have been infected in their home country. However, the incubation period for the illness is between 2 and 5 days, with a maximum of 10 days, so infections in people who were at Manston are likely to be recent.

A post-mortem examination is trying to determine whether the man held at Manston died because of his diphtheria infection. According to a Home Office spokesperson, hospital tests indicate "diphtheria may be the cause of the illness". Initial tests were negative and the Home Office said at the time there was "no evidence at this stage" that the person had died from an infectious disease. But a follow-up PCR test for diphtheria has since produced a positive result.

Health officials have advised vaccines and antibiotics are offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation, and close contacts are identified. The Manston centre was cleared of people earlier this month [November 2022] after reports of overcrowding and outbreaks of disease. There are concerns that people who may have had diphtheria have been moved around the country.

A Home Office spokesperson said: "We work closely with a range of partners within the community including local authorities and health leads to make sure information is shared in a timely way and that everyone leaving Manston is given access to appropriate treatment. As the UK Health Security Agency has made clear, the risk of diphtheria to the public is very low, due to high uptake of the diphtheria vaccine in this country and because the infection is typically passed on through close prolonged contact with a case. "We take both the welfare of those in our care and our wider public health responsibilities extremely seriously. As such, we continue to work closely with the NHS and UKHSA to support the individuals affected and limit the transmission of infection."

The Manston migrant processing facility is a former military base and is designed to hold just 1600 people. But in October [2022] there were around 4000 migrants being held there. More than 40 000 migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats this year [2022].

[ProMED has recently posted several reports on diphtheria at facilities in Europe used to house recent asylum seekers. (See ProMED posts Diphtheria - Germany: toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, cutaneous, migrants 20221119.8706803. Diphtheria - UK: (England) asylum seekers 20221021.8706299, and Diphtheria - Switzerland: (Bern) asylum seekers 20220804.8704867.)

In Germany, there were 42 cases of diphtheria caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ in migrants who had arrived in Germany since May 2022. There were no cases in migrants in 2019, 7 in 2020, and 7 in 2021. Most cases in migrants were detected by medical examinations at reception centers. Countries of origin, when known, were mostly Syria (n = 21) and Afghanistan (n = 17), with one each from Tunisia and Yemen. Migrants were en route often for months, living under very poor hygienic condition, usually without access to healthcare services. For 23 of the 42 cases with information on transit routes to Germany, most traveled along a Balkan route -- that is, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia, where they were said to have likely acquired diphtheria, based in part on genetic analysis of isolates.

We don't have similar detailed data from the recent ProMED reports of diphtheria in migrants in the UK or Switzerland.

The former military Manston airfield and former Defence Fire Training and Development Centre in Thanet, Kent, UK, which was originally meant to temporarily hold (24-48 hours) 1000 cross-Channel migrants, was being used to house 3000 people for prolonged stays (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-63164644). Children were reported to be sleeping on floors (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-63262176), although children are not supposed to be accommodated at the site.

The Isle of Thanet is a peninsula forming the easternmost part of Kent, England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Thanet). A map showing the location of Thanet can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanet+District,+UK. - Mod.ML
