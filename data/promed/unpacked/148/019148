As of Sat 27 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
1780 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
724 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.8 per cent],
1033 recoveries, and
18 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update (that was through 23 Jan 2018), there have been a total of:
5 newly confirmed cases,
0 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery.

Information on newly confirmed cases: (5 cases)
- none of the 5 cases were healthcare workers

[In the past 24 hours, there was reporting (delayed) of 5 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia, bringing the total number of cases reported during the month of January 2018 thusfar to 23 cases. The 5 newly confirmed cases come from 5 different regions (Riyadh, Ash Sharqīyah/Eastern, Hail, Tabūk and Makkah), involve 3 expats and 2 Saudi nationals, no healthcare workers, 2 women and 3 men, and classifications as to type of acquisition of infection included 4 primary cases (2 with a history of direct exposure to camels and 2 with high risk exposure histories still under investigation) and one household contact of a previously confirmed case (possibly the 65-year-old Saudi male reported as a newly confirmed case on 23 Jan 2018), in summary, a picture of ongoing endemic transmission of the virus in Saudi Arabia.

Maps showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL, and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5590493,131. - Mod.MPP]
