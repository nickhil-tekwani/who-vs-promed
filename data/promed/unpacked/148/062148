The Animal Health Trust has reported at least 5 horses have confirmed flu on a premises in Hertfordshire, where 15 others are showing signs of the virus. The yard, on which 30 non-thoroughbred horses live, most unvaccinated, has placed restrictions on movement.

Elsewhere, 2 other diagnosed cases, in Buckinghamshire and central Scotland, involve recently arrived unvaccinated horses that have been in contact with 8 vaccinated equines. In addition, 2 horses have been confirmed as having the virus in Worcestershire. One is a vaccinated non-thoroughbred with no equine contacts; the other, an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred in contact with some 35 other equines, of which about half are vaccinated, but this yard has been on lockdown since a case of strangles was confirmed there in the past month [late January/early February 2019].

A number of venues have cancelled events planned for the coming days as a result of the outbreaks. Blue Barn and Cobham Manor in Kent, Pyecombe and Crockstead in West Sussex, and Petley Wood in East Sussex are among those to have cancelled affiliated and unaffiliated competition, promising refunds or transfer of entries to affected competitors.

Crockstead said in a statement the decision had been made after a "sleepless night," adding: "There is always another day." Other venues have said they will still run planned shows, but that riders should ensure vaccinations are up to date, and that passports should be available to be checked.

The British Equestrian Federation (BEF) is urging all competition and training event organisers to check all attending horses' passports to ensure they comply with rules. It also advises riders to check venues' requirements beforehand.

"The BEF continues to urge all owners to be vigilant for the symptoms of equine flu and to alert the vet if they think their horses are showing signs," the BEF said in a statement. "All owners MUST ensure vaccination records are up to date, and if it has been longer than 6 months since the last vaccination, we strongly recommend discussing a booster with their veterinary surgeon. We also remind owners that any contact with recently imported horses represents an increased risk so owners should follow veterinary advice by isolating any recently imported horse for a period of at least 21 days."

[Equine influenza, an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenza virus_ A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s.

While normally confined to equids, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America, and it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. Although equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. - Mod.AS
