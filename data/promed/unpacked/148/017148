Disease hits Petersburg after problems with water tower
-------------------------------------------------------
The village of Petersburg [in Nebraska] is recovering from a suspected outbreak of a unique [Hardly! - Mod.SH] disease after problems with its water tower.

The investigation into the disease's origins and Petersburg's water began around August 2021. "With a disease like campylobacteriosis, people go to the doctor, and then the doctor identified [it is] a reportable disease, and that's how this was discovered," Sue Dempsey of the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said.

In October 2021, the East Central District Health Department initially concluded the outbreak came from food, not water. Currently, officials are saying it likely started when birds got into the city's water tower. Water tower experts with Maguire Inc. later stated the tower's gaps welcomed bird contamination -- meaning the tower needs to have its roof completely replaced or sealed up every 5 years.

"They need to do some tower maintenance because there are gaps in the seams. It's a little problematic with the time of the year," Dempsey said. As of this week, NDEE said that campylobacter is not a problem in Petersburg any more because the water is being chlorinated. That means the water is safe to drink. Petersburg's water operator, who also serves in several other positions for the village, has not yet commented.

Municipal water supplies can be contaminated with human enteric pathogens such as _E. coli_ and campylobacter. A previous outbreak of campylobacteriosis, also in Nebraska, was reported by CDC in 2019:
Pedati C, Koirala S, Safranek T, Buss BF, Carlson AV. Campylobacteriosis outbreak associated with contaminated municipal water supply -- Nebraska, 2017. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2019;68:169-173. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6807a1

Clinicians often find cases of campylobacteriosis associated with undercooked eggs or poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys) but wild birds can also carry the pathogen as shown by the following research:

Haid B, Skov MN, Nierlsen EM, et al. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli in wild birds on Danish livestock farms. Acta Vet Scand. 2016; 58: 11. doi: 10.1186/s13028-016-0192-9

Abstract
Background
Reducing the occurrence of campylobacteriosis is a food safety issue of high priority, as in recent years it has been the most commonly reported zoonosis in the EU. Livestock farms are of particular interest, since cattle, swine and poultry are common reservoirs of _Campylobacter_ spp. The farm environment provides attractive foraging and breeding habitats for some bird species reported to carry thermophilic _Campylobacter_ spp. We investigated the Campylobacter spp. carriage rates in 52 wild bird species present on 12 Danish farms, sampled during a winter and a summer season, in order to study the factors influencing the prevalence in wild birds according to their ecological guild. In total, 1607 individual wild bird cloacal swab samples and 386 livestock manure samples were cultured for _Campylobacter_ spp. according to the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis method NMKL 119.

Results
The highest _Campylobacter_ spp. prevalence was seen in 110 out of 178 thrushes (61.8%), of which the majority were common blackbird (_Turdus merula_), and in 131 out of 616 sparrows (21.3%), a guild made up of house sparrow (_Passer domesticus_) and Eurasian tree sparrow (_Passer montanus_). In general, birds feeding on a diet of animal or mixed animal and vegetable origin, foraging on the ground and vegetation in close proximity to livestock stables were more likely to carry _Campylobacter_ spp. in both summer (P < 0.001) and winter (P < 0.001) than birds foraging further away from the farm or in the air. Age, fat score, gender, and migration range were not found to be associated with _Campylobacter_ spp. carriage. A correlation was found between the prevalence (%) of _C. jejuni_ in wild birds and the proportions (%) of C. jejuni in both manure on cattle farms and poultry farms, and between the prevalence (%) of _C. coli_ in wild birds and the proportions (%) of _C. coli_ in manure on pig farms.

Conclusions
The ecological guild of wild birds influences the prevalence of _Campylobacter_ spp. through the behavioral patterns of the birds. More specifically, wild birds eating food of animal or mixed animal and vegetable origin and foraging on the ground close to livestock were more likely to carry _Campylobacter_ spp. than those foraging further away or hunting in the air. These findings suggest that wild birds may play a role in sustaining the epidemiology of _Campylobacter_ spp. on farms.
