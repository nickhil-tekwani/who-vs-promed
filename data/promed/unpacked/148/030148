State confirms 5 cases of rabies
---------------------------------
A rabid fox and a possibly rabid coyote in the seacoast region have animal
control officers urging residents to have their pets vaccinated against the
deadly disease. Seabrook confirmed a rabid fox last month [March 2006]. The
animal ran into back yards and streets, biting 2 children and a dog.
In Hampton on Fri 31 Mar 2006, police officers killed a coyote seen
wandering around downtown. They did not send the body to Concord for
testing since it attacked no one. Officers said the coyote was behaving
oddly and had a neck wound from which it probably contracted the disease.

tested for rabies. - Mod.TG]
The state has 5 confirmed rabies cases so far this year [2006], including
the fox in Seabrook, according to Dr. Jason Stull, the state public health
veterinarian. The other 4 positive tests were 2 each for skunks and
raccoons, he said, in Greenland, Londonderry, Nashua and Northwood.
While cases in humans are rare -- the national Centers for Disease Control
reports one to 2 a year -- they are almost always fatal once symptoms
appear. If bitten, symptoms will begin to appear one to 3 months later,
though people may not show signs of the disease for as long as several years.
Symptoms include malaise, loss of appetite, fatigue, headache and fever,
according to Healthscout.com. More than half of people bitten by a rabid
animal may have pain, itching or numbness at the site of exposure. Victims
may complain of insomnia or depression.
Two to 10 days later, signs of nervous system damage appear: hyperactivity
and hypersensitivity, disorientation, hallucinations, seizures and paralysis.
Vaccines to those potentially exposed to the virus can cost several
thousand dollars, Stull said. The vaccines have improved since the dreaded
needle in the stomach. People are given 6 shots, the 1st one at the site of
infection. They are then given a series of 5 vaccinations for a month.
Pets exposed, even those with up to date rabies inoculations, are
quarantined for 10 days. The state mandates all dogs and cats receive
rabies vaccines, a law Seabrook's animal control officer said is hard to
enforce when it comes to cats. Dog owners must show proof of having gotten
rabies shots for their pets when they get them licensed. Cats are not
licensed, though Seabrook tried it for a year or 2 before voters repealed
the ordinance last year [2005].
Animal Control Officer Jeff Baillargeon said the town wanted the cats
licensed to make sure the owners were having them inoculated. "We have no
idea how many are not inoculated," he said.
Seabrook and Hampton both have a large feral cat population. Two local
animal groups capture the cats, get them vaccinated, and have the animal's
ear notched to show they've been inoculated. Baillargeon said he has no way
of knowing whether the feral cats are getting yearly booster shots.
The disease is more common in wild animals.

a fenced yard or on a leash will also help prevent wild animal contact.
