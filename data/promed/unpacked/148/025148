United States: outbreaks of aseptic meningitis associated with echoviruses
9 and 30 and preliminary surveillance reports on enterovirus activity - 2003
---------------------------
Aseptic or viral meningitis is the commonest type of meningitis and is
associated with an estimated 26 000 to 42 000 hospital admissions each year
in the United States (1). Enteroviruses are the commonest cause of aseptic
meningitis (2). Echovirus 9 (E9) and echovirus 30 (E30) have been
associated frequently with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis (3,4,5).
During March 2003, several state public health departments noted increased
reports of aseptic meningitis and, as of 7 Aug 2003, 7 states (Arizona,
California, Georgia, Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina, and Texas) had reported
outbreaks associated with either E9 or E30. This report summarizes the
epidemiologic features of the aseptic meningitis outbreaks in 5 states
(Arizona, California, Georgia, Idaho, and South Carolina) and provides an
overview of enterovirus activity in the US during the period 1 Jan to 7 Aug
2003. Enteroviruses, E9 and E30 in particular, should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of people with aseptic meningitis.
Aseptic meningitis is not a nationally notifiable disease, and no
nationally accepted case definition exists for this condition (6).
Therefore, cases of aseptic meningitis described in this report represent
physician diagnoses based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings.
The enterovirus surveillance data were obtained from reports to the
National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS), a passive voluntary
surveillance system based on reporting by state public health and private
laboratories of enterovirus detections by serotype and basic demographic
information, specimen type, and date of collection.
Aseptic Meningitis Outbreaks
----------------------------
Arizona:
-------
From 1 Jan to 7 Jul 2003, a total of 465 cases of aseptic meningitis
(rate: 8.6 per 100 000 population) were reported to the Arizona Department
of Health Services, compared with 104 cases (rate: 1.9) reported for the
same period in 2002. The highest rate during this period was reported in
Maricopa County (rate: 12.7, compared with 2.7 during the same period in
2002). As of 31 Jul 2003, the Arizona State Health Laboratory had reported
62 enterovirus isolates, the majority (66 per cent) from cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) specimens. Of the 62 isolates, E30 accounted for 47 isolates
and E9 for one isolate.
California:
----------
As of 5 Aug 2003, a total of 1753 cases of aseptic meningitis (rate: 8.0
per 100 000 population) had been reported to the California Department of
Health Services (CDHS). During 1999 to 2003, the annual reported rate of
aseptic meningitis in California ranged from 4.5 to 7.3. Specimens from 148
patients with aseptic meningitis were submitted to CDHS for diagnostic
testing from 24 counties throughout the state. Serum and CSF specimens from
all patients were tested for enteroviruses and arboviruses (West Nile virus
[WNV], St. Louis encephalitis virus, and western equine encephalitis virus)
at CDHS. Of the 148 patients, 82 (55 per cent) had evidence of enterovirus
infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture; E30 was identified
from 29 (85%) of the 82 culture-positive cases, and E9 was identified from
four (12%) cases.
Georgia:
-------
During March, an outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with E9
infection began in Augusta, Georgia. During the period 10 Mar to 23 Jul
2003, a total of 320 cases were reported from 50 of Georgia's 159 counties,
compared with 227 cases reported statewide during 2002. E9 has been
isolated from CSF, throat swab, and/or rectal swab specimens of 24
patients. Enteroviruses (untyped) were isolated from an additional 24 CSF
specimens, and 52 CSF specimens tested positive for enteroviruses by PCR.
Patients commonly reported headache, fever, nausea or vomiting, stiff neck,
and photophobia. As of 7 Aug 2003, the outbreak was ongoing.
Idaho:
-----
From 2 May to 17 Jul 2003, an outbreak of viral meningitis occurred in
north central Idaho, with 38 cases from 3 adjacent counties reported to the
Idaho Division of Health, compared with 4 cases reported statewide during
the previous year. Of the 32 patients for whom clinical information was
available, 17 were hospitalized with clinical signs and symptoms consistent
with aseptic meningitis. E30 was isolated from 2 of 4 patients who
underwent virologic investigation. Two cases of aseptic meningitis reported
subsequently from the same area are under investigation by the North
Central District Health Department.
South Carolina:
--------------
From 6 Apr to 31 Jul 2003, a total of 82 cases of viral meningitis were
identified by the Aiken County Health Department. The outbreak peaked in
May, when 38 cases were reported. E9 was isolated from CSF of 2 of these
patients. At the same time, adjacent counties in Georgia also experienced
an outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with E9. In June, cases began
to appear in multiple counties. The number of reports and CSF specimen
submissions to the South Carolina State Laboratory continued to increase in
July. As of 31 Jul 2003, a total of 130 cases of aseptic meningitis had
been reported; E9 was isolated from 20 specimens (18 CSF and 2 throat
washings) from 8 different counties, and no other enteroviruses were
identified. Because viral meningitis is not a notifiable disease in South
Carolina, comparative data are not available for previous years.
Enterovirus surveillance data
-----------------------------
As of 7 Aug 2003, NESS had received reports of 365 enterovirus detections
in 25 states; source specimens for these isolates were collected from 5 Jan
to 30 Jul 2003. The most commonly detected serotypes were E9 and E30, with
E30 accounting for 132 (36 per cent) and E9 accounting for 108 (30 per
cent) reports. E9 was isolated in 14 states, mainly in the East (for
example, Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, and South Carolina), and E30 was
isolated in 10 states, mainly in the West (for example, Arizona,
California, Colorado, and Texas). For both serotypes, CSF was the source
specimen in the majority of cases (72 [67 per cent] for E9 and 107 [81 per
cent] for E30).
Other enterovirus serotypes reported most frequently include coxsackievirus
B1 (29 [8 per cent] of all reports), echovirus 7 (10 [3 per cent]),
coxsackievirus A9 (10 [3 per cent]), enterovirus 71 (nine [3 per cent]),
coxsackievirus B4 (12 [4 per cent]), and echovirus 5 (seven [2 per cent]).

MMWR editorial note:
-------------------
Aseptic meningitis is a central nervous system infection characterized by
fever and meningeal symptoms with moderate, predominantly lymphocytic CSF
pleocytosis and the absence of bacterial pathogens in CSF. The disease
occurs both sporadically and in outbreaks, and >90 per cent of cases with
an identified cause are associated with enteroviruses (2). Many aseptic
meningitis outbreaks occurring during the current enterovirus season
reflect high levels of E9 and E30 activity. In 2003, E9 has been involved
predominantly in the outbreaks in the East, and E30 has been linked
exclusively with outbreaks in the West.
From 1970 to 2001, both E9 and E30 were among the 15 enteroviruses
reported most commonly each year, accounting for 10.2 per cent and 8.2 per
cent of all enterovirus isolates reported to CDC, respectively (CDC,
unpublished data, 2003). However, these enteroviruses have been relatively
quiescent in recent years; E9 has not been the predominant enterovirus
isolated from clinical specimens since 1995, and E30 has not been
widespread since 1998 (7,8). This probably has resulted in an accumulation
of cohorts of susceptible persons who have not been exposed previously to
these agents.
The increase in aseptic meningitis cases associated with high activity of
E9 and E30 is consistent with the historic data; during the period 1988 to
1999, peak years for viral meningitis hospitalizations in the United States
coincided with periods of high activity of either E9 or E30 (1).
Although most cases of enterovirus infections are asymptomatic or result in
mild febrile illnesses, aseptic meningitis is the main diagnosis reported
with the current E9 and E30 activity in the US because patients with
meningitis are more likely to be tested for enteroviruses than those with
less severe manifestations. In a small proportion of cases, more severe,
life-threatening diseases (such as encephalitis, paralysis,
myopericarditis, and neonatal enteroviral sepsis) might occur.
Enteroviruses typically demonstrate a marked seasonality in temperate
climates, with a typical enterovirus season in the United States occurring
during June to October (9). In 2003, the enterovirus season appears to have
started early, with the first isolations of E9 reported in January (in
Louisiana), the first outbreaks of E9-associated aseptic meningitis
reported in March, and the first isolations of E30 reported in April (in
Arizona). WNV has the same seasonal pattern as enteroviruses, and is also
associated with neurologic signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis.
However, WNV-associated meningitis tends to occur among older people
(median age: 46 years) (10), whereas children and young adults (median age:
13 years) are at highest risk for enteroviral meningitis (1). The
investigation of an aseptic meningitis outbreak in an area of high WNV
epizootic activity in 2001 indicated that enteroviruses were the leading
cause of aseptic meningitis in this area, and no evidence of WNV infection
was detected (10). For this reason, diagnostic testing of specimens from
younger patients with aseptic meningitis should include testing for
enteroviruses, even during a documented WNV outbreak (10).
Early etiologic diagnosis of aseptic meningitis helps to avoid unnecessary
antibiotic treatment and additional testing. Although virus culture is the
standard technique for enterovirus detection, it consumes time and
resources and has limited clinical use. Molecular methods of enterovirus
detection (such as PCR and typing based on genomic sequences) are
increasingly becoming available. Serotype-specific PCR primers have been
developed by CDC for several enteroviruses, including E30 (5). These
serotype-specific primers are useful for rapid differentiation of cases in
patients infected with the outbreak strain from sporadic infections with
other enteroviruses.
Aseptic meningitis is a benign, self-limiting illness, and severe illness
and death are uncommon. The treatment is symptomatic and most patients
recover in about 1 week. Enteroviruses typically are spread person to
person through the fecal-oral or oral-oral routes and through respiratory
droplets and fomites. No specific prevention or control measures are
available for nonpolio enteroviruses including E9 and E30. Adherence to
good hygienic practices, such as frequent and thorough hand washing
(especially after diaper changes), disinfection of contaminated surfaces by
household cleaners (such as diluted bleach solution), and avoidance of
shared utensils and drinking containers, are recommended to help interrupt
transmission.
