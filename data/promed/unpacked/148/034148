Sierra Leoneans sceptical about Ebola reality
---------------------------------------------
As Ebola virus disease [EVD] continues to send people to their grave, many Sierra Leoneans say that the trumpeting of Ebola [virus disease, EVD] by government officials is a way of making money for themselves. This was an argument in a 20 sitter bus that accommodates over 80 passengers in which only one lady was bold to say that Ebola is real.

So many passengers were saying that "the government will declare the country EVD free in September [2014] because that is the time the funding will close." Others were saying in krio [local Creole dialect] 'na lie lie' that is, EVD does not exist at all. Another group of passengers were saying that Ebola does exist in other parts of the world but not yet in Sierra Leone. While others were saying that the government is playing politics, stating that most of the victims are from the East which is the stronghold of the opposition party.

It was based on that argument that Awoko [News] visited Dove Cot and Kissy Road Market to investigate what people think about EVD. Many people were making fun about the issue and were saying that it is not real. A businessman said he did not believe that EVD is real and that the Ministry of Health and Sanitation had never showed the public victims of EVD. "I will never believe that EVD is real, until a victim is disclosed." He says the government is saying that body contact spreads EVD and they have done nothing to address the issue of transportation, where people are squeezed like sardines in public transport. He explains that the public transports usually are very choked up and everybody perspires and breathes on each other.

It was at that juncture that a lady who prefers anonymity said that EVD is real but many people do not believe because the communication strategy used was wrong. She explains that at the beginning of the crisis, government officials were making fun about the issue stating that information was coming from the Ministry of Health, State House, politicians, and civil society, so the public was confused as to who is saying the truth. "It was like in-house fighting, that was why the public is thinking that there is some amount of financial gain," she said. The lady said that EVD is an emergency issue and needs a coordinated approach to address it. She advised that the authorities concerned should go back to the drawing board and see where they have gone wrong in terms of sensitization, so it can be strengthened. "If the public refuses to believe that Ebola is real, then the disease will continue to spread," she said.

Harold Thomas, the health communication officer in the Directorate of Disease Prevention and Control at the Ministry of Health, said EVD is real and as of 21 Jul 2014, 139 have been confirmed dead. He said they have done a lot in terms of sensitizing Sierra Leoneans, stating that most of them have heard the information but are refusing to accept it because of their social and cultural background. Thomas said the sensitization had started long before EVD entered the country, and it is still in progress. He said they have engaged leaders of different groups and are also doing face-to-face sensitization. He encouraged Sierra Leoneans to join the fight against EVD, stating that EVD is real.

[2] Liberia: USD 500 000 for Ebola fight
Date: Wed 23 Jul 2014
Source: AllAfrica, The New Dawn (Monrovia) report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201407231043.html


The Liberian Government has announced USD 500 000 from its coffers to fund the Ebola campaign. Liberian health authorities have in recent days reported 105 Ebola related deaths, with 48 of those cases confirmed since the 2nd wave of the outbreak here.

Making the pronouncement on [Tue 22 Jul 2014], President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf appealed to all citizens and residents to join the fight against the deadly Ebola virus, and requested the military's logistic command to help transport medical supplies to affected areas. The Executive Mansion says President Sirleaf made the call during a brief stopover at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Congo Town early Tuesday morning [22 Jul 2014].

A release issued Tuesday evening says president Sirleaf expressed the conviction that the country can overcome the outbreak if a common front is formed in the fight against EVD through community outreach and other awareness campaigns. She commended health workers, national and international partners for their role in the fight and reassured government's commitment to the fight. She, however, challenged government officials in particular to take the lead in informing their communities about preventive measures, terming the outbreak as serious and suggested that everyone gets involved. "This is not the time for denial, this Ebola issue is true and we all have to fight it together," president said. President Sirleaf, who is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Liberia called on the military to get involved in the fight by helping to transport medical supplies to the affected areas through its logistic command.

Speaking earlier, World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa, Dr Luis Gomes Sambo praised the courage and commitment of the Liberian government in the campaign. He called on the population to stop doubting the existence of the outbreak and begin to take preventive measures as the surest way of containing the Ebola virus. The visiting WHO envoy told the gathering that though the disease is serious, it is manageable but only through preventive measures. He encouraged the Liberian government to keep up the fight and committed the WHO by partnering with Liberia in dealing with the situation.

Also speaking, Karin Lagrin, special representative of the United Nations secretary general, renewed the UN Mission's commitment to collaborating with government and all players in the fight to contain the outbreak. She named some of their strategies as radio and community outreach, terming it as the most important component of the preventive engagement

[3] Liberia: hospitals avoided, closed
Date: Wed 23 Jul 2014
Source: AllAfrica, The New Dawn (Monrovia) report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201407231033.html


The Christian run United Methodist Hospital in Ganta has recorded what is said to be its 1st EVD death, months after it reported the 1st patient it diagnosed during the initial outbreak of the virus there. Hospital officials told the New Dawn correspondent in the county that a 36 year old man from Monrovia and had been transferred to the hospital. Both the hospital's chief medical doctor and chief administrator, Dr Albert Willicor and Mr Victor Doolakeh told our correspondent that the victim had spent a week at the hospital before his demise. The victim was the 2nd Ebola patient to have reported at the hospital. It can be recalled that the 1st suspected Ebola patient diagnosed at the hospital was from neighboring Guinea, where the virus 1st broke out before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. His transfer to the JFK Medical Hospital in Monrovia at the time sparked a controversy, with condemnation for the doctor who ordered the transfer.

Our correspondent says the reported EVD death at the hospital has sent fear among residents of the city and its surrounding communities. The Ganta United Methodist Hospital, is one of the hospitals that receives patients from Guinea, Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] and other nearby counties here, but the news of an EVD patient death there is turning [other] patients away. Our correspondent who visited the hospital said some health workers were seen well dressed in their EVD [personal protective equipment], while others were working [without it?].

The correspondent also said that the reported EVD death in Ganta has forced citizens to revert to buying drugs over the counter and from street drugs peddlers. This news comes days after health authorities at the GW Harley hospital shut-down the only government hospital following news of 2 EVD patients there. Health authorities there have refused to comment on the matter.

[4] Liberia: corpse abandoned
Date: Wed 23 Jul 2014
Source: AllAfrica, FrontPageAfrica (Monrovia) report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201407231051.html


With a reported donation of USD 500 000 from Nigeria to fight Ebola in Liberia, the Ministry of Health says it is doing its best to curtail the deadly virus, but yet the corpse of a suspected EVD patient was allegedly abandoned in Louisiana, in Montserrado County since Friday [18 Jul 2014].

Mr Solomon Miller, commissioner of Louisiana, via mobile phone on Monday morning [21 Jul 2014] said that the body has been in Louisiana since Friday [18 Jul 2014] and when he contacted the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, they sent health workers to collect the body. "When the health workers arrived to get the body, the son of the deceased started throwing stones at the car and refused for the body to be removed, so they got into their car and left," said commissioner Miller.

The commissioner said, upon returning from a funeral service, on Saturday [19 Jul 2014], he called deputy health minister Dr Bernice Dahn, and she told him she could not send health workers without police officers there to protect them. Mr Miller said he then got the police and called Dr Dahn who promised to send the health team, but the whole of Monday [21 Jul 2014] he and his people waited until 9:00 pm with the health team not showing up. "The body is still here this Monday morning [21 Jul 2014] as I speak to you, and the entire Louisiana is in fear and cannot pass the road for fear they would get affected, because they have been educated that when a person dies of EVD, the virus becomes over-active and can affect anybody," said Miller. [This is a serious misunderstanding -- infection only occurs on contact with the body of a victim, not through the air. - Mod.JW]

Case recorded
-------------
But when contacted via mobile phone, Dr Dahn said "I know about the case in Louisiana and it has been recorded, but I am in the middle of something right now that I cannot talk, but call 1333, they are responsible," she said. Upon speaking, she hung up, but when FPA [FrontPageAfrica] called 1333, which is considered the Ebola Hotline, nobody answered the call as the phone rang endlessly.

As to whether the lady who died lived in Louisiana, commissioner Miller said the lady and her son were strangers, but he heard that she was a wife of one Mr RF, who lives in Fofee town, in Louisiana. "We do not know this woman and her son and since the son threw stones at health workers to leave, he has not been seen, and he was the one looking after his mother."

Miller said he heard that the deceased was in Monrovia treating her sister who was sick and when the sister died, she relocated to Louisiana but when the she arrived in Louisiana, the residents refused her because they had already gotten a hint on her sickness, and when she was turned away, she died on her way back to Monrovia.

With the number of confirmed deaths from the disease in Liberia rising, many citizens are afraid to take their family members suspected of Ebola to health facilities in the Country, because health workers are turning them away.

[5] Liberia: spraying and fumigation
Date: Tue 22 Jul 2014
Source: AllAfrica, The New Dawn (Monrovia) report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201407221077.html


The government of Liberia through the Ministry of Internal Affairs is calling on all county authorities to cooperate and collaborate fully with county health officers across the country in ongoing efforts to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus from Liberia.

The government emphasized that Ebola is a major threat to public health and called on superintendents, city mayors, paramount and clan chiefs, general town chiefs, traditional and religious leaders, and communities throughout the country to support sensitization efforts by the Ministry of Health and partners.

In a press release issued in Monrovia over the weekend [19-20 Jul 2014], the Ministry of Internal Affairs said there are residents in some communities, family, and group members who are resisting authorized Ministry of Health personnel sent to handle and bury deceased victims or to remove people that believed to be suffering from the disease in treatment units away from general population.

The release said in some communities, residents are also resisting health officers who go out to fumigate or spray areas where victims of the virus had lived, noting that such action interferes with efforts to combat the virus, and violates the public health laws of Liberia as well as undermines government's efforts to eradicate the disease.

[Crofsblogs comments: "I have no idea what fumigating and spraying are supposed to achieve against Ebola [virus disease], though the activities might reduce some vectorborne diseases like malaria. Otherwise, it's just public health theatre. More disturbing is the continuing gulf between government and people. The politicians can "call on" local communities to cooperate against the outbreak, but those communities seem reluctant to cooperate." http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2014/07/liberia-the-politics-of-fighting-ebola.html. - Mod.JW]

[6] Laboratory tests

Could point-of-care testing stop Ebola virus disease outbreak?
--------------------------------------------------------------
In this exclusive interview, Sonia Nicholas discusses the current Ebola crisis with Matt Boisen, program director of Infectious Disease & Emerging Technologies at Corgenix Medical Corp. Matt is also the director of In-vitro Diagnostic Development for the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium. Corgenix has just been awarded a 3-year, USD 2.9 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant, to advance the development of an Ebola rapid diagnostic test kit.

SN: How is Ebola tested for at present?
MB: Initially, samples from suspected Ebola virus disease [EVD] cases were sent to regional labs or European labs for PCR and confirmation testing using viral plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Various agencies and groups, including the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC), have now transferred the capability to perform the EBOV [ebolavirus] PCR testing to some of the hospitals that are serving as treatment centers. To my knowledge, no biocontainment labs have been brought online in West Africa to perform PRNT. In Sierra Leone, the primary EVD treatment site at Kenema Government Hospital already had the capacity to perform PCR testing through the Ministry of Health and Sanitation's Lassa fever Research Program that Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) have helped to fund. The VHFC has developed several prototype tests based on previous research for evaluation of assay components, but has not begun clinical studies associated with the new development grant.

SN: You have recently been awarded a grant to aid in the development of a point-of-care (POC) test for Ebola; can you tell us more about the need for a POC test for this virus?
MB: Under this outbreak situation, there is a focused effort to maintain PCR testing capacity supported by large organizations (WHO) and western governments. Typically, PCR is not performed in West African hospitals as a routine diagnostic method for endemic diseases such as Dengue or Lassa fevers, because it is a real challenge to maintain proper laboratory conditions - lab personnel are constantly combating sources of contamination in a way not seen in western hospitals or labs. PCR testing can also fail to detect EVD cases that have survived the acute viral infection and have developed post-acute or convalescent antibody titers. Identifying these survivors is key to proper disease surveillance and identification of EVD case-contacts in order to contain the outbreak. To my knowledge, none of the PCR protocols or immunoassays that been deployed for this outbreak have either regulatory approval or are commercially available. For example, PCR protocols and associated primers may be well cited [in the scientific literature] but have not gone through regulatory approval as commercial reagents. In the case of immunoassays, some agencies may have emergency use regulatory approval, but these tests are not commercially available to health care agencies or NGOs.

Development of POC tests has the potential to improve detection of EVD cases, aid in identifying case-contacts, and improve disease surveillance based on what we've seen with the ReLASV(c) Lassa fever tests that Corgenix and the VHFC have developed. With the proper combination of POC rapid test and ELISA tests for antigen and antibody detection, medical staff and outreach teams can have all this vital information within 2 hours of sample collection.

Most of the immunoassay methods currently employed in viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) testing incorporate inactivated viral culture stocks that have to be generated in western biocontainment labs. Development and use of these materials is very costly and an impractical approach to developing commercial products that can be distributed to countries interested in maintaining capacity to test for VHFs. The African countries that are endemic for VHFs do not have the resources to maintain the high level of disease screening and surveillance needed during the current outbreak. A low cost, robust alternative to maintaining PCR labs or using expensive testing materials can provide the capacity to maintain these disease surveillance programs.

The approach Corgenix and the VHFC have taken is to develop POC immunoassays using recombinant protein technology to eliminate the need for costly materials derived from viral cultures. The consortium partners have developed recombinant viral proteins that can be easily scaled-up under standard laboratory conditions and maintain high fidelity to native viral proteins. This allows the capacity to develop high affinity immunoassay reagents at an accelerated pace and reduced cost.

SN: What stage are you at in the development of this test; can you tell us anything about the technology that will be utilized?
MB: As with the ReLASV(c) products for the detection of Lassa fever, the plan is to commercialize both rapid point of care lateral flow immunoassays (LFI), as well as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The LFI tests are developed as visually read point-of-contact tests requiring no reader or electronic equipment, which is a key design feature in West Africa. The current Lassa fever rapid test only takes 15 minutes for a visual signal to develop. The ELISAs are designed to have only a few procedural steps in order to reduce the time to result to under 2 hours. The previous Phase I grant allowed development of several ebolavirus recombinant proteins and other critical materials. At that time there were no EVD outbreaks. Given the timing, we are hoping to perform some additional field evaluations of these reagents on current EVD samples to help accelerate the Phase II assay optimization and commercialization stages. Future development of the new EVD assays will be performed under the auspices of the proper regulatory bodies and ethics committees of the United States and the affected countries in West Africa.

SN: How long do you expect it to be before a POC Ebola test becomes available?
MB: This region of West Africa is now endemic for two of the world's deadliest viruses and will remain that way into the future. Currently the VHFC ebolavirus tests are not deployed for clinical testing in this outbreak. We do have an aggressive timeline to develop these assays and get them to pilot stage and clinical trials. We are already behind by a year due to the delay in receiving the Phase II award. It would be ideal to have materials in place for clinical testing before the next Lassa fever peak season, which typically begins in January. A timeline for completion of a clinical study has not been finalized and performance testing in biocontainment labs will also be requisite for technical filings.
However, we have great sympathy for those affected by this outbreak and with friends and colleagues on the ground there; every aspect of this project is being expedited as much as possible.

[In Sierra Leone, 7 weeks after EVD was 1st confirmed in the country, there is still a lot of denial of the disease, for complex reasons.

In Liberia, there seems to be a problem with the system for rapidly responding to reports of EVD cases, and a misunderstanding -- not only by the public -- of how the disease spread. It is not airborne; as long as there is no unprotected contact with a sick or dead victim or surfaces that they have touched, there is no danger of being infected. Spraying with 1:100 bleach solution any surfaces that might have been contaminated by an EVD case is effective against ebolavirus, but fumigation with insecticide (if that is what is meant) has no effect on viruses spread by contact, like ebolavirus.

In Liberia, on the one hand the government has reportedly released USD 500 000 to combat EVD, but on the other, the country's Senate blocked a resolution from the lower house to use USD 1.5 million earmarked for the 26 Jul 2014 Independence Day celebrations for fighting EVD instead, saying it was unconstitutional to reallocate those particular funds http://allafrica.com/stories/201407230941.html.
This leaves the bulk of financing Liberia's struggle against EVD to outside agencies.

The sooner point-of-care tests for ebolavirus can be deployed in the 3 countries, the sooner testing can be done at all hospitals there instead of only in those few with specially-equipped labs using expensive reagents and equipment and expatriate experts.

Rwanda, which borders Ituri district, Orientale Province, DR Congo, where a suspected EVD outbreak is currently occurring (see ProMED archive 20140721.2624831) has 32 trained people on the alert for imported EVD cases (http://allafrica.com/stories/201407230513.html?page=2) and information about EVD posted on its Rwanda Biomedical Center website http://www.rbc.gov.rw/spip.php?article696.
Those are prudent moves. West African countries that have not yet seen an EVD case, take note. - Mod.JW]
