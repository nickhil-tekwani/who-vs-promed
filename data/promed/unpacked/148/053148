Abstract
--------
Anthrax in herbivorous wildlife and livestock is generally assumed to be transmitted via ingestion or inhalation of _Bacillus anthracis_ spores. Although recent studies have highlighted the importance of the ingestion route for anthrax transmission, little is known about the inhalational route in natural systems. Dust bathing could aerosolize soilborne pathogens such as _B. anthracis_, exposing dust-bathing individuals to inhalational infections. We investigated the potential role of dust bathing in the transmission of inhalational anthrax to herbivorous wildlife in Etosha National Park, Namibia, an area with endemic seasonal anthrax outbreaks. We 1) cultured soils from dust-bathing sites for the presence and concentration of _B. anthracis spores_, 2) monitored anthrax carcass sites, the locations with the highest _B. anthracis_ concentrations, for evidence of dust bathing, including a site where a zebra died of anthrax on a large dust bath, and 3) characterized the ecology and seasonality of dust bathing in plains zebra (_Equus quagga_), blue wildebeest (_Connochaetes taurinus_), and African savanna elephant (_Loxodonta africana_) using a combination of motion-sensing camera traps and direct observations. Only 2 out of 83 dust-bath soils were positive for _B. anthracis_, both with low spore concentrations (<20 colony-forming units per gram). We also detected no evidence of dust baths occurring at anthrax carcass sites, perhaps due to carcass-induced changes in soil composition that may deter dust bathing. Finally, despite observing some seasonal variation in dust bathing, preliminary evidence suggests that the seasonality of dust bathing and anthrax mortalities are not correlated. Thus, although dust bathing creates a dramatic cloud of aerosolized soil around an individual, our microbiologic, ecologic, and behavioral results in concert demonstrate that dust bathing is highly unlikely to transmit inhalational anthrax infections.

[This is an interesting objective paper and worth reading in full. Spore bearing dust has been observed elsewhere and in the air. To be a risk the dust must (1) bear spores and (2) this must be at a suitable concentration to initiate an infection if breathed in. The latter evidence is still lacking. Plus large particles, e.g., 'dust', get caught in the mucus of the bronchial system and are promptly removed from the lungs.

We see wood bison bull wallows in the Wood Bison National Park in the Canadian Northwest Territories. They are key to these bulls as they form the center of their demonstration of importance; a mature bull can throw up a column of dust some 30-40 ft high. It puts off the need for fighting other bulls. And a few have been found by Dan Dragon to contain anthrax spores. But as 83 percent of bison anthrax deaths are of bulls and while most go for the cool shade when sick, some will die near their wallow. But to date the major risk in wood bison outbreaks is the presence of haemophagic biting flies, not dust. - Mod.MHJ
