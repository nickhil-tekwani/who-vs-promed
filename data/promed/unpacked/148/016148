French authorities in Strasbourg and all the media announced yesterday that
the water brought from Mecca was not contaminated with cholera bacilli, but
not drinkable anyway.

According to Micheline Gustin, Departmental Director for Health and social
affairs for the Lower Rhine, further investigation failed to reveal the
presence of _Vibrio cholera_ in the water carried from Mecca to France by
pilgrims. _Pseudomonas_ was found. The water has been declared unfit for
consumption and will be dumped.
