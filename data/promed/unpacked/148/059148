New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: AEroskobing, AEro Kommune, South Denmark
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2009

Affected population: the affected animal is a 14-year-old dairy cow,
which was diagnosed positive for BSE on 19 Nov 2009. The cow was sent
for slaughter on 16 Nov 2009 and the routine BSE test appeared
positive on 17 Nov 2009. The cow originated from a herd of 116 cattle
situated on the island AEro south of Funen. The cow was born in 1995
and was the oldest animal on the premises. The oldest animal present
now was born in 2002, one year after the introduction of the total
feed ban (see epidemiological comments).

Outbreak statistics
Species: cattle
Apparent morbidity rate: 0.86 percent
Apparent mortality rate: 0.00 percent
Apparent case fatality rate: 0.00 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 0.86 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: the affected animal was born before the
tightening of the feed ban in 1997 and 2001. In 1990, feeding
ruminant MBM to ruminants was prohibited. In 1997, feeding mammalian
MBM to ruminants was prohibited. On 1 Jan 2001, the Danish Veterinary
and Food Administration introduced a total ban on feeding processed
animal protein (including meat and bone meal (MBM), fish meal, etc.)
to animals that are kept, fattened, or bred for the production of
food. Control measures will be conducted in accordance with European
Union regulation no. 999/2001.

[It is not surprising at all that an old dairy cow might occasionally
be identified by surveillance as positive, even in countries which
never had a case before. A smaller number of sporadic cases will
likely continue to occur in countries as long as they have cattle
that are older than the time that effective feed bans went into place.

This year (2009) Canada had one case, Ireland 7, and Poland 4 cases,
outside of the UK. In 2008, there were a greater number of cases with
88 outside the UK. These included Canada (4), France (8), Germany
(2), Ireland (23), Italy (1), Japan (1), Netherlands (1), Poland (5),
Portugal (18), and Spain (25). For incidence data all the way back to
1989, see the OIE World Animal Health Situation page on BSE at
