Trypanosomiasis? - Sri Lanka: RFI 990707004230
Date: Wed, 07 Jul 1999 12:15:17 +0600
From: Dr. D. S. Rajasingham <Rajan1@bigfoot.com>

Regarding my hurried posting yesterday, I must clarify that the case is a
human one. The patient is a 65-year-old male who has lived in Eastern Sri
Lanka all his life, and has never travelled out of the area until now. He,
however, has close contact with cattle, as he is a herdsman.
A routine blood film for malaria was detected as having ?trypanosomes' by
the local Anti-Malaria Campaign microscopist, and the medical officer at
the local hospital concurred with him. The slide was sent to the central
Medical Research Institute for confirmation. The parasitology department
there confirmed that this was _Trypanosoma_ but were unsure about the type.
As stated earlier, we are not experienced in handling trypanosomiasis, and
so, assistance is being sought regarding species differentiation and
management. Any advice would be valuable, and further developments will be
reported.

[We appreciate the clarification. We would still like to know if he has
ever had a blood transfusion, and if anybody he knows has come from, or
travelled to, the Americas - Mod.JW
