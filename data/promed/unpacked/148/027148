During the period 3 Oct 2010 to 11 Dec 2010, influenza activity
remained low in most regions of the United States. Influenza viruses
characterized thus far in the influenza season are well matched to
the strains included in the 2010/11 influenza vaccine. This report
summarizes U.S. influenza activity during this period.

Viral Surveillance
-----------------
During the period 3 Oct to 11 Dec 2010, approximately 140 World
Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus
Surveillance System collaborating laboratories in the United States
tested 42 497 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 2807 (6.6
percent) were positive. Of these, 1598 (57 percent) were influenza A
viruses, and 1209 (43 percent) were influenza B viruses. A total of
805 (50 percent) of the 1598 influenza A viruses were subtyped; 679
(84 percent) of these were influenza A (H3) viruses, and 126 (16
percent) were 2009 influenza A (H1) viruses.

Influenza virus-positive tests have been reported from 48 states and
the District of Columbia and in all 10 of the surveillance regions
since 3 Oct 2010. However, of the 2807 influenza positive tests
reported to CDC so far this season, most (1778 [63 percent]) have
been reported from Region 4 (southeastern United States). Region 4 is
the only region where influenza B viruses have been reported more
frequently than influenza A viruses. Influenza B viruses from Region
4 account for 1034 (58 percent) of the influenza-positive tests
reported from the region and 86 percent of all influenza B viruses
reported for the country.

Antigenic Characterization
----------------------
WHO collaborating laboratories in the United States are requested to
submit a subset of their influenza-positive respiratory specimens to
CDC for further antigenic characterization. CDC has antigenically
characterized 89 influenza viruses collected by U.S. laboratories
during the 2010-11 season, including 13 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 26
influenza A (H3N2), and 50 influenza B viruses. All viruses were
antigenically related to the components included in the 2010-11
influenza vaccine: A/California/7/2009-like (H1N1),
A/Perth/16/2009-like (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like.

Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Virus Isolates
-------------------------------------------------
Since 1 Oct 2010, a total of 104 influenza viruses have been tested
for antiviral resistance. Of the 17 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 33
influenza A (H3N2), and 54 influenza B viruses tested, all were
sensitive to both oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Novel Influenza A Viruses
-------------------------
Three cases of human infection with a novel influenza A virus were
reported during November and December 2010, one each from Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. Onset of the illnesses occurred in
September, October, and November 2010, respectively. All 3 patients
were infected with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Two of
the 3 cases occurred in adults, and the 3rd occurred in a child. Two
of the 3 patients were hospitalized; all 3 have fully recovered from
their illness. The 3 cases are not related, and influenza viruses
recovered from each of these cases were similar but not identical,
indicating that they did not come from a common source. All 3
patients had either contact with swine or lived in areas close to
swine farms. No evidence of human-to-human transmission of these
viruses was identified in the 1st 2 cases, and investigation of the
3rd case is ongoing.

Out-patient Influenza-Like Illness
------------------------------
Since 3 Oct 2010, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for
influenza-like illness (ILI) reported by the approximately 1500 U.S.
Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (ILINet) weekly reporters in 50
states, New York City, Chicago, and the District of Columbia that
comprise ILINet, has ranged from 1.1 percent to 1.9 percent, which is
below the national baseline of 2.5 percent. On a regional level, only
Region 4 has reported ILI at or above their respective
region-specific baseline, and that was for a single week that ended
on 27 Nov 2010.

Since 3 Oct 2010, only 2 states, Georgia and Alabama, have
experienced high levels of ILI activity. No other state has reported
a level of activity higher than low.

Pneumonia- and Influenza-Related Mortality
---------------------------------------
For the week ending 11 Dec 2010, pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was
reported as an underlying or contributing cause of death for 6.9
percent of all deaths reported to the 122-Cities Mortality Reporting
System. This percentage is below the epidemic threshold of 7.3
percent for that week. During 3 Oct-11 Dec 2010, the weekly
percentage of deaths attributed to P&I ranged from 6.0 percent to 7.0
percent, remaining below the epidemic threshold.**

Influenza-Related Pediatric Mortality
----------------------------------------------
Two influenza-related pediatric deaths have been reported for the
2010-11 season, one each from Texas and New York. One death was
associated with an influenza A (H3) virus and the other with an
influenza A virus for which the subtype was not determined. Both
children were aged under 5 years and had bacterial coinfections, but
no chronic medical conditions were reported.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----------------------
Influenza activity in the United States during 3 Oct to 11 Dec 2010
was low overall, with cocirculation of influenza A (H3N2), 2009 A
(H1N1), and B viruses. Regional differences in influenza activity
have been noted, with the highest levels seen in the southeastern
states, where influenza B viruses have predominated. Influenza
activity likely will continue to increase in the weeks ahead. During
the 2009/10 season, as a result of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
circulation, influenza activity peaked unusually early (late
October); however, during 22 of the 27 influenza seasons before the
2009/10 season, influenza activity peaked in January or later (1).
Health-care providers should offer influenza vaccination throughout
the influenza season to protect as many persons as possible from
influenza virus infection and its complications.

Although influenza activity has been low nationwide, the 1st
pediatric influenza-associated deaths of the 2010/11 season have been
reported, and influenza-associated deaths also have been reported
among adults through the AHDRA system. Health-care providers are
reminded to consider influenza infection in the differential
diagnosis of persons hospitalized with acute respiratory illness,
including those with clinical or radiologically confirmed pneumonia.
Influenza antiviral medication treatment is recommended for persons
with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza illness who 1) are
hospitalized; 2) have a severe, progressive, or complicated illness
course; or 3) are at increased risk for influenza-related
complications (e.g. persons with asthma, pregnant women, children
aged under 2 years, and adults aged 65 years or older) (2). If
influenza diagnostic testing is performed, antiviral treatment should
not be delayed pending test results because the benefit of antiviral
treatment is greatest when started within the 1st 2 days of illness
(2,3). Additional information regarding use of influenza antiviral
medications is available online
[<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals>].

Three human infections with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus
have been identified since October 2010, increasing the total number
of detections of human infections with this virus to 6 during 2009
and 2010. The increase in detection of this virus might have
resulted, in part, from changes in testing methods implemented at
state public health laboratories at the start of the 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) pandemic to allow for detection of swine-origin influenza A
viruses (4,5). Before the pandemic, recognition of swine-origin
influenza A (H3N2) virus infection in humans was possible only for
the small subset of viruses for which detailed antigenic or genetic
analysis was performed.

The continued detection of transmission of influenza viruses from
swine to humans and the earlier detections of outbreaks in swine
herds resulting from the transmission of 2009 H1N1 infection from
humans (6) illustrates the importance of continued influenza
surveillance among both human and animal populations. Thorough
investigations of all cases of novel influenza virus infections are
important to rule out sustained human-to-human transmission. Clinical
laboratories that identify viruses that cannot be subtyped should
contact their state laboratories. State or local health departments
are urged to contact CDC immediately if they detect an influenza
virus thought to be of animal origin or any influenza A virus that
cannot be subtyped with the influenza reagents currently available.

During the 2009/10 season, as a result of pandemic 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) circulation, influenza activity peaked unusually early (late
October); however, during 22 of the 27 influenza seasons before the
2009/10 season, influenza activity peaked in January or later. The
data presented above suggest that the temporal pattern of influenza
activity is reverting to the pre-2009/10 pattern. The predominance of
influenza H3N2 (in contrast to the situation in Europe and some other
regions) appears to be a feature of the southeastern USA rather than
the USA as a whole.

Egypt's health ministry said it received reports of 218 cases of
influenza A/(H1N1) virus infection last week, bringing the country's
total to 533, including 30 deaths, since October [2010], Daily News
Egypt reported today [21 Dec 2010].

Abdel Rahman Shahin, the Health Ministry spokesman, said clinical
studies indicate the rate is normal for seasonal influenza and should
rise as outdoor temperatures cool. He said the 2009 H1N1 activity in
Egypt is an example of periodic outbreaks of the virus that the World
Health Organization (WHO) said it expected to see in the post-pandemic phase.

In England, which has also reported a spike in 2009 H1N1 infections,
302 people are being treated in intensive care units for influenza infections.

Elsewhere, Sri Lanka's health ministry yesterday [20 Dec 2010] issued
an alert advising pregnant women, healthcare workers, transportation
employees, armed forces, and law enforcement personnel to get
vaccinated against the 2009 H1N1 virus as a precaution, the Asian
Tribune reported today.

The WHO said in its latest update that 2009 H1N1 activity had
recently peaked in Sri Lanka, one of the few tropical countries
reporting flu transmission. Dr Sudath Peiris, a senior epidemiologist
at the health ministry, said Sri Lanka had already distributed the
400 000 doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine from the WHO and is requesting one
million more.
