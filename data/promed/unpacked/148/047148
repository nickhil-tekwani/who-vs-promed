The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health received notification from the Ministry of Health (MoH) today, 10 Sep 2012, concerning a case of bubonic plague.

A CHP spokesman said that according to the preliminary information from the MoH, 3 villagers in Ganzizhou, Sichuan Province, had consumed a dead marmot on 2 Sep 2012. One of them presented with painful swelling of lymph nodes on the right side on 4 Sep 2012 and was admitted to hospital on 7 Sep 2012. His condition deteriorated later and he died on the same day.

According to the deceased's clinical characteristics, epidemiological investigation, and laboratory test results, the health authority of Sichuan Province confirmed the case as bubonic plague.

The health authority has traced 59 close contacts of the deceased (including the other 2 villagers who had consumed the marmot) and carried out medical surveillance. None of them were symptomatic.

"We are maintaining close liaison with the MoH in order to obtain more information on the case," the spokesman said. The Department of Health's Port Health Office will also alert the travel industry about the report.

The spokesman reminded travellers to avoid visiting plague-endemic areas. People who need to travel to areas with plague reports have to be vigilant and have to observe precautionary measures including wearing long sleeved shirts and trousers to avoid being bitten by fleas and applying insect repellent. "They should seek medical attention immediately if they are feeling unwell," the spokesman said.

[The death of the case here suggests progression of bubonic plague to septicemic plague and/or pneumonic plague. It is the latter form of infection that can spread via the respiratory route from person-to-person.

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse". - Mod.LL
