More cases of tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden
-----------------------------------------------
The number of people infected by tick-borne diseases, such as
[tick-borne] encephalitis, has gone up this year. So far in August
[2011], 66 cases of the deadly disease [tick-borne encephalitis] have
been reported, which is more than during any other month in the past 4
years.

"It looks like there will be more cases in total in 2011. The season
for tick-borne encephalitis started early," Marika Hjertqvist, an
epidemiologist at the Swedish Institute for Infectious disease
control, told Swedish Radio News. The weather plays a big role when it
comes to spreading the disease since a mild winter and a warm summer
usually means more ticks and also that people spend more time
outdoors.

In total this year 144 cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been
reported already compared to the total of 174 for the whole of 2010.

[Data compiled by Dr. Steven Berger from the Gideon Database, and
posted in the ProMED-mail report archived as: 'Tick-borne encephalitis
- Sweden 20100620.2072], highlighted the fact that Sweden has the
highest rate of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Scandinavia,
exceeding even those of Russia in 2008. It would seem that this trend
is being maintained, possibly as a consequence of climate change.
Interested readers can obtain further information on the prevalence
and distribution of of TBE in Sweden from this document.
