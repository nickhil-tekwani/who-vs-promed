A batch of home-made goat's cheese was last night identified as the
probable cause of a serious outbreak of _E. coli 0157_ which has affected
eight children at an Aberdeenshire primary school.
The unpasteurized cheese, made by a grandparent, was brought to school last
week for a project on taste by one of the seven-year-old pupils in the
Primary 3 class at Macduff Primary.
But it could be later this week before the cheese can be confirmed as the
source of the potentially deadly bacterial infection which has now affected
a quarter of the 31 pupils in the class.
The Macduff outbreak is the biggest in Scotland since the fatal _E. coli_
outbreak in Wishaw, Lanarkshire in 1996.
Yesterday three boys and a girl, confirmed as having contracted the
infection, were said to be "stable" in the Royal Aberdeen Children's
Hospital. Two boys and a girl, suspected of having the infection, are also
being monitored at the hospital, and another pupil is being treated at home.
Education sources have confirmed to The Scotsman that unpasteurised goat's
cheese, made by the grandfather of a non-infected pupil, has been
identified as the most likely cause [source of the infection.
Laboratory tests are being carried out on a sample of the cheese and
veterinary inspectors are carrying out tests on the goat and its milk.
