The following is the epidemiological investigation of foodborne
illness at the Ottawa County Adult Correctional Facility prepared by
me on 30 May 2006 [edited by Mod.LL]:
I. Introduction
This epidemiologic study was conducted to determine the etiology of
illness that plagued some of the inmates of the Ottawa County Adult
Correctional Facility and also to implement control measures to
prevent additional illness. On 17 May 2006, the Ottawa County Health
Department was notified by Ottawa County Adult Correctional Facility
that several of the inmates were experiencing gastrointestinal
symptoms. Ottawa County Health Department assembled and dispatched an
investigation team that included interdepartmental staff and region 6
epidemiologists. Epidemiological investigation indicated that the
onset of illness was 16 May 2006 with majority reporting onset on 17
May 2006, duration of illness was difficult to estimate since
majority of the cases were still experiencing symptoms during the
investigation period. Environmental inspection revealed violations of
the food handling process.
II. Methods
A. Epidemiologic Investigation
On 17 May 2006 a team consisting of one communicable disease nurse,
one regional epidemiologist and one sanitarian from Ottawa County
Health Department conducted 85 interviews of the jail inmates using a
gastrointestinal illness case investigation questionnaire developed
specifically for this investigation. The questionnaire was used to
obtain data on demographics (name, date of birth, gender and cell
location), symptoms, date and time of onset of symptoms, medical care
and 3-day food item consumption history. Data from completed
questionnaires were entered into Epi Info and analyzed using SAS
version 9 statistical software. A case was defined as any individual
who was symptomatic with vomiting and or 3 or more episodes of
diarrhea and onset date of symptoms was 17 May 2006.
B. Environmental Investigation
An on-site evaluation of the jail facility was conducted by
Environmental Health Division of the Ottawa County Health Department.
The Ottawa County Adult Correction Facility's inspections are managed
by the Department of Corrections but for this investigation Ottawa
County Health Department evaluated the food handling processes.
During the inspection, the food preparation staff was interviewed and
procedures used in food preparation were reviewed. Samples of food
items available were collected for testing purposes, powdered milk
and leftover boiled egg was collected from breakfast on the 17 May
2006, leftover food samples were collected for all items served for
dinner on 16 May 2006 except for the margarine and beverage. Based on
the results from the environmental inspection and epidemiology
analysis, only the powdered milk sample was sent in for testing.
C. Laboratory and Clinical Investigation
On 18 May 2006, stool specimen kits were made available by the
Communicable disease department of Ottawa County Health Department to
the jail facility. Stool samples were then collected from 6 inmates
by the jail facility nurses and transferred to Ottawa County Health
Department. The Ottawa County Health Department then submitted the
stool sample directly to Kent County Health Department laboratory and
Michigan Department of Community Health laboratory for analysis.
Also a sample of the powdered milk that was usually reconstituted for
meals was also submitted to Kent County Health Department laboratory
for analysis. Unfortunately there was no sample of the reconstituted
portion of the milk served available for testing.
III. Results
A. Epidemiology
Descriptions of all interviewees indicate that 87.1 percent were
males. Ages ranged from 17 to 56 years old with a median age of 27
years old. Cell distribution of interviewees indicated 18.8 percent
from Pod A, 22.4 percent from Pod B, 10.6 percent from Pod C, 8.2
percent from Pod M and 40 percent from Gen (general area).
There were 36 cases of the interviewees that fit the case definition
and 49 cases were used as controls. Descriptive analysis of all
identified cases revealed that 86.1 percent (31 percent) were male
and the ages ranged from 17 to 54 years old with a median age of 28 years old.
Description of case symptoms rate were as follows: vomiting 63.9
percent (23/36), diarrhea 86.1 percent (31/36), bloody diarrhea 2.9
percent (1/34), nausea 91.7 percent (33/36), abdominal cramps 80.6
percent (29/36) headache 63.9 percent (23/36), fever 28.1 percent
(9/32), fatigue 50 percent (17/34), constipation 8.3 percent (3/36)
and chills 52.8 percent (19/36). The duration of the symptoms is had
to estimate since approximately 53 percent of the interviewees
indicated that they were still experiencing symptoms at the time of
the interview.
Analysis of the food sample indicated that there is an association
between being ill and consumption of milk during breakfast on 16 and
17 May 2006. Those who consumed milk during breakfast on 17 May were
28 times more likely to become ill compared to those who did not
consume milk during breakfast on that day. Also those who consumed
milk during breakfast on 16 May were 5 times more likely to become
ill compared to those who did not consume milk during breakfast on
that day. There was also an association between being ill and
consumption of cereal on 17 May. Those who ate cereal for breakfast
on that day were 3 times more likely to be ill compared to those who
did not eat cereal for breakfast.
B.Environmental
The food handling and preparation techniques for the following foods:
sugar and jelly, bread, cereal, breakfast pastry, milk and eggs were
reviewed. The jail facility met food handling and preparation
techniques for all the above listed food item except for the milk.
The review indicated violation of the food handling and preparation
techniques code 3-501.15 (cooling methods). The jail facility
indicated that their reconstituted milk (mixed with warm water) was
put in a cambro container [a commercial brand of plastic food service
products] and covered with saran wrap while cooling thus preventing
proper heat transfer from the food surface.
The review also revealed a critical violation in relation to the
sanitization of equipment and utensil code 4-702.11 (before use after
cleaning). The jail facility indicated that the cambro containers
used for reconstituting and holding the milk before serving were
cleaned by hand scrubbing with only water after each use. The spigots
were only bleached 2 times a week.
C. Laboratory / Clinical
Laboratory test requisition for the powdered milk sample sent to Kent
County Health Department was for _Staphylococcus aureus_ and
_Bacillus cereus_. The results of the powdered milk sample indicated
no bacterial growth. No _S. aureus_ or _B. cereus_ enterotoxins were
found in the submitted sample.
Laboratory test requisition for the 6 stool samples sent to Kent
County Health Department was for norovirus, _S. aureus_ and _B.
cereus_. All 6 samples tested negative for norovirus. 2 of the stool
samples also tested negative for _B. cereus_ and _S. aureus_. The
remaining 4 stool specimens yielded positive results for _S. aureus_
and negative results for _B. cereus_. The 4 samples positive for _S.
aureus_ had enterotoxin D DNA present.
IV. Discussion/ Conclusion
The working hypothesis is that the preparation process of milk
resulted in bacterial growth that caused those who consumed the milk
to become ill. The environmental investigation indicated that the
preparation process of milk and sanitization process may be the major
contributing cause of the illness. The clinical presentation was
consistent with _S. aureus_ and _B. cereus_ and plausibly norovirus.
Estimation of the duration of the illness was between 15 minutes to
12 hours, with the median duration of illness of 4 hours. This is
contradictory to the duration of illness for norovirus with duration
of 12-60 hours and more in agreement with the duration of illness for
the bacterial toxin diseases mentioned.
The epidemiological analysis of data collected indicated associations
between milk served for breakfast (on 16 and 17 May 2006) and
becoming ill. Also there was an association between the cereal served
for breakfast on 17 May and becoming ill. Further analysis indicated
an interaction between the milk served for breakfast on 17 May and
the cereal served for breakfast on that day. The laboratory results
from the stool samples indicated the presence of _S. aureus_
enterotoxin D, and the negative results from the stool samples rule
out norovirus. The laboratory result from the powdered milk sample
was negative for _S. aureus_ but as such does not provide the
conclusive evidence needed to confirm milk as the source of the illness.
The environmental, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and
findings (stool samples) provide very strong evidence that the
causative organism was _S. aureus_; however due to the absence of _S.
aureus_ in the powdered milk it cannot be established as a link
between the enterotoxin D identified in the stool samples to the
milk. _S. aureus_ can be found naturally in approximately 15 to 20
percent of stool samples and about 30 percent of the Staphylococcus
species produce enterotoxin D. We presumptively postulate that the
source of the illness was the milk.
V. Recommendations
On 17 May 2006, Ottawa County Health Department provided the Ottawa
County Adult Correctional Facility with educational information on
measures that could optimize efforts towards controlling potential
secondary contamination. The Environmental Health department within
Ottawa County Health department also made recommendations and
provided the facility with information on proper food handling
procedures and cleaning/sanitization practices of food processing equipment.
