Dear Prof. Nash,
Thank you for your excellent ProMED-mail reviews on the relationship
between infectious agents and chronic diseases. However, in your last
posting there was a small detail that I would like to make a virological
comment on:
Kaposi's sarcoma & its associated herpesvirus [EBV, Epstein-Barr virus
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8, HHV-8) and
Epstein-Barr virus (human herpesvirus 4, HHV-4) are completely different
viruses that share two characteristics: 1) both are (human) herpesviruses,
2) both are associated with malignancies (Kaposi's sarcoma for HHV-8 and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma for HHV-4 are the most
well-known examples). Epstein-Barr virus has, to my knowledge, not been
associated with Kaposi's sarcoma.

with human malignancies: some key questions. Ann Med 1998 Jun;30(3):249-59
Abstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses genes that stimulate cells to
divide in culture. This property, coupled with the close association of the
virus with numerous malignancies, has prompted its designation as a human
DNA tumour virus. Before human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, alternatively KS
virus) was discovered, EBV was unique in this property among the human
herpesviruses. EBV infection has been best characterised in terms of gene
expression in B lymphocytes and epithelium, which represent cells found in
the best known of the associated malignancies, Burkitt's lymphoma and
poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The bulk of evidence
supports B cells as the primary EBV reservoir with the viral route into
other cell types remaining ill-defined. Molecular studies on gene
expression in the associated tumours suggest that EBV encodes a number of
functions associated with cell growth; whether they are expressed or silent
may largely be under control of the host cell. Many questions partly
addressed here remain with regard to this virus, two critical ones relating
to the mechanisms by which viral gene products escape T-cell recognition -
relevant from the fact that gene expression is not tightly restricted to
nonimmunogenic functions in tumours - and whether EBV can invoke cell
growth in a manner not requiring its continued presence. The latter seems a
plausible hypothesis and is of particular importance with regard to
identifying and understanding pathologies associated with EBV, as viral
transcriptional transactivators may on initial infection permanently
perturb cell regulation.

North Am 1998 Mar;12(1):63-82
Abstract: KS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among AIDS
patients and a treatment problem in the sporadic cases that are not
associated with HIV. All four forms of the disease are linked to a newly
described herpesvirus, HHV-8 or KSHV, via strong epidemiologic associations
and biologic plausibility as a causal agent. HHV-8 is also
epidemiologically associated with body cavity-based lymphomas, which are
almost unique to AIDS, and Castleman's disease. Existing radiation and
chemotherapeutic treatments of KS are only partially effective and cause
significant adverse effects. New preventive approaches and therapies aimed
at inhibiting HHV-8 may be effective. New treatments that interfere with
the molecular mechanisms that drive KS may, in the future, provide the best
opportunities to control the disease.
Hope this helps to clarify the sometimes confusing nomenclature of
herpesviruses,

>"Additional chronic diseases suggested as candidates with infectious
etiologies were, Kaposi's Sarcoma & its associated herpesvirus
[EBV,Epstein-Barr virus,"
Kaposi's Sarcoma is associated with HHV-8/KHSV not EBV. Not to take away
from the role of EBV in chronic diseases as this virus is directly
associated with at least two human cancers: Burkitt's lymphoma and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV is also a significant problem in AIDS
patients where it is associated with (i) diffuse polyclonal lymphomas, (ii)
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis and (iii) oral hairy leukoplakia of
the tongue.

[The words [EBV -- Epstein-Barr virus were inserted by me, not by Hal
Nash, & I regret not identifying myself there. At the time of the
isolation of EBV in association with Burkitt tumors & its identification as
a human herpesvirus, I believe it was thought that the agent associated
with Kaposi's sarcoma was the same. We are most grateful to Frank & Sidney
for the corrections. - Mod.JW
