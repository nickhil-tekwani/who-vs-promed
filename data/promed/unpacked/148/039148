The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 69 additional suspected monkeypox cases in the past month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), bringing the cumulative total since the beginning of the year [2021] to 8849.

In addition, 3 more deaths were recorded, bringing the monkeypox death for 2021 to 69.

In 2020, DRC saw a total of 6257 suspected cases including 229 deaths (CFR 3.7%) reported in 133 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the country.

According to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows: About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired. 1 to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too. The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off. The illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks. [The URL for this report has an image of MPX skin lesions]

Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts.

People at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or if you have contact with the animal's rash, blood or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory [droplets] or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.

There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.

[Monkeypox (MPX) continues to increase in the DR Congo. As of 8 Aug 2021 there were 2523 cases reported with 66 deaths. The above report brings the total to 8849 with 69 deaths. As mentioned in previous reports, it is not clear how many of the reported cases above are laboratory confirmed. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may have been chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. However, as the report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents or other wild mammals may be the source of MPX virus transmission. - Mod.TY
