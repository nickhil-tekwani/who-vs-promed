I hate to disagree with Jamuna, but I would have thought melioidosis
most unlikely as a cause of the 'TB-like' disease described in the
previous posting for the following reasons:
1. The clinical signs and symptoms do not sound typical (although very
few details were given in the original posting). Specifically there is
no mention of abscesses nor of pulmonary involvement, which one might
expect to see in some of "about 20 cases". I agree that the presence
and nature of underlying diseases are important pointers.
2. Although an outbreak of (mainly animal) melioidosis was reported in
France in the mid-1970s, and environmental contamination was found at
that time, the contamination declined over time, and neither
environmental isolates nor indigenously-acquired melioidosis have been
reported from France for over 10 years.
3. The organism is not difficult to grow, and so simple cultures should
have been able to exclude this possibility.
Nevertheless, it would be interesting to hear more about this 'new disease'.
