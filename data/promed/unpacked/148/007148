Toxoplasmosis spread among sheep in Tasmania
------------------------------------
Tasmania's wool-growing industry is under threat from a devastating disease
being spread by feral cats, say rural-sector leaders.
Wool Council executive officer Roger Tyshing says some Midlands woolgrowers
have lost up to 50 percent of their new season's lambs to toxoplasmosis,
which causes infected ewes to abort or produce stillborns. The ewes become
infected by ingesting a parasite contained in feral cats' faeces, Mr
Tyshing says.
"Tasmania's feral cat problem is causing stock losses that could seriously
cripple woolgrowers' ongoing viability," he said. "When someone experiences
a 50 percent loss of lambs, the genetic pool for their breeding program --
which they would have invested heavily in building up -- is reduced.
"Income from the sale of fat lambs is considerably depleted, and in this
day and age farmers can't afford this sort of loss." Carrick woolgrower
Rosemary Stobart said her fine-wool business had been hit hard by the loss
of 300 lambs to toxoplasmosis in 2003. "2 weeks before they were due to
lamb, 300 ewes just aborted," Ms Stobart said.
"It was devastating. They were very well-bred sheep and I'd paid a lot of
money for them." She had immediately had her ewes tested for toxoplasmosis
and the results had come back positive. Feral cats had reached epidemic
proportions on her property, Hatherly, she said.
"My son has shot 10 feral cats on the property since Christmas 2003, and
the fox-catching program has trapped many more," Ms Stobart said.
Mr Tyshing said a number of Tasmanian woolgrowers had been so badly
affected by toxoplasmosis they had stopped running ewes. "Quite a few
farmers have got out of running ewes and lambs and just run castrated male
sheep, which are not susceptible to toxoplasmosis," he said. Mr Tyshing
called on the State Government to introduce cat control programs.

[The feral cat is a well-known reservoir of _Toxoplasma gondii_ in
Tasmania. Previous studies have found approximately 50 percent of cats
infected. So called "abortion storms" have been described from other parts
of the world where _Toxoplasma gondii_ occurs, referring to epidemics of
abortions in pregnant sheep when they are let loose on fields heavily
contaminated with _Toxoplasma gondii_ oocysts. Preventing feral cats from
shedding oocysts on grazing land is difficult, and the best strategy is
immunization of pregnant sheep. - Mod.EP]
