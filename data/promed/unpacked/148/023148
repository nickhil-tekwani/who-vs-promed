MEDIA ADVISORY
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CDC Press Office: 404
639-3286
August 21, 1998
The CDC and Health Canada investigation of a summertime outbreak of
influenza and pneumonia among travelers to Alaska and the Yukon territory
has identified more than 1,600 cases, including 47 cases of pneumonia. The
CDC now recommends that travelers to this area who are 65 years of age and
older and those with chronic medical conditions first consult with their
physicians before travel.
Persons 65 years of age and older and those with chronic medical conditions
are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza, such as
pneumonia. Travelers may want to talk with their physicians about the
symptoms and complications of influenza and the advisability of carrying
antiviral medications while traveling in Alaska and the Yukon Territory
this summer.
During the summer, up to 70,000 overland tour and cruise ship passengers
travel to Alaska and the Yukon Territory each week. Many cases of illness
continue to be reported in clusters, particularly among smaller groups of
tourists sharing transportation and accommodations on overland tours in the
region. Information continues to suggest that, after touring inland, ill
persons are boarding cruise ships and seeking medical care. These cases
contribute to further spread among passengers and crew. In cooperation
with CDC, numerous cruise lines have initiated active surveillance for
respiratory illnesses, and some have organized vaccination campaigns for
crew members and have acquired stocks of antiviral medications. Antivirals
can be used to decrease the duration of influenza illness caused by A
strain viruses, if administered within 48 hours after symptoms begin.
Preliminary characterization has identified the strain as influenza
A/Sydney/5/97/ (H3N2)-like.
