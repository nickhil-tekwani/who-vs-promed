While the 1st wave of the flu epidemic of A(H1N1)
comes to an end in Guadeloupe, there now looms another virus, that of dengue.

The epidemiological situation in the archipelago
has deteriorated rapidly over the past 2 weeks,
according to the Committee of Experts on
Infectious and Emerging Diseases. A sudden and
significant increase in the number of cases was
observed. [Medical care] consultations in general
have increased by over 80 percent, and 89 cases
of dengue were laboratory confirmed over the past
3 weeks in Guadeloupe. The northern part of the
windward side of Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre are
the areas most heavily affected by this worsening situation.

The Prefect decided to initiate Phase 3 of "Plan
Dengue." We are, therefore, in the "epidemic
risk" phase, a phase in anticipation of a
potential epidemic with the preparation of
appropriate control measures. According to a
statement from the prefecture, the state
departments have already strengthened and
expanded control operations for mosquito vectors
of disease [virus]. A management committee should
meet on 7 Jan [2010] in order to mobilize all stakeholders.

As for the population, they are asked to protect
themselves against the bites of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito vector for dengue fever [virus]
and help in the fight against the proliferation
of mosquitoes by ensuring the destruction of
breeding sites. [They should] protect water
supplies, clean gutters, throw away objects that
can hold water in case of rain. These are some
actions that could prevent proliferation of the mosquitoes.

During 2009, there have been 55 reported deaths
due to dengue, among which 50 were laboratory
confirmed, according data of Coordination
Epidemiological Surveillance of the state
Secretariat of Health of Mato Grosso (SES/MT).
With the period of heavy rain, the trend is that
cases will increase, so public participation in
mosquito control is fundamental.

Until this Tuesday [29 Dec 2009], 54 299 dengue
cases have been reported, 1474 of which were
severe cases of the disease. Cuiaba has so far
reported 13 538 cases. Of these, 332 were
reported as serious. 13 cases were recorded as
deaths from dengue in Cuiaba, of which 12 cases
were confirmed, and one is under investigation.

In Varzea Grande, so far 4937 cases of dengue
have been recorded. Of that number, 480 were
reported as severe cases of dengue. In the
municipality, 9 deaths were registered, of which
8 were confirmed, and one is under investigation.

The state of Mato Grosso showed an increase of
374 percent of reported dengue, compared with the
periods from January-22 Dec 2008 to January-22 Dec 2009.

[At the risk of being tiresome, I repeat: there
is a considerable dengue epidemic in the
central-western Brazil region, despite frequent
statements that cases of dengue in Brazil declined in 2009.

The truth is that, in absolute terms, [dengue]
declines, but not in the entire country, rather
just in the most populated regions. The epidemic continues. - Mod.LJS]

Campo Grande is already preparing to face another
major epidemic of dengue. Three years after
affecting 45 000 people, the disease [outbreak]
has gained strength in recent months and
threatens to repeat this level, with much more
severity in 2010. The number of cases reported
this month [December 2009] is already 1138
percent higher than the same period last year [2008].

The Municipal Secretary of Health [SESAU], Luiz
Henrique Mandetta, since last month [November
2009], has warned the population of a repetition
of a 2nd epidemic disease with a much larger
number of serious cases. [Dengue] virus type 1,
to which 80 percent of the population is
susceptible, is in circulation and should be
responsible for the spread of dengue fever this summer [2010].

The person responsible for Epidemiological
Surveillance of SESAU, Erci Hirota, reported the
death of a 13-year-old boy, who is the 2nd death
caused by dengue this year [2009]. If confirmed,
it repeats the same number recorded in 2006 and
2007. Last year [2008], there were no deaths from dengue in the capital.

In the epidemic, as of Sunday, 29 Dec [2009], the
Health Secretariat reported 1300 suspected dengue
cases in Campo Grande. With 2 days to wind up the
year [2009], with an average of 100 new reports
per day, the number of dengue cases this month
[December 2009] should exceed the number recorded
in 2006 on the eve of the great epidemic, when 1438 cases were recorded.

Compared to December last year [2008], when there
were 105 reported dengue cases, there was an
increase of 1138 percent. The number exceeds by
296 percent the occurrences in the same month of
2007, when there were 328 patients with symptoms of the disease.

Public services are doing their part, but it is
like the work of an ant among a population of
nearly a million inhabitants warned Erci, who
made an appeal to the populace to combat the
mosquito that transmits the disease [virus] in the city.

[I am troubled by the media and the health
authorities who insist on counting cases of
dengue and proclaiming victory in its control.
They look and see only the trees, not the forest.
That is not epidemiological surveillance, only
health accounting! Dengue has become
endemic/epidemic in Brazil, where cases always
occur, with frequent epidemics in the most
diverse places. It now seems the time for the
west-central region. In 2008, it was Rio de
Janeiro. Health accounting records an increase in
cases when very populous regions are affected and
a fall in cases where regions of lower population
are affected; however, outbreaks continue to
occur. The problem is not just the absolute
number of cases but the force, or intensity, of transmission.

Sinop, in northern Mato Grosso, has about 100 000
inhabitants; the dengue mortality [rate] is,
consequently, 7 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants,
which is nothing to be ignored. - Mod.LJS]

[The MS Noticias edition of 1 Jan 2010
<http://www.msnoticias.com.br/?p=ler&id=30721>
indicated that Campo Grande could win back its
title as the dengue capital. Registered cases of
dengue in the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul
increased more than 1000 percent at the end of
the year (2009) in relation to the same period of last year (2008). - Mod.TY]

The number of reported cases of dengue fever rose
in 2009, but fatalities significantly fell from
2008 due to improved public awareness, local
media reported on Thursday [31 Dec 2009], citing health officials.

Ngan Chantha, director of dengue control at the
Health Ministry, was quoted by the Cambodia Daily
as saying that there were 11 625 cases of dengue
fever and 36 deaths from the disease this year
[2009], compared to 9245 cases and 65 deaths last year [2008].

"We intervened by disseminating information
through the media, spraying mosquito insecticide,
and training doctors and nurses to help dengue
victims properly. People understand the disease
and how dangerous it is, but they still don't
change their behavior," he said, referring to the
need to keep homes free of places where mosquitoes can breed.

Most of this year's [2009] dengue infections
occurred in high-density areas in provinces
including Kompong Cham, Kandal, Siem Reap, and
Kampot, as well as the capital Phnom Penh, Chantha added.

Doung Socheat, director of the National Center
for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control,
agreed with Ngan Chantha that this year's [2009]
decrease in fatalities was due to improved
awareness and public health education on how to treat the disease.

Public health authorities will concentrate on
decreasing further the number of both dengue
infections and fatalities in the coming year [2010], Socheat said.

[According to the newswire above, a total of 11
625 cases and 36 fatalities of dengue fever were
reported in Cambodia during 2009, 9245 cases and
65 fatalities in 2008, and 39 851 cases and 407
fatalities in 2007 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting
Dengue - Cambodia (03) 20081230.4108). The
morbidity and mortality due to dengue infection
have been apparently decreasing in 2008 and 2009 compared with those of 2007.

Summaries of the number of reported cases of
dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DF/DHF) in the Western Pacific region by country
are available from WHO's Regional Office for the
Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO) at
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>.
According to this report, as of 18 Sep 2009,
there were 9241 cases and 25 deaths of dengue
fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
reported in Viet Nam during 2009. There were 9542
cases and 65 deaths of dengue fever during 2008,
and 39 851 cases and 407 deaths during 2007.
