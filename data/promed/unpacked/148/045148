A person from Green County has died in an _E. coli_ outbreak that
appears to be isolated in that southwestern Wisconsin county,
according to a state health official.

The Capital Times on Wed 14 Sep 2011 reported the death as a
20-month-old child who died Sunday [11 Sep 2011] at UW Children's
Hospital in Madison. The state and the Green County Health Department
are investigating 9 confirmed _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections in Green
County, reportedly scattered around the county.

A common source of exposure has not been identified, said Beth Kaplan,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Services. "The state
lab has done testing to confirm the _E. coli_ isolated from stools has
the same DNA fingerprint," she said.

Young children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to _E.
coli_ O157:H7, which can cause a potentially fatal form of kidney
failure, hemolytic uremic syndrome. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
primarily attacks the red blood cells and kidneys. Two patients in
this outbreak have been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome,
Kaplan confirmed.

The outbreak started in mid-August 2011, and the most recent case was
reported in early September 2011, Kaplan said. She added that the
cases appear isolated in Green County.

[No vehicle of transmission has yet been elucidated in this outbreak.
That there is one death already and 2 more cases of HUS strongly
suggest that the total number of cases is probably 2 or 3 times
higher. - Mod.LL]
