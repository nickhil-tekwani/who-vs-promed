Persistent propaganda and parents' refusal to vaccinate their children has yet again led to the paralysis of 5 more children, raising the total count of polio cases to 31 in 2019 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and to 37 in the country, respectively

According to a notification of National Institute of Health (NIH) issued today [3 Jul 2019], 5 new polio cases have been confirmed from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa out of which 3 polio cases are confirmed from district Bannu and 2 from district Torghar.

The details reveal that wild polioviruses have been isolated from stool samples of a 2-month-old boy resident of UC Sardikhel, Tehsil SD Wazir in District Bannu; an 8-month-old boy of UC Lewan, Tehsil Bannu of District Bannu; and a 27-month-old boy of UC Nasirkhel, Tehsil SD Wazir in District Bannu.

Likewise, virus has been isolated from the stool samples of a 46-month-old girl and a 16-month-old boy of Gaeito village, UC Harnail, in District Torghar.

It is pertinent to mention that all the children [affected] by poliovirus were zero-dose for the essential immunization.

In a press statement issued [in Peshawar] on [Wed 3 Jul 2019], Coordinator EOC [Emergency Operations Center] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Capt. (R). Kamran Ahmed Afridi has shown grave concern over the persistent virus circulation in the province and the resultant increase in the number of polio victims.

He said that all the efforts put in by provincial government to eradicate polio from the region will not be achieved unless refusing parents understand that their individual decision to refuse anti polio vaccines not only demonstrates indifference to their child's health but is also an expression of disregard to the national cause of polio eradication that we must have to achieve as a nation.

[The information in the newswires above re: 5 newly confirmed cases of polio is also confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019). The continued identification of newly confirmed cases with histories of not having received vaccine is a continuation of the impact of the Pakistani antivaccine movement.

With respect to the global picture, with the addition of these 5 newly confirmed cases in Pakistan, the global number of confirmed cases of WPV1 associated polio reported since 1 Jan 2019 is now up to 47.
