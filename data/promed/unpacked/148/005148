[1] Qatar - media report

An elderly Qatari man has become the country's 1st citizen in nearly a year to contract the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, it has been announced.

The disease is said to have struck a 66-year-old [elderly? - Mod.MPP] man who suffers from several chronic diseases at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), according to the Ministry of Public Health.

Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported that this is the 1st case to be registered this year [2016]. The last case was reported on [22 May 2015].

At least 5 people have contracted the virus this year [2016] in Saudi Arabia [there have been 17 newly infected individuals reported in Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016 - Mod.MPP], it has been reported, with a 28-year-old health worker becoming the most recent casualty [see below for newly reported case in Saudi Arabia - Mod.MPP].

Last summer [2015], 130-cases of MERS were reported at an outbreak at a large Riyadh medical centre due an influx of emergency patients. At least 51 died during that outbreak, and 63 required intensive care treatment, local media reported.

MERS is a viral respiratory illness and can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include fever, coughing, a sore throat, and, in some cases, diarrhea.

Qatar's last recorded case was in May last year [2015] when a 29-year-old male expat who worked on a camel farm and a 73-year-old Qatari national were diagnosed with the virus.

So far, 6 of the 15 people from Qatar who contracted the virus in recent years have died.

[2] Qatar ex Saudi Arabia, camel contact - Qatari MOPH, RFI

The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has announced that a new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) case has been confirmed for a 66-year-old Qatari national, marking the 1st MERS-CoV case to be confirmed in Qatar in 2016, where the last confirmed case was reported on [22 May 2015].

After his return from a trip to KSA, where he owns a sheep and camel barn, the patient developed acute symptoms of fever, cough, and diarrhea associated with abdominal pain. He was taken by ambulance to Hamad General Hospital (HGM) where laboratory tests detected MERS-CoV. The patient is currently in critical condition and was admitted to the ICU in restricted infection prevention and control measures at HGH.

Once the case has been confirmed, the rapid response team of the Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control department at the MOPH will carry out an extensive search to list all potential contacts with the purpose to verify their consistence with the standard case definition of the suspected cases based on the WHO guidelines. All traced contacts will be monitored over a period of 2 weeks, while those who develop suspected symptoms will then be subject to laboratory investigation.

While research efforts continue on a global and local level to determine the modes of transmission of MERS-CoV infection, the Ministry of Public Health advises citizens and residents who suffer from chronic diseases to avoid direct contact with camels and to wash hands with soap and water thoroughly. The MOPH also recommends implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette in addition to the boiling of camel milk before consumption.

The MOPH announced that Health Protection & CDC Hotlines 66740948 & 66740951 are accessible 24/7 to respond to any notification or enquiry related to infectious diseases.

[According to the ECDC most recent Communicable Disease Threats report dated 20 Feb 2016, as of 18 Feb 2016, there have been a total of 1663 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 663 deaths reported worldwide since April 2012. As of 18 Feb 2016, there had been a total of 13 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Qatar including 5 deaths (see the ECDC report available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report--20-feb-2016.pdf).

Similar to many of the earlier reports of MERS-CoV infections diagnosed in Qatar, this current patient had a history of travel outside of Qatar in the 2 weeks preceding onset of symptoms. In this instance, the individual was reported to visit a farm with camels and sheep he owned in Saudi Arabia. The report does not mention where in Saudi Arabia this individual's farm is located. One obviously wonders whether it is located near where recent cases of MERS-CoV have had camel contact in Saudi Arabia (11 of the 17 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016 have a history of either direct or indirect contact with camels in the 2 weeks preceding onset of their illness). More information on the location of the farm in Saudi Arabia from knowledgeable sources in the region would be greatly appreciated.
