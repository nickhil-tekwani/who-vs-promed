This is a follow up to the 29 Sep 1999, USGS Wildlife Health Alert (WHA
#02) notifying state and federal natural resource agencies of the emergence
of West Nile virus in both free ranging and captive birds in the New York
City area. West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod- borne virus that had
never been reported in the Western Hemisphere. Birds are the natural hosts
for this virus. WNV can be transmitted from birds to other birds and
animals, including humans, through the bite of mosquitoes.

American crows still appear to be the most susceptible species to this
disease. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Fort Collins, Co. have
confirmed that 17 native bird species have tested virus positive for WNV;
Connecticut has added a Cooper's Hawk as an 18th species. The specific
cause of mortality was not determined for all birds. Except for American
crows, most species are represented by few specimens. The species include:

American crow Ring-billed gull Yellow-billed cuckoo
Rock dove Sandhill crane* Blue jay
Bald eagle* Laughing gull* Black-crowned night-heron*
Mallard* American robin Fish crow
Red-tailed hawk Broad-winged hawk Cooper's hawk
Belted kingfisher American kestrel Herring gull
* Captive bird

WNV has been diagnosed in birds from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Geographically the virus has been detected in birds from central New York
(a single crow in Saratoga County), western New Jersey (Hunterdon & Warren
Counties), south-central New Jersey (Burlington County), and east to
Suffolk County on Long Island and the East Haven area of Connecticut.

At this time it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the mortality.
While there have been reports of high bird mortality (1000's) in some of
the affected areas, mostly American crows, a number of the birds have died
from other causes. Of the 255 specimens tested by CDC only about 55% have
tested positive for WNV. The earliest confirmed isolate was from a specimen
collected on 9 Aug 1999 in Nassau County, NY.

The USGS National Wildlife Health Center, along with CDC and state and
federal agencies, are continuing to carry out a national surveillance
effort to document bird mortality. We are particularly interested in
receiving reports of sick or dead birds with neurological symptoms from
states along the Atlantic seaboard. Specimens collected during this
surveillance will be examined by USGS at the National Wildlife
Health Center and tested for the presence of WNV.

Concurrently, USGS, along with several state and federal natural resource
and public health agencies, and other interested groups, are continuing to
conduct field investigations in the area of the outbreak. The investigation
will continue to focus on collecting information and samples that will help
determine the extent of wildlife species involved, the geographic and
temporal distribution of the virus in bird populations, and if the range of
the virus is expanding beyond the currently reported sites.

For further information and to report sick or dead crows or other unusual
bird mortality, please contact USGS Wildlife Disease Specialists Drs. Linda
Glaser (608-270-2446, linda_glaser@ usgs.gov) or Kathryn Converse
(608-270-2445, kathy_converse@usgs.gov).

[Has anyone besides Martin Hugh-Jones noticed that most of the birds on
these lists are predators and scavengers. Many (not all) of them will eat
nestling song birds (or pretty much anything else) if given the chance;
Cooper's hawk feeds on birds. - Mod.CHC
