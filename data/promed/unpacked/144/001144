Cyprus probes mystery flamingo deaths
-------------------------------------
Wildlife authorities in Cyprus are investigating whether a mystery virus or
lead poisoning is to blame for the unexplained deaths of more than 20
flamingos in the past week, an official said on Wed, 12 Feb 2003.
Cyprus hosts thousands of the birds in its salt marshes each year, and the
deaths of about 25 of them in recent days have worried wardens who have
started monitoring the lagoons round the clock. All the deaths have
occurred in the Larnaca salt lake, which is adjacent to the island's main
airport on the southern coast.
Lead poisoning, either from jet fuel fumes or a nearby shooting range, or a
virus outbreak are being investigated as possible causes of the deaths.
"From what we saw it doesn't suggest lead poisoning, but possibly a virus,"
said Pantelis Hadjiyerou, head of the island's Game and Wildlife Service.
"We have not experienced anything like this before." Hadjiyerou told
Reuters that authorities expected to reach a conclusion later this week to
take appropriate action.
Usually, up to 2000 birds, which have a life span of up to 50 years,
cluster in Larnaca salt lake in the winter.

[Migrating storks arriving in Israel were found to be dying of West Nile
virus a few years ago -- see West Nile virus disease, storks - Israel
19981218.2406. Israel is not far from Cyprus. Zoo flamingos have been found
to be more susceptible to WNV than other species. Even if there are no
mosquitoes in Cyprus at this time of year, tests of these birds for WNV
should definitely be done. - Mod.JW]
