Food security in Kenya is under threat from a potato disease that has been reported in 20 [out of a total of 47] counties. The Nakuru County Executive for Agriculture, Dr Stanley Chepkwony, said a potato cyst nematode has been reported. He said the disease has the capacity of wiping out potatoes in the country.

He, however, said the authorities were on high alert and surveillance had been enhanced. It's suspected that some unscrupulous businessmen may have imported seed [tubers], but by-passed the certification process by Kenya Plant Health Inspection Service (KPHIS). He urged farmers to grow only KEPHIS certified potato seeds.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing and wilting of leaves, as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind or on plant material (such as seed potatoes). Disease management may include exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races (pathotypes) and nematicides. Control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds.

The report above does not state which of the 2 species has been detected. In Africa, both PCN species have been reported north of the Sahara, but _G. rostochiensis_ has previously also been reported from South Africa and Kenya, so this may be the species referred to above.
