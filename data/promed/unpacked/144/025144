2001/022 _Ralstonia solanacearum_ introduced in France and eradicated
------------------------------------------------------------
In September 2000, _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was
detected in France. It was identified during a regular survey, on a sample
taken from one field of ware potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_ cv. Estima). The
origin of this outbreak could be related to the introduction of Dutch
potatoes by a producer of seed potatoes in Haute-Normandie in 1998. All
seed potato lots multiplied and sold by this producer were identified.
Growers who had planted these lots were located (in Haute-Normandie,
Seine-Maritime, and Nord Pas de Calais) and tests were carried out to
determine the extent of the disease. Results showed that a limited number
of fields were infested by [the pathogen. [Fields belonging to
approximately 10 growers were [affected, most of [which were located in
Seine-Maritime. Eradication measures were immediately applied: destruction
of infected potatoes, disinfection of harvesting and storage equipment,
prohibition of potato growing (or other root crops) on infested fields for
several years, survey of volunteer potato plants and other potential host
plants. During the next growing-season, general surveillance of this
disease will be intensified, [and there will be phytosanitary checks of
imported material to [prevent further introduction.
As of January 2001, _R. solanacearum_ is considered eradicated by the
French NPPO. The situation of _R. solanacearum_ in France can be described
as follows:
Absent: found only in a few areas and subsequently eradicated.

[_Ralstonia solanacearum_ causes bacterial wilt of potato. The pathogen is
second to the late blight fungus (_Phytophthora infestans_) as the most
limiting phytopathological factor to potato production in the developing
world. There is no effective chemical control for the disease. The
International Potato Center (CIP) recommends an integrated management
scheme that involves crop rotation, sanitation, use of healthy seed pieces,
and use of a sensitive ELISA protocol to detect latent infection in tubers.
CIP has distributed detection kits to seed programs worldwide. - Mod.DH
