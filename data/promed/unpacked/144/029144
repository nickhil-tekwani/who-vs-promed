There has been a recrudescence of cholera in the West Africa region since
September 1998. Some countries in the region have been reporting cases of
cholera since the beginning of the year. As from September, however, there
has been a considerable increase in the number of countries reporting from
the region and in the number of cases. Eleven countries are currently
reporting cases of cholera with, for the time being, a relatively
acceptable case fatality rate. The ministries of health of the countries
affected are taking steps to ensure adequate case management and prevent
further spread. These measures have been quite successful so far. WHO is
concerned about the potential deterioration of the situation in the region
and therefore strongly recommends the strengthening of epidemic
preparedness and response activities for the countries in West Africa.
The region was ravaged by a dramatic cholera epidemic in 1994-95. In 1995,
West Africa represented 64% of all cholera cases and 67% of all cholera
deaths reported in Africa.
Updated information on the number of cholera cases and deaths in the region
can be obtained from the Global Cholera Update at:
<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/cholera/choltbl1998.html>. In addition,
the Global Task Force on Cholera Control can be contacted for further
information regarding possible interventions in the region (at
neiram@who.ch).
