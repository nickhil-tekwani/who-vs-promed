Saudi closes borders with Yemen on Rift Valley fever fears
----------------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has closed its borders with Yemen to prevent the
spread of Rift Valley fever, which has left dozens dead and hundreds ill in
both countries, a Saudi official said on Mon 25 Sep 2000. Yemen's ambassador
to Riyadh said he could not confirm the closure.
The Saudi health ministry said that 27 people in Saudi Arabia have died of
the fever out of a total of 129 who have been stricken with the disease. The
Jizan region was the worst affected with 105 people [affected, the ministry
said. On Sun 24 Sep 200 King Fahd ordered the destruction of all livestock
carrying, or suspected of carrying, the deadly fever. The fever was first
reported on 11 Sep 2000 in the south of the Kingdom near the border with
Yemen, where 30 people have since died of the disease in the Red Sea region
of Hodeida, 225 kilometres (140 miles) west of Sana'a.
The Saudi and Yemeni authorities, meanwhile, are boosting cooperation in
their attempts to eradicate the fever. Twenty Saudi planes sprayed
insecticide in the infected zones on both sides of the Saudi-Yemeni border,
while the 2 countries have met to establish joint technical committees.
International assistance has also been forthcoming: South African experts
arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sun 24 Sep 2000, while Yemen said teams from the
Geneva-based World Health Organisation (WHO) and the US-based Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) arrived Mon 25 Sep 2000 in Sana'a. The WHO and CDC
teams aim to collect samples from the affected regions [and will analyse
them in CDC laboratories in Cairo and South Africa, the Yemeni news agency
SABA said.

Rift Valley Fever Victim Toll in the Yemen Soars
-------------------------------------------------
The number of the Rift Valley fever victims in Hodeidah has shot up
frighteningly during the past week. 95 people have died in the Governorate
of Hodeidah and the Yemeni-Saudi border areas, especially Harradh". Sources
from the Governorate of Hodeidah have said that the number of deaths in the
Moor Valley had approached 60, whereas other places like "Ubad", "Kudmah",
"Zuhair","Mahal Manih", "Budilah", and " Al Marawidh" have become completely
infected. Other neighboring areas are [now becoming involved in the outbreak.
The sources added that hundreds of cattle had [died especially in the
"Zuhra" region, which was extensively affected by the disease. Starting
from today, Mon 25 Sep 2000, it is expected that Saudi airplanes will spray
chemicals to [control spread the disease in the border region. Meanwhile 50
ground teams, accompanied by Dr. Abdu Alwali Nasher, the minister of health,
and Mr. Ahmed Salem Al Jabali, minister of Agriculture, [are operating in
the same area. Attempts to control the spread of the disease are being
hampered by high winds which disperse that thousands of mosquitoes that are
swarming in the region due to humidity and rain.
Official statements until last night [claimed that 24 deaths had occurred,
whereas [local sources said hat there had been more than 95 cases [deaths
?. Until now, a regional belt around the [affected areas has not been
[established. Some of the citizens of the unaffected areas in "Zuhra" and
others have complained that they had no [longer any source of income after
the death of about two thirds of their cattle. The disease had started
spreading in districts near Hodeidah. Al-Zuhrah district has been reported
to be an infected area. The disease had appeared in southern areas of Saudi
Arabia, then moved to Harad, Abss and to Al-Zuhrah.
A Yemeni medical team, headed by the health director in Hodeidah, and
another medical/veterinary team ave been rushed to the area to work [on
disease control. About 40 cars sprayed insecticide in areas where
mosquitoes are found. Official sources say that the disease has claimed the
lives of 23 persons while other local sources indicate that the number is
more than 95. They indicated that most of them had died and were buried
before medical teams arrived in these districts.
The Wadi Moor villages are home to more than 150 000 people, all of whom are
working in pasturing and sheep trading with neighboring countries. New
military check-points have been set up in Al-Zuhrah district and neighboring
villages to prevent the spread of meat or milk to Hodeidah or neighboring
markets. [The arrival of modern spraying equipment from Saudi Arabia is
expected soon.
