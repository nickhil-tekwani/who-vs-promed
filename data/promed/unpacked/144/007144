A disease that has been killing off deer populations in coastal BC [British Columbia] over the past few years could be linked to a recent spike in cougar attacks and encounters on Vancouver Island.

The province first detected adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) in 2020, particularly near the Mid-Island communities of Duncan and Nanaimo, as well as on several Gulf Islands.

The disease causes damage to the lungs and intestines and is generally fatal for deer. However, the illness can also cause chronic ailments, such as ulcers and abscesses in a deer's mouth and throat, according to the province.

Over the past 2 years [2020-2021], the province has tested more than 100 deer for the virus, with the public reporting more than 300 dead deer to the BC Wildlife Health Program.

A veterinarian with BC Wildlife believes that a wide range of deer have been impacted by the disease, leading to a decline in deer populations on Vancouver Island.

With a lower number of prey during the winter, cougars may be turning elsewhere for food.

"Predators will be looking for alternate food sources and may be a bit hungrier than they would be if there was an abundant deer population," said Caeley Thacker, a wildlife veterinarian.

"I think it's not surprising that we may be seeing more predator contact in our communities right now," she said.

There have been 5 reports [https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/dog-injured-in-5th-cougar-attack-near-victoria-in-recent-weeks-1.5849480] of cougar attacks on pets in the Sooke and Metchosin areas over the past several weeks.

Thacker says AHD has not been confirmed in humans or any other animal species.

She recommends that people avoid handling or harvesting sick deer.

The province is asking anyone who spots a dead deer that may have had AHD to report it on the Wildlife Health website, where further information on symptoms can be found.

There is currently no treatment for the disease in deer.

[This adenovirus was first recognized in California in 1994, where it caused fatal hemorrhagic disease in black-tailed deer (_Odocoileus columbianus_). The virus is closely related to bovine adenovirus-3, but the biological properties of the 2 viruses are clearly distinct and CdAdV-1 (or OdAdV-1) does not cause disease in other animals than deer. Mortalities due to CdAdV-1 infection have been documented in black-tailed deer and moose. Wild populations of other cervid species, such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk, are also sporadically infected.

The cascading effect of a disease of a given host on the behavior of its predators makes biological sense and there is plenty of evidentiary support from other cases. Optimal foraging theory predicts that when a vertebrate is short of preferred food items it seeks alternative sources. The carnivore-livestock conflict represents complex management and policy challenges, that need ecosystem-level integrative approaches. - Mod.PMB
