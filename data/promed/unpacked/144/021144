Viet Nam: Youth dies of H5N1
----------------------------
A patient, 23 years of age, resident of Sam Min city of Dien Bien, had
eaten quantities of duck soup for about a week before he fell ill. His
death is the 5th fatality this year [2009] as a consequence of avian
influenza H5N1 virus infection.

According to the Department of Preventive Health and Environment
(Ministry of Health), on 18 Nov 2009 the patient developed sudden high
fever, cough, and shortness of breath. 6 days later his medical
condition worsened and he was transferred on 25 Nov 2009 to the Clinic
in the area of Phu. A day later he was transferred to the provincial
hospital in Dien Bien, was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and he
received antibiotic and antipyretic treatment. The patient's condition
continued to deteriorate and he died on 28 Nov 2009.

On 29 Nov 2009 the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology reported that
the patient had tested positive for H5N1 virus infection.

[Official confirmation of this suspected human case of avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam is awaited. If confirmed this will
be the 5th case in Viet Nam during 2009, and the 57th overall. There
has been no proof in the past in any country that avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection can be contracted by consumption of cooked
poultry or poultry products. It must be presumed that the victim in
this incident had been exposed to live or recently deceased infected
ducks. - Mod.CP]
