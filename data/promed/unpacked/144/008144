[This FMDV-O event in northwestern China (Xinjiang) reportedly started with a single outbreak on 22 Nov 2016; 2 additional outbreaks have been reported within the 6 following months, totaling 3 outbreaks so far, located rather distant from each other, advancing northwards (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21691).

The current, new outbreak in Ili Kazak is adjacent to the border with Kazakhstan's Almaty province (see map at http://tinyurl.com/moy6agg).

The event's summary since its start in Nov 2016 follows:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 3 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 98 / 58 / 0 / 98 / 0
Sheep / 54 / 0 / 0 / 54 / 0
The full archived information of the event is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000023620_20170424_152630.pdf.

Almaty, as well as other southern and eastern provinces of Kazakhstan, does not have an OIE-recognised FMD status, in difference with Kazakhstan's northern and western provinces, which have been recognised by the OIE as included in a "free zone where vaccination is not practiced," (allowing export to other countries/zones of the same status, such as Russia).

For the official FMD zoning of Kazakhstan, as designated by the Delegate of Kazakhstan in a document addressed to OIE's Director General in August 2014, see map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg. - Mod.AS
