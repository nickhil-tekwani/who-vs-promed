Officials with the Albuquerque BioPark announced that 31 lorikeets
have died since last week at the facility. The cause is a form of _E.
coli_ contamination. BioPark officials conducted necropsies on each
bird and sent tissue samples and cultures to disease specialists at
other labs across the country for assistance.

Results from Michigan State University found the _E. coli_, but Rick
Janser, BioPark director, said further testing must be done. It's not
clear if it's a human strain or one specific to birds.

The lorikeet exhibit has been closed to the public for the time being.

The 1st birds fell ill on 4 May 2010. Birds that seem to be ill are
being triaged at the park's veterinary clinic, but treatment with
antibiotics has reportedly not helped.

[It would be appreciated if our avian-expert members in New Mexico or
Michigan could flesh this story out. The occasional bird is to be
expected; 31 are not. - Mod.MHJ]
