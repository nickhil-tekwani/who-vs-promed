TBE recorded in the Vologda Oblast
----------------------------------
A total of 9 cases of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) have been registered in
Vologda Oblast. Yuriy Sapognikov, the head of the Municipal Healthcare
department of Vologda City, reported this to the members of Vologda Duma
[parliament]. There have been no confirmed cases among the residents of
Vologda City, Sapognikov reported. However, a 2 year old girl has died in
one of the rayons [regions] of the oblast. The immune globulin, which this
girl received, was found to be ineffective due to improper transportation.

Compared with last year, this year [2010] tick attacks have increased by 8
per cent. More than 3000 people have already experienced tick bites. In
addition a small increase of Lyme disease [another tick-transmitted
infection] has been noted among unimmunised people compared with last year.

[It should be noted that immune globulin against TBE does not have 100 per
cent efficacy. It should be administered as early as possible to all
non-immune people, to all who have no full immunization and to those who
have had 2 or more ticks on their body. The problem is that up to 40 per
cent of people do not recall tick bites at all. The best and the most
efficient prevention is vaccine administration, which is recommended twice
with a 1-7 month interval and once more after one year. Then a booster is
recommended every 3rd year. An effective immunity develops only after the
3rd shot. - Corr.VM

Vologda oblast is a federal subject of the Russian Federation, part of the
Northwestern Federal District. The administrative center is Vologda City.
