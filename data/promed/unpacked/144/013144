[Re: Unexplained deaths, pigs - India (Kerala) 20050215.0506:]
The outbreak mentioned in the news clip seems to be located in Agra,
which is in Uttar Pradesh, not Kerala.
[You are correct. We were misled by the fact that the source was India News
via New Kerala. We should have realised that "Taj city" means Agra, the city
of the Taj Mahal. This shows we should always check the location rather than
accept the dateline. We will post a correction.

> health hazard.

> In the posh Karamyogi Enclave near Kamla Nagar, dozens of dead pigs

> 20 to 25 pigs are dying daily, reports say.

> "A few dying of exposure to cold is routine and understandable, but
> so many collapsing for no rhyme or reason needs to be investigated
> before something more serious takes a heavy toll," says Amit Agarwal,
> a local Congress leader. "Those engaged in the piggery business are
> naturally perturbed as a single pig costs up to 5000 INR [114.34
> USD] these days," he adds.

> "Had there been no pigs in Agra the whole city would have been
> submerged in human excreta and household garbage," according to
> Netra Pal Singh, a social worker and family counsellor, who last
> year organised the Public Reception To A Pig campaign for
> contribution to keeping the city clean.
>
> The Agra Nagar Nigam has only 4000 workers [doing the work] of 10
> 000. "The pigs are therefore a great help in the recycling of waste,
> " according to Rajiv Saxena, a media person.
