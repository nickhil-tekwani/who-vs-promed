Jamaica. 4 Feb 2019. (published) A major chikungunya epidemic hit Jamaica in 2014 but no chikungunya-associated deaths were reported. We assessed the excess of all-cause deaths during this epidemic. Excess deaths were estimated by difference between observed and expected mortality based on the average age-specific mortality rate of 2012-2013, using the 99% confidence interval. There was an excess of 2499 deaths during the epidemic (91.9/100 000 population), and a strong positive correlation between the monthly incidence of chikungunya and the excess of deaths (Rho = 0.939, p less than 0.005).

Interestingly, excess mortality was reported in Guadeloupe and Martinique during the 2014 chikungunya outbreak. In that report, there were excess deaths in almost all age groups, and excess mortality rate was higher among the elderly but was similar between male and female individuals. The overall mortality estimated in that study (639 deaths) was about 4 times greater than that obtained through death declarations (160 deaths).

Brazil
- Year of appearance. 26 Feb 2019. (published). Sequence analyses of CHIKV from 16 samples revealed that the East-Central-South-African (ESCA) genotype of CHIKV has been circulating in Brazil since, almost a year before it was detected by arbovirus surveillance program as a single event in 2013. Brazilian cases are related to Central African Republic sequences from 1980's. To the best of the authors' knowledge, given the available sequence published here and elsewhere, the ESCA genotype was likely introduced to Rio de Janeiro early in 2014 (02/2014; BCI: 07/2013-08/2014) through a single event, after primary circulation in the Bahia state in north eastern Brazil in the previous year.
