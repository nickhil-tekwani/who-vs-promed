-----------------------------------------------
The FAO/EUFMD (European Commission for the Control of Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD)) together with the State Veterinary Inspection of
Armenia has launched an investigation into the reports of FMD
occurrence in Shirak Region (Marz) in Armenia from 19-22 Jul 2006. No
clinical cases of acute or convalescent FMD were identified in the
animals investigated. The clinical signs reported earlier (e.g.
stomatitis and lameness) were probably caused by dry weather
conditions [see commentary].
The mission to Shirak took place in the villages of Panik and Maliy
Mantash (Artiq district) and in Amasia town (Amasia district). Shirak
Region is located in northwest Armenia and borders Turkey in the west
and Georgia in the north. It has a steppe-like mountainous landscape
and is typical cattle country, with about 15 percent of the national
cattle and 10 percent of the national sheep population. Shirak region
is part of an FMD vaccination buffer zone that is maintained under an
FAO/EC/OIE regional project, and more than 80 percent of the cattle
population is reported to be vaccinated against FMD. However,
susceptible animals have not yet been immunized against a new strain
of FMD serotype A (A 05) that is circulating in neighboring Iran and Turkey.
The State Veterinary Inspection of Armenia had reports of stomatitis
and lameness in cattle in the districts of Artiq and Amasia and a
case of stomatitis in a horse in Amasia. Routine national
investigations had taken place in the previous weeks. The joint
international team clinically investigated cattle, small ruminants
and pigs. Attention was especially focused on the reported cases of
stomatitis in cattle and the horse. All cases of stomatitis dated
back 2 to 4 weeks. No signs typical of FMD were detected in any of
the cattle, sheep or pigs inspected. Blood samples were taken and
will be investigated. Stomatitis and lameness were most probably
caused by very short and dry grass, due to a draught, which affected
the region from mid May to mid July 2006.

[ProMED-mail is most grateful to Dr. Potzsch and the other
investigators for this relieving, firsthand information.
It would be interesting to obtain the results of serology,
particularly re. FMD serotype A, and to note whether other potential
causes of stomatitis and lameness in ruminants (e.g. Bluetongue) have
been ruled out. - Mod.AS]
