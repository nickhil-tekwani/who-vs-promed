[Ref: RI Davis, TK Ruabete: Records of plant pathogenic viruses and
virus-like agents from 22 Pacific island countries and territories: a
review and an update. Australasian Plant Pathology 2010, 39, 265-91;

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Information on the plant virus and virus-like disease status of any
country is a necessary prerequisite for trade, safe movement of
germplasm, and disease management. This is particularly true in the
Pacific islands, where many significant food crops and other plant
commodities are vegetatively propagated.

This paper provides an updated listing of plant virus and viroid
records and the 1st consolidated listing of phytoplasma records in
the 22 Pacific island countries and territories served by the
Secretariat of the Pacific Community. These are American Samoa, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Cook Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, the Fiji Islands, French Polynesia,
Guam, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea
(PNG), the Pitcairn Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna.

[Pathogens detected in at least one of the countries:]

_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV), _Banana mild mosaic virus_
(BanMMV), _Banana streak GF virus_ (BSGFV), _Banana streak Mys virus_
(BSMysV), _Banana streak OL virus_ (BSOLV), _Bean common mosaic
virus_ (BCMV), _Cassava common mosaic virus_ (CsCMV), _Cassava green

_Maize mosaic virus_ (MMV), _Nerine latent virus_ (NeLV),
_Odontoglossum ringspot virus_ (ORSV), _Papaya leaf distortion mosaic
virus_ (PLDMV), _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV-W, cucurbit infecting
strain), PRSV-P (papaya infecting strain), _Passionfruit woodiness
virus_ (PWV), _Peanut mottle virus_ (PeMoV), _Potato virus Y_ (PVY),
_Squash mosaic virus_ (SqMV), _Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_ (SCYLV),
Sweet potato caulimo-like virus (SPCaLV), Sweet potato chlorotic
fleck virus (SPCFV), _Sweet potato feathery mottle virus_ (SPFMV),
Sweet potato ringspot virus (SPRSV), _Sweet potato virus G_ (SPVG),
_Taro bacilliform virus_ (TaBV), Taro reovirus (TaRV), Taro vein
chlorosis virus (TaVCV), _Tobacco mosaic virus_ (TMV), _Tomato mosaic
virus_ (ToMV), _Tomato ringspot virus_ (ToRSV), _Turnip mosaic virus_
(TuMV), _Vanilla mosaic virus_ (VanMV), _Watermelon mosaic virus_
(WMV), WMV-VNS, WMV (vanilla necrosis strain), _Wisteria vein mosaic
virus_ (WVMV), _Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_ (ZYMV).
Viroids
-------
_Coconut tinangaja viroid_ (CiTVd), _Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd),
_Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd), Oil palm orange spotting viroid (OOSVd).
Bacteria
--------
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma (unidentified species), strains of _Ca._ P.
asteris (16SrI group), strains of _Ca._ P. aurantifolia (16SrII),
strains of _Ca._ P. australiense (SrXII), strains of _Ca._ P. solani
(SrXII), _Ca._ Liberibacter asiaticus [huanglongbing, HLB, citrus greening].

Comments on specific pathogens:
[1] Banana streak disease is particularly common in bananas in the
Mysore subgroup, especially in plants that have been distributed as
tissue cultures.
[2] _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is of extreme quarantine concern
in the Pacific.
[3] No evidence exists for presence of HLB (citrus greening) outside
of PNG. This is generally considered the worst disease of citrus in
South-East Asia and recently reached the island of New Guinea.

[Surveys of this kind are enormously difficult to conduct due to the
remoteness of some of the locations, limited resources available, and
extreme problems of logistics for collection, preservation, and
analysis of samples. The results reported above are valuable
information for managing agriculture and increasing food security in
a region which includes many developing countries, as well as for
addressing international biosecurity issues.

These data also make an important contribution towards the knowledge
of individual pathogens, such as 1st reports (for example, citrus
greening in Papua-New Guinea), new host records, and new information
on epidemiology and distribution of the pathogens. For more
information on specific pathogens see previous ProMED-mail posts in
