Genetic analysis showed that the Bovine TB organism from the infected cow is not the same as any strains detected in Canadian domestic animals or wildlife to date.

Abstract
--------
Spoligotyping was applied to 44 isolates of _Mycobacterium bovis_ obtained from the Canadian province of Manitoba. Isolates were obtained from submissions of elk (n = 16), deer (n = 1), and cattle (n = 27) tissues spanning the period of 1990 to early 2003. A total of 2 spoligotype profiles were obtained differing only in the reaction with oligonucleotide number 12. As many as 40 of the 44 isolates (90.9 percent) hybridized with oligonucleotide 12 (MB-1 type), while the remaining 4 of 44 (9.1 percent) did not show a signal at position 12 (MB-2 type). Octal codes for these 2 types are 656573377603600 and 656473377603600, respectively. These spoligotypes have not been reported as occurring elsewhere worldwide.

[Back in 2005, this article generated excitement among some Canadian wildlife disease experts regarding the "uniqueness" of the Manitoba elk/deer/cattle isolates. However, at that time relatively few Canadian _M. bovis_ isolates had been spoligotyped and they were relatively recent (i.e., late in the course of the successful bovine TB eradication campaign). In other words, there may have been many more spoligotypes out there that we will never know about simply because the Canadians wiped out the disease and lost isolates before spoligotyping was invented.

I suspect that other developed countries have similar holes in their databases. In developing countries "new" _M. bovis_ spoligotypes are regularly discovered because local microbiologists have only recently started to use this technology. Also once you start testing you find that multiple spoligotypes can be present in one herd and in one animal. Consequently, the technology must be interpreted carefully. There is still a place for "shoe leather epidemiology". With luck, the Canadians will eventually discover where this singular spoligotype strain came from.

And thanks to the strict protocols insisted upon these days for biosecurity many organisms get destroyed, instead of being saved, maybe freeze-dried, documented, and archived. And as we learn more and get away from the genomic finger-print identification and better understand what the DNA means, we can make more sense and science out of what we have found. - Mod.MHJ
