Hundreds of British holidaymakers have been struck down by a virus at a Turkish seaside hotel. A baby and several adults required hospital treatment after the bug hit guests at the Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side [Antalya province]. Tour operator Thomas Cook said yesterday [21 Aug 2013] it was suspending bookings at the all-inclusive hotel for the next week and providing other accommodation for those due to stay there. The company has also flown out hygiene experts from the UK to investigate the cause of the outbreak, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea.

More than 100 British guests met hotel representatives on Tuesday [20 Aug 2013] to demand action over the virus, believed to have started several weeks ago. The hotel has closed the main swimming pool and advised people to stay in their rooms. Guests have posted warnings on holiday review website TripAdvisor, and a Facebook page for those affected has been set up.

Travel lawyer Nick Harris said: "They have told of widespread illness among hundreds of guests." Tour operator Thomas Cook said last night [21 Aug 2013]: "We can confirm that a number of customers at the Sentido Perissia, Turkey, have reported a stomach upset lasting 24-48 hours. "Preliminary indications suggest that this is of a viral nature. We immediately arranged for an independent UK hygiene consultant to carry out a comprehensive review of the hotel."

[This outbreak of gastroenteritis has characteristics of norovirus infection -- sudden onset and rapid resolution. This outbreak, however, seems to have affected a large number of hotel residents over a period of days. There is no indication of the source of the outbreak, and the recommendation that guests should remain in their rooms is hardly realistic. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for norovirus infection.

Side is a city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, a resort town and one of the best-known classical sites in the country. It is located on the eastern part of the Pamphylian coast, which lies about 20 km (12 miles) east of the mouth of the Eurymedon River. Today, as in antiquity, the ancient city is situated on a small north-south peninsula about 1 km (0.6 mile) long and 400 m (0.2 mile) across. - Mod.CP
