"People should also stay away from areas where mosquitoes concentrate and limit outside activities between dusk and dawn."

Multiple [mosquito] samples in Oswego County had tested positive so far in 2015 for EEE. The county also conducted aerial spraying for EEE.

The 1st human case in 2015 in Oswego County of the mosquito-borne virus Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE} was confirmed Friday afternoon [18 Sep 2015] by health officials.

The Oswego County Health Department said an adult living in the town of Albion has been hospitalized with EEE. That person is listed in critical condition. The health department said it would not be releasing additional information about the person who was hospitalized.

EEE was not detected in mosquito traps in the Albion area, the health department said.

County and state health officials are continuing to investigate how the Albion resident was infected. They are also continuing to monitor for EEE.

An elderly Salina man died earlier in September 2015 after contracting EEE. It was the 6th reported Eastern equine encephalitis death in Central New York since 1971.

The Salina man was the 1st person in the state and the 2nd in the nation diagnosed in 2015 with EEE, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

EEE [virus], which is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, is a rare but potentially deadly viral infection. It can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. Initial symptoms usually start between 5 and 15 days after the bite and can include fever, headache, and vomiting. People who spend more time outdoors are at a greater risk as are the young and elderly.

Mosquito populations are already decreasing, but health officials warned that the public should continue to take precautions to guard against contracting EEE.

"People in all areas of Oswego County must continue to take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites until we have a hard frost." said Oswego County Director of Patient Services Judy Lester.

"People should also stay away from areas where mosquitoes concentrate and limit outside activities between dusk and dawn."

Multiple [mosquito] samples in Oswego County had tested positive so far in 2015 for EEE. The county also conducted aerial spraying for EEE.

[As noted with the earlier EEE human case in New York State (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150902.3617180), EEE virus is endemic along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and as far west as the Upper Midwestern states of the USA. Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other mosquito species may act as bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamps into adjoining localities and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in those who survive the infection (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis). Although human infections are rare, it is prudent to follow the recommendations given above to avoid mosquito bites until killing frosts eliminate mosquito vectors and halt transmission.
