[1] Cholera - Nigeria

In the last couple of days, some states in Nigeria have come under the spell of cholera epidemic. And aside those still anguishing in hospitals from the attack, the death toll also gives cause for concern. Weekly Trust investigations show that Plateau, Sokoto, Zamfara and Lagos States have been hit by cholera epidemic.

Zamfara recorded 1117 cases with official confirmation of 72 deaths in 2 weeks. Unofficial sources said the casualty figure is higher as the official statistics did not reflect those that died either at home or before reaching the hospitals. According to the Medical teams managing the cholera outbreak in the state, Gusau recorded the highest number of cholera cases, followed by Zurmi, Maradun and Bakura local government areas. At the Shagari Primary Health Care Center, 90 fresh cases were recorded in a day, an official said.

In Namu, a small village in Quan'Pan Local Government Area of Plateau State, with just one Primary Healthcare Clinic (PHC) and no decent source of drinking water, had to suddenly cater for an additional 6490 displaced people from Nasarawa State. Weekly Trust gathered that over 6000 internally displaced persons from the violence in Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State have relocated to Namu for refuge and are presently housed in a camp. Reports say the cholera outbreak started in the camp of the displaced persons, who eat, sleep and use the same latrines with the indigenes of Namu. It was observed in the Anguwan Yashi community, which hosts most of the displaced persons that over 50 people squeeze themselves in small compounds. Also, in some houses, about 20 people squat, sharing sleeping space every night in tiny rooms. Also, only wells serve as sources of drinking water, usually open and unhygienic. Based on the set up, cholera epidemic struck the displaced and indigenes, the young and the old, men and women in the community.

Plateau State government admits the outbreak of cholera in the state, and claimed that only 9 people have been killed. But the community claims 30 people have so far died from the cholera outbreak. None could however dispute that over 100 people have been infected and treated from the outbreak.

Health workers claimed that cholera was reported in the Namu village on 5 Oct 2013, but knowledge of the epidemic became public after the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) team from Nasarawa and Plateau States visited Namu last week. The District Head of the village, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq claimed that mortality numbers have been downplayed, adding that most of those killed by the scourge were women nursing their children. Sadiq said "both indigenes of the village and the displaced have been affected because we now live together. And I can count over 10 of the indigenes who have died from this disease, including my brother's wife, my neighbor and her daughter."

Despite claims by the community and officials in Plateau, the Nasarawa State government is denying that its population which is displaced in the neighbouring Plateau State is hit by cholera outbreak. Dr. Abdullahi Idris, Executive Secretary of Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA), told Weekly Trust that the state Ministry of Health sent a consignment of medicals to Namu to treat the displaced persons there, but insisted that they are merely suffering from vomiting and diarrhea. He said the result of a detailed laboratory test is still being expected to confirm the disease, and added that the state government is not taking chances, and has taken far reaching steps to control vomiting and diarrhea, while also stepping up prevention of possible cholera outbreak.

Similarly, cholera outbreak hit Tambuwal and Kebbe Local Government Areas in Sokoto State. Scores of people were killed and the community blamed poor source of water for the outbreak. The state government official statement on the matter pegged the death toll at 13 by last Thursday, 24 Oct 2013, and put the total number of victims in the 2 local government areas at 152. In Barkeji alone, a village located along Sokoto-Jega road in Tambuwal Local Government Area where the disease was said to have 1st surfaced, 31 cases were recorded between 10 and 21 Oct 2013; 5 persons were confirmed dead, 21 discharged and 2 were still on admission and positively responding to treatment. In Kebbe Local Government Area, which is less than 20 kilometers from Tambuwal, the disease resurfaced in Bakin Dutse, Tuna, 'Yar-Romo, Nabasa, Fakku and Bashi, all in riverine area. At least, out of 121 cases, 8 deaths were recorded.

In the Lagos State cholera outbreak, which has hit 5 local government areas and has so far claimed the lives of at least 3 persons, a few others were reportedly discharged after treatment. Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, who made the disclosure in Alausa, Ikeja, pleaded with residents to report any case of cholera to the nearest health facility as well as maintain high level of hygiene. Idris said "although many of the cases had been treated and discharged in several health facilities, 3 had been confirmed dead. Most of the suspected cases were from Ajeromi, Apapa, Lagos Island, Oshodi_Isolo and Surulere Local Government Areas."

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Lagos)
Date: Sat 26 Oct 2013

Shock, pandemonium, and fear gripped Lagosians as another 5 persons from the Ago area of Lagos reportedly died of cholera recently. Before then, 3 persons were confirmed dead out of the 13 cases reported to the Ministry of Health.

A 25-year-old newspaper vendor in Ago Palace Way, Okota, Lagos state, was found dead on the staircase of a residential building in the area recently. It was also discovered that another young man who tried helping the deceased in his helpless state to the hospital died few hours after [the 1st case's] death. Comments from neighbours suggested that he stooled and vomited profusely the previous day. A resident in a wing of the complex located by Marcity bus-stop, Ago, Lagos, told the Vanguard how the vendor, who made the corridor of the complex his home, had shown no sign of illness until the day before his death eating an African salad popularly known as abacha. He disclosed that the deceased was stooling and vomiting consistently for one day when he was taken to the hospital.

A fashion designer who seldom sleeps in the complex exhibited the same symptoms but had some money to pay for treatment. He approached Treasure Gold Hospital in the area where he promptly received treatment. According him, he had taken about 59 different bottles of intravenous fluids within 72 hours.

That same day, Vanguard gathered a woman and her son who were said to have eaten abacha were both hospitalised after showing similar symptoms. The 15-year-old boy died after a few hours while the mother as at press time, is still receiving treatment in another hospital. When Vanguard visited Treasure Gold Hospital, the doctor in charge, Dr. Tosan Hamsa, disclosed that the hospital had 8 cases of cholera in the past few weeks.

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, had in a statement a few days ago said: "The suspected cases that were recorded have been contracted from food sources such as the African salad popularly called abacha, well-water sources, especially in areas like Ikare community, Amuwo-Odofin local government area and Badia area of Apapa local government area, as well as other infected foods from food sellers and other unhygienic habits."
