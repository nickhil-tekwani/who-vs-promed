Cholera Kills 10 in Southeast Nigeria
-------------------------------------------------------
A Cholera outbreak has claimed lives of 10 people in Abbare village of Lau
district in Taraba State, southeast Nigeria, announced Philip Duwe, health
commissioner of Taraba State in Jalingo, state capital of Taraba.
The district government sought the state government's intervention as a
result of the huge financial requirement to tackle the problem, Duwe said,
adding that a local official had noted "that the disease is spreading and
might claim more lives."
The commissioner said as soon as the matter was reported to the government,
the state government released 1.7 million naira (about $14 500 US) to the
district government. The money, he said, was used to procure drugs,
antiseptics, and other consumables needed to stem the spread of the
epidemic as well as to pay allowances to health officials and other logistics.
The health official noted that the intervention was effective and no case
of death had again been reported, while patients admitted in the hospitals
had been recovered and gone home.

Hospital Trying to Contain Cholera
-----------------------------------
Officials at the District Hospital at Cape Coast are making efforts to
contain an outbreak of cholera following 30 reported new cases in the midst
of the acute water shortage facing the area.
Dr. Yaw Ofori Yeboah, the Municipal Director of Health Services, said
though the hospital has been recording cholera cases over the years, the
situation has now become alarming in view of the water crisis.
Dr. Yeboah said 12 cases were recorded at the Hospital on 5 and 6 May 2002
while 18 cases were recorded between January and March, but there were no
deaths so far.
He said most of the new the cases were from Komenda, with a few from within
Cape Coast, and that the regional health directorate had supplied enough
intravenous infusion to the unit to help contain the outbreak.
Dr. Yeboah called on the public to boil drinking water, since people use
water from all types of sources, and further advised food vendors to sell
under hygienic conditions to prevent contamination.
The water crisis, which hit Cape Coast and its surrounding towns, worsened
a month later when the Kakum river that flows into the Brimsu dam dried up,
resulting in a halt in the production and distribution of water by the
Ghana Water Company Limited.
Last year, a total of 832 cholera cases with 7 deaths were recorded at the
hospital with 392 of the cases coming from Komenda.

182 confirmed cholera cases in Delhi
------------------------------------
The number of cholera cases in New Delhi has been rising steadily. As of
now there are 182 confirmed cases. Last year in the corresponding period
only about 70 cases had been reported.
The incidence of gastroenteritis, however, seems to be on the decline.The
toll up to 8 May 2002 is 14 810. Last year the figure around this time of
the year was much higher.
An MCD health officer said, We are not particularly alarmed by the number
of cholera cases. Of course, when we compare with last year's figures it
looks as though an epidemic has broken out. In May 2001, a large number of
cases were reported. We do not expect so many cases this year so hopefully
the figures of the 2 years would even out by the end of the month."
On Tuesday, the city health ministry directed the civic agencies to obtain
more samples of drinking water from unauthorized colonies, slum clusters,
resettlement colonies and also chlorinate all tube wells.
The health minister expressed concern over the increasing cases of cholera
and directed the staff of the MCD and Delhi Jal Board to obtain at least
600 samples between them. He said the civic agencies should make sure no
cut fruits were sold in the city.
He said last week 15 water trolleys, 25 sugarcane crushers, 405 carts, 3357
kg of unhygienic food and 5746 kg of dirty ice had been seized.
