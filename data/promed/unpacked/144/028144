Livestock producers and pet owners need to be on the lookout for
signs of blue-green algae in lakes and ponds, state officials said.
Becky Brewer, state veterinarian with the Oklahoma Department of
Agriculture, Food, and Forestry, said her office has received word of
livestock deaths caused by toxins produced by blue-green algae from
across the state.
"It seems to be a very widespread problem right now and it is
extremely important that everyone who has a pond or lake on their
property be vigilant in watching for signs of a blue-green algae
over-growth," she said. "Animals can die extremely quickly if they
ingest the toxin released after an algae bloom."
Other signs can include bloody diarrhea and muscle tremors. Brewer
said animals that do not immediately die from the toxin could also
suffer liver damage.
"The important thing is to keep an eye on the color of the water,"
she said. "If you notice a sudden bluish or greenish color to the
water you need to get your animals away from it immediately and have
the water tested."
While the water is being tested, be sure to move animals away from
the area or block access to the pond and offer alternative water
sources. "When in doubt, lock them out," Brewer said. "That's the
best advice we can offer."
She also advises against allowing pets in or near waters suspected of
blue-green algae contamination.
Owners are advised to contact their local veterinarians, county
extension offices, or the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Center
in Stillwater for advice or to have their water tested. Ponds that
test positive for the organism can be treated with an algaecide or
copper sulphate. Untreated ponds will recover naturally.
Blue-green algae are actually not real algae but rather cyanobacteria.
Brewer said many different kinds of the organism can be found in
Oklahoma but all can produce the toxin after an algae bloom. In
heavily affected waters even small amounts of water can cause
symptoms or death. All terrestrial animals are susceptible.
Recent rains and temperatures are believed to have contributed to the
sudden increase in blue-green algae problems.

Toxic algae can produce a number of different toxins, some capable of
killing animals within a very short time. Toxic blooms should be
taken seriously and public health warnings heeded.
Cyanobacteria is the scientific name for blue-green algae, or "pond
scum." The 1st recognized species were blue-green in color, which is
how the algae got their name. Species identified since range in color
from olive-green to red.
Cyanobacteria form in shallow, warm, slow-moving, or still water.
They are made up of cells, which can house poisons called
cyanobacterial toxins. A mass of cyanobacteria in a body of water is
called a bloom. When this mass rises to the surface of the water, it
is known as surface scum or a surface water bloom.
Cyanobacterial toxins are the naturally produced poisons stored in
the cells of certain species of cyanobacteria. These toxins fall into
various categories. Some are known to attack the liver (hepatotoxins)
or the nervous system (neurotoxins); others simply irritate the skin.
These toxins are usually released into water when the cells rupture or die.
One group of toxins produced and released by cyanobacteria are called
microcystins because they were isolated from a cyanobacterium called
_Microcystis aeruginosa_. Microcystins are the most common of the
cyanobacterial toxins found in water, as well as being the ones most
often responsible for poisoning animals and humans who come into
contact with toxic blooms. Microcystins are extremely stable in water
because of their chemical structure, which means they can survive in
both warm and cold water and can tolerate radical changes in water
chemistry, including pH. So far, scientists have found about 50
different kinds of microcystins. One of them, microcystin-LR, appears
to be one of the microcystins most commonly found in water supplies
around the world.
