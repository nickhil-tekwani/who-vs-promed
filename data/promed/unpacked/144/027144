The Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service (VMVT) confirmed on Thursday [13 Jul 2017] the largest numbers of cases of African swine fever (ASF) to ever hit the country, following years of the Baltic country's efforts to tackle the spread of the virus.

The positive ASF results were found in a test at a pig farm in Central Lithuania with 23 464 pigs, said VMVT.

This is "the biggest ASF case in Lithuania so far," said VMVT in an announcement.

All the pigs kept by the farm will have to be slaughtered, according to local news agency Elta.

VMVT also took immediate measures to prevent the spread of ASF in areas surrounding the farm.

Vidmantas Paulauskas, the deputy head of VMVT, told Lithuanian national radio LRT that he suspected [that] a "human error" was behind the ASF case at the farm.

The farm is to incur losses of about 4-5 million euros [USD 4.55 to 5.69 million], Algis Baravykas, the head of the Lithuanian pig producers' association, told LRT.

It's the 2nd big ASF case in Lithuania in [3] years. In 2014, around 20 000 pigs were slaughtered due to the outbreak of ASF in Danish owned farms in Eastern Lithuania.

The disease was brought to Lithuania in late 2013 by infected boars from Belarus. Since then, the country saw a rapid spread of ASF. Seven out of 60 Lithuanian municipalities have been in a state of emergency over the disease for more than 2 years. At the end of last year [2016], the Lithuanian government revoked the state of emergency, claiming the virus had been tackled. The virus causes no threat to people but is lethal in pigs and boars [wild].

The Food and Veterinary Board has diagnosed African swine fever (ASF) in pigs on a farm with 3200 animals in the territory of the Orissaare rural municipality in Saaremaa [Saare].

The farm has been quarantined, and the pigs will have to be killed, after which the buildings will be disinfected, spokespeople for the Food and Veterinary Board said on Tuesday [11 Jul 2017].

As BNS reported, pigs started dying on Monday [10 Jul 2017]. Scientists from the Estonian Academy of Life Sciences examined the facility to find out how the infection found its way to the farm.

AS Vireen, a company specializing in biological waste disposal, will start killing the pigs on the farm and dispose of the carcasses in accordance with legal requirements on Wednesday [12 Jul 2017].

There is one more pig farm within a radius of 10 km [6.2 miles] of the affected farm that belongs to the same owner. That farm is under increased scrutiny by officials, and checks will be carried out there shortly, BNS reported.

The affected farm was last examined by officials on [7 Jun 2017], and no shortcomings were detected then.

Harles Kaup, head of the department for animal health at the Veterinary and Food Board, said that reports of wild boar carcasses infected with ASF kept coming in every week. "The disease is still widespread in wild boar and now shows signs of abating," the official said, stressing the importance of preventing domestic pigs from contact with other domestic animals, wild boar, or potentially contaminated materials.

On Monday [10 Jul 2017], several cases of ASF were detected in domestic pigs in Lithuania and Poland. The disease has been diagnosed on 29 farms in Poland and 8 farms in Lithuania. In Latvia, 2 cases of ASF in domestic pigs have been diagnosed this year [2017].

Between the beginning of the year and the end of June 2017, 6519 wild boar in Estonia were tested for ASF. In the case of 556 of them, the test outcome was positive. The respective numbers for Saaremaa were 1974 and 203, making for a ratio of 10.3 percent, compared with a ratio of 7.8 percent for Estonia overall.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate any additional information on the new cases noted on Monday [10 Jul 2017] in the second article on the Estonia outbreak mentioned above in [2] (the additional cases mentioned were in Lithuania and Poland). Presumably, the Lithuania event mentioned in the second article is the same as the outbreak information contained in the first article [1] above on Lithuania, but that event wasn't reported until Thursday [13 Jul 2017], and the Estonia article notes the outbreaks in domestic swine were reported on Monday [10 Jul 2017] in both Lithuania and Poland.

The ongoing ASF outbreaks in Europe and PEDV outbreaks in North America have shown the inadequacy of, and/or complacency with, many swine producers' biosecurity programs. The ASF situation in Europe also shows the difficulty of maintaining negative commercial herds when surrounded by the virtual sea of ASF-positive wild boar that continues to move the virus westward. - Mod.JH
