[1] Spread in Haskovo

A total of 280 animals in 8 settlements in the region of Haskovo have been affected by lumpy skin disease, according to Dr Georgi Stankov, director of the Haskovo District Directorate of Food Safety Agency.

"These animals must be euthanized, and farmers will receive compensation for them," Dr Stankov said. "Mosquitoes, flies, and mites infect domesticated animals directly. The disease is transmitted quickly among animals, but it is not dangerous to humans. The 1st outbreak was discovered in the village of Voden. So far, 9 centres in 7 towns in Dimitrovgrad municipality and a village in the municipality of Haskovo have been established," Dr Stankov said.

[According to the follow-up report No. 1 submitted by the Bulgarian authorities to the OIE on Tue 19 Apr 2016, 4 of the 6 new outbreaks are in the Haskovo province, while the other 2 are in 2 different provinces, namely the (already affected) Stara Zagora province and the hitherto unaffected Plovdiv province. An interactive map showing all 9 LSD outbreaks in Bulgaria since the start of the event is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20063. - Mod.AS]

[2] Vaccination contemplated

"It is necessary to carry out timely and rapid vaccination of all susceptible animals to the viral disease called nodular dermatitis (lumpy skin disease). First, it must be done so in the area where outbreaks have been found," according to the chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Bulgarian Veterinary Union, Dr Trifon Tsvetkov, in an interview with FOCUS News Agency.

According to him, in view of the emerging distribution of the disease, the current measures are no longer sufficient. Dr Tsvetkov said that at first, vaccination would be carried out throughout South Bulgaria. "The funds will be provided by the state," he said.

[The apparent decision (or advice?) to apply lumpy skin disease vaccination in Bulgaria is not surprising. As anticipated (see 20160419.4167379), a stamping out policy has meagre chances of success in a country invaded by the lumpy skin disease virus from adjacent borders of endemic countries (in this case, both Greece and Turkey could have been the source of infection).

According to OIE's WAHID archive, the summary of the Bulgarian event, as of 19 Apr 2016, is as follows:

Total outbreaks = 9 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 366 / 12 / 0 / 366 / 0

Of the 9 recorded outbreaks, 6 were reported from Haskovo, 2 from Stara Zagora and one from Plovdiv province. According to an update in the same Bulgarian News Agency "Focus" dated 20 Apr 2016, the lumpy skin disease spread continues: "537 animals from 13 farms have been affected by the disease. The affected districts are Haskovo, Stara Zagora and Plovdiv." See at http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2016/04/20/404213/bulgaria-officially-allocates-bgn-15-to-fight-lumpy-skin-disease.html.

In case vaccination is applied in Bulgaria, this might be the same vaccine applied in Greece, namely a freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) vaccine. A similar vaccine has recently been applied in Israel (see ProMED-mail post 20150926.3672096). As reported in another posting (20150929.3676992), CODA-CERVA (Belgium) in partnership with the Pirbright laboratory (UK) were coordinating a project on the comparison of lumpy skin disease vaccines. The project was planned to address 6 different vaccines, including live attenuated lumpy skin disease vaccines, live attenuated sheep pox or goat pox vaccines, and newly developed inactivated vaccines. It would be helpful to be informed of the advance attained in the mentioned comparative project, a live attenuated vaccine. - Mod.AS
