There is no major health threat by the presence of multi-drug
resistant bacteria in Delhi's environment, the Union Health Ministry
said on Mon 11 Apr 2011.

A UK based prestigious medical journal has accused the Indian
government of "suppressing the truth" about the presence of the
superbug. "We have rejected it and we still reject it," Director
General Health Service RK Srivastava said, reports IANS. However, he
said that a final statement can be made only after the research wing
of the Health Ministry (Indian Council of Medical Research) completes
its study.

"The research wing will examine everything, the protocol and the
method of research, all will be examined and only after that, a final
statement can be given by the concerned authorities," he said.

Days after Health Ministry rejected the study on the presence of the
superbug in Delhi's environment, published in British journal The
Lancet, study co-author Mark Toleman accused the government of India
of "suppressing the truth."

The study, published last week, said the New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene, which makes bacteria resistant to
an array of antibiotics, including the most powerful ones, has been
found in open water pools, water from overflowing sewage and even a
couple of drinking water samples in the Indian capital.

The health ministry, however, said such bacteria existed all over the
world and the study was targeting India.

Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit also reiterated Monday that water
in the city was safe for drinking and there was nothing to panic
about.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bharti for this report. Indeed, panic should not
be the response to the report. While it is the truth that NDM-1 gene
containing bacteria have been found around the world, most of the
cases have been traced back to the Indian subcontinent where, in New
Delhi, the gene cassette was 1st identified. Furthermore, the danger
represented by such antimicrobial-resistant bacteria needs to be
stratified. That is, an extremely resistant _E. coli_ in the
intestines of a healthy individual is not an immediate danger to the
host. Indeed, it can be part of the microflora of the gut which serves
a positive role in health. How well the NDM-1-containing
enterobacteriacae compete in the gut is not clear and may not be able
to survive well against their drug-sensitive 'cousins.'

Those points must be taken in perspective should the
polydrug-resistant organism escape the nurturing environment of the
gut and cause a urinary tract infection by traversing the urethra or
enter the sterile peritoneum via a ruptured appendix or diverticulum.
In such circumstances, appropriate antimicrobial intervention is
extremely limited and can certainly lead to increased morbidity and
mortality.

As discussed in the ProMED posting NDM-1 carrying Enterobacteriaceae
- India: (New Delhi) water supply 20110411.1145, the widespread misuse
of antimicrobial agents, plays a large role in the selection on such
isolates. The recognition and some of the creative causes of the
misuse in China are discussed below. An inadequate sanitary system,
allowing human waste to contaminate water supplies, further serves to
spread the resistant strains. - Mod.LL]

The Ministry of Health is set to further curb the overuse of
antibiotics, mainly at large hospitals, to fight rising drug
resistance.

By 2011's end, the rates of antibiotics use among inpatients and
outpatients on the mainland are expected to be lowered from 70 percent
and 50 percent to around 50 percent and 20 percent, which are in line
with international standards, the ministry told a regular news
conference on Mon 11 Apr 2011.

"The long-time overuse is related to factors including bad morality
of some medical workers and the current system whereby hospitals rely
on drug sales for revenue," said Zhao Minggang, deputy director of the
department of medical administration under the ministry. Experts
estimate that only 20 percent of the total antibiotics administered on
the mainland are necessary. Others are prescribed mainly for financial
benefit.

Apart from the economic burden caused for patients, "the misuse of
antibiotics. primarily the overuse, creates antibiotic-resistant
germs, which might cost human lives," warned Professor Xiao Yonghong
from the First Hospital of Zhejiang province.

According to Xiao, about 30 to 50 percent of the infections acquired
in hospitals on the mainland are caused by bacteria that are highly
resistant to antibiotics. And the rate is on the rise, he said.

In October 2010, China confirmed its 1st 3 cases of the NDM-1
superbug in 2 infants in northwestern Ningxia Hui autonomous region,
and an elderly resident of the eastern Fujian province. Originally
found in India in 2008, the new bacterium carrying the NDM-1 gene,
which is resistant to almost all antibiotics and could only be treated
with a combination of antibiotic drugs, was briefly spreading
globally.
