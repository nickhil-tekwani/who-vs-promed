New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: River Bidj, Cerje, Zupanja, Vukovarsko- Srijemska
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Oct 2016

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Approximately 10 swans died on the river Bidj but only 2 of them were available for laboratory testing. Organ samples were taken and submitted on 31 Oct [2016] to the Poultry centre of the Croatian Veterinary Institute. Avian influenza - subtype H5N8 was isolated. Nucleotide sequencing at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the isolate revealed the multiple basic amino acid sequence "RERRRKR/GLF", which is consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Croatian Veterinary Institute- Poultry Centre (National laboratory) / mute swan / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 9 Nov 2016 / Positive
