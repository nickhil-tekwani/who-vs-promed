The recovery of the bodies of a female elephant and a calf within 3 days in Joypur rainforest in Dibrugarh district has spread an anthrax scare in the forest area.

On 3 Dec 2020, inside the Joypur rainforest of Naharkatia, the body of an elephant calf was recovered. The veterinarians from Tinsukia Guijan and Naharkatia suspected the cause of death of the elephant calf to be infection of anthrax. The fear of anthrax thickened on 5 Dec 2020 after the recovery of the carcass of a female elephant inside the rainforest.

To prevent the outbreak of anthrax, the forest officials cremated the elephant calf instead of burying it. After just 2 days of the incident, the dead female elephant was recovered under a mysterious condition, which has increased the risk of anthrax outbreak.

[To find Assam in India, go to http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg. It is in northeast India and lies between Bangladesh, Myanmar, and China. For Dibrugarh district, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibrugarh.

Frankly, anthrax is rare in juvenile animals of whatever species, other than _Homo sapiens_, who get exposed when helping a relative slaughter and butcher a sick infected animal. But for livestock and wildlife, the usual juvenile problem is starvation when their mother dies of the disease. The diagnosis has been rapid -- the carcasses were found on the 3rd and 5th of December 2020, and this report is dated 6 Dec 2020 -- so maybe more has yet to be revealed. The mysterious condition of the mother elephant may reflect that she had decomposed and had been dead for a week or more. While we give the veterinary service the benefit of the doubt, we hope there will be further information on this incident. - Mod.MHJ
