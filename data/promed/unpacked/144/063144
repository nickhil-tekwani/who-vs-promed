Elephant deaths: Forest Department confirms anthrax
--------------------------------------------------
The Forest Department has confirmed reports about the outbreak of Anthrax
disease in the Nagarahole National Park, causing the death of 3 wild
elephants recently.
Dr. R. Raju, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Hunsur Wildlife Division,
informed in a press release that 2 elephants in D. B. Kuppe forest range
and one in Metikuppe forest range were killed due to anthrax during January
and February 2004. The 1st elephant death was noticed on 16 Jan 2004 at D.
B. Kuppe, followed by the death of another female elephant on 9 Feb 2004 in
the same range. The visceral mass were sent for clinical analysis at the
Institute of Veterinary Biological Research, Bangalore. The cause of the
death was confirmed when the 3rd elephant's death occurred on 25 Feb 2004,
the press release said.
"Once the outbreak of the disease was suspected, the Nagarahole National
Park management authorities took precautionary measures against the further
spread of the disease", said Dr. Raju and added that the Deputy Conservator
of Forests visited the death sites and personally monitored the burning of
the elephant carcasses.
"All the 40 elephants in captivity of the Forest Department at various
camps, including the Dasara jumboo savari team lead by Balaram, were
vaccinated against the disease," he said and stated that village cattle
vaccination programme was launched, completing the process in the villages
bordering the National Park from Kutta to Badaga in Kodagu.
Cattle vaccination in the villages bordering H.D. Kote, Hunsur and
Periyapatna, that was started recently, will be completed in a couple of
weeks' time, he said.
Dr. Raju informed that the issue was taken up with the Deputy Commissioner
of Mysore district, following which, the Veterinary Department, in
association with the Forest Department, have jointly launched the Mass
Vaccination programme for cattle of more than 100 villages of the district,
under which around 30 000 cattle heads would be vaccinated.

[It doesn't take an expert in ESP to read between the lines of this report
to realise that these elephants must have acquired their infections in
parallel with another series of cases. Elephants usually become infected as
a result of cases in wildlife or, from the government response in this
instance, from cases in local village cattle. The size of the response --
30 000 head in 100 villages -- would indicate that the underlying problem
has been active for some time. It seems to be the constant pattern of
anthrax control in India to be reactive and not proactive, which of course
assures that the problem persists. A very expensive way of controlling this
disease. If any member in Mysore would care to shed light on the events
taking place, it would be most welcome. - Mod.MHJ]
