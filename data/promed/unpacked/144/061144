Rural anthrax situation in Argentina, 2014
----------------------------------
Summary
We are very proud to announce that the main livestock provinces in Argentina are Buenos Aires (Resolution N 115/14) and Santa Fe (Resolution N 1007/14). The Department of Agriculture deemed this measure as fundamental to the mandatory vaccination of all bovines with Sterne strain in order to safeguard the health of livestock and the public health of people living in rural areas. We analyze, as we always do, the evolution of the different sectors involved:

1 - Assessment Area: 455 isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ were carried out during the period 1977-2014. There was an 11 percent distribution of sudden death in bovines with 5 outbreaks in the districts of: Mar Chiquita, Madariaga, Dolores, and Tapalque.

2 - Alert Zone and Response in the District of Azul: there were no cases of bovine or human anthrax, consequently, no alerts. Likewise, there has been a simultaneous foot and mouth disease and anthrax vaccination covering up to 90 percent of the cattle since 2014: 1 700 000 bovines were vaccinated with this pioneering model.

3 - Isolations performed in other Vet Diagnosis Laboratories: The presence of _B. anthracis_ was confirmed in 15 outbreaks in the Districts of: Puan, Villarino, Rauch, Ayacucho, Tandil, and Madariaga. This involved the following laboratories: Laboratorio Bahia Blsanca, Bs. As.; Ministerio Asuntos Agrarias Pcia, Rauch, Bs. As.; INTA-Balcarce, Bs.As.; Instituto Biologico, Tandil, Bs. As.; and Laboratorio Santa Rosa, Pcia La Pampa.

4 - Districts of the Province of Buenos Aires involved in Anthrax outbreaks: There were 9 cases during 2014 in Mar Chiquita, Madariaga, Dolores, Tapalque, Rauch, Ayacucho, Tandil, Puan, and Villarino.

5 - Production of Anti Anthrax vaccine for veterinary use. The governmental body SENASA approved the production of 24 358 480 doses of Sterne strain manufactured in 11 manufacturing plants, greater than the production of last year [2013] by more than 7 million doses.

6 - Cases of Domestic Human Anthrax: There were 5 cutaneous cases in humans, 2 in the Province of Buenos Aires, and 3 in the Province of Santa Fe, one of the latter provoked the death of the patient.

7 - Other facts related to Rural Anthrax: Many Provincial and Municipal public documents were published (6 technical and research publications, and 3 Provincial Resolution documents) in order to encourage vaccination and/or the elimination of the affected carcasses.

Conclusion: During this period, competent authorities recognized and implemented preventive measures to control rural anthrax since it is a real problem of public health and an indication of economic loss for national livestock. The accomplishment shall be visible if: 1) Systematic vaccination is made mandatory; 2) The disposal of carcasses is properly done; 3) The assessment of epidemiological indicators is able to oversee the effective control of anthrax. In this way, we shall control and eventually eradicate rural anthrax in Argentina if we can reverse so many years of absent oversight and maintain the epidemiologic achievements.

[Our thanks to Ramon for sharing this document with us.

Making vaccination compulsory and achieving 100 percent participation are 2 separate states, as we all know. But the incidence is decreasing, and with success will come better rancher confidence and involvement. They will succeed and probably within the next 10 years.
