For the past 2 years, a camel named Badaliya has been participating
in a village camel fair, organised about 60 km from Bikaner in
Rajasthan. But this January 2011, she did not. She was suffering from
pneumonia, having fever and continuous nasal discharge of phlegm.
Badaliya is not alone. The contagious disease has affected camels
across Rajasthan.

Veterinarians of the state say they have never witnessed such an
extensive spread of pneumonia among camels. "It is a strange
situation. The camel is generally a robust animal. It does not fall
prey to diseases easily," commented R K Tanwar, director, clinics,
Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (RAJUVAS),
Bikaner. "Earlier, there used to be sporadic cases. But this time, the
disease has affected 30-50 per cent of camels in the state, and new
cases are being reported every week," he said. There are 430 000
camels in Rajasthan, which is 60 per cent of India's total camel
population, as per the 2007 census.

The disease was 1st reported in November last year [2010], when about
12 camels died in the state's Pali district, and sporadic deaths
occurred across Rajasthan. Veterinarians collected samples of nasal
discharge of the affected camels. The culture examination showed
presence of the bacterium _Pasteurella haemolytica_, said Tanwar. The
bacteria are present in a dormant stage in the lungs and pharynx of
camels, but under environmental stress, like [high] humidity, they
become active and cause pneumonia.

Veterinarians attribute the outbreak to the drastic change in weather
conditions. Rajasthan generally has a dry, hot and cold climate, but
good rainfall last year [2010] significantly increased humidity. "This
facilitated multiplication of the bacteria," said A P Singh, assistant
professor at RAJUVAS.

In 2010, Rajasthan received 28 per cent more than the average
rainfall in the past 50 years, according to the state's meteorological
department. Although camels can adapt to extreme hot and cold
conditions, "they could not adapt to this sudden change, especially
when the temperature dipped to -2 C in January this year [2011]," said
F C Tuteja, scientist at the National Research Centre on Camel (NRCC)
in Bikaner.

Another reason for the spread of pneumonia could be that herders gave
their own medicine, made of milk, millet, jaggery and ajwain (carom
seeds) instead of contacting veterinarians, claimed Tuteja. "They were
not interested in spending money on antibiotics," he pointed out.

Others suspect that the last year's [2010] Pushkar camel fair near
Ajmer could be the source of the disease. Extreme cold followed a long
spell of heavy rainfall during the fair, said Hanwant Singh, director
of Lokhit Pashu Palak Sansthan, a non-profit in Sadri, Rajasthan.
"Many pneumonia cases were seen at the fair," he added.

RAJUVAS and NRCC have started administering antibiotics to the
affected camels. "We are trying to treat as many affected camels as
possible," said N V Patil, director of NRCC. "However, it is difficult
to tend to every camel, as we depend on veterinarians to report the
cases," he added. Tanwar said it is vital to start the treatment of
the disease as soon as it is identified. In later stages, the nasal
discharge becomes purulent, causing difficulty in breathing. Camels
gradually become lethargic, just like Badaliya. "She was an active
camel. But now she cannot carry any kind of load," said her owner
Bhanwar Lal. "It has been 2 months, and she has not recovered," he
added.

In January 2011, new pneumonia cases were reported in Rajasthan's
Jhunjhunu and Churu districts close to Haryana. About 6 camels died of
pneumonia in December 2010 in Kachchh district of Gujarat.

[The health problem described above in (dromedary) camels in the
Indian Rajasthan desert is reminiscent of similar recent observations
from neighbouring Pakistani territories (Cholistan and Thar deserts).
However, in Pakistan, the disease seems to be more pathogenic, with
significant mortality reported. As indicated in the postings on
Pakistan cited below, hemorrhagic septicaemia was suspected, but PPR
deserved to be excluded as well. The same comment is valid in relation
to the Rajasthan event.

The Rajasthan Desert of India and the Thar Desert of Pakistan are
parts of a monsoon desert region.

More clinical and epidemiological information, and particularly
results of laboratory investigations, are requested. - Mod.AS
