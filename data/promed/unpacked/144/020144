A total of 21 doctors and nurses in east China's Anhui province have been hospitalized after being diagnosed with viral pneumonia, local health authorities said on Friday [14 Jun 2013]. The medical staff have been quarantined for treatment and none of their infections are critical, according to a statement from the municipal health bureau of the city of Suzhou. All of those infected work in the department of respiratory care at the General Hospital of the Wanbei Coal-Electricity Group.

One nurse began to show symptoms of fever, headache and coughing on the night of 5 Jun 2013, with the rest exhibiting symptoms soon afterwards, the bureau said. A total of 21 of the department's employees had been diagnosed and hospitalized as of Tuesday [11 Jun 2013], the bureau said, adding that no new cases have been reported since then. The bureau said tests for viral pneumonia have not yet been completed, although 2 respiratory experts from another hospital diagnosed them with viral pneumonia.

The Suzhou Disease Prevention and Control Center has taken samples from some the patients. Feng Lizhong, a publicity official from the provincial health department, said the case represents an ordinary pneumonic infection and is not a public health issue.
