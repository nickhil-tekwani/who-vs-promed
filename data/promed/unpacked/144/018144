I am a cat owner and lover, but the key concern in the situation described
in this posting is not whether the involved cat should be immunized against
rabies (which I agree it should) but whether the cat owner and the
policeman who handled the bat should be immunized. Exposure to a bat,
particularly a known (how was this determined?) rabid bat, is an indication
for rabies vaccine, even without any evidence of known bites from the bat.
This is certainly true in the US, because of cases of human rabies due to
bat-associated rabies virus strains when there was no definite history of
bites, but just a (sometimes questionable) history of exposure to bats. I
would be surprised if the local health authorities in the Netherlands did
not recommend rabies immunization for these contacts.
