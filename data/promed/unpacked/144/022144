Just a short note about the case of canine rabies in Charlotte. At this
time the date of transmission of rabies to the puppy is not known. Both the
original breeder and the final owner report never seeing evidence of
exposure of this animal to any wild animal or bat.
Both of them report a relatively constant oversight of the
litter/individual. Some of the important facts and dates in this case are:
* litter born 22 Dec 2000
* breeder reports the litter stayed inside his home until approx. 20 Jan 2001
* from 20 Jan until approx. 2 Feb the litter stayed in his garage in a
fenced in area with the female dog and the rest of the litter
* adopted on approx. 2 Feb to an owner from the Mecklenburg County area
* visits 2 birthday parties and a preschool during the ensuing several weeks
* in retrospect the animal's behavior started to change on 21 Feb
* 22 Feb the animal was fearful, aggressive & snapping at the air
* 23 Feb taken to DVM
* 24 Feb hind limb paresis
* 25 Feb animal euthanized
* 28 Feb animal tested positive by DFA at the State Laboratory of Public
Health
* virus = raccoon strain
* approx. 56 people in the preschool have requested post exposure prophylaxis
* approx. 25 people from the birthday parties have requested post exposure
prophylaxis
* additional requests for treatment are expected
North Carolina law requires all dogs and cats 4 months of age and over to
be currently vaccinated against rabies. Because most animal rabies vaccines
are licensed for use at 3 months of age it is certainly permissible for the
animal be vaccinated at that time. As a matter of epidemiology it is best
to take raw animal rabies numbers with a grain of salt. There are many
factors that come into play in determining the number of animals testing
rabid from a county: land area, population density, media play, local and
state submission guidelines, etc.
Certainly the numbers are useful in viewing the larger picture but they
probably should not be used to say with any precision that County X has a
worse problem than County Y because the former had "5" more cases of rabies
than the latter during any time period.
This case does point out the importance of vaccination of pets against
rabies. The Veterinary Public Health Program points out the vaccination of
pets is done to protect the public against the disease. It also points out
the need for policies regarding allowing animals in (pre)schools. While
rabies is the disease that receives the most press, there are other
diseases that are more likely to negatively impact human health.

[Thanks to Dr. Hunter for an update. It would be nice to find out the
source of exposure. - Mod.TG
