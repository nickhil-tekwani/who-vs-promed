Dropsy epidemic feared in MP, 150 ill
--------------------------
More than 150 people have fallen ill in the Shivpuri district of Madhya
Pradesh in the last 3 days due to the sudden outbreak of a mysterious
disease with dropsy-like symptoms.
Dropsy had spread in New Delhi a few years ago due to consumption of
contaminated mustard oil.
District hospital superintendent SC Goyal said patients with swelling body
parts started pouring in the district hospital from Thursday, giving health
authorities sleepless nights.
Soon doctors in the district hospital contacted their counterparts in
Gwalior, where they also referred some of the patients with serious
condition. A 4-member team of specialists from Gwalior district has been
pressed into service to find out more about the disease.
Some of the affected persons were even unable to walk. All those affected
have been suffering from excessive swelling of hands, legs, face and
stomach after eating food cooked in mustard oil, Goel said, adding that the
disease would however be confirmed only after tests were complete.
Meanwhile, the District Magistrate Kanta Rao has ordered that mustard oil
samples be collected from shops in the district. As many as 10 teams have
been constituted for the purpose by the food department. 3 oil mills in the
area have already been sealed, while oil samples from other places were
being collected.

[According to Dorland's Medical dictionary, epidemic dropsy, is a sometimes
fatal condition seen in India, Fiji, South Africa, and elsewhere,
characterized by edema of the extremities; dilatation of vessels of the
skin, subcutaneous tissues, and uveal tract, resulting in glaucoma; cardiac
insufficiency; and liver abnormalities. It is caused by contamination of
cooking oil by argemone oil (q.v.), which contains the toxic glycoside
sanguinarine.

There was an outbreak of epidemic dropsy associated with assumed
adulterated cooking oil in India in 1998 covered by ProMED-mail (see
references below). At that time there was a posting that suggested that
argemone was ruled out but a definitive contaminant was not identified at
that time. There was an additional case (imported) in Nepal associated
with the same event.
Information on this current outbreak and or information on the resolution
of the prior outbreak in 1998 would be appreciated. - Mods.MPP/TG]
