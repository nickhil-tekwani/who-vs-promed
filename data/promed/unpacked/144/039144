EHV in New York: state health official confirms disease diagnosed at racetrack
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Late Tuesday afternoon [23 Nov 2010], officials in New York State confirmed
by phone that a stable at Finger Lakes Racetrack in the western part of the
state has been placed under quarantine after a horse that had been stabled
there was diagnosed with equine herpesvirus [EHV].

Dr David Smith, director of the Division of Animal Industry of the New York
State Department of Agriculture and Markets said that the racetrack is
being very proactive about the situation, which also involves a farm where
the horse had been stabled.

On the phone this afternoon [24 Nov 2010], he said that efforts were under
way to identify and locate horses that had been stabled with the affected
horse, and that certain states had been notified if affected horses had
been shipped there.

Racing continues at Finger Lakes
--------------------------------
EHV is not a disease that limits itself to racetracks. Sport, work, and
pleasure horses are also vulnerable to EHV. Vaccinations are available,
although the disease has several strains, and veterinarians will advise
horse owners on a horse's risk factors for the disease based largely on
exposure to other horses. Outbreaks of EHV in Northern Virginia and
Wellington, Florida in the winter of 2007 virtually shut down all horse
activities in those areas.

[Equine herpes virus was recently found in New Jersey. It is an easy
transfer across the border to NY. Readers are encouraged to read the
