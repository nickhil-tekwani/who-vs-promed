Malaria imported to China from Angola
-------------------------------------
Between May 2008 and Jan 10, 2009, 14 cases of malaria were identified
among people who returned from Angola. Following effective prevention
measures, malaria did not spread.

According to the Municipal Health Bureau, between May 2008 and 10 Jan 2009,
Wuwei City workers returned from Angola reported a total of 14 cases of
malaria, 12 of which are falciparum malaria, [and 2 have not been typed].
12 cases were reported from Gulang County, 1 case from Liangzhou District,
and 1 case from Tianzhu County. Four cases were admitted to Wuwei City
People's Hospital for inpatient treatment. One of the patients died and 3
remain in hospital. The other 10 cases were referred to other hospitals or
outpatient treatment centers.

[The Peoples Republic of China reported 40 681 malaria cases with 52 deaths
in 2003, the latest year for which data are available. 3291 imported cases
were reported in the same year but the species and country of infections
are not reported (<http://rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/china.pdf>).

It would be interesting to know if the patients had used prophylaxis, and
the number of cases in the 2003 report who had come from Africa. - Mod.EP]
