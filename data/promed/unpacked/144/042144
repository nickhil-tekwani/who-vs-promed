Mystery disease strikes cattle
------------------------------
More than 150-odd cattle have succumbed to a mysterious disease at
Dimirikuda and under Deogarh district. The deaths have created a
panic among farmers, as 200 more cattle are suffering from the same
symptoms.
"At 1st a swelling appears on the animal's neck. That is followed by
profuse flow of saliva. It takes 24 hours for an affected animal to
die," said Basanta Kumar Dhal, a resident of Dimirikuda. For now
chief district veterinary officer (CDVO) and other senior officers of
the department have visited the place.
"We have advised farmers to bury the dead animals in deep pits. But,
most are not heeding our order and that could possibly escalate the
situation," stressed the Deogarh CDVO, S.K. Dash. As precaution,
vaccination is going on in full swing.
Since Deogarh is solely depended on agriculture for sustenance
district collector Ambika Prasad Mishra has asked veterinary
department to handle the matter as top priority.
"If required assistance from Orissa University of Agriculture and
Technology would also be taken," Mishra assured.

[Deogarh District, also known as Debagarh District, is a district of
Orissa state, India, and is located in the northern part of the
state; see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Deogarh.html>.
Last year (2006), almost on the very same date, a similar event was
described in bovines in Orissa (Kendrapara district); see
20060602.1537. It was followed by ProMED-mail's request for
additional details, which unfortunately remained unanswered.
"Neck swelling", or -- as described last year -- "swollen throats"
may be indicative of (sub-mandibular) oedema. The causes of such a
clinico-pathological change in bovines are within the virological,
bacteriological, parasitological and metabolic/toxicological arenas.
Obviously more clinical and pathological information is required,
including elementary data such as body temperature. The similar
timing of last year's and the current event might be indicative of a
seasonal pattern, which could be infectious (e.g., arboviral),
parasitological (e.g., tickborne) or toxicological (e.g., poisonous
plants) in nature.
Additional details, as mentioned, are urgently required; including
(in case available) last year's diagnosis or findings, and any
available laboratory results.- Mod.AS].
