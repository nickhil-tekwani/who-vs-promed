More than 100 displaced people who live in camps in Al-Aynaa, Kafr Owayd Al-Mahabah, and Al-Mukhtar camps near Kalli town in northern Idlib countryside have fallen ill over being served spoiled meals at a "breaking fast" table by relief organizations. According to Syrian Observatory sources, the majority affected are children and women, who have been taken to hospitals.

Yesterday [Sat 24 Apr 2022] SOHR activists reported that over 40 civilians mostly children and women have suffered food poisoning, due to consuming Iftar fasting meals in camps north of Idlib, where they were transported to the hospitals to receive proper medication.

In "Al-Molk Lelah" camp in Atma northern Idlib, at least 12 civilians, 7 children, and 3 women were transported to the hospital, while 30 civilians from Dar Al-Kiram camp in Kally mountain in Idlib countryside were transported to the hospital, most of them being children.

It is worth noting that during Ramadan, Iftar fasting meals were distributed to civilians as a gesture by organizations and institutions operating in northwestern Syria, to support displaced civilians who suffer harsh living conditions.

[It is likely that the diagnostic tools necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in the displaced persons camps are not available. Some assessment of possibilities can be made by knowing what foods were involved, the symptoms developed, and the incubation period between the meal and the onset of illnesses.

Idlib Governorate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib_Governorate) is one of the 14 governorates of Syria. It is situated in northwestern Syria, bordering Turkey's Hatay province to the north, Aleppo Governorate to the east, Hama Governorate to the south, and Latakia Governorate to the west. - Mod.LL]
