Outbreak of illness in schools in Angola
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of an unknown illness has been reported among children and
students in schools in Angola. In most cases, the illness has occurred
suddenly, followed by the resolution of symptoms within a few hours.
No deaths have been reported. The typical symptoms reported include:
vomiting, headache, sore throat, eye irritation, coughing, breathing
difficulties, and fainting in some cases. The outbreaks have been
reported in schools of the capital, Luanda, and in a number of other
provinces.

Although the cause of these outbreaks still remains unknown, this may
be related to exposure to irritant chemicals. WHO has sent a team to
Angola to assist the Government in investigating these outbreaks and
to suggest measures for preventing further occurrences. The WHO team
includes an epidemiologist, laboratory specialists, and a
pharmacologist/toxicologist who are providing technical support to the
national intersectoral committee created for this purpose. This is
complex work and WHO is consulting with experts and specialized
institutions from other countries to explore ideas on appropriate
lines of investigation.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Indeed, the symptom complex described is compatible with a chemical
irritant. It is difficult to explain the apparent widespread nature of
the outbreak involving schools in multiple provinces. A time curve of
where and when each school was affected would be instructive to see if
a pattern can be found. Hopefully, WHO can contribute to finding the
etiology of these outbreaks. - Mod.LL]
