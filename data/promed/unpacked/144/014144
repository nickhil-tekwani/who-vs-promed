Warning over virulent strain of blight
--------------------------------------
Farmers have learned how to deal with potato blight in the 160 years
since Ireland's great famine, and the advent of modern agro-chemicals
has done much to cut crop losses. However, the disease, which is
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, has mutated over the
years and the current strain is especially virulent.

Rob Clayton of the Potato Council, the organisation funded by
growers, said: "We're now dealing with a different type of blight. We
are expecting an early start to the season and control measures may
have to remain tight. Growers should be deciding their control
strategy around how this type behaves in the field. This year [2008],
more than ever, best practice really does mean best practice."

Blight is the number-one potato disease, and while Scottish crops
tend to be less susceptible because of a generally cooler and less
humid climate than in England, losses can still be considerable.
Growers throughout the UK are estimated to spend at least GBP 20
million (about USD 39.6 million) each year on blight control.

Clayton recommends constant vigilance of all potato crops from
emergence early next month [May 2008] and advises growers to discuss
spraying programmes with an agronomist. Growers might be well advised
to vary the mix of chemicals throughout the season. The Potato
Council runs a combined "Fight Against Blight" and "Blightwatch"
service to provide early warnings of disease outbreaks. Clayton said:
"It is vital that growers make good use of these services. This is
now an integral part of Britain's defence in the battle against
blight, and the 350 'blight scouts' play a crucial role in supplying
samples and identifying actual outbreaks."

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_, which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as
tomato or eggplant. The fungus affects leaves as well as tubers and
can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is spread by plant material
(including seed tubers), wind and water, and solanaceous weeds can
serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria often invade
blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber breakdown. Disease
management includes preventative fungicide treatment of seed tubers
and additional fungicide applications to the crop. Some PLB resistant
potato varieties are available.

Worldwide, considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. A severe form of PLB
was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s, but
PLB is still the most devastating disease threatening potato crops
worldwide today. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation
of the United Nations (FAO), at present around 20 percent of the
worldwide potato crop is destroyed by PLB each year. The pathogen is
considered an increasing problem in many areas because new and even
more virulent strains continue to emerge. Some of these can destroy a
potato plant in a matter of hours and a complete crop within days.

When both of the mating types, A1 and A2, are present, reproduction
occurs sexually as well as asexually, leading to strains with higher
fungicide resistance and increased yield losses. A1 was the first to
spread worldwide. A2 began to spread later, and in Western Europe a
dramatic increase in the frequency of A2 is being recorded recently.
The report above refers to the threat posed by new more aggressive
blight strains that are currently emerging in the UK (see ProMED-mail
post no. 20071207.3939).
