Ebola Hits Uganda again
-----------------------
Two days ago, a young girl lost her life after the doctors in Gombe
suspected that she had Ebola. It was later discovered that the girl
had died from poisonous substance she had consumed. Actually, she was
admitted with 5 others who had taken the substance with her. The
doctors neglected all of them which led to the death of one. The fear
of Ebola has now engulfed the country.

[While Ebola is a frightening disease, it is even more alarming that
good medicine and differential diagnosis have been overlooked.

The article is NOT specific about what they ate. It may have been a
plant (likely) or it may have been a toad or a lizard. Either way,
good diagnostic medicine and a life were lost because of fear. â€“
