Health officials in Pará state in northern Brazil are concerned about the number of Chagas disease cases seen this year [2016] as 2 fatalities were reported recently in the city of Barcarena, according to G1 report (computer translated). Between January and September 2016, 127 cases of the disease were registered in Pará.

The State Department of Public Health attributes much of the Chagas to the consumption of açaí palm contaminated by the vector of the parasite, the kissing bug. "We routinely have training for açaí [beaters; machines that remove the thin layer of fruit from the pit], routine sanitary surveillance inspections on [beaters], regardless of whether it is in the harvest period or not."

"We have even worked on the issue of banning points of sale that are not using the proper technique of preparing this food", explains Eugenia Teles, secretary of health of Barcarena. Barcarena is the 7th municipality in the state with more cases of Chagas disease in 2016. The municipalities with the most cases were Breves (45 cases), Igarapé-Miri (14 cases), Abaetetuba cases (12 cases), and Belém (9 cases).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (_T. cruzi_). It is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 Latin American countries. About 7 million to 8 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the parasite.

_T. cruzi_ parasites are mainly transmitted by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine bugs, or kissing bugs. In addition, the parasite can be transmitted via food contaminated with _T. cruzi_ through for example the contact with triatomine bug feces; blood transfusions using blood from infected donors; passage from an infected mother to her newborn during pregnancy or childbirth; organ transplants using organs from infected donors; and laboratory accidents.

[The açaí palm is a species of palm tree in the genus _Euterpe_ cultivated for its fruit and hearts of palm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aça%C3%AD_palm).

Oral transmission of Chagas disease has been reported repeatedly over the past decade. The largest outbreak was reported from Caracas, Venezuela, with nearly 150 cases due to contaminated guava juice. - Mod.EP
