During October, there was one case of canine rabies in a dog (Willacy
County) in South Texas. Five people were exposed to the rabid dog;
all received postexposure treatment. One horse, three dogs, and four
cats were also exposed to the rabid dog. The horse was not currently
vaccinated and received postexposure treatment; the three dogs and
four cats were euthanatized. To date, no cases of canine rabies have
been reported north of the Oral Rabies Vaccination Program (ORVP)
drop-zone for coyotes. In West-Central Texas, there was one case of
gray fox rabies in a coyote from Callahan County. To date, no cases
