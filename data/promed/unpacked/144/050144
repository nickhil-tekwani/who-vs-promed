A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis (JE) on
18 May 2011. She is currently under treatment in the Medical Mission
Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany. Virological investigations of serum and
CSF samples were performed at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for
Tropical Medicine, WHO Collaborating Center for Arboviruses, Hamburg,
Germany.

Together with her husband, the woman spent 2 weeks in Bali, Indonesia
(15-30 Apr 2011). She visited many tourist sites and went upcountry
but did not stay in particularly low budget accommodations. She was
not vaccinated for JE.

The patient developed an unspecific febrile illness on 2 May [2011],
which lasted 3 days. After a short recovery, fever came back on 9 May
[2011] together with speech disorders, lethargy and ataxia, and,
therefore, a JE virus infection was suspected. The patient is
currently recovering; severe sequelae are not expected, but it is
still too early to evaluate the definitive outcome. Her husband
remains healthy up to today.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st recorded case of a
laboratory-confirmed JE virus infection in a German tourist returning
from Bali, which is a favourite site for short term and last minute
travel. German health authorities were given all available information
about the case, enabling them to update JE vaccination strategies for
German travelers.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Schmidt-Chanasit for this firsthand information.

Reports from places where these kinds of cases occur are particularly
valuable. Infrequent cases of JE virus infections in tourists visiting
JE virus endemic areas in Asia illustrate the dilemma of whether
routine vaccination is justified or not. Certainly, travel advisories
for tourists providing information on avoiding mosquito bites is
important.

Reports of JE virus infections in Indonesia have been relatively
scarce. In the 13 Jun 1997 ProMED post (archive no. 19970613.1243)
Prof. John Mackenzie reported: "There is good evidence that Japanese
encephalitis virus is enzootic in Java and Bali, and probably Lombok.
A single isolation of virus has been reported from Flores Island." A
published report of JE virus infections in people on Bali by Liu et
al. (see reference below) stated: "Japanese encephalitis (JE) has been
found to be endemic in Bali, Indonesia. A case-control study was
conducted to identify factors associated with JE infection. All 94
serologically confirmed JE cases (cases) and 163 cases of encephalitis
or aseptic meningitis without JE (controls) identified in Bali during
2001-2004 were included in the study."
