AVIAN INFLUENZA, POULTRY VS MIGRATORY BIRDS (23)

Flying backpackers, communications satellites and a network of
computers would monitor the movements of wild birds on their annual
migrations under a plan proposed by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).
The 6.8-million-dollar plan could also provide the world with crucial
advance warning of the occurrence of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) virus, which causes bird flu.
Deploying teams of national and international veterinary and wild
bird experts on the ground, it would fill a huge gap in scientific
knowledge about where, when and how wild birds associated with HPAI
-- principally aquatic and shore birds -- migrate. "All we have now
is a snapshot. We need to see the whole film," says Joseph Domenech,
Chief veterinary Officer of FAO.
The plan involves capturing thousands of wild birds before they
migrate, testing sample birds for disease, and fitting some of them
out with tiny backpacks weighing less than 50 grams each. After the
birds are released, the sophisticated telemetry equipment inside the
packs would track their every movement. A system of radio beacons and
satellites would then feed data into the computers of ornithologists,
ecologists, virologists and epidemiologists round the world.
The project is in line with recommendations made at a 2-day
international scientific conference on avian influenza and wild birds
which ended yesterday. The conference, attended by some 300
scientists from over 100 countries, was organized by FAO and the
Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).
The conference concluded that wild birds do play a role in
transporting HPAI over long distances but that human activities such
as poultry production and trade are principally responsible for
spreading the disease. It noted, however, that there was a basic need
for better understanding of wild bird migration and the associated
risks of virus introduction. And it also called for temetry and
satellite technology to be used in such studies.
Under FAO's plan, the backpacks would show the migrating birds' exact
whereabouts when they stop over for rest and recreation on their long
journeys. Mobile, ground-based teams would then re-test the sample
birds for disease and, in the case of a positive return, have a good
idea of where the infection originated and where it might head next.
Early warning would give governments and producers more time to
respond to potential threats -- with great benefits for the poultry
industry and society at large.
FAO together with the World Health Organization and the World
Organisation for Animal Health has initiated a global early warning
and response system (GLEWS) which monitors livestock and emerging
transboundary diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest,
swine fever, ebola, and Rift valley fever. "But so far wildlife and
wild birds have fallen into the cracks," Domenech said. The proposed
new system, in which several Organizations -- such as the Wildlife
Conservation Society, Wetlands International, CIRAD, the French
Agricultural Research Centre for International Development and others
could participate -- would feed into the GLEWS system.
A small part of the money to fund the project is already on hand, but
FAO would need the help of donors and governments to get it up and
flying.

[A colleague who had better be nameless tells me:
"I'm just back from the FAO/OIE Conference on Avian Flu and Wild
birds in Rome. Very interesting but tiring. Many maps were screened
showing projected wild bird migration routes under various climatic
conditions. Someone asked "where was the map of commercial poultry
product global movements" but was told that this was not the subject
of the conference!
Heads seem to be still firmly in the sand regarding the risks posed
by commercial poultry. The birders did their best to defend the birds
(which obviously do play a big part in viral spread, this is
accepted), and Billy Karesh showed a good map of global wildlife
trade which is not quite the same thing. Some countries' prime
ministers have advocated cutting the tops off trees so that wild
birds cannot roost. They seemed to think that mallard ducks roost in
trees!"
My own suspicion is that we may be entering the closing phase of
serious interest and equivalent funding on this virus unless
something happens to maintain the hyper-sensitivity. If I am right,
valid projects, like the above, will die from financial malnutrition
and inattention -- until we are faced with the next international
threat du jour. - Mod.MHJ]
