Researchers in Denmark have identified a new cause of respiratory
disease in horses. They found the bacterium _Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia_ in samples collected from horses with chronic lower
airway disease.

_Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_, a gram-negative bacterium, has been
found increasingly in human medicine, especially in patients with
impaired immune systems. Until recently the organism has been
recorded only rarely in animals.

The researchers said: "This pathogen has not previously been
associated with lower airway disease in the horse."

In a paper to be published in the Veterinary Journal, Lotte Winther,
a PhD student in the Department of Large Animal Sciences at the
University of Copenhagen, and colleagues will present data from 7
horses with respiratory disease associated with _S. maltophilia_ infection.

The horses were treated at 3 equine referral hospitals in Denmark in 2007.

The report documents the clinical findings, laboratory diagnosis, and
response to treatment.

All cases had a history of chronic coughing. Endoscopic examination
revealed copious mucopurulent exudate in the lower trachea. Culture
of the tracheal exudate produced grey, slow-growing colonies, which
were identified as _S. maltophilia_ by both culture and DNA testing.

All isolates had a similar antibiotic susceptibility pattern. They
were resistant to many antibiotics used to treat respiratory
infections in horses, including all penicillins, cephalosporins,
aminoglycosides, and rifampicin.

"The results from susceptibility testing and clinical response to
treatment suggest prolonged administration of tetracyclines (greater
than 10 to 14 days) is an effective treatment, especially for adult
horses," the researchers said.

The findings suggest that _S. maltophilia_ can act as a respiratory
pathogen. The researchers advise that the organism be included in the
differential diagnosis of horses with respiratory disease associated
with copious mucopurulent exudate.

They stress that many antibiotics commonly used to treat equine
respiratory infections are not effective against _S. maltophilia_.

[_Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ is ubiquitous in aqueous
environments, soil, and plants. It has been documented in humans as
an important agent of nosocomial infection, in particular affecting
cancer patients. This bacterium was initially classified as
_Pseudomonas maltophilia_; it was also grouped in the genus
_Xanthomonas_ before eventually becoming the type species of the
genus _Stenotrophomonas_ in 1993.

It will be interesting to note if the authors of the due paper regard
the equine cases observed as caused primarily by the bacterium. - Mod.AS]

[I have the impression that gram negatives are under-diagnosed. It
will be of interest to note if the _S. maltophilia_-infected horses
were also EIA (equine infectious anemia) positives or whether the
stress of racing, showing, traveling has left these horses
immunodepressed; if so, such infections are very possible. Though it
has yet to be described maybe there is an EIV equine immunodeficiency
virus out there waiting to be discovered. - Mod.MHJ]

[I wonder if these horses were exposed to individuals who carried
this bacterium or if the horses may be immunocompromised in some
fashion. - Mod.TG]
