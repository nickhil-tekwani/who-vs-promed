Subject: Emergency Management Warning 73: Exotic Newcastle Disease
Confirmed in the United States
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002 in the State of
California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 22
commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also
confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada. A backyard flock was
confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of Arizona. Clinical signs
in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal
signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final
validation. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel
and other federal government personnel are working with the States to
consider additional resources to meet the labor demands at the Task
Forces. APHIS has developed a plan for national END surveillance. This
plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance underway.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. These
declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within Arizona,
California and Nevada.
Currently there are 22 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END. The breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as
follows: 4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 7
premises in San Diego County (7 infected), and 11 premises in
San Bernardino County (11 infected).
* Of the 2562 premises designated for depopulation, 96.5 percent have been
completed.
The Inland Desert and South Coast ICPs have realigned their service
territories so that all of Los Angeles County will now be handled by the
South Coast ICP. The South Coast ICP also will be responsible for all of
San Diego County, except in cases involving commercial
premises. Previously, the Inland Desert ICP handled portion of Los Angeles
County, as well as certain areas of San Diego County (both backyard and
commercial premises).
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed and
working cooperatively with approximately 15 ) 20 county officials to
implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.
Outreach Activities: On a daily basis, Task Force personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation, and
cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city managers in
Southern California.
Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450 calls
per week from the public through the Joint Information Center phone
bank. This is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls in October
2002. On average, approximately 300 of these calls require follow-up
action by the Inland Desert or South Coast Incident Command Posts.
The Task Force information staff provides daily updates to approximately 50
media outlets in California. In addition, in Area Command alone, the
information staff field approximately 70 media calls per week.
Caltrans is in the process of placing posters with information on END and
related quarantine restrictions at approximately 100 highway rest areas
throughout California.
