Officials of the office of the Ayacucho Regional Director of Health
(DIRESA) confirmed today [11 Nov 2011] the 1st yellow fever (YF)
victim in the Union Mantaro community, Llochegua district in the
Apurimac - Ene River valley.

After a histopathologic study, epidemiological specialists confirmed
the 1st YF case in this river valley area, after the puerperal
15-year-old woman died on the 3rd day after giving birth. She was
considered, initially, as a victim of maternal death.

The DIRESA Director of Epidemiology, Tania Cardenas, told INFOREGION
that the patient presented with a clinical picture of fever, jaundice
and gum hemorrhage due to which she was transferred from the Canayre
Health Post to the San Francisco Hospital and later to the regional
hospital.

"Despite all efforts, she died on the 3rd day and was considered a
case of maternal death. Following her death, specialists carried out a
histopathological study of her liver and determined that [the cause of
death] was yellow fever [YF]," Cardenas explained.

David Gordillo Inostroza, DIRESA-Ayacucho head, told the populace of
the forested areas to come in for free YF virus vaccine. He also
insisted that health personnel be on alert for any case suspected of
having YF. "YF is a very dangerous disease, and because of this I am
calling the population between 2 - 59 years of age to come in to the
health posts for free vaccination," he recommended.

In conversation with Citizens Dialogue, the newscast of INFOREGION
which is transmitted from San Francisco to the whole valley, the head
of Ayacucho health also provided details of a series of symptoms which
the citizens should take into account in order to be on alert against
other possible YF cases. "If people are feeling headaches, sudden
fever, muscle pain and gum, mouth or nose bleeding, they must quickly
come to the nearest health center. The vaccination for this disease is
totally free," he stated.

Gordillo added that his sector is carrying out preventive action --
regional promotions, mainly in the valley. "Now a YF vaccination sweep
in Union Mantaro, Canayre and Llochegua is being carried out. At the
same time, there is intensification of surveillance for dead animals
[wild primates] and the presence of mosquitoes to detect and study the
vector and carry out timely control."

According to reports from the DIRESA Epidemiology Office, the 1st YF
outbreak in the valley was registered in 2006, the year in which 7
cases were reported, with 100 per cent fatality [see ProMED-mail

[Peru has had sporadic cases of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever infection
in the Amazon basin over recent years. The current call for people
living in the forest suggests that they are isolated and perhaps
usually out of the reach of health posts and YF virus vaccination
campaigns -- a logistical challenge to maintaining good herd immunity
and ongoing surveillance. One hopes that the immunization campaign in
the area is sufficient to prevent further cases.

Llochegua District is one of 8 districts of the province Huanta in
Peru. An interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of
