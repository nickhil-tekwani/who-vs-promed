A fever outbreak in 2 villages of Tiruvallur district [Tamil Nadu] has so far led to the death of 4 children, hospitalisation of 10 kids, and outpatient treatment for 92 others.

On [Sat 20 Aug 2016], a team of officials, including the District Collector visited the villages, Adi Andhrawada and Kaverirajapuram, and initiated control measures, said Director of Public Health K Kolandaisamy.

On [Fri 19 Aug 2016], a quack from a nearby village was arrested. On [Sat 20 Aug 2016], [a 9-year-old and a 6-year-old] from Adi Andhrawada, sons of labourers, who had been admitted to the Institute of Child Health, Egmore, died.

On [Thu 18 Aug 2016], a 5-year-old died and on [13 Aug 2016], a 4-year-old from Kaverirajapuram, died.

While the hospital said the deaths were not due to dengue -- as serological tests on [2 of the children] were found to be negative and could have been a result of viral or water-borne infections, Dr Kolandaisamy said the infections are suspected to have been viral and mosquito-borne. Dengue has not been ruled out, he said.

[This outbreak is in 2 villages of Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India. Not much is clear from the report above except that 4 young children have died and 10 have been hospitalized; whether the other 92 mentioned in the report are also children is not clear.

It is imperative that the endemic viral illnesses that present with fever such as chikungunya, dengue, or Japanese encephalitis be ruled out. Just the clinical presentation may not be helpful and laboratory diagnostic tests will be required. Not to be forgotten is possibility of malaria, which must be tested for in all febrile cases, especially if supported by the characteristic pattern of fever.

Further information on the duration of illness, clinical signs in addition to fever, any diagnostic work up, immunization status for vaccine preventable illness, and epidemiological history will be highly appreciated from the public health personnel and health care staff in the areas. - Mod.UBA
