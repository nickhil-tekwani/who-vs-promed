Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), United Kingdom, informed
the OIE that a field simulation exercise on foot and mouth disease
[FMD] called "Silver Birch", will take place on 9 and 10 Nov 2010 in
England, Scotland and Wales, where national and local disease control
centres will be set up.

The overall aim of this exercise, which will be conducted in
conjunction with the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) and the Scottish
Government (SG), is to review and check the Governments' contingency
plans and policies for the control and eradication of an outbreak of
FMD with a view to identifying improvements in the plans,
instructions, structures and procedures.

The objectives of this simulation exercise are to:
1. demonstrate that the Government is taking the threat of exotic
animal disease seriously and that it has effective policies and
contingency plans in place;
2. to exercise the integration and interaction between the strategic
and tactical levels within Defra, the Devolved Administration and
Animal Health, to demonstrate the joined up response to an outbreak of FMD;
3. to exercise the multi agency response to an outbreak of FMD in
conjunction with our operational partners (including LRFs* and
SCGs**), both nationally and locally;
4. to exercise Animal Health's new operational model in reaction to a
confirmed case of FMD regionally/divisionally, to demonstrate
increased readiness and resilience within the structures;
5. increase awareness of Defra's/Scottish Government's/Welsh Assembly
Government's/Animal Health's emergency preparedness work amongst stakeholders.

been recently illuminated by the outbreaks in Japan and South Korea. - Mod.AS]
