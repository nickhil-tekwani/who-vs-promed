When the cows don't come home
-------------------------------------
"I don't know what are we going to eat now; chickens have bird flu, cattle
suffer from lumpy skin disease and fish come from polluted waters," said a
housewife, as she shopped at a Cairo market.
Over the past 4 months, lumpy skin disease (LSD) has killed at least 12 000
animals, or 20 percent of the area's entire livestock, in Beni Sweif, 120
km south of Cairo. An estimated 60 percent of the remaining cattle are
infected.
There have been more than 15 outbreaks of LSD in other governorates,
including Al-Beheira, Alexandria, Giza, Fayoum, Minya, Al-Wadi Al-Gedid and
Menoufiya. Altogether, 12 percent of Egypt's 3.75 million cattle have died,
causing losses estimated at LE 60 million [about USD 10.5 million]. [12
percent of Egypt's cattle population mean 450 000 head, an exceptionally
high mortality, for which confirmation or otherwise from official sources
is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
LSD occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, Kuwait and Madagascar. It came to Egypt
in 1988, but not in an endemic form, and subsequently spread to Israel,
where it has since been eradicated.
According to Talib Murad Ali, the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO)
regional officer for animal health, countries like Egypt are likely to be
hard hit economically by the spread of LSD and the panic it causes. More
than 300 000 suspect cows are still awaiting tests.
Grazing land is scarce in the Middle East, and the region is vulnerable to
animal diseases because it imports so many live animals, often without
strict regulation. "It is commonly said that every piece of meat on a kebab
skewer comes from a different country," says Ali.
LSD, an acute viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes [see commentary],
affects only cattle.
The disease starts, says Ahmed Tawfiq, head of the General Organization of
Veterinary Services, with a lack of appetite and high temperature; later,
nasal and eye secretions occur, and lymph nodes swell. In later stages,
nodules appear on the skin which, if left untreated, rupture to form ulcers.
Once the ulcers are present, the cow is in danger of contracting secondary
bacterial infections.
"No treatment is available for lumpy skin disease," says Tawfiq.
"Antibiotics are used to prevent sick animals from contracting secondary
infections."
The only way to save infected livestock is to quarantine the sick animal in
a fly-free environment to prevent the spread of the disease. All in-contact
animals must be vaccinated, and the carcasses of animals that have died
from LSD should be buried or burnt.
The most effective way to contain the disease is to eliminate the virus
transmitter. Swamps and marshy areas in which mosquitoes proliferate should
be drained, and oil can be added to water pools to discourage mosquitoes
from breeding. Routine vaccination of cattle strengthens their resistance
to the disease, but it does not guarantee immunity in animals that are
over-stressed or inadequately fed. "But no cow should be denied
vaccination, which is offered for free to all farmers and cattle breeders,"
stresses Tawfiq.
Human beings cannot contract the disease by touching infected cows [nor by
any other means. - Mod.AS], says Mounir Mohamed Abdel-Halim, professor of
contagious diseases at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Cairo
University. But cows that have been vaccinated and which recover should
not, he warns, be slaughtered until at least 18 days have passed since the
end of medical treatment, otherwise the meat is "contaminated by the
medication given to the animal." [This, most probably, relates to residues
following preventive antibiotic treatment. - Mod.AS]
Despite official claims that the infection is being contained and new
outbreaks of the disease are dwindling, representatives of the livestock
industry have accused the government of ignoring the problem until it had
spun out of control. Only livestock breeders who are members of the Cattle
Insurance Fund will be compensated for their losses, though Tawfiq says
levels of compensation have yet to be decided.

[Egypt's official notification on LSD, sent by Dr. Ahmed Tawfik to the OIE
on 19 Apr 2006, referred to 15 outbreaks in 5 governorates: Iamailia, Beni
Sweif, Al-Beheira, New Vally (Al-Wadi Al-Gedid) and Menoufiya. According to
the report, these outbreaks started between 2 Jan 2006 (Elsadat, Menoufiya)
and 9 Apr 2006 (Etaie-elbarood, Al-Beheira). According to the current news
item, 4 governorates have been added: Alexandria, Giza, Fayoum and Minya.
This brings the total number of infected governorates to 9. For Egypt's 27
governorates, see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Egypt>.
The OIE report indicated that Egypt "applies a regular program for
vaccination against LSD using sheep pox vaccine." No details on the
vaccination history of the affected cattle, nor their age(s), were
included; such data, as well as the vaccine strain used and the vaccination
scheme (minimal age, revaccinations), will help in assessing the
deteriorated situation. According to Egypt's annual report to the OIE for
2004 -- the last year available in OIE's Handistatus II -- 2 105 887
bovines were given mandatory vaccination during that year; see
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/zi_pays.asp?c_pays=56>.
Within Egypt's ecological situation and prevailing animal husbandry
conditions and in view of the fact that LSD seems to have become endemic
while being known to be transmitted by heterologous species -- mosquitoes,
biting flies, midges (for details, see the reference) -- mandatory
vaccination with an efficacious vaccine seems to be the preferable policy.
