Dengue outbreak in Terengganu
------------------------------------
It was reported yesterday [Fri 2 Jul 2004] that 96 people were
hospitalized at the district hospital in Permaisuri, Setiu,
following a dengue outbreak there. Meanwhile, State Health director
Datuk Dr. Ahmad Razin Ahmad Maher said the situation in Kelantan was
under control, with a small number of cases reported so far.
Local councils have been directed to take immediate precautionary
measures against a dengue outbreak in the Setiu district of
Terengganu. State Public Administration, Local Government, Housing
and Health committee chairman Takiyuddin Hassan said a meeting with
the heads of all local authorities would be held tomorrow [Sun 4 Jul
2004] to discuss further measures. "We are not taking any chances.
Strict measures must be taken to rid the State from Aedes breeding
grounds."
Takiyuddin said it was unfortunate that many people did not take the
danger of dengue seriously. "They only react when there are cases in
their areas, but sometimes it is too late," he said.

Dengue in Sri Lanka: 28 deaths & 6742 suspected cases
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities yesterday [Fri 2 Jul 2004] warned that the dengue
epidemic could hit a peak in Jul 2004 owing to the poor response from
the public towards the dengue eradication program, including keeping
the environment clean.
The total number of suspected cases stood at 6743 by Fri 2 Jul 2004,
while the number of deaths due to dengue fever rose to 28. Gampaha
and Colombo districts are the worst affected, while Kurunegala,
Kandy, Trincomalee and Kalutara also recorded a high prevalence. Out
of the 48 deaths, 16 have been reported from Colombo [the capital].
In June 2004 alone, 190 cases had been reported within the Colombo
Municipality area, while the total number of cases stood at 430. 6
cases have been reported within the last 2 days of this month [July
2004], recording an alarming increase. A senior Health Ministry
official said the number of cases is increasing daily due to the rain
in many parts of the country. The highest number of dengue cases are
reported during June and July every year. "During this period, people
should be extra careful," Dr. Kariyawasam added. "Unless the public
supports [the cause] to ensure a clean environment, this might turn
into an epidemic causing a severe crisis," the official added. The
Health Ministry has urged the public to clear breeding places of
dengue mosquitoes by getting rid of cans, tins, coconut shells, old
tires, small containers, and roof gutters where rainwater collects.
"The elimination of mosquito breeding places is the key to an
effective and sustainable preventive strategy," the Ministry said.
The Ministry has also installed a hotline (011-267 5449) for
answering public complaints and queries.

Government declares end of dengue fever outbreak, lifts alert status
-----------------------------------------------
The government declared the dengue fever outbreak over and lifted the
red alert status in 12 provinces, as the prevalence rate had
decreased to a baseline level.
Minister of Health Achmad Suyudi said the number of dengue cases had
been decreasing since mid-April [2004]. "In May, there were only 506
cases with 4 casualties [deaths], far below the 3616 cases recorded a
month earlier, with 25 people succumbing to the disease. We can see
that the number has declined significantly," Suyudi said on Wed 16
Jun 2004. He added that the outbreak had slowed faster than the
government had expected. In May last year [2003], 6425 cases were
recorded, of which 78 died.
In February [2004], the government placed Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam,
Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, Banten,
Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, South Kalimantan, and
South Sulawesi under extraordinary status due to the high number of
people affected by dengue fever. The ministry recorded 59 321 cases
and 669 deaths during this year's [2004] outbreak.
4 distinct, but closely related, serotypes cause dengue, with the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito being the vector. All 4 serotypes -- DEN-1,
DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 -- were found in dengue patients here, said I
Nyoman Kandun, the ministry's expert staff member on environment,
health and epidemiology. Blood samples from 10 Jakarta hospitals
revealed that 2/3 of total patients were affected by DEN-3. Recovery
from an infection caused by a particular serotype results in a
lifelong immunity against that serotype, but provides only a partial,
transient protection against subsequent infections by any of the
other serotypes, he said.
Despite the normal status, the minister called on people to maintain
precautionary measures, as the country was not yet dengue-free. The
government has long urged public participation in its dengue
eradication program through a change in household habits, such as
draining open tanks, covering vats of bathing and standing water, and
burying used cans -- locally called the 3M measures -- to eliminate
the breeding grounds of _Aedes aegypti_.
Dengue fever was 1st recorded in 1968 in Surabaya and Jakarta, when
it killed 24 people.

114 infected with dengue this season in Bangladesh
-----------------------------------------------
The dengue control room in Dhaka reported 114 cases of dengue fever
this season [summer 2004] so far, with 62 of the patients still under
treatment, reported the New Age on Wed 30 Jun 2004.
Dhaka Mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka said, on Tue 29 Jun 2004, that
mosquito control activities have been geared up by Dhaka City
Corporation (DCC) in recent weeks, adding that the dengue situation
in Dhaka is "totally under control." He added that city residents
need to be aware, and they should keep their own houses clean to stop
the spread of dengue fever.
State Minister for Labor and Employment Amanullah Aman also urged the
DCC to monitor dengue status, and stressed that commissioners of all
the 90 wards of Dhaka should come forward and report on the dengue
situation.
An awareness campaign in the media is expected to be launched soon to
make people aware of the deadly disease, according to sources with
the cleanliness and mosquito control advisory committee.
