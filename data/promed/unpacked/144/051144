A mysterious fever has surfaced at Baalur, a village of over 500 population near Ripponpet in Shivamogga [Shimoga] district [Karnataka state], as 35 persons are reported to have been infected with it since [Fri 24 Apr 2015].

It all began on [Fri 24 Apr 2015] when 8 persons in the village developed complaints of fever and pain in joints. They underwent treatment at the primary health centre at Ripponpet. However, the number of infected persons jumped to 32 by [Sun 26 Apr 2015] and another 3 complained of similar symptoms on [Mon 27 Apr 2015], District Health Officer Nagaraj Naik told The Hindu. Blood samples of all the patients were subjected to medical investigation, which tested negative for malaria, chikungunya, and dengue.

Meanwhile, a team of medical experts from a private hospital in Manipal visited the village on [Sun 26 Apr 2015] and conducted medical examination.

Dr Naik said the medical experts suspected the symptoms to have been caused by a "droplet viral infection". The blood samples were later sent to a private health establishment at Manipal for further tests and the results were expected in 4 days' time.

A medical camp had been set up at Baalur and 2 doctors had been deputed to treat the patients. Those suffering from serious health complications were treated at the general hospital in Sagar and Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences.

Adequate stock of medicines was being maintained in the village, he said.

Kalagodu Ratnakar, president of the Shivamogga Zilla Panchayat [district government], has said that the local gram panchayat had launched a drive to control mosquitoes at Baalur and the neighbouring Haalugudde villages.

Fogging operation had been conducted in places, which were potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, he said.

[There is not an adequate enough description of the disease to speculate what the etiology of these febrile cases might be. The basis on which a "droplet virus infection" was based is not presented in the report above. The emphasis on mosquito breeding sites and control suggests that vector mosquitoes are involved, although dengue and chikungunya viruses were excluded. However, the tests used to exclude these 2 viruses were not given.

The results from the blood samples taken should be available by now. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving the results of those tests, and any addition information about this outbreak that may become available.
