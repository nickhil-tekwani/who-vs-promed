re: ProMED COVID-19 update (444): early treatment, herd immunity, USA rally WHO, global 20201019.7872083
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a lot of confusion among many, regarding herd immunity, on account of 2 problems:

One, assuming that the herd immunity principle taken from vaccinology applies equally well to disease epidemiology without vaccination. That is incorrect.

Two, herd immunity itself is not well defined. When used in science the term must have a clear definition.

I have been addressing these issues for a long time.

[Dr. TJ John provided the following article from The Wired Science published 8 Oct 2020; https://science.thewire.in/health/india-covid-19-epidemic-herd-immunity-vaccine-t-jacob-john/]

It is rather obvious that the term 'herd immunity' was borrowed by medical epidemiologists from their veterinary colleagues. The original context of recognising the phenomenon of herd immunity was outbreaks of contagious infection in herds of cattle. A herd consisted of a finite number of heads of cattle, free-roaming in the farmer's land, without contact with other cattle. If nothing was done, many would get infected and some would die -- but eventually, the outbreak itself would die out, sparing others that never got infected. Animals that recovered from infection were typically immune but the uninfected ones lacked this immunity.

An infectious disease's transmission dynamics change as the fractions of immune animals increase and naive animals decline. At the tipping point of zero transmission, the reason for the infection dying out is explained as the result of herd immunity. New calves are not exposed to infection and grow up immunity-naive.

Herd immunity can be tested in the laboratory. The same thing happens when a contagious infection is introduced in a colony of lab animals. When a majority is infected, the disease transmission ceases at a tipping point, and the minority that survives have no infection -- and no immunity.

Herd immunity as a strategy
---------------------------
'Contagious' means direct animal-to-animal transmission, mostly via the respiratory route -- and not through insect vectors or contaminated food or water. The novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, is transmitted through respiration, during social contact, so it is contagious. As a result, the virus's transmission dynamics also involve the possibility of herd immunity. The concept of herd immunity is common in many textbooks of human disease epidemiology. However, when the international COVID-19 outbreak began, theoretical experts overlooked many details.

First: herd immunity comes at a steep price. Some animals, or in COVID-19's case, humans, die of the disease consequent to infection. It is inhuman to let some die so that others might be protected. The infection must be prevented as best as possible through physical distancing and mask-wearing, although this does not help the development of herd immunity.

Second: a 'herd' refers to a group of animals that have no contact with other animals. So, the condition of herd immunity required no in-migration of fresh animals during an outbreak, so that there is no external source of infection in addition to the intra-herd source.

Humans are social animals and blocking contact between people strikes at the root of societal structure and functions. The nationwide lockdown to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus came with the heavy price of disrupting socio-economic activities -- encompassing production, consumption, and profit. As we have learned the hard way, there are also limitations to preventing transmission by disrupting social transactions. Therefore, the lockdowns should have been applied in graded doses, disaggregated in geographies and timed intelligently, and collateral damage minimised.

The most important detail that was overlooked was the fact that, in the past, epidemiologists did not adapt the herd immunity concept to human disease epidemiology for epidemic control. Public health ethics does not allow the sacrifice of an unfortunate few for the benefit of survivors. The risks and benefits of any public health intervention must be equitably distributed.

When vaccines were developed and vaccination programmes designed, we could mimic nature and induce immunity by vaccination with zero risk of disease and death. But do we need to vaccinate 100% of a population? No -- the coverage required can be calculated based on the transmissibility characteristics of the infection; it varies from disease to disease. Unfortunately, theoretical epidemiologists did not consult vaccinology colleagues to understand the nuances of herd immunity in disease control.

Traditional vaccinology
-----------------------
Herd immunity in the human context is defined differently by 2 schools of vaccinologists. The traditionalists maintain that herd immunity was the theoretical possibility of interrupting transmission when a majority was infected and became immune. There has never been a real-life situation of herd immunity interrupting contagious infection in open societies. In island populations without in-migration, outbreaks have died out until they were reintroduced later. In open societies, 2 major contagious diseases, polio and measles, continue to wreak havoc among children until vaccines became available. This is despite the fact that in India, no child developed polio after 5 years and measles after 10 years; beyond that age, all were immune. The reason why infections continued was the constant 'replenishment' of non-immune children in the form of new births.

Herd immunity conditions in herds of cattle cannot apply in human communities.

Practical vaccinologists define herd immunity as the fraction of people immune in the community -- a simple way to measure the immunity profile of a community. We might as well call it 'community immunity'.

In order to control diseases through vaccination, high coverage is required. The extreme form of control is to achieve zero transmission, elimination in countries, or eradication globally. We can achieve the tipping point of interruption of transmission if a certain level of coverage is achieved. This is called the herd immunity threshold. Knowing the transmission efficiency of a virus, measured by the basic reproduction number R0, epidemiologists have created a mathematical formula to derive the herd immunity threshold necessary to eliminate transmission.

The error theoretical epidemiologists made was to assume that the same formula could calculate the herd immunity threshold in terms of what fraction ought to be immune (due to infection) to reach the tipping point. However, again, there is no precedent of any contagious disease having reached zero transmission with herd immunity.

To put it simply, the formula implies a herd immunity threshold of 60% if the R0 value is 2.5 -- but this applies specifically to immunity induced by a vaccine, and not by the coronavirus itself. Most experts assumed that the herd immunity level of 60% would be required for the epidemic to turn endemic, with low and relatively stable numbers perpetually present. This is just like the H1N1 virus has been causing seasonal influenza outbreaks after the 2009 pandemic. If 60% spells the end of the epidemic, the peak ought to be at the halfway mark, namely at 30% of the population infected, in a bell-shaped curve.

The numbers for India
---------------------
Data from the Union health ministry indicate that India's case load peaked around the middle of September [2020]; the number of new daily cases has consistently declined from [19 Sep 2020] until today [8 Oct 2020]. However, the 30% herd immunity assumption, based on results from the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR's) 1st seroprevalence survey, was probably wrong. What was the observed herd immunity? According to the 2nd seroprevalence survey, also conducted by the ICMR, the total number of infected adults in India was about 150 million. Approximating India's adult population to be 1000 million, a herd immunity level of 15% coincided with the peak.

This is not good news: the rest of India's population remains at risk of contracting the infection, and we cannot let our guard down just because we have crossed a peak. However, it would appear the speed of transmission has come down, with effective reproduction number R below 1 (by definition). And when R stands at 1, with a relatively low number of daily cases, we will know that the epidemic has entered the endemic transmission phase. This is likely to happen early next year [2021].

Finally, what should we aim to achieve by using a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available? The likelihood of a vaccine becoming available to help us to cut short the epidemic is very low. But we should aim to eliminate the infection altogether, especially as 60% herd immunity will suffice. India should lead the world towards the global eradication of COVID-19. The chairperson of the executive board of the WHO is our health minister. The WHO's chief scientist is a former director-general of the ICMR. Indian vaccine manufacturers are well-known for scaling up the supplies of good-quality vaccines. We must seize the day -- carpe diem.

[As always, D. T Jacob John has very insightful thoughts to share. He is being kind when he refers to the different groups of individuals for and against applying the concept of herd immunity to management of a pandemic in the absence of vaccination.

Dr John and Dr Samuel published an article addressing the concept of herd immunity and herd effect in the European Journal of Epidemiology in 2000, which he also shared with us:

ref: John TJ, Samuel R. Herd immunity and herd effect: new insights and definitions. Eur J Epidemiol. 2000; 16(7): 601-6. doi: 10.1023/a:1007626510002. PMID: 11078115; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1007626510002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"The term herd immunity has been used by various authors to conform to different definitions. Earlier this situation had been identified but not corrected. We propose that it should have precise meaning for which purpose a new definition is offered: "the proportion of subjects with immunity in a given population". This definition dissociates herd immunity from the indirect protection observed in the unimmunised segment of a population in which a large proportion is immunised, for which the term 'herd effect' is proposed. It is defined as: "the reduction of infection or disease in the unimmunised segment as a result of immunising a proportion of the population". Herd immunity can be measured by testing a sample of the population for the presence of the chosen immune parameter. Herd effect can be measured by quantifying the decline in incidence in the unimmunised segment of a population in which an immunisation programme is instituted. Herd immunity applies to immunisation or infection, human to human transmitted, or otherwise. On the other hand, herd effect applies to immunisation or other health interventions which reduce the probability of transmission, confined to infections transmitted human to human, directly or via vector. The induced herd immunity of a given vaccine exhibits geographic variation as it depends upon coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, both of which can vary geographically. Herd effect is determined by herd immunity as well as the force of transmission of the corresponding infection. Clear understanding of these phenomena and their relationships will help improve the design of effective and efficient immunisation programmes aimed at control, elimination, or eradication of vaccine preventable infectious diseases."

Dr TJ John's comment in the Science Wired article: "...herd immunity comes at a steep price. Some animals, or in COVID-19's case, humans, die of the disease consequent to infection. It is inhuman to let some die so that others might be protected. The infection must be prevented as best as possible through physical distancing and mask-wearing, although this does not help the development of herd immunity." says it all. Not only is it inhuman, but unethical. The psychological toll of the battlefield triage situation in hospitals that were overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, and shortages of respirators and ICU beds, speaks to the humanity of the healthcare professionals. - Mod.MPP]

Full text [abridged]
As of [15 Oct 2020], 216 025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1-6). Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during [26 Jan 2020]-[3 Oct 2020]. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015-2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299 028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January [2020] through [3 Oct 2020], with 2/3 of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.

Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limited by factors such as the availability and use of diagnostic testing (including postmortem testing) and the accurate and complete reporting of cause of death information on the death certificate. Excess death analyses are not subject to these limitations because they examine historical trends in all-cause mortality to determine the degree to which observed numbers of deaths differ from historical norms. In April 2020, CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) began publishing data on excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (7,8). This report describes trends and demographic patterns in the number of excess deaths occurring in the United States from [26 Jan 2020], through [3 Oct 2020], and differences by age and race/ethnicity using provisional mortality data from the NVSS.

[Details on methodology can be found at the source URL above - Mod.MPP]. Approximately 0.2% of decedents overall are foreign residents.

From [26 Jan 2020], through [3 Oct 2020], an estimated 299 028 more persons than expected have died in the United States. Excess deaths reached their highest points to date during the weeks ending [11 Apr 2020] (40.4% excess) and [8 Aug 2020] (23.5% excess) (Figure 1: Weekly numbers of deaths from all causes and from all causes excluding COVID-19 relative to the average expected number and the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval (A), and the weekly and total numbers of deaths from all causes and from all causes excluding COVID-19 above the average expected number and the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval (B) -- National Vital Statistics System, United States, January-September 2020]). 2/3 of excess deaths during the analysis period (66.2%; 198 081) were attributed to COVID-19 and the remaining third to other causes (Figure 1).

The total number of excess deaths (deaths above average levels) from [26 Jan 2020] through [3 Oct 2020] ranged from a low of approximately 841 in the youngest age group (younger than 25 years) to a high of 94 646 among adults aged 75-84 years. However, the average percentage change in deaths over this period compared with previous years was largest for adults aged 25-44 years (26.5%) ([Figure 2: Percentage change in the weekly number of deaths in 2020 relative to average in the same weeks during 2015-2019, by age group -- United States, 2015-2019 and 2020]). Overall, numbers of deaths among persons aged younger than 25 years were 2.0% below average, and among adults aged 45-64, 65-74 years, 75-84, and 85 years or older were 14.4%, 24.1%, 21.5%, and 14.7% above average, respectively.

When examined by race and ethnicity, the total numbers of excess deaths during the analysis period ranged from a low of approximately 3412 among AI/AN [non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native] persons to a high of 171 491 among White persons. For White persons, deaths were 11.9% higher when compared to average numbers during 2015-2019. However, some racial and ethnic subgroups experienced disproportionately higher percentage increases in deaths ([Figure 3 Percentage change in the weekly number of deaths in 2020 relative to average numbers in the same weeks during 2015-2019, by race and Hispanic ethnicity -- United States, 2015-2019 and 2020]). Specifically, the average percentage increase over this period was largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%). Deaths were 28.9% above average for AI/AN persons, 32.9% above average for Black persons, 34.6% above average for those of other or unknown race or ethnicity, and 36.6% above average for Asian persons.

Discussion
----------
Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299 028 more persons than expected have died since [26 Jan 2020]; approximately 2/3 of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March [2020] through July [2020] reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September [2020] (5).

Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25-44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January [2020] through [3 Oct 2020]. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May [2020] through August [2020] (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%-36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations [see source URL above]. Despite these limitations, however, this report demonstrates important trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results provide more information about deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform public health messaging and mitigation efforts focused on the prevention of infection and mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the elimination of health inequities.

CDC continues to recommend the use of masks, frequent handwashing, and maintenance of social distancing to prevent COVID-19.

[The estimated mortality directly attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the USA is approximately 300 000. With an estimated 10-20% of the population infected, there have been approximately 300 000 deaths, do the math of mortality that might occur if one ponders using the herd immunity approach. And note that the age and ethnic group most experiencing the excess mortality are the 25-44-year-olds, and overall among the Hispanic ethnic group.

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 18 Oct 2020, 10 am CEST

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
The incidence of new COVID-19 cases has continued to accelerate, while the incidence of new deaths has remained relatively stable (Figure 1). As of [18 Oct 2020], over 40 million cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported globally, with over 2.4 million new cases and 36 000 new deaths reported over the past week.

The European Region has continued to report a rapid increase in cases and deaths, with over 927 000 new cases reported this past week -- a 25% weekly increase in cases compared to the previous week -- contributing 38% of all new cases reported worldwide (Table 1). Similarly, the number of deaths continues to climb with a 29% increase from last week. Increases, although more gradual, were also observed in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific Regions. Declines continued to be reported in the Region of the Americas and the South East Asia Region; although the incidence of new infections remains high, and collectively these 2 regions contribute over half of new cases and deaths observed globally.

The countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week remain the same as last week: India, the United States of America, France, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.

Figure 2: COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, [12 Oct 2020] through [18 Oct 2020]

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
Continuing trends in the previous week, the Region reported an increase in both cases and deaths in the last 7 days, with an 11% increase in new cases and an 8% increase in new deaths (Figure 3). The pattern of increasing cases continues to be driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, with Kenya, and Botswana also reporting notable increases.

The majority of countries in the region are reporting community transmission of COVID-19 (n=39; 78%), with a further 7 (14%) classifying transmission as clusters of cases (n=7; 14%), 3 (6%) as sporadic cases, and 1 (2%) as reporting no active cases.

An unusually high number of cases was reported from Botswana this week, with over 1800 cases reported in one day. This was largely attributed to a backlog of tests administered from [2-13 Oct 2020], mostly from in and around the capital city of Gaborone.

South Africa has accounted for approximately 70% of deaths in the Region in the past week. The high number of deaths being reported is partially attributed to a mortality audit, and many of these deaths are retrospectively reported.

Mauritania reported a large increase from last week (12 to 80 cases), all reported from the capital, Nouakchott. Although this is a higher number of cases than Mauritania has reported in recent weeks, it remains lower than the daily numbers reported in July [2020].

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [18 Oct 2020]

- Region of the Americas
A slight decrease in new cases was reported across the Region over the past week (Figure 4) in comparison to the previous week. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico continue to register the highest number of weekly new cases in the region, while the highest incidence of new cases per million population was reported in Argentina, Bahamas, Costa Rica, and Saint Martin, all with more than 1600 cases per million in the past 7 days. A marked decline in the incidence of deaths in the region continued this past week with just over 16 000 new deaths, compared with 20 000 new deaths last week. The Region accounts for 1/3 (n=798 794, 33%) of new cases and almost 1/2 (45%) of new deaths reported globally in the past week. Most countries and territories in the region self characterize their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=34, 64%), with 8 (15%) classified as clusters of cases, 7 (13%) as sporadic cases, and 5 (9%) as no cases.

Argentina remains the country in the Region with the highest number of new cases and new deaths per million population with over 2000 new cases per million inhabitants in the past week. Even though the weekly incidence of new COVID-19 cases is increasing gradually, a decreasing trend in the number of new deaths has been reported in the past 2 weeks, dropping from 6000 deaths per week at the end of September [2020] to less than 2500 deaths in the past week.

Guatemala continues to register a gradual decline in the incidence of new cases, however, an 88% increase in new deaths (from 80 to 150 deaths) was reported over the past 7 days. COVID-19 test positivity rates have also remained relatively high for the last 12 weeks with over 10% of samples testing positive. The highest incidence of cases and deaths was reported in the capital, Guatemala City, and has reached over 530 deaths per million population.

Peru has the 2nd-highest rate of deaths per 1 million population in the Region with 1021 deaths per million inhabitants. However, in the last week, modest decreases in case and death rates continued. Some regions have reported declines of 50% and the regions of Puno, Madre de Dios, Amazonas, and Moquegua registered declines of 70% in the weekly incidence of COVID-19.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [18 Oct 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
A gradual increase of new cases and deaths was reported by the Eastern Mediterranean Region over the past week (Figure 5), reaching the highest weekly incidence reported since the beginning of the pandemic, with almost 150 000 new confirmed cases from 22 countries. In the past week, The Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Morocco are reported the highest number of new cases while Bahrain, Lebanon, and Jordan report the highest incidence, with over 1500 new cases per million population.

A majority of the countries in the region continue to self-characterise their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=14, 64%), with 5 countries reporting clusters of cases and sporadic cases being reported in Somalia, Djibouti, and Saudi Arabia. During the past week, Tunisia updated their classification from clusters of cases to community transmission.

The Islamic Republic of Iran remains the most affected country in the region with Tehran, the capital city, being the most affected area. In this reporting period, Iran has recorded new weekly records, with over 30 000 new cases (360 cases per million population) and over 1800 deaths (22 new deaths per million population) reported, bringing cumulative counts in the country to over 534 000 cases and 30 000 deaths.

Libya has shown a surge in cases, recording over 6000 new cases (900 cases per million population). Test positivity rates also continue to gradually increase, with approximately 1 in 4 samples tested returning a positive result.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [18 Oct 2020]

- European Region
This week, the European Region again reports the highest increase in cases and deaths thus far -- 25% and 29%, respectively compared to the previous week. In addition, the Region reported the greatest proportion of new cases globally (38%, n=927 433). A media briefing by WHO Regional Director for Europe highlighted that the region is currently reporting over 3 times more cases per day compared to the April [2020] peak, with hospital admissions rising, although the number of daily deaths remains 5 times lower than they were in April [2020].

France, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, Czechia, and Italy continue to report a high incidence of new cases. Collectively, these 5 countries contribute to over 1/2 of all reported cases this week in the Region.

A majority of the countries in the region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=34, 55%), with a further 20 (33%) countries reporting clusters of cases, 4 (6%) [sporadic cases], 3 (less than 1%) no cases, and one pending classification. During the past week, North Macedonia updated their classification from clusters of cases to community transmission.

Slovenia reported a 150% increase in cases this week (n=4890) -- the highest one-week increase the country has experienced so far. In addition, Slovenia reported 1924 deaths, compared to only one death last week. In response to this recent increase in cases and deaths, as of [19 Oct 2020], the Slovenian government has declared a 30-day state of emergency with a daily curfew.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [18 Oct 2020]

- South East Asia Region
Overall, the region continues to show a decline in cases and deaths (Figure 7), with Nepal being the only country which reported an increase in both new weekly cases (12%) and new deaths (31%) in comparison to the previous week. Nepal reported 810 new cases per one million population, the highest in the region, followed by the Maldives (590) and India (319). Most countries in the region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as cluster of cases (n=6, 55%), with 2 countries reporting community transmission, and a further 2 reporting sporadic cases.

Bangladesh reported an 8% increase in new weekly cases. Among the 386 086 cases reported as of [16 Oct 2020], the majority (81%) were adults aged 21-60 years, and almost three-quarters (72%) were male. During the same timeframe, the country has conducted 2.13 million diagnostic tests or 12 900 tests per million population.

Myanmar reported a 6% increase in new weekly deaths compared to last week. The majority of the cases and deaths continue to be reported from Yangon Region. Here, the Government has further extended stay at home orders for 44 townships from [8-21 Oct 2020]. On [3 Oct 2020], Myanmar published standard operating procedures for testing of COVID-19 with antigen-based rapid diagnostic kits and began using these in Yangon Region on [29 Sep 2020], followed by other regions and states.

Thailand continues to report relatively low numbers of cases. The country has become one of the 1st countries in the world to complete an assessment of how its health system has so far responded to COVID-19. The review highlights success factors and provides recommendations across nine areas, or "pillars" of the national response.

- Western Pacific Region
Overall, one percent of all new weekly cases and deaths were reported from the Western-Pacific Region. The region reported an 8% increase in new weekly cases and a 27% decrease in new weekly deaths as compared to the previous week. The majority of new cases continue to be reported from the Philippines, Malaysia, and Japan. Whereas French Polynesia and Guam reported the highest incidence of new cases - 3713 and 3258 new cases per one million inhabitants, respectively. Papua New Guinea reported an increase of over 200% in weekly cases as compared to the previous week, with 31 new cases and 581 total confirmed cases.

Only 2 out of countries and territories in the region self-characterize their current transmission pattern as community transmission, with a further 9 (24%) countries reporting clusters of cases, and 7 (18%) countries reporting sporadic cases. The majority (n=19, 50%) of countries and territories report no active cases, and one territory is pending classification.

Malaysia reported a 51% increase in cases and deaths as compared to last week, with the majority of cases reported from Sabah State. The Ministry of Health has taken several measures to reduce transmission and increasing test capacity in the state -- daily RT-PCR tests increased from 1350 in July [2020] to 2600 as of [17 Oct 2020].

Wallis and Futuna reported its 1st positive case of COVID-19 to WHO on [19 Oct 2020]. As this falls outside of the reporting period of this update, the island territory will be reflected in next week's update.

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts. There are now 6 counts reporting more than 1 million cases: the USA (8 520 307), India (7 649 158), Brazil (5 274 817), Russia (1 431 635), Spain (1 029 668), and Argentina (1 018 999). In the past 24 hours, the USA (63 654) India (54 422) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 6560 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Oct 2020). It took 2 days to go from 40+ million to 41+ million.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (18 countries) include the USA, India, Brazil (23 690), UK (21 330), France (20 468), Argentina (16 337), Russia (16 319), Spain (13 873), Czech Republic (11 984), Italy (10 871), Poland (9291), Colombia (8256), Belgium (8227), Netherlands (8165), Germany (7167), Mexico (5788), Ukraine (5469), and Iran (5039).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 15.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.1%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA has increased in 7-day average daily reported cases in the past week compared with the preceding week by 17.0%, and increased deaths by 4.5% reflecting the increased transmission ongoing since the end of the summer. - Mod.MPP]
