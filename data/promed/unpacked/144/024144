TYPHOID WARNING - WALES (GLAMORGAN)
===================================
Date: Thu, 13 Mar 1997 12:34:41 +0000 (GMT)
From: L93LMM@tay.ac.uk

Two days ago I took note of a small article supplied by the BBC
news service but have seen nothing or heard nothing since.
The following information was supplied:
Health officials are warning of a Typhoid outbreak ater a teenager
contracted the disease in Port Talbot, Glamorgan.
The 16 year old became ill after eating out at a local restaurant.
The girl has since been discharged from hospital in Swansea where she
had spent 10 days.
An inquiry by officials from the Iechyd Morgannwy Public Health
Department, that covers the area, has been started.
---------------------------------------------------
Perhaps someone else can shed a little more light on this subject
as it would be interesting to know precisely how/why the Typhoid has
appeared here?
