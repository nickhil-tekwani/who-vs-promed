Unexpected human cases of cutaneous anthrax in Latium region, Italy, August 2017: integrated human-animal investigation of epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and ecological factors. Euro Surveill. 2019;24(24):pii=1800685. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.24.1800685

Abstract
-------
On [31 Aug 2017], a veterinarian and a farmworker were hospitalised for skin lesions. Both had been exposed to a dead cow on [19 Aug 2017] on a farm near Rome, where 8 further cattle died of confirmed anthrax later the same month. At admission, the 1st case showed a black depressed eschar and another smaller lesion on one hand. The 2nd case presented deep infection of the skin, with involvement of both arms. Anthrax diagnosis was confirmed by detection of _Bacillus anthracis_ DNA in eschar fragments from both patients. T-cell specific immunity was studied by flow cytometry and Elispot assay after stimulation with _B. anthracis_ secretome in blood samples collected from case 1. Immunoglobulin production was detected by complement fixation assay. In case 1, specific CD4+ T-cell activation was detected, without antibody production. Specific antibodies were detected only in the 2nd patient with severe cutaneous illness. Both patients recovered. The 2 human anthrax cases were epidemiologically linked, but anthrax was not suspected at admission in either case. The veterinarian had initially unrecognised professional exposure and the exposed farmworker did initially not report exposure to affected animals. A One Health strategy integrating human and animal investigations was essential to confirm the diagnosis.

[The introduction of the full text of the article at https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.24.1800685#html_fulltext says: "On [25 Aug 2017], the Veterinary Service Area A (Animal Health) of the Azienda Sanitaria Locale Roma 6 (ASL RM6) and the veterinarians of the Regional Veterinary Public Health Institute for Latium and Tuscany (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana, IZSLT) suspected anthrax in four cattle that suddenly died on a pasture in Municipality of Grottaferrata, in the province of Rome, Italy. On [31 Aug 2017], a veterinarian was hospitalised at 'Lazzaro Spallanzani' National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome for necrotising skin lesions. On the same day, a 2nd patient was admitted in the same hospital for a suspected necrotising fasciitis."

This farm had suffered repeated anthrax outbreaks in March 2018 and August 2017. See 19 Mar 2018 Anthrax - Italy (02): (LZ) bovine, history 20180319.5696362.

Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. The modern descendant, the Italian Regione of Lazio, also called Latium in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latium and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio.

Lazio is given to sporadic cases of anthrax. The one in 2017, referred to here, had 9 bovine cases. There was a Lazio sheep outbreak also in 2017 with 2 cases. There were previous bovine outbreaks in 2000 and 1997. When livestock anthrax is not a regular event it is just another unexpected animal death, and no precautions are taken, either to prevent human contact cases or subsequent livestock outbreaks from the contaminated soil, and the novelty generated by this detailed diagnostic report on the 2017 human cases. The scientific publicity has the benefit of putting this disease back in the spotlight of awareness of risk. - Mod.MHJ
