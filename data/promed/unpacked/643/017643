Brazil's Agriculture Ministry has confirmed several new cases of foot and
mouth disease (FMD) on 6 ranches in Mato Grasso do Sul, near the border
with Parana; that brings the total number of farms infected in that state
to 10. There are 4 reported cases in Parana that have not been confirmed by
Sao Paulo.
The Ag Ministry expects more than 10 000 animals to be culled in Mato
Grasso do Sul, the source of nearly half of all cattle exported from the
world's top beef-selling nation.
Since the initial outbreak 2 weeks ago, 41 nations have banned meat imports
from Brazil. Depending on how long the bans last, this FMD outbreak could
cost Brazil upwards of $1 billion.

An outbreak of foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease has apparently spread to cattle
in Parana state from neighboring Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, the world's
top cattle producer, the federal government's agriculture minister said on
Saturday.
"It clearly is related to the original outbreak in Mato Grosso do Sul,"
Roberto Rodrigues told journalists. Investigators are examining an area
near the Parana cities of Londrina and Toledo with 4000 cattle spread
across 40 ranches.
"About 20 head of this total showed early signs of the illness," he said.
"It's not a certainty that it is FMD, but we are 90 percent certain that
they have the disease because the group of animals came from Mato Grosso do
Sul," he said.
The results of laboratory tests on the cows, which were raised in Mato
Grosso do Sul but recently sold to ranchers at an auction in Parana, will
not be ready until Tuesday.
At least 41 countries have restricted imports of Brazilian beef since the
1st outbreak was discovered on 10 Oct 2005.
At least 5100 head of cattle in the region will be slaughtered in and
around the region of Eldorado, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil's No. 1
cattle-ranching state. But the number could climb if the quarantine area grows.
Health officials have suggested that vaccines used in the area were poorly
handled or administered, making them less effective or even useless against
the disease.
Ranchers have also said that the disease originated from across the nearby
border in Paraguay, as all of Brazil's herd in the state has been vaccinated.
The Paraguayan government has denied this.
Brazil is the world's leading beef exporter. Its commercial cattle herd
slightly outnumbers its 184 million citizens.

There are now 11 confirmed foci of FMD in Mato Grosso do Sul state (MS).
According to the Director of the department of animal health, the
government is still awaiting the result of lab tests from 2 more suspected
foci in MS and 4 in Parana state (PR), which will be available on Friday
[28 Oct 2005].
The 11th focus was found on a small property in Eldorado township near the
Vezozzo ranch, where the 1st focus was found this month, close to the
borders of Paraguay, and of Sao Paulo & Parana states, Brazil. See map at:

3 out of 24 cattle were sick; all have been slaughtered.

[This disease is very easily spread, and the movement of animals will move
the disease. The disease can spread by the wind carrying viral particles to
a new location. Biosecurity should be strictly maintained, and every
vehicle, person, or anything else moving onto or off of these problems
should be thoroughly disinfected. - Mod.TG]
