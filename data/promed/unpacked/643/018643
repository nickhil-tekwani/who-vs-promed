Possible Estuary-Associated Syndrome
_Pfiesteria piscicida_ (Pp) is an estuarine dinoflagellate that has been
associated with fish kill events in estuaries along the eastern seaboard
and possibly with human health effects. CDC, in collaboration with other
federal, state, and local government agencies and academic institutions, is
conducting multi-state surveillance, epidemiological studies, and
laboratory research for possible estuary-associated syndrome (PEAS),
including possible Pp-related human illness.
The surveillance system tracks PEAS rather than Pp-related illness because
a Pp toxin(s) has not been identified and therefore a biomarker of exposure
has not been developed. Detection of Pp or fish with lesions in water has
been used as evidence of suspected Pp toxin(s). However, Pp has been found
in waters where there were no reports of harm to fish or persons. In
addition, lesions on fish can result from various biologic, physical, and
environmental factors. Therefore, detecting Pp or observing fish with
lesions may not be indicative of the presence of putative Pp toxin(s). PEAS
surveillance criteria resulted from a series of CDC-sponsored multi-state
workshops and differ from criteria developed in 1997. Persons are
considered to have PEAS if:
1) they report developing symptoms within 2 weeks after exposure to
estuarine water;
2) they report memory loss or confusion of any duration and/or three or
more selected symptoms (i.e., headache, skin rash at the site of water
contact, sensation of burning skin, eye irritation, upper respiratory
irritation, muscle cramps, and gastrointestinal symptoms) that-with the
exception of skin rash at the site of water contact and sensation of
burning skin-persist for 2 or more weeks; and
3) a health-care provider cannot identify another cause for the symptoms.
It is unclear whether persons exposed to Pp while swimming, boating, or
engaging in other recreational activities in coastal waters are at risk for
developing illness. PEAS is not infectious and has not been associated with
eating fish or shellfish caught in waters where Pp has been found. However,
persons should avoid areas with large numbers of diseased, dying, or dead
fish and should promptly report the event to the state's environmental or
natural resource agency. In addition, persons should not go in or near the
water in areas that are closed officially by the state and should not
harvest or eat fish or shellfish from these areas. Persons who experience
health problems after exposure to estuarine water, a fish-disease event, or
a fish-kill site should contact their health-care provider and state or
local public health agency.
Several states have established PEAS information lines: Delaware, (800)
523-3336; Florida, (888) 232-8635; Maryland, (888) 584-3110; North
Carolina, (888) 823-6915; South Carolina, (888) 481-0125; and Virginia,
(888) 238-6154.
