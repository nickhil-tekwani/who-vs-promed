A survey of bison in the Fort Providence area of Canada's Northwest Territories estimates the population is less than half of what it was a year ago. The survey was conducted in March 2013 and shows an estimated 714 bison left in the area. That's down from 1531 last year [2012].

The territorial government blames last summer's [2013] anthrax outbreak for the substantial decline. Last year, more than 400 bison carcasses were found in the Fort Providence area, west of the Great Slave Lake in the south central part of the territory. Bison biologist Terry Armstrong says there are probably many more, but their carcasses may be in wooded areas and weren't found by crews. "It's impossible to predict how long it'll take for this population to rebound and build back up to its previous size because we don't know exactly how good the conditions are." But he is optimistic. Fewer bison mean less competition for the animals that survived. "Given that there are only half the number of animals that there were a year ago, I would think that the habitat should be able to support more animals than there are now and probably much closer to the previous number."

The territorial government hasn't allowed hunting of the bison since late last year [2012]. The government says there will be consultation with authorities in the area in the next couple of months to decide how the herd will be managed moving forward.

[In August 2012, the estimated loss was 30 percent. Aerial surveys are done each year as routine regular flights during the summer "anthrax season" to find and burn carcasses promptly. The outbreak in 1993 killed only 10 percent of the sanctuary bison herd. In the west Texas 2001 anthrax wildlife, essentially involving white tailed deer, epidemic loses on the various affected ranches were in the 70-90 percent range, but this was ascribed to the artificially high deer densities maintained to support commercial hunting. While anthrax is essentially non-contagious, thanks to spread via blow-flies and biting flies it can appear to be so. And if the female tabanids with contaminated mouthparts do not have to fly far to find another bison to feed on, the chances of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary cases is much increased. In tabanid-based epidemics it is not unusual to hear comments that the deer/cows/bison were black with flies. Similarly mob members visiting a dead member will be attracted to any blood from the carcass thanks to its salt content. Hunting in the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary is not very intense at all, and the bison are not fed as they are in Texas. Thus the causes for this high mortality are yet to be determined, though we can assume that bison density will have played a part.
