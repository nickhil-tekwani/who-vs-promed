Ongoing nationwide outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona associated with internationally distributed infant milk products, France, Dec 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identification of the outbreak
------------------------------
At the end of [November 2017], the French National Reference Centre (NRC) for _Salmonella_ noted an unusual increase in _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona among infants, with 22 cases identified between [August and November 2017] in children younger than 6 months. On [1 Dec 2017], interviews with the caregivers of 8 of these infants by the French National Institute for Public Health (Sante Publique France (SPF)) identified infant milk products from a single company as a potential source. All but 1 of the first 8 investigated cases had consumed products manufactured at a single facility operated by this company. This facility had previously been associated with an outbreak of _S._ Agona in 2005 [1]. An outbreak investigation is currently ongoing in conjunction with the NRC, SPF, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economy in charge of consumers' affairs.

Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
The operational definition for probable cases as at [11 Jan 2018] includes children younger than 2 years with a laboratory-confirmed _S._ Agona infection and with a date of onset of symptoms since [1 Jan 2017]. A confirmed case is a probable case with a _S._ Agona isolate belonging to the outbreak cluster by whole genome sequencing (WGS) or, if WGS has not been performed, an isolate which does not produce H2S and gas after 18 h incubation on Kligler iron agar (see Microbiological investigations for further details). Cases were excluded if they had a history of travel abroad in the 7 days before symptom onset and probable cases were excluded if after WGS, they were not within the outbreak cluster.

As at [11 Jan 2018], 37 cases have been identified in France, all of whom were confirmed (Figure 1 [for Figures, see original URL - Mod. LL]). All cases had gastrointestinal symptoms, and there was no case of bloodstream infection or meningitis. Almost all cases had diarrhea (34 cases), 23 had bloody diarrhea, 26 fever and 13 vomiting. One case had symptom onset in [April 2017] while the remaining cases had onset of symptoms between mid-[August 2017] and [2 Dec 2017]. The cases included 21 girls and 16 boys. The median age was 4 months (range: 2 weeks-9 months). The cases were scattered across 10 different regions of France.

Among 36 cases whose caregivers have been interviewed to date, 18 were hospitalized for their illness, all of whom have recovered at the time of writing this report. A total of 11 cases had underlying medical conditions; these conditions were not associated with an increased risk of salmonellosis. However, they may have increased the likelihood of presentation to a healthcare provider and of diagnostic investigations. In the 3 days before symptom onset, 35 of the 36 cases had consumed infant milk products intended for babies aged 0-6 months manufactured by the same company. As many as 5 different products have been implicated to date: 1 product was associated with 26 cases (MILK-A), 1 product was associated with 5 cases (MILK-B), 1 product was associated with 2 cases (MILK-E) and 2 products were associated with 1 case each (MILK-C and MILK-D). All products were manufactured at the same facility. In 1 confirmed case, exclusive breast-feeding was reported.

No other common foods or drinks were identified among cases. Given the young age of the cases, the majority were still exclusively fed with infant milk products. A variety of types of water (tap and different brands of bottled water) were used to prepare these products. Caregivers were questioned on their practices in relation to the preparation of bottles of milk (e.g. advance preparation, storage, cleaning of equipment) and no issues were identified which would increase the risk of bacterial contamination or bacterial propagation.

Microbiological investigations
------------------------------
WGS of _Salmonella_ isolates has been performed routinely at the French NRC since [April 2017]. DNA extraction, libraries and high-throughput genome sequencing for our cases were carried out at PIBnet, Institut Pasteur, Paris on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Molecular serotyping was done by in-house scripts based on MLST-7, fliC and fliB gene databases. For all 88 _S._ Agona isolates received in the NRC between [1 Jan 2017] and [31 Dec 2017], the filtered paired-end reads were aligned with the Agona SL483 reference genome (GenBank accession number NC_011149) [2]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) filtered alignment using the maximum-likelihood method, and the final tree was visualised as previously described [3]. Raw reads of a representative strain are available under the European Nucleotide Archive number ERR2219379 and under Enterobase name SAL_NA11229AA.
The phylogenetic analysis of all 88 genomes of _S._ Agona human isolates indicated a unique ST13 type with a high number of 9,519 SNPs in total and revealed that outbreak isolates clustered within a maximum distance of 26 SNPs (Figure 2).

Interestingly, distinctive microbiological traits were also found in the outbreak strain: it did not produce H2S and gas in 18 h incubation on Kligler iron agar. _Salmonella_ isolates do typically produce H2S and gas in 18 h incubation on Kligler iron agar. To date, 36 of the 37 confirmed cases belonged to this SNP cluster on WGS. For the remaining case, WGS results are pending but the isolate does not produce H2S and gas after 18 h incubation on Kligler iron agar.

Environmental and product investigations
----------------------------------------
Environmental and product investigations by the company and the Ministry responsible for consumers' affairs are still ongoing. However, epidemiological information strongly suggests products manufactured at one facility as the source of infections. The facility manufactures a wide range of infant and toddler foods. Routine microbiological tests of products undertaken by the facility as part of normal production practices were negative. On [2 Dec 2017], the company voluntarily recalled batches of the 3 initially implicated products (MILKS-A, B, C) [4]. On [10 Dec 2017], after parents of 1 case reported exclusive use of a 4th product (MILK-D), and in light of preliminary results of environmental investigations at the facility, the company recalled all products manufactured at the facility since mid-[February 2017] and for which production was associated with one drying tower at the facility [5,6]. On [13 Dec 2017], 5 further batches omitted from the recall list issued on 10 Dec 2017 were recalled [7]. On [22 Dec 2017], as a precautionary measure, the company voluntarily recalled all products manufactured or processed in the facility since [February 2017] [6].

Potential for international spread and international alerts
-----------------------------------------------------------
As of [8 Jan 2018], trace-forward investigations indicated that recalled products were distributed to 66 countries, including 12 countries in the European Union (EU). An alert was issued on the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) on [4 Dec 2017], and updated as further information on the international distribution network of the products became available [8]. The alert was also issued through the Infosan network operated by the WHO. European public health authorities and microbiologists were alerted about the outbreak on [6 Dec 2017] by SPF via an urgent inquiry for information issued through the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses hosted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

To date, 2 cases in infants who consumed implicated exported products have been identified in EU countries other than France. The isolate from a case in Spain belonged to the outbreak SNP cluster in WGS performed at the NRC (data not shown in Figure 2). The isolate from a case in Greece did not produce H2S or gas after 18 h incubation on Kligler iron agar, and the results of WGS are pending [9].

Control measures in France
--------------------------
In France, multiple media platforms have been used since [2 Dec 2017], to inform parents and caregivers about the outbreak, to advise them not to use the implicated products and to recommend appropriate hygiene practices when preparing infant milk products [5]. All recalled products have been published on the website of the French ministry responsible for consumers' affairs [4-7]. As the initial public alert was issued on a weekend, advice was also given on how to mitigate the risk if alternative products were unavailable over the weekend. In cooperation with the French Society of Paediatrics, advice was issued on alternative infant milk product options [10]. The French Ministry of Health put in place a telephone help service for concerned parents and caregivers. Paediatric and maternity facilities as well as healthcare professionals were also informed.

Discussion
----------
In France, surveillance of _Salmonella_ infections is undertaken by the NRC and SPF. Between 2011 and 2016, _S._ Agona accounted for 2.1 percent of _Salmonella_ isolates identified in infants and received in the NRC, with between 8 and 13 isolates received by the NRC a year. The detection of 8 isolates of _S._ Agona in infants within a period of 8 days alerted the NRC to the outbreak. No increase in the number of _S._ Agona isolates was observed in other age groups. Prompt investigation provided strong epidemiological evidence pointing to infant milk products manufactured by the same company as the source of the outbreak.

This is the 3rd outbreak of salmonellosis associated with infant milk products reported in France [1,11]. Similar outbreaks have also been reported elsewhere [12-16]. A _S._ Agona outbreak affecting 141 confirmed cases occurred in France in 2005 and was associated with 2 different products manufactured within the same facility implicated in the current outbreak [1]. During the 2005 outbreak, samples of the implicated products and environmental samples from the facility yielded isolates with the same PFGE pattern as the clinical isolates. However, only 1 of 176 and 4 of 27 samples from the 2 implicated food products and 6 of 420 environmental samples tested positive for _S._ Agona, suggesting a low level contamination. The production dates of the positive food samples suggested a persistent environmental contamination. The source of the contamination in the facility was not identified. In the current outbreak, the environmental investigations are still ongoing, and at this stage no obvious source of contamination has been identified within the facility.

The number of cases associated with this outbreak is probably underestimated as cases with mild symptoms may not have consulted a healthcare professional or had comprehensive diagnostic investigations (stool sample, culture, identification of serotype, confirmation at the NRC). Despite this possibility, given the wide distribution of products and the small number of reported cases, the level of contamination of products is probably low. The fact that the current outbreak involves the same serotype as the previous outbreak raises the question whether the organism has persisted in the facility for 12 years. The persistence of _S._ Agona in a dry food production environment in the USA, resulting in 2 outbreaks 10 years apart, 1998 and 2008, has been reported before [17]. Comparison of human and environmental isolates from 2005 with isolates from the current outbreak is ongoing to investigate this possibility.

[2] Expanded recall
Date: Sat 13 Jan 2018, 8:23 PM EST,

Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against French dairy group Lactalis by families who say their children were struck down with the infection. Picot and Milumel baby milk are 2 of the company's brands, and were the subject of chaotic international recalls issued in mid-December 2017 after dozens of children fell sick. The company's CEO, Emmanuel Besnier, told French media: "We must take account the scale of this operation: more than 12 million boxes are affected." He added that distributors would no longer have to sort through the produce to find the contaminated powder. "They know that everything has to be removed from the shelves," he said.

Mr. Besnier, scion of the secretive family behind one of the world's biggest dairy groups, promised compensation for all the families affected. He said that the consequences of this health crisis for consumers, including babies under 6 months, were at the forefront of his mind. "It is for us, for me, a great concern," he told the Journal du Dimanche.

So far French officials have reported 35 cases of infants getting salmonellosis from the powder, while one case has been reported in Spain and another is being investigated in Greece. An association representing victims says the authorities are underestimating the number of cases.

Created in 1933 by Besnier's grandfather, Lactalis has become an industry behemoth with annual sales of some 17 billion EU (USD20.6 billion), with products including Galbani ricotta and mozzarella in Italy. With 246 production sites in 47 countries, its list of products also features household names like President butter and Societe roquefort. Two of those brands, Picot and Milumel baby milk, were the subject of chaotic international recalls issued in mid-[December 2017] after dozens of children fell sick.

The scandal deepened this month, in [January 2018] when French investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported that state inspectors had given a clean bill of health to the Lactalis site in Craon, northwest France, in early September 2017. They failed to find the _Salmonella_ bacteria that had been detected by Lactalis's own tests in [August 2017] and [November 2017], which were not reported to the authorities. The company said it was not legally bound to report the contamination.

[From these reports, the number of cases in France has risen in 36 and there are cases likely in Spain and Greece. The 2nd posting implies "hundreds of cases" but these have not been documented nor any more than the 2 cases outside of France. Given the size of the recall and the large number of countries to which the products were sent, it is likely that more cases will be reported.

It is interesting that the outbreak strain of _S._ Agona does not produce hydrogen sulfide, H2S production is a common characteristic of salmonellae and in the developing world can still be used to help diagnosis this infection. Such H2S negative strains are described in the literature and, in fact, may be isolated together with the same serotype having hydrogen sulfide production. Different mutations have been described which were thought to account for the biochemical anomaly. Sakano and colleagues (1) described alteration to the stop codon for the phsA gene in _S._ Typhimurium and _S._ Infantis. Other investigators have reported other phsA mutations associated with the lack of H2S production in serotype Paratyphi A (2) and serotype Aderdeen (3). Another group reported a strain of _S._ Kentucky with a frameshift mutation in the moacC gene. Both of these defects can result in the lack of hydrogen sulfide production and Sakano (1) postulated that this might lead to better gut growth and colonization.
