Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Lipetsk, Voronej, Tambov and
Ryazan regions
-----------------------------------------------
As of 9 Mar 2007, 585 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) have been registered in 4 districts of the Central Federal
Region of the Russian Federation. These comprise 243 cases in the
Lipetsk region, 197 cases in the Voronej region, 75 in the Tambov
region and 70 cases in the Ryazan region.
The increase in morbidity ceased in the Voronej and Lipetsk regions
during the period from December 2006 to February 2007. There have
been no new cases registered in the Voronej region since 15 Feb 2007
or in the Lipetsk region since 23 Feb 2007.
(1) The Office of Rospotrebnadzor has supplied the following
statistics for HFRS cases in the Tambov region for the period up to 9
Mar 2007: A total of 75 cases were registered in 16 districts, 41
settlements and in the cities of Tambov, Michurinsk, Kotovsk, and
Jerdevke. During the past 10 days, 4 new cases have been registered.
In 63 out of the 75 cases (84 percent), the diagnosis was confirmed

on 16 Feb, in the Pichaevskiy district on 18 Feb, and in the
Bondarskoy district on 18 & 23 Feb 2007 and on 3 Mar 2007. Thus,
during the past 26 days, only 5 cases of HFRS have been registered.
(2) 70 cases of HFRS in the Ryazan region have been recorded in 16
districts, 35 settlements and the city of Ryazan. All the cases were

[According to the detailed report of the Rospotrebnadzor Office, the

is nearly normal. There have been no new cases in the Voronej and
Lipetsk regions since the end of February 2007. Four new cases have
been registered in the Tambov region during the last 10 days, and 3

HFRS Outbreak in Lipetsk Region predicted
-----------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists [predict] a new outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with
kidney syndrome (HFRS) in the Lipetsk Region this spring 2007,
regional chief epidemiologist Lyudmial Kirillov told ITAR-TASS on Fri
2 Mar 2007. She said that the outbreak was related to the awakening
of rodents that spread the disease.
By the beginning of March 2007, 244 human cases of this dangerous
disease have been registered in the Lipetsk region. 27 people,
including 3 children, have been hospitalized. Most of the HFRS cases,
176, occurred in the Dorinsky district.
Specialists are of the opinion that the HFRS outbreak in central
Russia was caused by the unusually warm winter. The causative virus
dies in 30-degree frost. The abundance of food on fields, which long
remained uncovered by the snow, also helped an increase in the rodent
population.
Tests have shown that every 3rd field mouse carries the virus, which
can be transmitted to humans via air. However, even affected humans
are not spreaders of infection.
The Lipetsk regional administration has allocated additional funds
for a rodent extermination program.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of
clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan,
Dobrava-Belgrade, Seoul, and Puumala. Puumala virus is likely to be
the virus causing HFRS in the Central Federal Region of Russia.
A picture of the reservoir rodent host (_Apodemus agrarius_) and
other information is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/hfrs.htm>.
ProMED-mail does not routinely report outbreaks of HFRS in endemic
regions of Russia and middle Asia, but recent benign weather
conditions may be exacerbating the disease situation.
