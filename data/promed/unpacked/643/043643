Vaccination of foxes and jackals -- 2014 (official announcement)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan and end April 2014, the annual vaccination of foxes and jackals will be performed. The continuous project is commonly undertaken by the State Veterinary Services and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

The baits, which include rabies vaccine, are brown; their size and form resemble match-boxes. They will be dispersed by various aircrafts. Though absolutely non-dangerous, the baits should not be touched and children should avoid collecting them. In case they are touched, hands should be thoroughly washed and contact undertaken (2 phone numbers given).

The project covers the entire surface of the State of Israel.

Israel has become infested with jackals from the Galilee to the Negev because of the food and carcasses in landfills.

The problem is especially acute in the Judean Hills both north and south of Jerusalem, and between Haifa and Tel Aviv, including in Yarkon Park in north Tel Aviv. Elsewhere, farmers say packs of jackals have been preying on livestock and wildlife.

The Israel Nature and Parks Authority began taking steps to combat the growing jackal population years ago, but a new report says these efforts have had little effect. The authority's Alon Reichman, an ecologist specializing in predators, based the study on the jackal population in the north of the country. The report, which covers the years between 2005 and 2010, includes data gathered by observation and by tracking devices fitted on jackals.

In recent years the Israel Nature and Parks Authority has killed more than 1000 jackals annually, though the report notes that this has done little to decrease the overall population. The population in the Golan Heights has remained high relative to the size of the area despite a 5-year cull.

"The ineffective population control methods have failed to affect the jackals' survivability rates," the Nature and Parks Authority said in its report. "Contrary to expectations, there has been no difference in survivability among jackals in the southern Golan Heights, where many control methods have been implemented, compared to the central Golan Heights, where only slight efforts have been undertaken."

Higher numbers than in Europe, Asia and Africa
----------------------------------------------
The abundance of food in the Golan appears to be attracting ever more jackals. According to the Nature and Parks Authority, there are 12 to 24 jackals per square kilometer [0.4 sq mi] in certain areas. In other countries in southeast Europe, Asia, and Africa where the animal abounds, a typical number is 1 to 4. According to the parks authority, landfills and cattle pens attract the highest number of jackals.

Waste-management efforts have been stepped up in recent years, especially in the Golan Heights, where the goal is to better dispose of carcasses. Still, the jackal population has remained robust there, while in the Galilee similar efforts have slightly decreased the jackal and fox population.

Jackals can spread rabies among humans. In recent years, the Nature and Parks Authority has spread oral rabies vaccinations for foxes and jackals, limiting the number of rabies cases. The animals have also caused problems for crop growers.

"Jackals cause serious damage to agriculture, and they chew through irrigation pipes and irrigation-system wires," said Amitzur Budlow, a parks authority inspector in the Jordan Valley.

Jackals also prey on cattle in pastures and barns, Budlow said. "They've greatly multiplied, and every deer they eat causes lots of damage," he said.

[Until 2004, rabies was sylvatic in Israel, foxes being the vectors. The disease underwent a drastic change following the statewide implementation of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of foxes and jackals. Since 2004, the project covers most parts of the country, practically eliminating cases in foxes (see map at http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2004-2011.html). During the (just started) 2014 operation, the dispersion rate will be 16-20 baits per square km.

Since 2009, a surge-up of rabies has been reported from north-eastern Israel on the border with Syria, in spite of the oral vaccination. This has been found to be caused by the penetration of rabid stray dogs from Syria, infecting local pets (if unvaccinated) and susceptible domestic ungulates, particularly cattle, with the canine virus. For more details, see ref. 1 below and maps at http://tinyurl.com/pvfwqns and http://tinyurl.com/pascu29.

The number of lab-confirmed rabies cases in various animal species in Israel during 2013 (1 Jan to 31 Dec) is included in the following table, compared to the years 2002-2012.

No human case of rabies has been recorded in Israel since 2003.

According to OIE data, during 2012 there were one reported human case in Jordan and 2 in Syria; Lebanon has not submitted reports since 2008.
