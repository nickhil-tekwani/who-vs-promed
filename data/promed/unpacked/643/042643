Recently, the Netherlands (1996) and Denmark (1997) have reported large
increases in numbers of cases of whooping cough, for which the cause r
emains unclear. It is well recognised that epidemics of pertussis occur
every three to five years, but there is also evidence that the circulating
strains of _Bordetella pertussis_ have changed in recent decades. The last
significant epidemic of whooping cough in Switzerland occurred during the
second half of 1994. Since then the incidence of whooping cough in
Switzerland has fallen to the pre-epidemic level.
Cases of whooping cough have been notified to the Swiss reporting system
"Sentinella" since 1991. The system is a joint project of the Swiss Federal
Office of Public Health (SFOPH) and the "Fakult√§re Instanz fur
Allgemeinmedizin" (FIAM) of the University of Berne, funded by public money.
Participation is voluntary and unpaid. Since June 1986, between 120 and 220
doctors (with private practice) throughout the country have notified weekly
morbidity data to the SFOPH. This non-randomised sample of participants
includes general practitioners, specialists in internal medicine, and
paediatricians. In 1996 they comprised 3.7% of all doctors in these
specialties registered in Switzerland. Cases are defined as patients either
with a cough characterised by acute episodes for at least 14 days, a barking
cough or vomiting after a coughing fit, or following contact with another
case of whooping cough. Since 1994, testing for _B. pertussis_ by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal secretions has been available free of
charge to all cases notified to Sentinella. PCR results available for 82% of
clinical cases reported between 1994 and 1996 were positive in 26% of cases.
During 1997, _B. pertussis_ infection was confirmed in 27% of nasopharyngeal
specimens available.
The annual incidence of whooping cough in Switzerland was around 70 cases
per 100,000 population in 1992 and 1993. In the following two years the
incidence was higher: 370/100,000 in 1994 and 280/100,000 in 1995. The
overall rise in the number of reported cases was attributable to a large
increase of cases between July and October. Extrapolation from the
Sentinella data to the entire population of Switzerland yields an estimated
40 000 clinical cases of pertussis during the epidemic years 1994 and 1995.
The age groups most affected were infants and children under 6 years of age.
In 1996 the incidence was 165/100,000 representing an estimated 11,500
cases. In comparison with 1996, no increase in cases was seen in the first
10 months of 1997. Given the cyclical nature of whooping cough, however,
increases may be observed in future years.
In 1990, 90% of children in Switzerland between 27 and 36 months had
received at least three doses of pertussis vaccine. In view of the epidemic
potential of _B. pertussis_ it is important to maintain a high vaccination
coverage. The recommendations given in the Swiss vaccination schedule are
for primary vaccination (three injections of DTP or DTPa) for infants at 2,
4, and 6 months. In addition, booster doses (each time one injection) are
recommended for young children (15 to 24 months; DTP or DTPa) and preschool
(4 to 7 years, DTPa).
The SFOPH will carefully follow the evolution of pertussis infections in
neighbouring countries as well as monitoring their progress in Switzerland
by means of the Sentinella surveillance system.

periods of higher incidence of pertussis was 6 years of age or younger,
