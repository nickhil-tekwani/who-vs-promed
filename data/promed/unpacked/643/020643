Erin Staples, MD, Susan Hills, MBBS. Notes from the Field: Concurrent Outbreaks of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus and West Nile Virus Disease -- Arizona, 2015.

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses that can cause outbreaks of acute febrile illness and neurologic disease. Both viruses are endemic throughout much of the United States and have the same _Culex_ species mosquito vectors and avian hosts; however, since WNV was 1st identified in the United States in 1999, SLEV disease incidence has been substantially lower than WNV disease incidence, and no outbreaks involving the 2 viruses circulating in the same location at the same time have been identified. Currently, there is a commercially available laboratory test for diagnosis of acute WNV infection, but there is no commercially available SLEV test, and all SLEV testing must be performed at public health laboratories. In addition, because antibodies against SLEV and WNV can cross-react on standard diagnostic tests, confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing at public health laboratories is usually required to determine the flavivirus species. This report describes the 1st known concurrent outbreaks of SLEV and WNV disease in the United States.

During 2010-2014, 537 WNV disease cases and only one SLEV disease case were reported to the Arizona Department of Health Services. However, during 2015, by the end of July, SLEV infection had been confirmed in 7 ill Arizona residents. In addition, the Maricopa County Vector Control Division identified 60 pools of _Culex tarsalis_ or _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes that tested positive for SLEV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and 97 pools that tested positive for WNV RNA. An investigation was initiated to ascertain the magnitude and describe the epidemiology of the outbreaks. Cases were defined according to national surveillance case definitions. If the patient had immunoglobulin M antibody against both WNV and SLEV, and insufficient sample or inconclusive results on neutralizing antibody testing, the case was classified as an unspecified flavivirus infection.

As of 24 Nov 2015, a total of 117 cases of flavivirus disease had been reported to the Arizona Department of Health Services, including 75 WNV, 19 SLEV, and 23 unspecified flavivirus disease cases. Laboratory testing is ongoing, and some cases will likely be reclassified. Among all cases, 103 (88 percent) occurred from July through September [2015]. Eight (53 percent) of 15 counties reported cases; 45 (60 percent) WNV and 18 (95 percent) SLEV disease cases were reported from Maricopa County. Overall, 77 (66 percent) patients were aged 50 years and older (median = 54 years, range = 21-89 years), and 61 (52 percent) were male. 79 (68 percent) patients had neuroinvasive disease (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis), including 47 (63 percent) with WNV infection, 17 (89 percent) with SLEV infection, and 15 (65 percent) with unspecified flavivirus infection. Among all 117 cases, 86 (74 percent) patients were hospitalized, and 5 (4 percent) died.

This is the 1st known outbreak of concurrent WNV and SLEV disease. Enhanced clinical and laboratory surveillance activities in Arizona will continue through the end of the arboviral transmission season in late November [2015] to characterize the outbreak. WNV and SLEV disease cases will be compared to better understand differences in the epidemiology and outcomes of these diseases. Because of the similarity in clinical presentation for WNV and SLEV disease cases, cross reactivity between WNV and SLEV antibodies, and the lack of availability of a commercial SLEV test, SLEV disease cases could be incorrectly diagnosed as WNV disease cases or remain undetected if clinicians only request WNV testing and no confirmatory testing is conducted. Health care providers should consider both WNV and SLEV infections in the differential diagnosis of cases of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and obtain appropriate cerebrospinal fluid, serum specimens, or both for laboratory testing. Confirmatory testing at state health departments or CDC will be required to distinguish these flavivirus infections. When feasible, vector control programs should test mosquitoes for SLEV in addition to WNV. Clinical management for both diseases involves supportive care. Because human vaccines against domestic arboviruses are not available, prevention of arboviral infection depends on local vector control, community, and household efforts to reduce vector populations (e.g., removal of standing water), and individual efforts to decrease exposure to mosquitoes (e.g., applying mosquito repellant and eliminating mosquito breeding sites).

[A previous report of this concurrent WNV and SLEV outbreak in Arizona was posted on 21 Aug 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150821.3594184). However, the above report covers a broader range of dates, increasing case numbers, and provides considerably more detail.

These are the 1st cases of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection in Arizona that ProMED-mail has posted since 2003, which were also in Maricopa County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20031015.2601). Biologically, it is not surprising that both West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses are being transmitted in Arizona. The same species of _Culex_ mosquitoes are vectors of both viruses.

When West Nile virus 1st arrived in the USA in 1999, it was speculated that it would not become established in areas endemic for St. Louis encephalitis virus in the USA because they are antigenically very similar, being in the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses, and wild bird hosts would already be immune. This speculation proved not to be the case, and the current outbreak in Arizona further illustrates that. Although the southwestern states of the USA are experiencing a drought, it is obviously not so severe in Arizona that vector mosquito populations have decreased enough to prevent virus transmission. Since clinical disease represents a small fraction of individuals who are infected with either virus, there are almost certainly many more infected people than are reported above.
