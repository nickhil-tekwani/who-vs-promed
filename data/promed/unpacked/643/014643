Boende: Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak suspected
--------------------------------------------------
The WHO sub-office based in Mbandaka (Equateur province) reported, on
2 Jun 2008, a worrying trend of reported cases of suspected viral
hemorrhagic fever (VHF) at the General Referral Hospital (HGR) Boende,
in Tshuapa district [see ProMED-mail post Ebola hemorrhagic fever -
Congo DR: susp., corr. 20080604.1789].

Indeed, according to the weekly report of activities "Action Health
Crisis in DR Congo," from 23 May to 13 Jun 2008, 4 suspected cases
were recorded, all fatal. The 4th case, which was followed in
isolation, died on the night of 12-13 Jun 2008, bringing the fatality
rate to 100 percent. The report says that all these cases come from
the health zone of Boende. Of the 4 cases, 2 are in the age group of
less than 5 years, all male, while the 2 others are women 18-25 years old.

The report also stresses that WHO has provided technical, financial,
and logistical support and facilitated the transport of teams of
experts from Kinshasa, and other parts of Mbandaka, capital of
Equateur province, to reach Boende, located 444 km (276 mi) east of
Mbandaka. The report also notes that WHO has provided basic kits and
3 other essential medicines at the hospital to improve Boende's care
for the sick, and personal protection material.

Samples were taken and sent to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention)-Atlanta, USA, lab but the results are not yet known.
Other partners such as UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund),
Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-B), and ECHO (European
Commission Humanitarian Aid) have also given their support to monitor
the suspected viral hemorrhagic fever in Boende.
