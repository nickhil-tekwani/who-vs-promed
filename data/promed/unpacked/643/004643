The Mexican authority regulating fisheries (INAPESCA) reported that they are conducting studies to prevent the propagation of a pathogen of oysters in Sonora and Sinaloa states.

Ongoing research is underway assessing the impact of perkinsosis to avoid its proliferation, as it may affect the growth and maturation of mollusks, and even cause them to die. The upcoming study results will allow the protection and conservation of the native oyster, producing biosafety protocols that will enable the recovery the resource and the livelihoods that depend upon it. Oyster culture is of social and cultural importance in the region.

Preliminary results of the investigations carried out indicate that perkinsosis is present in [oyster producing] areas of Sonora and Sinaloa states. Specialists from the Scientific Research Center of Ensenada (Baja California) are collaborating with INAPESCA by analyzing samples from 6 coastal lagoons in Sinaloa and attempting to culture the pathogen to be able to carry out experimental studies.

The studies include measuring environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels of the mollusk habitat, and, among other things, they will try to identify the cause of mortality and likely inhibitors of the parasite.

[_Perkinsus_ spp. are protozoans widespread in mollusks around the world. It is not clear what species is involved, but _Perkinsus marinus_ is the one prevalent in mollusks from the gulf of California. _P. marinus_ is a prevalent pathogen of oysters, causing massive mortality in oyster populations. The disease it causes is known as "Dermo" (or "Perkinsosis").

[The parasite is most prevalent on the East & Gulf coasts of the USA.
