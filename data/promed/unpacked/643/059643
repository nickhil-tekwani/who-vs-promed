An extremely dangerous and possibly fatal horse disease is spreading in West Tennessee. "It's called equine infectious anemia, or EIA, and is something we take seriously," Corinne Gould said.

The state veterinarian announced on Thursday [30 Apr 2015] that 4 cases of the illness, also known as Coggins, have been reported at 3 different locations in Henderson County.

"It's like HIV for humans," Tina Wooley with R&J Feed Supply said. "It completely shuts down the horse's immune system."

Experts say a horse should be tested for Coggins every year, typically in spring. The state requires any horse leaving its stable to test negative for Coggins before they travel. If a horse tests positive, the owner has only 2 options. "They either have to put the horse down, or they have to put them in quarantine," Gould said.

Experts say Coggins is spread through insect bites and that mosquitoes and horse flies are the typical transmitters. "If a fly bites a horse that's contagious, then bites the horse I'm carrying, his chances are a lot higher," Wooley said. State officials say to practice high standards of fly control to prevent that from happening.

Readers are strongly encouraged to see the APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) information on equine infectious anemia (EIA) at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_equine_infectious_anemia.pdf.

When horses are exposed to equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), they may develop severe, acute signs of disease and die within 2 to 3 weeks. This form of the disease is the most damaging and the most difficult to diagnose because the signs appear rapidly, and often only an elevated body temperature is noted. 1/5 of a teaspoon or 1 mL of blood from a horse with acute EIA contains enough virus to infect one million horses.

The clinical signs of the acute form of EIA are nonspecific; in mild cases, the initial fever may be short lived (often less than 24 hours). As a result, horse owners and veterinarians may not observe this initial sign when a horse is infected with EIAV. These infected horses often recover and continue to move freely in the population. The 1st indication that a horse was exposed to, and infected with, EIAV may well be a positive result on a routine annual test.

If the horse survives this 1st acute bout, it may develop a recurring clinical disease with these signs:
- fever: an infected horse's temperature may rise suddenly to about 105 F [40.6 C] or, rarely, as high as 108 F [42.2 C]. Then it may drop back to normal for an indeterminate period until the onset of another episode.
- petechial hemorrhages: minute blood-colored spots appear on the mucous membranes.
- depression: the horse appears more or less dejected (head hangs low) and generally listless.
- weight loss: the horse may refuse feed or may eat an inordinate amount but still continues on an obvious decline from normal weight.
- dependent edema: the horse may develop swelling, which is evidence of fluid collecting under the skin in the legs and under the chest and other underbody surfaces.
- anemia: the horse's blood may experience a marked drop in its red corpuscle count and appear thin and watery. The animal may also have an irregular heartbeat, and a jugular pulse may become evident.

The horse with chronic EIA is the classic "swamper" who has lost condition, is lethargic and anorexic, has a low hematocrit, and demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, especially coincident with fever induced by EIAV. One mL of blood from a chronic case during a feverish episode contains enough virus to infect 10 000 horses.

By far the majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. They survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAV in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only one horsefly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAV from this horse. All horses infected with EIAV are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute due to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

EIA is considered a classic bloodborne infection. People have played an important role in EIAV transmission over the years by using blood-contaminated materials on different horses. The EIAV most frequently is transmitted between horses in close proximity by large biting insects, such as horseflies and deerflies. The bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by the horse, which often results in an interruption of the blood-feeding. When interrupted, the fly is motivated to complete the feeding as soon as possible. It then attacks the same or a 2nd host and feeds to repletion. In this manner, any infective material from the blood of the 1st host that is present on the mouthparts of the insect can be mechanically transmitted to the 2nd host. Insect transmission of EIAV is dependent on the number and habits of the insects, the density of the horse population, the number of times the insect bites the same and other horses, the amount of blood transferred between horses, and the level of virus in the blood of the infected horse from which the initial blood meal was obtained. The rate of transmission cannot be predicted accurately because of these variables.

Controlling the spread of EIAV involves minimizing or eliminating contact of horses with the secretions, excretions, and blood of EIAV-infected horses. This has been carried out in most areas of the world by testing and segregating test-positive horses from those with negative test results. Once the reservoirs of EIAV are identified, separated, and maintained a safe distance from the other horses, the transmission of EIAV is broken. Until all horses are tested, one must assume that each horse is a potential reservoir of EIAV and take precautions to see that his or her horses commingle only with horses with impeccable backgrounds (that is, they came from farms with only test-negative horses and have never been exposed to test-positive horses).
