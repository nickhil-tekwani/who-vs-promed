[1] Johnson & Johnson vaccine
Date: Fri 29 Jan 2021

The 1st one-shot COVID-19 vaccine provides good protection against the illness, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) reported in a key study released Friday [29 Jan 2021], offering the world a potentially important new tool as it races to stay ahead of the rapidly mutating virus. The pharmaceutical giant's preliminary findings suggest the single-dose option may not be as strong as Pfizer's or Moderna's 2-dose formula and was markedly weaker against a worrisome mutated version of the virus in South Africa [B.1.351].

But amid a rocky start to vaccinations worldwide, that may be an acceptable trade-off to get more people inoculated faster with an easier-to-handle shot that, unlike rival vaccines that must be kept frozen, can last months in the refrigerator. "Frankly, simple is beautiful," said Dr. Matt Hepburn, the US government's COVID-19 vaccine response leader.

J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization in the USA within a week. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the USA by June [2021] -- and a billion doses globally by year's end -- but declined to say how much could be ready if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives the green light. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions. The shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require 2 doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Nearly 23 million Americans have received a 1st dose of Pfizer or Moderna shots since vaccinations began last month [December 2020], but fewer than 5 million have gotten their 2nd dose.

Also Friday [29 Jan 2021], regulators cleared a 3rd option, AstraZeneca's vaccine, for use throughout the European Union. The decision came amid criticism that the 27-nation bloc is not moving fast enough, as well as concern that there [are] not enough data to tell how well the vaccine works in older people.

J&J studied its one-dose option in 44 000 people in the USA, Latin America and South Africa. Interim results found the shot 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, and much more protective -- 85% -- against the most serious symptoms. There were no serious side effects. "Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile," Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press.

The vaccine worked better in the USA -- 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 -- compared with 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, where a more contagious mutant virus is spreading. The reduced protection against that mutation is "really a wake-up call," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease expert. The more the virus is allowed to spread, the more opportunities it has to mutate. Vaccine makers are looking into how to alter their shots if necessary.

For now, the findings are an incentive "to vaccinate as many people as we possibly can," Fauci stressed. Data [are] mixed on how well other vaccines being used around the world work, but the Pfizer and Moderna shots were 95% protective in large US studies.

It's not fair to compare studies done before the record surges of recent months and discovery of new mutants -- they might not turn out the same today, cautioned Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. The J&J protection is "good enough to help attack a pandemic," Goodman said. "The advantage of having more vaccine, in a single shot, would be significant."

Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination -- about the time when, if participants were getting a 2-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died, regardless of whether they were exposed to the original virus or "these particularly nasty variants," Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness.

All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. But they're made in very different ways.

J&J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. It's the same technology the company used in making a successful Ebola vaccine.

That's similar to how AstraZeneca's 2-dose vaccine is made, although it's not clear exactly how well that one works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested 2 doses are about 70% effective. An ongoing US study may provide more information.

Still another vaccine is in final testing: Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89% effective in a British study and that it also seems to work -- though not as well -- against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the USA and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers [see section [2] below].

[2] Novavax vaccine

https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/novavax-covid-vax-effective-except-against-south-africa-strain/


The vaccine candidate from Novavax is almost 90% effective against COVID-19 -- but just under 50% effective against the new South African variant of the virus, the company announced Thursday [28 Jan 2021]. A UK study found the Novavax vaccine was 89.3% effective in protecting test participants from developing COVID-19 symptoms, the company said in a press statement.

The good results came despite the new, highly transmittable coronavirus variant now circulating in the UK. "These are spectacular results, and we are very pleased to have helped Novavax with the development of this vaccine," said Stanley C. Erck, who heads the Maryland-based company. "The efficacy shown against the emerging variants is also extremely encouraging."

But more preliminary results from a small, separate study in South Africa -- where a different mutation of the coronavirus is wreaking havoc -- showed the Novavax shot was only 49.4% effective, meaning just over half the test subjects got the jab and then still got sick.

Both the in-use Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have been found to be more than 90% effective against COVID-19.

As of Thursday [28 Jan 2021], New York has 22 cases of the new UK coronavirus strain. The first 2 cases of the South African strain in the USA were just found in South Carolina, officials announced Thursday [28 Jan 2021].

[Moderna] has said it is developing a vaccine booster to fight off the strain first identified in South Africa.

[Both the Johnson & Johnson (original press release at https://bit.ly/3pxJtEd) and Novavax (press release at https://bit.ly/36sqPWB) vaccines will increase vaccine availability, which will help relieve the current shortage. While strain B.1.351 still presents a problem, research appears to be underway to address that through development of new booster shots that will be active against the new variants. There is also the AstraZeneca vaccine, with a design similar to Johnson & Johnson's and reportedly 70% protective after 2 doses. Although the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines provide greater protection than these 3 vaccines, all are needed to stop this pandemic. The faster virus transmission is stopped, the less opportunity the virus has to mutate, facilitating protection with the current vaccines. - Mod.LK]

[3] Mekong Basin outbreaks
[A1] Viet Nam

The latest COVID-19 outbreak in northern Viet Nam has dented tourism firms' hopes for a revenue surge during the upcoming Tet, the nation's longest holiday. Nguyen Cong Hoan, deputy director of Hanoi Redtours, said his company stands ready to suspend services as soon as authorities order it, especially to places like Ha Long Bay, a tourist hotspot located in the northern province of Quang Ninh. A total of 15 new COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the province since Thursday [28 Jan 2021].

"Although we are not pessimistic about the 2021 outlook, the outbreak surely has put more roadblocks on our recovery journey this year [2021] after experiencing major challenges caused by the pandemic last year [2020]," he told VnExpress International. Other tourism firms have canceled or made changes to their tours to ensure safety and keep the business running after Viet Nam recorded over 149 new COVID-19 patients within 2 days, just 2 weeks before the year's biggest festival.

Leading tour company Vietravel has made plans to relocate 101 tours to Quang Ninh in the next 3 weeks to other destinations in the Central Highlands and the Mekong Delta. The company has also offered to refund customers with other tour options in the upcoming months.

Nguyen Nguyet Van Khanh, deputy director of the company's marketing department, said that the latest outbreak will have a major impact on the tourism industry, as many people were making travel plans after Viet Nam went nearly 2 months without a community transmission.

Vietrantour has canceled 12 tours with over 200 customers in Ha Long, Quang Ninh and Cat Ba, Hai Phong City. Hanoitourist is relocating its Ha Long tours to other destinations like the northern province of Ninh Binh. Le Hong Thai, deputy director of Hanoitourist, said many southern customers have called to know if they could cancel or reschedule their tours to the north. "Tourism companies will be hurt, but we support the administration of local authorities to quickly contain the outbreak."

Viet Nam's tourism industry went through one of the most difficult years in its history last year [2020] when the COVID-19 pandemic slashed the number of foreign arrivals by nearly 79% to 3.8 million. Industry revenues plunged nearly 56% to VND 17.9 trillion (USD 771.55 million) as flights were cancelled and people became reluctant in making travel plans due to fear of contracting the novel coronavirus.

Industry insiders say that many difficulties will likely linger this year [2021], especially with the new outbreak affecting the northern localities of Hai Duong, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Bac Ninh, and Hanoi. Hoan of Hanoi Redtours, which saw revenues plunge 80% last year [2020], estimates it would take around 3 years for the industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels.

Municipal authorities in several northern localities have suspended all crowd-gathering events as government officials warned that the new COVID-19 variant has a faster contagion rate.

Viet Nam reported 53 new COVID-19 community transmissions, all related to the latest outbreak, and one imported case Friday [29 Jan 2021] evening. One of the new cases is a 2-year-old girl in the northern province of Bac Ninh. Patient 1652 is the daughter of Patient 1565, whose address is in Hai Duong Province. The mother's case is related to the COVID-19 hotspot in the province's Chi Linh Town.

Patient 1653, a 20-year-old man from Chi Linh Town in Hai Duong Province, is a temporary resident of Hanoi's Cau Giay District.

The cases of patients 1654-1656, residents of Dong Trieu Town in Quang Ninh Province, are related to the outbreak in Chi Linh Town.

Hai Duong Province, currently the biggest COVID-19 hotspot in the country, recorded 47 transmissions on Friday [29 Jan 2021] evening, all related to its Chi Linh Town.

Meanwhile, the southern province of Dong Nai has recorded one imported case. Patient 1705, a 31-year-old man who lives in District 10, HCMC, landed 27 Jan 2021 at the Tan Son Nhat Airport from Japan. He was quarantined on arrival. Tests showed the next day that he was positive for the novel coronavirus.

Viet Nam's current COVID-19 tally of 1705 includes 149 community transmissions recorded since Thursday [28 Jan 2021].

Chi Linh Town, with around 220 000 residents, has been placed under a lockdown while other parts of Hai Duong have applied social distancing measures at different levels, depending on the seriousness of the situation.

Thai police arrested 109 people on Tuesday [26 Jan 2021] after raiding an illegal bar party on the island of Koh Phangnan. Of the arrests, 89 were visitors from 10 foreign countries, including the USA, Britain, Switzerland and Denmark, according to the Associated Press.

The partygoers received suspended one-month jail terms, which will not apply if they exhibit "good behavior" for one year, and USD 130 fines via videoconferenced hearings on Thursday [28 Jan 2021]. According to CNN, 10 Americans were in attendance, and all of the partygoers tested negative for the coronavirus after arrest.

The business, ThreeSixtyBar, had promoted the party on its social media channels as a 5-year birthday party for itself, and sold tickets for the event online, which is how police discovered the illegal party, according to the Bangkok Post.

Thailand currently allows foreigners, including Americans, to enter the country if they quarantine in approved lodging for 14 days after displaying negative results from a coronavirus test taken no more than 72 hours prior. Due to those strict entry requirements, most foreigners currently in Thailand are likely long-term visitors who will need to meet their home countries' testing and quarantine requirements to leave.

"They are stranded tourists who can't leave Thailand due to COVID," Koh Phangnan Police Col. Panya Nirattimanon told CNN. "They may think it is OK to gather in large groups and I think they may want to relax and have some fun."

Thailand has been under a state of emergency since March [2020] because of the coronavirus, which bans gatherings. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been rising in the country since mid-December [2020], which is when Thailand reopened to travelers with strict health protocols in place for arrivals. Koh Phangnan is a popular backpacking island known for its raucous full-moon parties, which have not been permitted since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

The bar apologized on Facebook following the raid, saying the owner believed the party was permitted because of low case counts in the area. The post called the event a "terrible mistake."

Over 20 Thai individuals were also arrested in the raid, including the bar owner and bartenders, who received the same fines as well as 2-year prison sentences (also suspended for one year, pending good behavior) for violating national health protocols.

[These articles were included to point out that the economic ramifications of the pandemic are being felt even in countries with much lower transmission levels, as well as the challenges these countries are facing. Viet Nam was doing well, and hopefully will be able to "cluster bust" the ongoing outbreak. Thailand has been challenged for the past month, also attempting cluster control, with challenges seen with illegal border crossings (see COVID-19 update (548): mutations, PEGs, Thailand, WHO, global 20201222.8037438), as well as with young, partygoing longer-term tourists as described above. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (173 586), Brazil (58 691), Spain (38 118), and the UK (29 079) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 581 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 28 Jan to late 29 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, UK, France (22 858), Russia (19 238), Mexico (16 374), Indonesia (13 802), Italy (13 563), Portugal (13 200), Germany (12 848), India (12 516), Peru (11 905), and Colombia (10 058). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 12.9% decrease in daily reported cases and a 4.3% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are just under 600 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 48 hours and over 102.62 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.21 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 4 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
