LP, who is 9 years old now, came down with a polio-like illness in 2014 -- one of many kids to contract what the news media called a mystery illness, with an epicenter in Colorado. For this little girl, symptoms started with a fever, then a cough, followed by a weakness in her arms. She and her mother, SP, who's also a pediatrician, tell Colorado Matters about experiencing the illness.

Now, University of Colorado researchers along with colleagues around the world, say they've identified the likely cause. Acute Flaccid Myelitis is a neurological illness that can cause paralysis, facial drooping and muscle weakness. In 2014 there were more than 100 cases in 34 states, including 12 cases treated at Children's Hospital Colorado. Now it appears to be surging again. The CDC announced this year [2018] it's seen 50 cases in 24 states.

Dr. Kevin Messacar with Children's Hospital tells Colorado Matters only a few cases have shown up in Colorado so far this time. All of the Colorado children with the disease eventually got better, but most still have some residual weakness in their arms and legs. "As a scientific community we need to take it seriously because of the long-term consequences and potentially disabling consequences of it," he said.

["Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is one of a number of conditions that can result in neurologic illness with limb weakness. Such illnesses can result from a variety of causes, including viral infections, environmental toxins, genetic disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic disorder caused by an abnormal immune response that attacks the body's nerves. Oftentimes, however, despite extensive laboratory testing, a cause for AFM is unable to be identified.

Symptoms
--------
"Most patients will have sudden onset of limb weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes. Some patients, in addition to the limb weakness, will experience facial droop/weakness, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, or difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech. Numbness or tingling is rare in patients with AFM, though some patients have pain in their arms or legs. Some patients with AFM may be unable to urinate. The most severe symptom of AFM is respiratory failure that can happen when the muscles involved with breathing become weak. This can require urgent ventilator support (breathing machines).

Diagnosis
---------
"A doctor can tell the difference between AFM and other diseases with a careful examination of the nervous system, looking at the location of the weakness, muscle tone, and reflexes, to help differentiate such patients from patients with other forms of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be very helpful in diagnosing cases of AFM.

"Testing nerve response can also be helpful in supporting a diagnosis of AFM; it is important that the tests are performed at the appropriate time (e.g., 7-10 days after onset of weakness) to be helpful. Finally, by testing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord), clinicians can look for findings suggestive of AFM. All of these findings put together help a clinician make a diagnosis of AFM.

Viruses associated with AFM
---------------------------
"Conditions like acute flaccid myelitis can be caused by a variety of agents, including several viruses:
- enteroviruses (polio and non-polio),
- West Nile virus (WNV) and viruses in the same family as WNV, specifically Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus, and
- adenoviruses. "
