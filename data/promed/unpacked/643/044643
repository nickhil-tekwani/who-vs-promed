[Previous outbreaks in nearby Greece have involved humans as well as
horses and sentinel chickens. Some of these reports from Macedonia
occurred in September and October 2011, but 2 of the cases occurred in
November 2011, involving both chickens and horses. The reason for
reports this late in the year, after killing frosts should have
occurred, may lie in the fact that they were identified by serology,
not clinical signs, as part of a surveillance effort. However, further
details of any clinical reports of disease would be very useful. -
