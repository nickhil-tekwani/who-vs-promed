Mango growers fear a 50 percent drop in production this year [2009]
in Rajshahi region due to an irregular weather pattern.

Mango growers in Chapainawabganj [a district of Raishahi division]
have their own words for explaining the situation: "We are cursed
with Moha this year," said a 55-year-old mango grower at Kansat.
Horticulturists explained that Moha is a disease that appears in the
form of mould on leaves. It happens especially during foggy and moist
summer nights. Mango growers are worried in Rajshahi, as the numbers
of trees bearing fruit are inadequate.

[Quick decline syndrome of mango was reported from this area earlier
in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090504.1669). However, quick decline does
not include mould on leaves, as described above. The symptoms
reported here appear to be a kind of mildew, perhaps powdery mildew,
which has also been reported from northern India during the current
season (ProMED-mail post 20090326.1177).

Powdery mildew of mango is caused by the fungus _Oidium mangiferae_
and is one of the most serious diseases of the crop, affecting almost
all varieties to varying degrees. The disease is reported to cause
yield losses of up to 80 percent on individual trees. Spores are
dispersed by wind, water, or mechanical means. Disease management
includes fungicides and cultural practices. (For more information see
links below.)
