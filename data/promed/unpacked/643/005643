[The following notification on the same issue, published on 18 Nov 2016, is derived from the official web-site of Rosselkhoznadzor (Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance).
http://fsvps.ru/fsvps-docs/ru/iac/operative-messages/2016-11-18.pdf [in Russian, machine translated]:
"Epizootic situation: Recent reports on the epidemiological situation in Russia.
Foot and mouth disease: the lifting of quarantine, Vladimir area 1.
The Governor of the Vladimir region has signed a decree to lift the quarantine for FMD in Vyshmanovo village and on restrictive measures on the territory Sobinsk, the area where the outbreak was detected.
[The number of vaccinated animals] is: Cattle - 134 647. Sheep & goats (small ruminants) - 26 277. The cost of the vaccinations is 5.9 million rubles [about 91 000 US dollars]."

The said vaccination figures are different from the ones included in the OIE final report. Explanation will be helpful.

This enigmatic event, which reportedly started on 16 Oct 2016, caused Russia's status of "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised," as recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution No. 16 in May 2016, to be suspended with effect from 20 Oct 2016. The outbreak was accompanied by a huge dairy products recall (about 4000 tons). Among the measures applied were the destruction of 814 cattle, 54 pigs and 11 sheep/goats. These stamping-out and quarantine measures were swiftly applied with the logistic support of the army. There were no additional cases.

On 17 Nov 2016, the Director of the Veterinary Department of the Vladimir regional administration stated: "I doubt the natural route of infection" and raised the suspicion that the FMD Asia 1 event in Vladimir could have been related to "economic sabotage" (http://www.vedom.ru/news/2016/11/17/23194-direktor). It may be assumed that an investigation into the matter has been undertaken by Russia's authorities. Its results, and, in particular, the genotyped profile of the virus strain involved, will be assiduously followed by ProMED-mail and brought to subscribers' knowledge if/when they become available. - Mod.AS
