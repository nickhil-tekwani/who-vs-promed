Rubella Warning After Infections
--------------------------------
Parents are being urged to make sure their children are vaccinated
against rubella, as concerns are raised the infection is circulating
around Crieff [Perthshire, Scotland]. Rubella is a viral infection,
commonly known as German Measles.

It is generally a mild illness, but can cause birth defects if a
woman catches the disease in early pregnancy. The main symptoms are a
fever and red-brown rash. Swollen glands, a lack of energy and aches
and pains are also common. The disease is passed on through droplets
in the air from coughs and sneezes of infected people.

Dr. Julie Cavanagh, from the National Health Service Tayside, said:
"The health protection team is concerned that rubella infection may
be circulating in the local area. However, I would stress that the
majority of people are actually immune to the disease. The safest way
to protect yourself and your children against measles, mumps and
rubella is the combined MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] triple
vaccine and I would encourage all parents to ensure their children's
vaccinations are up to date."

[Crieff is a small town in a semi-rural area of central Scotland. It
can be located just to the west of Perth in the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of the United Kingdom at:
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=54.5,-2,5>. Rubella infection is
likely to be another consequence of low uptake of the MMR triple
vaccine. It is not immediately obvious, however, why uptake of the
vaccine might be lower than elsewhere in Scotland. It may be that
this region has been at greater risk of exposure to infection as a
consequence of the presence of seasonal agricultural workers. Further
information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
