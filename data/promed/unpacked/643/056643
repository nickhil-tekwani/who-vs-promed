Overseas travel has been one of the most ancient [targets of public
health, especially concerning cholera and plague. We studied the topic a
few years ago in Santos, Brazil (where the biggest harbour in South America
is), and pointed out the terrible sanitation on board vessels, mostly
registered with "flags of convenience". They fly the flags of countries
where taxes are low and there are poor labour and environmental controls.
Practices adopted by authorities were not very different from the ancient
ones, adding watching out for _A.aegypti_ at a time it was not frequent in
the country.
I think it would be interesting to hear a bit about the activity of
environment and health control at harbours around the world. Some people
also claim it is a nonsense activity nowadays.
