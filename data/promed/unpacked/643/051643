A new case of wild poliovirus has been recorded in Wuru village of Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State, 5 years after the state was declared polio free.

This was disclosed by Ms Edele Thebaud, Chief of UNICEF D-Field Office, while signing the Programme Implementation Agreement (PIA) in the office of the Secretary to the Taraba State Government in Jalingo yesterday [10 Sep 2012].

Thebaud commended the state government for releasing [NGN 3 million Nigerian Naira][USD 18 963.34] for mop up exercise, but added that a lot needs to be done for the state to become polio free again.

"UNICEF urges the state to ensure the establishment of a functional primary health care development agency; and the timely release of counterpart fund for the implementation of health activities like Immunisation Plus Days (IPDs) and the Maternal and New-born Child Health Weeks (MNCHWs). UNICEF also urges the state government to encourage local government authorities to provide budgets for routine immunisation and adequate, and timely release of funds for immunization activities, particularly monitoring and supervision of Routine Immunization (RI) activities.

She also urged the state to increase cross-border surveillance as a proactive measure in eradicating the virus.

Responding, the SSG [Secretary to the State Government], Ambassador Emmanuel Njiwah, said the state government will not hesitate to implement the observations raised by UNICEF.

[In reading the update below from the Polio Eradication Initiative, the above mentioned case in Taraba had date of onset of paralysis on 5 Jul 2012. Obvious concerns raised by the identification of this case relate to the re-introduction of wild poliovirus (WPV) in a geographic area that had interrupted WPV transmission 5 years previously. This highlights the ever present concerns related to the ongoing transmission of WPV in Nigeria and the persistent risk of reintroduction of WPV into WPV-free areas in Nigeria, in neighboring countries, and in distant countries as seen over the past 10 years (see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - worldwide: WHO report Nigeria, updates 20090106.0052).

Highlights of the week ending 5 Sep 2012
----------------------------------------
The outbreak in Katsina, northern Nigeria, is continuing, with 4 new wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 cases reported this week. Katsina has reported 16 cases of WPV1 since May [2012], more than any other state in the country. Katsina now accounts for 40 percent of all WPV1 cases in Nigeria since May [2012]. Upwards of one third of children remain under-immunized in the state. During the most recent supplementary immunization activity (SIA), nearly one third of children were missed in Katsina city (the most populous part of the state and location of the bulk of cases).

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) Polio Working Group met this week in Geneva, Switzerland. Among other topics, the SAGE Polio Working Group discussed concrete ways to more effectively manage the short- and long-term implications of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), including a potential switch from trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV even before the interruption of the remaining strains of WPV type 1 and WPV type 3. This approach had previously been endorsed in principle by SAGE. In May [2012], the World Health Assembly (WHA) had requested the development of a comprehensive polio eradication and endgame strategy, to feature the potential timing of such a switch. The outcomes of the discussions from the SAGE Polio Working Group, and with continued guidance from SAGE and the WHA, will help inform a comprehensive Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategy 2014-2018.

Afghanistan
-----------
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases for 2012 remains 17. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Jul 2012 (WPV1 from Kunar).

Nigeria
-------
6 new cases were reported in the past week (4 WPV1s from Katsina and one WPV1 each from Kaduna and Sokoto), bringing the total number of cases for 2012 to 83. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 15 Aug 2012 (WPV1 from Kaduna).

Additionally, 3 new positive environmental samples were reported, including a WPV3 from Kano. This is significant, as it is the 1st WPV3 detected through environmental sampling in the country; and, it is the 1st wild poliovirus of any serotype detected in the Kano environmental system, since environmental sampling was introduced in 2011. The other 2 samples detected were WPV1s from Sokoto.

In response to the recently-detected WPV3 case in Taraba (onset of paralysis on 5 Jul 2012, a state-wide mop-up will be held on 15-18 Sep 2012. This follows a 4-ward mop-up already conducted on 25-26 Aug 2012, in the immediate vicinity of the affected area.

Pakistan
--------
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases for 2012 remains 29. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Jul 2012 (WPV1 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-KP).

Although no new cases were reported, the continuing presence of positive environmental samples collected underscores ongoing widespread transmission of polio in the country. 2 new positive samples were reported this week, collected from Gadap, Sindh, and Peshawar, KP.

Angola
------
No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The country reported a total of 5 cases in 2011, and the last case had onset of paralysis on 7 Jul 2011 in Uige in the country's north.

Chad
----
No new cases were reported in the past week. The most recently reported case occurred in the Lac region (WPV1) with onset of paralysis on 14 Jun 2012. The total number of cases for 2012 remains 5.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
--------------------------------------
No new cases were reported in the past week. No wild poliovirus cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 is 93 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 20 Dec 2011 in Maniema province.

Although the country has not reported a WPV case since December [2011], in 2012 DR Congo has been affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Katanga province, with 17 cases reported (most recent case: 4 Apr 2012). Efforts are focused on ensuring the cVDPV2 is fully stopped.

Horn of Africa
--------------
In Kenya, a type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) case, near the Somali border, is being investigated. The case had onset of paralysis on 25 Jun 2012, from Dadaab, in the North Eastern Province. Dadaab hosts a major refugee camp, housing more than 500 000 persons from across the Horn of Africa, displaced due to last year's drought and ongoing insecurity in some areas of Somalia.

Investigations are ongoing to determine if this case is related to a circulating VDPV type 2 (cVDPV type 2) from Somalia in 2011. In 2011, Somalia was affected by a cVDPV type 2, with 9 cases reported from April to December 2011. The most recent case in Somalia had onset of paralysis on 10 Dec 2011. The south and central parts of the country were primarily affected by the cVDPV, an area affected by insecurity where access is hampered during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity remain inadequate in key areas of south-central Somalia and border areas. Dadaab is also affected by security challenges, as both government and UN agencies are actively targeted by groups sympathetic to extremist organizations in Somalia.

Epidemiologists are currently conducting a full investigation, and planning an appropriate outbreak response with trivalent OPV on both sides of the border. At the same time, surveillance in and around Dadaab is being enhanced, to actively search for any additional potential cases (including in refugee camps).

West Africa
-----------
No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of cases for 2011 in West Africa remains 51 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 5 from Niger). The most recent case from the region (WPV1 from Niger) had onset of paralysis on 22 Dec 2011.

The situation in Mali continues to be of concern, due to insecurity.

[For detailed maps showing the geographic location of WPV confirmed cases in 2011, 2012, the last 6 months (5 Mar to 4 Sep 2012) and the last 12 months (5 Sep 2011 to 4 Sep 2012) see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx and click on the respective tabs.

Reviewing the update above from the Polio Eradication Initiative, key points are:
With the exception of 5 WPV associated cases in Chad, in the past 6 months, the only WPV associated cases confirmed in the world have occurred in the 3 remaining WPV endemic countries -- Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Optimistically, the 2012 year to date case count (308) is less than the 2011 year to date case count (364).

The continued circulation of WPV in Nigeria, including in areas that have not reported paralytic cases associated with the WPV (referring to the environmental sampling in Kano identifying WPV3). This remains a threat to neighboring countries as well as distant countries given the population mobility seen in the world.

Environmental sampling for WPV is an important adjunct to active surveillance activities in the (hopefully) final stages of polio eradication. As seen from the weekly update above, environmental sampling has identified WPV in areas that have not reported recent paralytic cases, suggesting that the WPV is in circulation in the area, either sub-clinically (involving non-paralytic infections with the WPV) or deficiencies in AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance activities in local areas.

Civil unrest continues to be a significant concern to the polio eradication effort as surveillance activities as well as vaccination activities are hampered by security concerns -- a reminder that polio eradication program workers have been subjects of violence and lethal attacks during the past year [2012].

The issue of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) associated paralytic cases increases in prominence and concern as the risk of paralytic disease associated with cVDPVs increases in relation to the risk of paralytic disease associated with the WPVs. The rationale for switching to a bivalent OPV, eliminating use the type 2 vaccine poliovirus is justified as the last paralytic case associated with WPV2 was in India in 1999 and the majority of paralytic cases associated with cVDPVs are associated with cVDPV2 (for a table showing confirmed cases of paralytic disease associated with cVDPVs by poliovirus type, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).

Not mentioned in this week's Polio Eradication Initiative update (but mentioned in prior updates), are additional obstacles posed by anti-vaccination movements in countries. There persist pockets of rumor mongers interfering with vaccination acceptance in local areas, especially in Pakistan and northern Nigeria. Newswires continue to highlight these situations (see http://dawn.com/2012/09/11/anti-polio-campaigns-political-agents-warned-against-negligence/ and http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-nigerian-unrest-anti-polio-efforts.html for recent newswires mentioning anti-vaccination activities and conspiracy theories). - Mod.MPP]
