"Newcastle disease is a notifiable disease, according to Council Directive 82/894/EEC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:01982L0894-20130101&from=EN) on the notification of animal diseases within the European Union.

Council Directive 92/66/EEC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:01992L0066-20080903&from=EN) introduced community measures to control Newcastle disease.

In case of disease outbreaks, specific control measures including killing of infected animals and those suspected to be infected or contaminated need to be implemented in the infected holdings and areas around the outbreaks. Council Directive 92/66/EEC requires setting up a 3 km [2 mile] protection zone and 10 km [6 mile] surveillance zone. The protection zone measures must be applied for at least 21 days, and the surveillance zone measures must be applied for at least 30 days after the cleansing and disinfection of the outbreak holding," https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animal-diseases/control-measures/newcastle-disease_en. - Mod.CRD
