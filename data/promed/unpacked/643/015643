So far during November [2011] more than 50 inhabitants of Novosibirsk
have fallen ill with hepatitis A virus infection. The 1st cases ate in
the dining room of one of the business centres of the city, according
to a statement released on Thu 17 Nov 2011 by the Novosibirsk press
centre.

According to this statement there have now been 56 confirmed cases in
the city. The Municipal health authorities have now identified almost
2000 contacts, 31 of whom are children. All of the identified
contacts, who have not had hepatitis A previously or been vaccinated,
have now been vaccinated. In all, 1318 people including 13 children
have now been vaccinated. More than 2000 doses of hepatitis A vaccine
at a cost of 1 425 000 rubles [about USD 46 000] were provided by the
city administration.

Experts from Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection
and Human Welfare] in the Novosibirsk region are carrying out an
epidemiological investigation into the outbreak. The municipal medical
institutions have implemented appropriate measures to contain the
spread of infection.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV).
The virus is spread when an uninfected (or unvaccinated) person eats
or drinks something contaminated by the faeces of an HAV-infected
person; that is, by faecal-oral transmission. The disease is closely
associated with inadequate sanitation, poor personal hygiene, and
polluted water supplies. The symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild
to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite,
diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine, and
jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Not
everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms. Adults have
signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the
severity of disease and mortality increase in older age groups.
Infected children under 6 years of age do not usually experience
noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop jaundice. Among older
children and adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms,
with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases. Most people
recover in several weeks -- or sometimes months -- without
complications. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

The source of the current outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection in
Novosibirsk has not yet been identified, but appears to be associated
with a specific dinning room and is likely to be foodborne.

Novosibirsk is the 3rd-largest city in Russia, after Moscow and Saint
Petersburg. It is the administrative centre of Novosibirsk Oblast as
well as of the Siberian Federal District. The location of Novosibirsk
is shown in the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
