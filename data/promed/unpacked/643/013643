JOHANNESBURG - Five cattle tested positive for the Foot-and-Mouth Disease
(FMD) virus in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province raising the prospect
of a culling program involving thousands of animals, veterinary officials
said.
More than 3600 cattle, pigs, sheep and goats have already been culled
since the disease broke out on a farm near the village of Camperdown,
some 40 km northwest of Durban in mid-September.
The latest animals found to be infected with the virus belonged to
communal farmers unlike the previous 3 cases where the animals belonged
to individual farmers. "Samples taken yesterday from 5 of 32 animals were
airlifted for testing at the veterinary research laboratory at
Onderstepoort, and late last night they were all declared positive," the
Foot-and-Mouth Disease Control Center said in a statement.
Veterinary teams were likely to cull several thousand cattle in the
quarantine zone around the affected area and urgent plans were being
drawn up to compensate mainly black farmers whose wealth was tied up in
the cattle, said the center's spokesman.
"This is a very grave situation and there is going to be culling,
culling, culling," said the center's John MacDonald.
He said the culling would begin immediately in the affected homesteads
and animals in a 3-km zone and a further buffer zone would all be
inoculated ahead of the culling program.
The virus causes fever and blistering in cloven-hoofed animals often
resulting in death, but is not dangerous to humans.
A European Union delegation has arrived in the affected area to assess
measures taken by authorities to contain and stamp out the disease,which
is the first such outbreak in 44 years.
The latest outbreak occurred within a 10-km quarantine zone enforced by
soldiers and police around the original affected farms.
The virus is suspected to have been brought into the country in pig swill
imported from the Middle East or the Far East.
The EU, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Singapore have banned
imports of South African meat and livestock. Namibia has only halted meat
imports from the affected area.
-----
Comment: It would be preferable to view the latest positive tests as new
cases rather than "another outbreak" as conveyed here since the animals
still occur within the 10km zone.The visit of the EU team help clarify
the situation as the outbreak has been limited to a small circumscribed
area of the KwaZulu Natal area thus leaving other susceptible
yet-unaffected livestock stock free of the disease. I visited the said
Institute at
Onderstepoort 2 weeks ago and had a clearer picture from those involved
in the testing. Shamsudeen Fagbo, DVM
