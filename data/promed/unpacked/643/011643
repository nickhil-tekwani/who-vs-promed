On a number of occasions, we have seen anthrax outbreaks suddenly emerge 10 days after a rainfall following a drought. It is assumed that this occurs because the moisture causes the anthrax spores tucked into the roots of a turf mat to germinate and multiply.

In 2001, this is what happened, and there was a massive epidemic of anthrax in the deer ranches in western and southern Texas. Some 80 ranches were affected. A few ranches suffered 100% mortality of their deer, fortunately not many ranches. The stench was so bad that the ranchers abandoned their ranches for a while. Not unexpectedly, there were some human cases. Spread occurred through an abundance of bloodsucking Tabanid flies.

Texas has been suffering a severe drought, but in the next few days they are going to be visited by a depression off the Gulf with rain (see https://weather.com/news/weather/video/southwest-monsoon-activity-continues-localized-flooding-possible). This will travel across to El Paso.

The ranchers need to be aware of this risk, and if the weather follows the meteorological predictions, ranchers should, if they can, vaccinate their livestock. There is time, as the rain has yet to arrive, and the 1st anthrax cases, usually in deer, will be seen 10 days later. I hope my prediction is wrong, but I fear I will be right.
