A city official in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said a species of
mosquito that's new to the state -- one that bites during the day and
tolerates cold weather better than other mosquitoes -- has been
discovered in city traps. Health Program Coordinator Denise VanRoekel
said 4 adult mosquitoes of the Asian species _Aedes japonicus_ [more
recently classified as Ochlerotatus japonicus_, but the revision is
not accepted by all medical entomologists. - Mod.TY], the Asian bush
mosquito, turned up in late September [2009].

Some experts said the mosquitoes can carry diseases such as West
Nile, but others said the data don't support them transmitting it to humans.

Finding the new species is worrisome, said Lon Kightlinger, state
epidemiologist. "This new mosquito is a very unwelcome guest in South
Dakota, and we don't want it to get a foothold here. Kudos to the
Sioux Falls control network for finding and identifying it," he said.

Some think the new mosquito was introduced to the U.S. in a shipment
of tires to New Jersey in 1998. It has spread widely since, including
into Canada, where in some areas, it has become the dominant mosquito species.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, it can carry
encephalitis-type viruses that affect humans. Outside the laboratory,
though, it has not been shown to have great ability to infect humans
with West Nile [virus]. "They can carry it, but there is not a lot of
data to support them transmitting it, at least in the U.S.," VanRoekel said.

_Aedes japonicus_ "is something to watch. But it's not something to
get freaked out about," she said. The species' appearance in South
Dakota was inevitable, Kightlinger said. "Nebraska and Minnesota have
found it. We're kind of in the bull's-eye. It's coming up the
Missouri (River)," he said.

[In the United States, West Nile virus has been isolated from pools
of _Oc. j. japonicus_ captured in Westchester county, New York state,
and New Jersey (see ProMED-mail archive numbers 20000905.1515 and
20020824.5132). This species has been shown to transmit West Nile,
Japanese encephalitis, LaCrosse, Eastern equine encephalitis and St.
Louis encephalitis viruses experimentally in the laboratory.
