Venezuelan health minister Eugenia Sader said Fri 28 Jan 2011 that
111 people went to the hospital to be checked for cholera, an illness
they may have picked up at a wedding in the Dominican Republic.

Authorities were still trying to locate the rest of the 452
Venezuelans who traveled to the Dominican Republic for the 22 Jan 2011
wedding. "Our goal is for the 452 people to receive treatment," Sader
said in an interview with Telesur network. If all those people are
checked, and, if necessary, are treated, then "we will not have an
epidemic in Venezuela," she said.

Up to now, 37 of those checked by doctors have been confirmed as
cases of cholera, and 27 have been hospitalized. Venezuela has had no
cholera in a decade.

Besides the cholera patients in Caracas, another 12 Venezuelans
infected with the bacteria are still in the Dominican Republic.

[It is not specifically stated how many of the 111 individuals
mentioned actually presented with diarrhea. Whether cases of cholera
will occur that are acquired in Venezuela will depend on the adequacy
of sewage containment in the country, not whether all 452 individuals
are treated with antimicrobials.

The fate of the bride and groom in this real-life "Love in the Time
of Cholera" has not been stated. - Mod.LL]
