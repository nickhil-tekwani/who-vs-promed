Comment on reservoir of _Trichinella_ in seals
----------------------------------------------
In the mid-'80s I was in charge of food hygiene and meat inspection in North-Eastern Norway, based in Vadsoe. At the time there was an "invasion" of Greenland seals (which after a while spread southwards with a resultant morbillivirus infection in an oversized North Sea grey seal population).

A lot of these Greenland seals were accidentally netted by fishermen, probably because they were going for fish in the nets, and were brought ashore for their meat; trichinella was one of the main hindrances to using the meat, and we basically had to systematically test any animal to be used. Even those where trichinella was not found were considered unsafe and required thorough cooking.

As far as I'm aware, the Greenland seal is also used as meat in Greenland (!), and it might be worth looking into as a possible source of the parasites.

[ProMED-mail thanks Per L Lausund for this comment. Seals are a source of infection with _Trichinella_ species, and in the comment to the original posting (20131026.2022008) we cited 3 papers from Canada and Greenland providing data on trichinella infections in seals. - Mod.EP
