[1] UK: new variant virus
Date: Mon 14 Dec 2020

A new variant of coronavirus has been found which is growing faster in some parts of England, MPs have been told. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at least 60 different local authorities had recorded COVID infections caused by the new variant. He said the World Health Organization had been notified and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. He said there was "nothing to suggest" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work.

He told MPs in the House of Commons that over the last week, there had been sharp, exponential rises in coronavirus infections across London, Kent, parts of Essex, and Hertfordshire. "We've currently identified over 1000 cases with this variant predominantly in the South of England although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. "We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."

England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said current coronavirus swab tests would detect the new variant. Prof Alan McNally, an expert at the University of Birmingham, said UK testing labs had picked up on this new variant in the last few weeks. He told the BBC: "Let's not be hysterical. It doesn't mean it's more transmissible or more infectious or dangerous. "It is something to keep an eye on. "Huge efforts are ongoing at characterising the variant and understanding its emergence. It is important to keep a calm and rational perspective on the strain as this is normal virus evolution and we expect new variants to come and go and emerge over time."

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said it was potentially serious. "The surveillance and research must continue and we must take the necessary steps to stay ahead of the virus."

There is a simple rule for understanding all "new strain" or "new variants": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the "scare" but not the "answer".

Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus "may be associated" with the faster spread in the south east of England. This is not the same as saying it "is causing" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily.

New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the "Spanish strain" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment, there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is.

Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at Nottingham University, said: "The genetic information in many viruses can change very rapidly and sometimes these changes can benefit the virus -- by allowing it to transmit more efficiently or to escape from vaccines or treatments -- but many changes have no effect at all. "Even though a new genetic variant of the virus has emerged and is spreading in many parts of the UK and across the world, this can happen purely by chance. "Therefore, it is important that we study any genetic changes as they occur, to work out if they are affecting how the virus behaves, and until we have done that important work it is premature to make any claims about the potential impacts of virus mutation."

[B] Expert reactions to announcement
Date: Mon 14 Dec 2020

https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-the-new-variant-of-sars-cov-2/


Dr Zania Stamataki, Viral Immunologist, University of Birmingham, said:
"The emergence of different coronavirus strains a year after SARS-CoV-2 first jumped to humans is neither cause for panic nor unexpected. Mutations will accumulate and lead to new virus variants, pushed by our own immune system to change or perish.

"This virus doesn't mutate as fast as influenza and, although we need to keep it under surveillance, it will not be a major undertaking to update the new vaccines when necessary in the future. This year [2020] has seen significant advances take place, to build the infrastructure for us to keep up with this coronavirus."

Prof Tom Solomon, the Director of the NIHR [National Institute for Health Research] Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, at the University of Liverpool, said:
"SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19 is evolving and mutating all the time, as do all similar viruses. Such changes are completely to be expected.

"In the UK we are doing very detailed genetic assessment of many of the virus strains detected. From what Matt Hancock has announced it sounds as though a particular variant is being detected especially across the South of England. Just because there has been a small change in the virus' genetic make-up this does not mean it is any more virulent, nor that vaccines won't be effective. Our experience from previous similar viruses suggests that the vaccines will be effective despite small genetic changes."

Prof Julian Hiscox, Chair in Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, said:
Is this to be expected?
"Yes, this has been known for many years with coronaviruses. Coronaviruses have 2 mechanisms of mutation. If we look at animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus of poultry, there are hundreds of different variants of that virus. There are many different variants of the different seasonal human coronaviruses, and with those people can become reinfected within 6 months to a year.

Are new variants always more virulent?
"No, not always, but in feline (cat) coronaviruses, within host change in a single infection can lead to a new more virulent virus being formed. In other coronaviruses, some have 'changed' that have become less virulent, for example, pig coronaviruses.

Is this a big deal? Should we be alarmed? How should it change our response, if at all?
"We should be cautious and focus efforts on understanding the transmission of this virus and if necessary introducing control measures to prevent its spread. There is always a lag between sampling and information. Currently, there is no evidence that this virus will evade the vaccine or will lead to increased disease or death.

What will PHE [Public Health England] be doing to analyse it? What do we need to know about it?
"PHE will be focusing on sequencing the virus from patients to determine its prevalence in the population and conducting analysis of the biology of the virus -- for example, does it grow more quickly or the same as other strains. They will also be checking that the nucleic acid based diagnostic remains fit for purpose as many of these target the spike gene. This illustrates why we need a rapid mechanism in the UK to understand these so called genotype to phenotype changes.

Why should we be confident that it will still respond to the vaccines?
"We know from other coronaviruses that small changes in the spike glycoprotein (that is the target of the vaccine) can lead to vaccine escape. We have no evidence at the moment whether this variant will or won't respond to the vaccine. This illustrates that we need to be agile and flexible with the vaccine platforms and will probably be like seasonal influenza viruses where we have to give multiple vaccines that change with time.

How different do variants need to be for one to resist a vaccine?
"This depends on where the variants are located in the vaccine target. If this is in what is called the receptor binding domain of spike then variants may be refractive to the vaccine. This illustrates why for most animal coronaviruses the vaccines are [multivalent], that is, target a number of different viral proteins."

Prof Richard Tedder, Senior Research Investigator in Medical Virology, Imperial College London, said:
"In reality, when one has a species jump of a virus, it is not at all surprising if the virus undergoes a period of adaptation to the new host. This does not necessarily bring about a change in the degree to which the virus causes disease; in fact some of the most effective agents at establishing themselves in the human population recently have exploited long periods of apparent clinical harmony with their new host, HIV being a case in point. So, although the initial primary host of SARS-CoV-2 may not be known with absolute certainty, on the scale that we now see this is clearly a new infection in our species. One has seen a natural evolution of genetic variants for example in HIV, a recent human acquisition. One also sees well documented existence of variants in hepatitis B, a virus in humans of great antiquity, which comprise a number of sub families, better described as genomic variants, or genotypes, which after millennia are stable and circulate as stable variants throughout the human population.

"Viral variation is "normal". Whilst it is important to keep a genetic eye on the current coronavirus, variation is bound to occur as the numbers of infections and transmissions increase in what is a relatively early stage of this human-virus relationship. This becomes of critical importance if any established variation confers the virus a biological advantage over the host -- and the advantage can take many forms. At present, science needs to document genetic variants as we learn more about the diversity of the host-virus relationship and keep a watching brief for evidence of viruses with altered behaviour."

Prof Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said:
"Reports of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the south of England is not surprising and it is too early to say how important it is yet.

"It is truly a wonderful worldwide effort that is ensuring that changes in the virus are being monitored, and the UK has been an important part of that. As the vaccines are introduced, this will become a more important process, to ensure that any vaccine escape mutants that could theoretically develop are quickly identified and isolated. In the nearly a year since the 1st sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, many genetic variants have been identified. These have been useful in understanding the worldwide spread and transmission patterns, but scientists think that only one of these has previously conferred an advantage to the virus. That advantage did not make the virus more virulent, and should not affect vaccines or treatments, but did seem to make the virus slightly more easily spread from one person to the next. This has meant that strain is now the most common variant seen in many parts of the world.

"The newly observed variant in England may be similarly important and perhaps offer an advantage to the virus by becoming more transmissible, but the observation may also be the result of chance events. We are fortunate that we are able to monitor and evaluate this and will no doubt be able to calculate a thorough analysis from the evidence soon."

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said:
"While research is ongoing, there is evidence to indicate a new variant of the COVID-19 virus. There have been many mutations in the virus since it emerged in 2019. This is to be expected, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and these viruses mutate and change. The pressure on the virus to evolve is increased by the fact that so many millions of people have now been infected. Most of the mutations will not be significant or cause for concern, but some may give the virus an evolutionary advantage which may lead to higher transmission or mean it is more harmful.

"The full significance of this is not yet clear -- that includes whether a new strain is responsible for the current rise of infections in parts of the UK and, if so, what this may or may not mean for transmission and the efficacy of the 1st vaccines and treatments. This is potentially serious; the surveillance and research must continue and we must take the necessary steps to stay ahead of the virus.

"Above all, this is a reminder that there is still so much to learn about COVID-19. The pace of the research effort in the past year has been extraordinary, allowing us to make significant progress on the vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics needed to end this crisis. The speed at which this has been picked up on is also testament to this phenomenal research effort. However, there is no room for complacency. We have to remain humble and be prepared to adapt and respond to new and continued challenges as we move into 2021. This pandemic is not over and there will still be surprises in the virus, how it evolves, and the trajectory of the pandemic in the coming year.

"2020 has been a tough year; tough beyond belief for millions across the country, and across the world. Unfortunately, more difficult months lie ahead and the consequences of relaxing our focus or not having sufficient restrictions will result in more suffering. We have to respect the restrictions and accept that there will be a need for these to be tightened when infection rates rise, or as new information is learned about this virus."

[2] Genomic study of disease severity
Date: Mon 14 Dec 2020 2:10 PM GMT+1
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/12/14/covid-genes-illness-severity/


Certain gene variants are linked to severe coronavirus infections, according to a team of scientists in Europe who studied the genomes of 2200 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Their results provide robust support that genetic makeup plays a role in the potentially fatal illness experienced by some people infected by the coronavirus.

Diving into people's DNA is an approach that could help answer one of the pandemic's biggest mysteries: Why do some people have mild coronavirus cases, or no symptoms at all, while others rapidly fall ill and die? Evidence is clear that older age and underlying conditions are risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity. But genetic predispositions to runaway inflammation or other harmful immune responses could also contribute to worse disease.

Knowing this, researchers are working to uncover genes closely linked with biological systems to accelerate drug development for Covid-19. "Our primary aim in this work is to find effective treatments," said study author Kenneth Baillie, a University of Edinburgh clinical researcher and an investigator with the GenOMICC Consortium, which explores associations between genes and critical illness.

Baillie and his colleagues pinpointed 8 spots on chromosomes -- 5 of which strongly held up under further scrutiny -- where variants were more common among people in intensive care. Some of the genes contain instructions for anti-viral components of the immune system, suggesting flaws in a person's microscopic defenses that therapeutics might fix, at least in theory.

"Looking across thousands of people, there are little variations in how much there is of each signal; these variations arise because of genetic differences between people," Baillie said. "At this scale, we can see the effect of these variations, so we can directly predict the effect of drugs that hit the immune system in the same place."

Translating results from these types of investigations into successful therapies has, generally, been a struggle. The process often requires lengthy research even before drugs are ready to be tested in people.

"There is no guarantee that when a gene is found, targeting that gene will result in therapeutic efficacy," said Tom Hemming Karlsen, a physician at the University of Oslo who did not participate in the new work. He added: "What genetics studies like this then do is they help us find very specific starting points" for further investigation.

In what's known as a genome-wide association study, Baillie and his colleagues examined the genes of more than 2000 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units across Britain, and compared those with the genes of healthy people. The research, published recently in the journal Nature [see reference below], aligns with earlier reports that also found variants in the genetic makeup of critically ill patients.

The new report is the "biggest published to date of its kind," Karlsen said. He is a co-author of a paper, published earlier this year [2020] in the New England Journal of Medicine, which used the same scientific process to identify gene variants associated with severe COVID-19. That study found people with blood type A were at higher risk of severe infections, while having blood type O was somewhat associated with a protective effect. It also noted a location on chromosome 3 linked to respiratory failure. [Severe COVID-19 GWAS Group, Ellinghaus D, Degenhardt F, Bujanda L, et al. Genomewide association study of severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. N Engl J Med. 2020; 383(16): 1522-1534. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2020283. Epub 2020 Jun 17. The study mentions a possible association with blood type. Another study -- Latz CA, DeCarlo C, Boitano L, et al. Blood type and outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Ann Hematol. 2020; 99(9): 2113-2118. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04169-1. Epub 2020 Jul 12, did not find any association with blood type. - Mod.MPP]

The new work detected the link to chromosome 3, too, though how that cluster relates to severe COVID-19 is not clear. What's more, "several of the new findings are able to point quite directly to genes with known functions of relevance to the immune system or antiviral responses," Karlsen said.

Among the new links to severe disease is a gene named IFNAR2. That gene allows cells to build a protein receptor for a potent immune molecule, dubbed interferon for its ability to interfere with viral replication. It is part of the body's first responses against infection. But a weak interferon response could allow the virus to quickly proliferate. That, in turn, may result in a potentially deadly overcorrection when later immune defenses kick in.

The study reveals "genetic variants, particularly near genes that are involved in the so-called interferon immune response play an important role in causing a life-threatening COVID-19 infection," said Lude Franke, a statistical geneticist at the University of Groningen, who was not involved in the Nature report.

Experts cautioned these types of investigations rarely produce evidence for direct cause-and-effect relationships between specific genes and disease severity or susceptibility to infection. "A chunk of the answer is in our genes" but "it's unlikely that a single element is fully responsible for the development of severe COVID-19," study author Sara Clohisey, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out. "It's more likely to be a combination of factors," she said, which may include genetics as well as age, obesity, gender and other characteristics. (Although men are more likely to die of coronavirus infections than women, the scientists did not detect genetic variants linked to sex in this study.)

Yet Baillie said this work provides "causal evidence," specifically for the IFNAR2 gene, and another, called TYK2, that "the products of those genes change a person's chance of becoming critically ill with COVID." Karlsen said "very rare, but more deleterious genetic variants in the same genes, may provide a stronger driver towards severe disease, as seen for IFNAR2."

Interferon has been tested as a possible COVID-19 therapy in clinical trials, although one large trial found giving interferon to hospitalized patients did not reduce mortality. The study authors also noted that the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and being tested in Covid-19 patients, can inhibit the protein encoded by the TYK2 gene.

The researchers plan to continue to analyze DNA samples from coronavirus patients -- not only those who were severely ill and in intensive care, but also from people who had milder symptoms.

There's no shortage of potential donors as the outbreaks continue. "The pandemic is still raging," Clohisey said. Since they began writing this paper, she said, the researchers have tripled their DNA samples of people who have had the coronavirus.

"Abstract
---------
"Host-mediated lung inflammation is present(1), and drives mortality(2), in critical illness caused by Covid-19. Host genetic variants associated with critical illness may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development.(3) Here we report the results of the GenOMICC (Genetics of mortality in critical care) genome-wide association study(GWAS) in 2244 critically ill COVID-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs). We identify and replicate novel genome-wide significant associations, on chr12q24.13 (rs10735079, p=1.65 x 10^-8) in a gene cluster encoding antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), on chr19p13.2 (rs2109069, p=2.3 x 10^-12) near the gene encoding tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), on chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, p=3.98 x 10^-12) within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and on chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, p=4.99 x 10^-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We identify potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease; transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe COVID-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host antiviral defence mechanisms, and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in COVID-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing drugs. Large-scale randomised clinical trials will be essential before any change to clinical practice."

The study above comes a week after Lazzeroni D, Concari P, Moderato L. Simultaneous COVID-19 in homozygous twins. Ann Intern Med. 2020 Dec 8. doi: 10.7326/L20-1207. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33284682; https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1207 was published presenting one severe clinical course and one mild to moderate clinical course in presumed homozygous twins. The discussion section is interesting as well:

"Discussion
-----------
"Genetic factors are often proposed to explain differences in how COVID-19 affects people. For example, others have suggested that polymorphisms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, differences in the ABO blood group system, and additional genetic factors may be associated with the susceptibility for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19.(1,2). That possibility seems unlikely in the 2 patients we describe, especially if we assume no spontaneous mutations or epigenetic differences. In addition, other factors have been associated with an adverse prognosis, such as older age; cardiovascular risk factors; and chronic diseases of the lung, kidney, liver, or cardiovascular system (3). Our patients were identical in these respects. Moreover, some have proposed that environmental factors, such as air pollution, are associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 (4) and by extension may be related to disease severity. However, our patients lived at the same address and worked at the same job in the same workplace, so they probably had similar environmental exposures. Also, differences in the virus--for example, differences in the infecting dose (5) or viruses with different mutations--may explain differences in illness severity. We do not have direct information about these viral characteristics, but we believe both patients were infected by the same person, so they likely acquired the same virus. We also know that the number of polymerase chain reaction cycles needed to produce detectable viral RNA was similar (Table), which suggests that the viral load at diagnosis was similar."

I'm still a believer that genetics plays a role in disease presentation and outcome... why do only 0.5% of poliovirus infected individuals have paralytic disease... yet one family in Ontario Canada with 10 children -- 3 of whom had paralytic disease during the outbreak of 1978-9... But, if the twins were truly homozygous, how does one explain very severe disease requiring intubation in one, and a significantly milder course in the other? - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 52.2% of daily case numbers and 48.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 30.4 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, Peru, and Dominican Republic. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Paraguay, and Puerto Rico. Costa Rica and El Salvador among others did not report any new cases to WHO in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 33.3% of daily case numbers and 35.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 22.1 million. Countries not reporting cases today (14 Dec 2020) include Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Russia, Turkey, UK, Italy, Germany, and France. There are 15 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 9 countries reporting more than 500 but less than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.2% of daily case numbers and 6.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.51 million cases. Iran is dominant, with decreasing daily case counts now below 7500, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, UAE, and Iraq. Sudan, Somalia and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 2.8% of daily case numbers and 3.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.63 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting almost 8000 new cases, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Mauritania, Algeria, Uganda, Namibia, Nigeria, Niger, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Congo, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and DR Congo. 21 countries and territories in the region did not report cases for the last 24 hours, among which are Ghana, Madagascar, Guinea, and Botswana.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.96% of daily case numbers and 0.46% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.96 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.3 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant (although reported less than 30 000 cases), followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on both the regional and country levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 83% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. This is in the face of weekend reporting decreases as seen most clearly in Europe, with high transmission countries not reporting to WHO in the past 24 hours, but similar in other regions. At the country level, South Korea continues with high daily reports with the most recent over 700 cases. Indonesia reported over 6000 cases. Iran may have "peaked" as seen by decreasing daily new cases. South Africa reported over 8000 new cases. Mexico has a significant presence in the Americas with reports of over 12 000 cases. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis, now reporting over 200 000 cases in the past 24 hours, and reflecting weekend reporting slowdowns.

A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, compared with 62 on Fri 11 Dec 2020; 26 of the 51 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Pakistan, Sweden, Kazakhstan, and Tunisia among others, consistent with previously noted weekend reductions in reporting.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 20.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.6%. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (8.6%) and reported deaths (9.5%).

Impression: The daily reporting is still currently decreased as a function of reduced reporting over the weekend. Even with the reduction in reporting, the USA accounted for 37.8% of newly confirmed cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
