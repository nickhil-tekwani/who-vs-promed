In the area of Dobrich in the village of Obrochishte, a woman has died of anthrax, the 2nd victim of the disease over the past few months.

The 73 year old woman died in the infectious diseases clinic in Varna on the morning of 24 Sep 2015. It is known that only 7 people have been in contact with the infected meat. Authorities say they are doing everything possible to limit the spread the infection.

The dead woman was involved in the slaughter of a sheep, which had health problems. When cutting the meat, the woman cut herself, and that was the most likely cause of the infection. Pet owners have not informed veterinarians about animal health problems. The 1st laboratory samples taken from the woman, showed the presence of anthrax. The results of the 2nd sample [presumably from the meat, see below. - Mod.MHJ] should be ready by 28 Sep 2015.

An anthrax outbreak has been reported in the village of Obrochishte, municipality of Balchik, district of Dobrich, after a signal was submitted by the Regional Health Inspectorate in Dobrich after a woman that had died from anthrax, the press centre of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) announced. The District Food Safety Directorate in Dobrich is working on the case.

According to initial reports, a sheep in poor health was slaughtered on a farm in Obrochishte on 17 Sep 2015. The official vet was not notified. While cutting the meat, the animal owners cut themselves, which is most likely how they got infected. Lab tests run on the sheep meat kept in a freezer revealed the animal had been infected with anthrax. The BFSA insists that farmers should not slaughter animals without notifying the official vet responsible for their farm.

[As mentioned previously [see archive 20150720.3523608], this north east region of Bulgaria is regularly afflicted with livestock anthrax outbreaks year after year. The government is overdue in initiating a regional control & surveillance programme -- note that this case came to their notice through an elderly woman dying in hospital, which is a mite late -- in Varna & Ruse oblasts with annual vaccination of the livestock.
