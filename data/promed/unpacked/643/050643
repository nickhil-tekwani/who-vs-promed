The number of reported polio cases in Ethiopia has risen sharply from 2 to 16
this year, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) reported.
The first 2 cases were children living close to the border with Sudan, where a
polio outbreak was reported in December 2000.
"These were the first cases of polio in Ethiopia in 4 years, the last being in
January 2001," WHO said in a statement released on Wednesday [31 Aug
2005] "Both cases are wild polio virus type 1 and genetically linked to the
polio virus circulating in neighbouring Sudan."
The additional 14 cases, WHO added, were detected in children aged between 8
months and 11 years in Tigray, Amhara and Oromiya regions of Ethiopia.
The agency urged Ethiopian authorities to strengthen routine immunisation of
children, particularly in areas affected by the virus, and also called for
coordinated anti-polio campaigns, saying the virus had spread along porous
borders.
When the first cases were reported, the UN made an urgent appeal for USD 4.9
million to vaccinate 14.7 million children against polio.
The Ethiopian government declared a public health emergency and launched 2
rounds of nationwide polio immunisation campaigns in April and May 2005. A 3rd
campaign was completed in August [2005].
According to WHO, Ethiopia was expecting to be declared polio-free in 2005 --
a qualification it would have achieved after recording no cases for 3 years.
However, it has become the 14th formerly polio-free African country to record
a new case, following ... a new epidemic [that] originated in northern Nigeria
18 months ago.
Globally, the poliovirus circulates in no more than 20 countries -- mainly in
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa -- down from 30 in 1999 and 125 in 1988,
when a major anti-polio campaign was launched.
Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious disease with no cure. It is
caused by a virus that mainly affects children under 3 years of age. The virus
invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs.
Over the last 2 years, more than 14 million Ethiopian children have been
vaccinated against the crippling virus. Across the world, more than 550
million children have been vaccinated.

[The most recent data available on the polio eradication website show 15
confirmed cases in Ethiopia as of 30 Aug 2005 with most recent date of onset
16 Jul 2005
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml>.
There was 1 case reported in 2004. It is possible that the total referred to
in the above article includes the one case reported in 2004.ï¿½
According to the website, polio activity in Ethiopia is being considered as
due to importation and not as yet due to re-established transmission (the
latter being considered once there are 6 or more months of documented wild
poliovirus transmission in a country following importation). As mentioned in
the above article, the number of previously polio-free countries with polio
outbreaks related to the outbreak in Northern Nigeria in 2003 continues to
grow (presently 14, including Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Mali, Eritrea,
Cameroon, Saudi Arabia, Guinea, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso, Cote
D'Ivoire, Benin, & Togo).
Prior to the importation of wild polio virus into Ethiopia in 2004, the last
case (a wild type 1 poliovirus) was reported in a child from the then KAT zone
of Southern Nations Nationalities Peoples Region in January 2001, according to
the WHO EPI (Expanded Programme on Immunizations) team leader in 2002 (see
ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - Ethiopia: correction 20020201.3459). -
