Ivory Coast: ravens did not die from [highly pathogenic avian influenza]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In October [2009], the ag [agriculture] authorities of Ivory Coast
reported that 30 wild white-necked ravens were found dead on a
secondary school ground in Abidjan. A total of 9 birds tested
positive on the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1.
However, tests conducted by the OIE reference lab in Padova do not
confirm H5N1 infection. The results obtained by the OIE Reference
Laboratory in Padova were negative for avian influenza by RT-PCR,
virus isolation in embryonated eggs, sequencing, intravenous
pathogenicity index test, and hemagglutination inhibition test.

Further tests were carried out by the same laboratory for Newcastle
disease and West Nile fever and they were negative.

Concerning the ravens that died in Abidjan, some people revealed that
they had spread a toxic product, mainly Gambaril, which could be the
origin of the deaths reported. However, toxicological tests gave
negative results.

[Cote d'Ivoire officially notified OIE of this outbreak on 16 Oct
2009. Reportedly, the diagnosis was carried out by the Central
Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Bingerville (National laboratory),
which applied PCR.

On 20 Nov 2009, follow-up report no. 1 was received at the OIE, sent
by Dr Kanga Kouame, director of Veterinary Services and Quality,
Department of Animal Production and Fish Resources, Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire. It included the following "Epidemiological comments":

"The reoccurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza serotype H5N1
is not confirmed and will be closed since the results obtained by the
OIE Reference Laboratory in Padova were negative for avian influenza
by RT-PCR, virus isolation in embryonated eggs, sequencing,
intravenous pathogenicity index test, and hemagglutination inhibition
test. Further tests were carried out by the same laboratory for
Newcastle disease and West Nile fever and they were negative.

Concerning the ravens that died in Abidjan, some people have revealed
that they had spread a toxic product, mainly Gambaril; that could be
the origin of the deaths reported. Toxicological tests gave negative
results." - Mod.AS]
