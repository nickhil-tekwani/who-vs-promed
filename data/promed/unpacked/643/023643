A 46 year old southern Cape farm worker is in a critical
condition in Groote Schuur Hospital after contracting
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Those who contract
the virus have a 30 to 50 per cent chance of dying. Dozens
of others are affected, although the health department says
the outbreak is contained.

7 of the man's relatives and colleagues who came into
contact with him, and who have shown early symptoms of the
disease, have been admitted to Riversdale Hospital for
observation. The 7 include the man's wife, his child and
other farm workers. None of them has shown any bleeding.

A further 66 people, mainly health workers who treated the
man, are being monitored for symptoms twice daily for 21
days. They are from the Heidelberg Clinic, Riversdale
Hospital and the George Hospital. By last night none of them
had shown symptoms of the disease.

The man, who works on a cattle farm between Swellendam and
Heidelberg, was flown to Groote Schuur from the George
Regional Hospital last Wednesday [5 Oct 2005]. CCHF was
diagnosed on Friday [7 Oct 2005]. He is being treated in
isolation at Groote Schuur by medical staff wearing full
"space suit" protective clothing and masks. His symptoms are
high fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscular pain, coughing up
blood, and bleeding from the nose.

Keith Cloete, the acting chief director for health
programmes in the Department of Health, said yesterday the
department had set in motion its "full outbreak response"
and staff believed they had contained the disease. The staff
had also notified the department of Agriculture "We have
only one confirmed case of CCHF, a 46 year old man who works
on a cattle farm between Swellendam and Heidelberg," Cloete
said. "He is critical but stable. The diagnosis was
confirmed last Friday and we've traced back everyone who has
been in contact with him. There were 47 people in Riversdale
and we've admitted 7 of those as a precaution. The other 40
we are monitoring, taking their temperatures morning and
evening. If there is any suspicion that they have symptoms,
we will admit them. These 40 are mainly the hospital staff
who treated him." Another 26 people are being monitored in
George. They are also mainly hospital staff and emergency
medical staff. None has been admitted.

Cloete said the man had developed flu-like symptoms on 26
Sep 2005. On 3 Oct, he went to the clinic in Heidelberg,
which referred him to Riversdale Hospital. He was
transferred the next day to the bigger George Hospital,
where he began bleeding. Blood tests howed "problems with
his platelets" and he was flown to Groote Schuur for
specialist treatment. The disease, which is carried by ticks
infected with the virus, can spread from an infected person
to another by body fluids penetrating broken skin. It can
also spread to humans from the blood or tissue of fresh
animal carcasses infected with CCHF virus. People at higher
risk of getting CCHF are abattoir workers and people dealing
with livestock.

It is possible, but rare, for CCHF virus to be transmitted
to humans by bites from infected ticks. The tick that
carries the fever comes from the genus _Hyalomma_, found in
Africa, Asia and eastern Europe. Locally they are known as
bontpootluise.

South Africa: health officials say CCHF contained
-------------------------------------------------
Health officials are monitoring 151 people for symptoms of
the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF], which
claimed the life of an unnamed farm labourer at Groote
Schuur hospital on Monday [10 Oct 2005]. Confident the
disease will not spread, officials on Monday discharged 7
people, including the dead man's wife and son, from the
Riversdale hospital.

The 46 year old farm labourer from Riversdale died of
multiple organ failure on Monday. "The patient passed away
in hospital. He had multiple organ failure," said Western
Cape health minister Pierre Uys at a media briefing at
Groote Schuur. Uys said the farm worker had been in contact
with people in Slangriver, Riversdale, George and Groote
Schuur. "This is the only case at this moment in time that
we do have. We did notify the national Department of Health,
so they're fully aware of what's happening," said Uys.

Dr Keith Cloete, acting chief of health programmes in the
Western Cape, said the man took ill on 26 Sep 2005, was
admitted to Riversdale hospital on 3 Oct 2005 and was
transferred to George hospital the next day. He was then
taken to Groote Schuur where the positive diagnosis was
confirmed, and he was moved into an isolation ward on 7 Oct
2005.

Immediately after CCHF was diagnosed, everybody who had come
into contact with him was identified -- 74 staff at Groote
Schuur; 28 people in the George area; and 49 people in
Riversdale, said Cloete. "We do morning and evening
temperatures on all of them. We also monitor them for
symptoms suggestive of developing the illness." Cloete said
the 7 people, including 4 co-workers, from Riversdale were
discharged after doctors felt that they were "significantly
out of danger".

Although the man's bleeding -- CCHF is a haemorrhagic fever
that causes bleeding from all bodily orifices -- was
initially stabilised, he took a turn for the worse before
his death. Cloete said officials are working on the
assumption that he contracted the disease while slaughtering
a cow on 24 Sep 2005. He said farmers in the Southern Cape
area are being advised to ensure their animals are free of
ticks, which pass on the disease by biting people or
animals, whose blood then carries the disease. Cloete said
meat from infected carcasses is safe to consume.

Professor Robin Wood, an infectious disease specialist at
Groote Schuur hospital, said the incubation period varies
from 3 to 14 days depending on how a person was infected.
This means the outbreak could be considered to have been
contained if there are no more cases by Fri 21 Oct 2005, he
said. Wood said the last case at Groote Schuur was in 2001,
when the patient survived. A larger outbreak was handled at
Tygerberg hospital in 1996. "This is a disease which occurs
relatively infrequently, but very widely across the world,"
Treatment involves blood transfusions. Wood said the
mortality of the disease varies. In the most recent case,
the victim was at an advanced stage of the illness by the
time he was taken for treatment.

[The 1st case of CCHF in South Africa was diagnosed in 1981
when the virus was isolated from the blood of a schoolboy
who died after being bitten by a tick in the North West
Province. This prompted investigations to determine the
prevalence of the virus in the country. Results of antibody
surveys on sera from humans, livestock and wild vertebrates
confirmed that the virus is widespread in South Africa in
areas corresponding to the distribution of ticks belonging
to the genus _Hyalomma_. The wide distribution of antibody
and its detection in sera which had been stored for several
years indicated that the virus had been present for many
years and was not a recent introduction. Information about
CCHF in South Africa is available on the South African
government's website: <http://www.info.gov.za>.

CCHF cases are rare but can be fatal in humans. Animals are
less severely affected or unaffected by exposure to CCHF
virus. - Mod.CP]
