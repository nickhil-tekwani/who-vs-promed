At least 10 infants have been treated for syphilis in Manitoba [Canada] in the last 6 months [2018-2019], and the public health office says the methamphetamine crisis could be exacerbating the outbreak. [See prior ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Canada: (MB) increased incidence, methamphetamine use, 2018 20190131.6287056.]

The number of people with syphilis has nearly tripled since 2014 -- to 350 [in 2018, reference 1] from 118 [cases of primary and secondary syphilis in 2014, reference 2]. For women, it's gone to 168 [in 2018, reference 1] from 16 [in 2014, reference 1] in 4 years.

Michael Isaac, Manitoba's acting chief public health officer, says women can pass the bacterial infection on during pregnancy. Isaac says substance abuse and a lack of prenatal care were common factors in many of the cases.

The province is urging people to practise safe sex and to get tested. Women should seek regular prenatal medical care, especially if they are intravenous drug users. "I think the injection drug use that we are seeing in Manitoba certainly is linked with crystal methamphetamine use," Isaac said [Mon 25 Feb 2019]. "And we've noted that some of the moms with congenital syphilis have been using crystal meth and injecting drugs."

Winnipeg's police chief has said the skyrocketing use of meth is creating a crisis for police, treatment centres, and healthcare services. The Addictions Foundation of Manitoba has said meth use increased by more than 100 per cent in adults and nearly 50 per cent in youth since 2014. Isaac said the rise in injection drug use is linked to the increase in blood-borne illnesses such as syphilis.

Syphilis can have a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other conditions. Tests confirm whether a person has the infection and, once diagnosed, it is easily treated with penicillin.

The number of women and babies infected with syphilis recently rose in Manitoba, as an outbreak continues.

The province says one congenital case of the sexually transmitted infection, in which a baby was infected during pregnancy or childbirth, took place in 2015. That marked the 1st congenital case throughout the province in "many years," said Dr Michael Isaac, the province's acting chief public health officer. Another single congenital syphilis case was recorded in 2017. Then, in the last 6 months, at least 10 more infants were treated for syphilis, Isaac said. "We noticed in late 2018 and early 2019, a large increase in cases of congenital syphilis, especially in the last 6 weeks. The risk level has changed," he said.

Congenital cases of the infection can cause birth defects, miscarriage, stillbirth and other serious complications. While most syphilis cases in babies were found in the Northern and Winnipeg health regions, Isaac said the entire province is at risk. "I think the risk for congenital syphilis is really high across the province," he said. The doctor said 70% of the congenital cases involved pregnant women who used substances or injected drugs and 30% involved women who lacked prenatal care, though some cases didn't involve those risk factors. In Manitoba, every pregnant woman who seeks full prenatal care is tested for syphilis at least once.

Manitoba's syphilis outbreak began in 2014 but the spread of the infection has since increased between heterosexual partners. Before that change, the infection mostly occurred in urban areas and mostly affected men who have sex with men, said Isaac.

The number of women infected with syphilis jumped from 16 in 2014 to 168 in 2018, the province says. During the same period, the number of total syphilis cases rose from 118 to more than 350. Those numbers are expected to rise once again, as case reports are finalized, Isaac added.

The health officer said a surge in injection drug use, including crystal meth, appears to be related to the spread. "I think the injection drug use we're seeing in Manitoba certainly is linked with crystal methamphetamine use ... That certainly could be exacerbating the situation," said Isaac.

Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics. To reduce the risk of congenital cases, pregnant women are urged to seek regular prenatal care that includes a syphilis test. Those who have multiple sexual partners, have sex with someone who has multiple sexual partners, have sex without protection, and/or use intravenous drugs should be tested more often, according to Manitoba Health. If women with syphilis are tested and treated early in pregnancy, their babies are less likely to be severely affected by the infection, the province says.

[The 1st news report above characterizes syphilis as a blood-borne illness and links its increased incidence to the rise in injection drug use in Manitoba, Canada. Blood-borne pathogens are microorganisms that are present in the blood stream that can be transmitted to other people by means of blood. There are many different blood-borne pathogens that include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. These diseases can be transmitted by transfusion of blood, although transmission of syphilis in this manner is rare in developed countries. Syphilis is most commonly transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact with an infected lesion during oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

Syphilis is caused by _Treponema pallidum_, a spirochete bacterium. _T. pallidum_ bacteremia, which occurs during primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, can result in transplacental transmission of this organism to the fetus during pregnancy, causing congenital syphilis, and an increase in the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in women in the population is commonly accompanied by increasing rates of congenital syphilis.

It may also be possible to acquire syphilis by an injecting drug user who shares a contaminated needle/syringe with somebody who is infected (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9147154, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification. - Mod.ML
