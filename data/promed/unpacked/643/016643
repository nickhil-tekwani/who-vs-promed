Two people are in hospital in Afghanistan with possible bird flu symptoms
and their blood is being analysed to confirm whether they have the deadly
virus, an official said.
Afghanistan has not had any human cases of the H5N1 version of bird flu but
last week [23 Feb 2007] confirmed outbreaks of the virus in chickens and
turkeys in [the provinces of] Nangarhar and Kunar. The 2 patients are in
hospital in Kunar. "We are sure that their symptoms indicate they have bird
flu," provincial health chief Assadullah Fazli said. "Blood samples have
been sent to the capital for analysis."
Authorities in Kunar and Nangarhar are slaughtering birds and disinfecting
areas where the outbreaks were confirmed. Officials said this week that
around 4000 birds are being vaccinated each day.
