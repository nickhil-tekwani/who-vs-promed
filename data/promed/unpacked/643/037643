We have read with interest your post on [12 Feb 2018]: Equine herpesvirus, equine: EHV-8, possible association with abortion in mares, 20180212.5622069. The post mentions that researchers from Ireland and Scotland, writing in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, described how they sequenced the genome of 4 EHV-8 strains collected in Ireland between 2003 and 2015. 2 of these strains were collected from aborted foetuses in horses, and were misdiagnosed initially as EHV-1. 2 were isolated from nasal swabs taken from donkeys, 1 with neurological disease.

Recently we have described a similar case in a donkey (Kees van Maanen, Ellen van der Zaag, Rianne Buter, Linda van den Wollenberg, Marianne Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan. Asinine herpesvirus-3 (equine herpesvirus-8)-associated neurological disease in a donkey. Veterinary Record Case Reports, Dec 2017, 5 (4) e000498; DOI: 10.1136/vetreccr-2017-000498) that may be of interest to your readers. This case was also initially misdiagnosed as EHV-1 and presented by us as the first case of neurological disease in a donkey associated with EHV-8 (AsHV-3).

[It appears there may be some similarity in how these cases presented, possibly leading to the initial misdiagnosis.

Abstract:
A 30-year-old female donkey with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) was referred to the Department of Equine Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, for losing weight despite good appetite and treatment for PPID. A total of 12 days after returning home, the mare developed nasal discharge, and the next day it was found recumbent and was only able to stand up with manual assistance. The next day the mare showed severe tetraparesis, ataxia, and hypotonia of anus, tail and bladder, and it became completely recumbent. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy was suspected, and to confirm the diagnosis a deep nasal swab was taken. Because of the poor prognosis the mare was euthanased. The swab scored very strong positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and virus isolation was performed to enable further characterisation of the virus. The identity of the virus was again confirmed as EHV-1 with type-specific monoclonal antibodies, but sequencing identified the virus as asinine herpesvirus-3 (EHV-8).
