Indicating among "Measures applied" that vaccination is prohibited is in need of explanation. Vaccinations against FMD, as mentioned earlier in the Epidemiological comments notification, are practiced within South Africa's FMD protection zone, in which the described event took place. The prohibition relates to all other parts of South Africa.

During 2012, South Africa reported to the OIE 2 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) events, both caused by FMDV SAT2 strain in Mpumalanga province. The 1st event started on 9 Jan 2012, involved 2 outbreaks, and was declared resolved on 27 Jul 2012. The 2nd one started on 24 Apr 2012, involved 5 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 5 Jul 2012.

A recent new event was reported from Limpopo, caused by FMDV strain SAT1 (see ProMED-mail post 20130719.1834896).

The current outbreak in Mpumalanga has been caused, as in previous outbreaks there, by seroype SAT 1, similarly regarded endemic in wildlife (mainly African buffaloes). Additional details on the FMDV strains diagnosed in South Africa throughout the years, can be seen at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/sar.htm. - Mod.AS
