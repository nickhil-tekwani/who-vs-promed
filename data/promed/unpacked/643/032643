A crippling mosquito-borne disease is spreading at an accelerating
rate on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion, health officials say.
They say the number of cases of the viral illness, known as
chikungunya, had risen to 50 000, an increase of 15 000 in the past week alone.
The disease is not fatal, but those affected suffer high fever and
severe pain. There is no cure or vaccine.
Hundreds of troops have been deployed on the island to eradicate mosquitoes.
Officials said the troops would be spraying the whole island against
mosquitoes in the coming days.
The latest outbreak was first noticed there in February 2005 - but
has spread at an accelerating rate since December.
Meanwhile, neighboring territories are mobilizing to contain the disease.
On the Seychelles - where 2,000 cases have been reported in the past
4 weeks - the army has been mobilized to exterminate mosquitoes,
Reuters news agency reports.
The authorities in Madagascar also fear the disease may have reached
their island, AFP news agency says.
Chikungunya fever is named after a Swahili word meaning "that which
bends up" - referring to the stooped posture of those afflicted.

[The spreading speed at 15 000 cases per week, or 2143 per day, is
incredible. A bit of geography and climate may be of interest to our
readers. Reunion is located east of Madagascar and is a part of the
Madagascar archipelago. Situated between the equator and the tropic
of Capricorn, Reunion's climate is of tropical type (southern
hemisphere) with oceanic influence. The island is home to one of the
world's most active volcanoes. There are 2 seasons: cool or dry
season (May till October) and warm or wet season (November till
April). Currently it is in the middle of the warm season when
mosquitoes are most active and proliferative. The island was ruled as
a colony until 1946, when it was made a "departement" (=department),
or administrative unit, of France. - Mod.RY]

[2] Reunion - fatal case

A crippling mosquito-borne disease has claimed its first life and
infected more than 50 000 people on the volcanic French island of
Reunion, spooking tourists in the region, local authorities said.
The "chikungunya" disease, which is extremely painful and causes high
fever, was not previously thought to be lethal and there is no known
cure or vaccine.
The Reunion Regional Agency for Hospitalisation said late on Friday
the virus was the only explanation for the death of a 9-year-old in
January [2006].
The "chikungunya" fever is named after a Swahili word meaning "that
which bends up," referring to the stooped posture of those afflicted.
First recognised in epidemic form in East Africa in 1952, it also
leaves immune systems weak, providing opportunities for other
diseases to set in.
The disease, which has already travelled to the nearby Indian Ocean
islands of Seychelles, Mauritius and Mayotte, has prompted tourists
to cancel bookings.
Since 23 Jan [2006], the Reunion Committee on Tourism said at least
1500 tours had been cancelled and the costs incurred from
cancellations over the past 2 weeks were equal to its annual
advertising budget. It did not provide any figures.
On Thursday [2 Feb 2006], Seychelles said it had mobilised its army
to control the virus which has infected 2000 of the idyllic
archipelago's 80 000 people.
Reunion last week earmarked $720 000 to fight the outbreak, drafting
400 extra troops to help fight the mosquitoes that have spread the
disease for nearly a year.
In neighbouring Mauritius, authorities are screening people at the
airport and port, spraying places near hotels and guest houses and
warning the public to take precautions.
The Reunion authorities said they planned to set up a scientific
committee to better understand the disease. They said they had
registered some 25 deaths citing the virus as a possible cause.
Authorities say people should remove stagnant water, use mosquito
repellents and bed nets and spray bedrooms at night.

Mauritian authorities are on high alert after the identification of 2
confirmed cases of Chikungunya in Mahebourg. A ministerial committee
is chaired by the Prime Minister, Navin Ramgoolam, to decide on
measures to take to prevent infection by the _Aedes albopictus_
mosquito, which transmits this viral illness that is characterized
mainly by fever, muscular pain and joint swellings. 15 cases have
been registered from January up to 2 Feb 2006; the ministry of Health
in 2005 detected 3500 cases that it prefers to call suspected cases
of Chikungunya.
The government is buying equipment for disinfection in order to
destroy all mosquitoes liable to infect people. [Even if] the port
and the airport are watched closely by the Health Inspectorate
Division, there is no protocol to quarantine travellers arriving from
Reunion Island. A spokesman for the Ministry of Health said this
morning [3 Feb] that provisions for keeping people in quarantine
exist [only] in protocols on avian influenza and in cases of a
potentially fatal illness that is transmissible from person to
person. The Ministry of Health is requesting all hotels and all
medical practitioners in private practice to notify any suspect case.
Personal comment:
In Mauritius, the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak occurred in May
[2005] when several hundred cases were reported per week. The number
of cases started to fall in June and by September, only occasional
cases were reported. Most cases reported in January [2006] occurred
in people who had a history of recent travel to Reunion Island.
However, in the [last] 10 days, some cases in people without history
of travel have been reported. Some have been confirmed by virus
isolation in tissue culture from blood samples. With the exception of
the cluster in Mahebourg, the other cases live in different regions
of Mauritius.
Up to now, the situation with Chikungunya virus has been much less
dramatic than in Reunion Island. However, this may change. December
[2005] was very dry in Mauritius, and heavy summer rainfall did not
occur until 23 Jan 2006.

[ProMED is grateful for the timely information and comment given by
Dr. M. I. Issack from Mauritius. In the wake of the extraordinary
epidemic of chikungunya on Reunion Island, spread of the epidemic to
other islands seems inevitable. - Mod.RY]
