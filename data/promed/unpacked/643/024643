According to the state Department of Health, a Franklin County man is the
first person this year to have contracted [a hantavirus infection] in
Washington. This is the fifteenth reported Washington case. Because most
cases occur in the summer, state and local health officials are reminding
Washington residents, especially those living in rural areas, that the
disease can be prevented.
Seven of the 15 cases in Washington since 1985 have been fatal. Between two
and four hantavirus infections have been reported annually between 1994 and
1997. Eleven [10?] of the cases occurred east of the Cascade Mountains: two
[each] have occurred in Lincoln, Lewis, Stevens, Adams, and Franklin
counties. Yakima, King, Klickitat, Snohomish, and Grant counties have each
had one case each.
Monitoring of rodent populations in the southwestern United States has
shown a 10-20 fold increase in the numbers of mice [infected] with [a]
hantavirus [This may be correct for small foci but not as a general
statement regarding the entire southwestern U.S., which is quite large. -
Mod.CHC]. There is no statewide rodent monitoring effort in Washington, but
it is possible that similar increases in rodent populations have occurred
this year in certain parts of the state.
Of the 625 deer mice tested in Washington since 1993, about 10% were
hantavirus positive.
