At least 45 begin rabies treatments
---------------------------------------
The Rogers County Health Department held a special clinic Saturday
[31 Dec 2005] to begin treating people identified as at risk for
contracting rabies after drinking raw milk from a rabid cow.
Oklahoma State Department of Health officials announced last week
that people who drank raw, un-pasteurized milk or cream sold by Swan
Bros. Dairy in Claremore from 4-19 Dec 2005 may have been exposed.
So far, 45 people have begun receiving a regimen of rabies
vaccinations, officials said.
A Claremore resident and father took his 2 children to the Rogers
County Health Department before going to their grandmother's house.
A 15-year-old victim said she did not like having to spend part of
her Christmas Eve receiving shots, but that the injection was not too
painful. Her brother, a 13-year-old, said he was a little nervous
before receiving the shot, but said the experience was not as bad as
he thought it would be. The Health Department is normally not open,
but 17 employees worked at Saturday's clinic.
"The public health call goes out, and we respond," said Rick Garner,
a registered nurse for the department's communicable disease
division. "We are here to make sure the public is safe." By holding
the Saturday [31 Dec 2005] clinic, the Health Department can help the
public receive the injections with the "least amount of stress and
inconvenience possible," Garner said.
Most healthy people who drank the milk or cream are not at risk for
contracting rabies, Garner said. However, people with certain medical
conditions, including suppressed immune systems or oral sores, should
call the Health Department to determine whether post-exposure
treatment is needed.
Families flowed into the Rogers County Health Department on Saturday
[31 Dec 2005] morning, and people continually called. Many appeared
concerned that recent dental work coupled with raw milk consumption
put them at risk for contracting the virus. Garner said each person
who contacts the department is evaluated either in person or via
telephone to determine his or her level of risk. The preventive shots
range from USD 2500 - 4000 for the course of treatment. The post
exposure injections can cause side effects, including redness, fever
and fatigue, so shots are given only to those who are at high risk
for rabies.
The Health Department is working with Swan Bros. Dairy and its
insurance company to explore the possibility of paying the bill for
the vaccinations, said Dr. Mike Crutcher, state health commissioner.
One cow in the dairy's herd recently died from rabies, the state
Health Department confirmed on 20 Dec 2005. The dairy sells raw milk
at its Claremore farm, which began operating in 1923. Garner said
dairy owner Harley Swan Jr. has been very cooperative with the health
department's investigation. "The Swans have been very good people,
and they are trying to do the right thing," he said.
Since the Health Department issued a public health alert Wednesday
[28 Dec 2005], more than 500 people have called the state's hot line
and the Rogers County Health Department for more information.
Officials said the call volume dramatically decreased Saturday [31
Dec 2005], but not everyone who needs to be treated has started their
regimen of shots. Some plan to wait until after Christmas to begin
treatment.
Humans are usually exposed to rabies, a potentially fatal viral
infection that attacks the nervous system, when they are bitten by
infected animals such as bats, said Kim Rayno, an epidemiologist for
the Health Department. There have been no documented cases of human
rabies because of consumption of milk from a rabid animal, Rayno
said. However, because there is a chance for transmission, the Health
Department decided to issue a public health alert.
The milk that may have been infected was not pasteurized.
Pasteurization, a heating-and-cooling treatment that kills organisms
in the milk, would have killed the rabies virus, Garner said.
Un-pasteurized milk can also contain _E. coli_ and salmonella.
Milk sold at commercial stores and restaurants must be pasteurized,
and none of the possibly infected milk was used to make Swan Bros.
cheese, which is shipped across the country.
Swan said Friday [30 Dec 2005] that the dairy produced nearly 5000
gallons of milk from 4-19 Dec 2005. The infected cow's milk was mixed
with the milk of up to 70 other healthy cows, therefore diluting any
infected milk that could have been present. Additional tests are
being run to determine whether there was any of the virus in the
milk. Before this incident, Swan said, he did not vaccinate his herd
for rabies, but he will start doing so this week.
For information on potential rabies exposure from un-pasteurized Swan
Bros. milk, call the State Health Department hotline at (405)
271-0980 or visit

Callers may page an epidemiologist during the holiday weekend. Health
Department officials said they will have staff on call to answer
messages left on the hotline.

More people being treated for possible rabies exposure
-----------------------------------------------
More people are receiving treatment after possibly contracting rabies
from drinking the raw milk of a rabid cow, according to Oklahoma
State Department of Health officials.
As of Tuesday [27 Dec 2005], 62 people had been treated, up from 45
last week, officials said.
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested
the brain matter from the dead cow and concluded, as the state did,
that the animal had rabies. Initial state tests of the cow's udder
were negative for rabies, but results from CDC udder tests will not
be available until next week [1st week January 2006], said Dr. Brett
Cauthen, the state epidemiologist.
Health Department officials announced last week [4th week December
2005] that people who drank raw, un-pasteurized milk or cream sold by
Swan Bros. Dairy in Claremore from 4-19 Dec 2005 may have been
exposed to the virus.
The Rogers County Health Department held special clinics Saturday and
Monday [24 and 26 Dec 2005] to provide a preventive or prophylaxis
rabies regimen.
Cauthen said calls to the state's information hotline have decreased,
but the department is still receiving some inquiries each day from
concerned milk drinkers. He said officials suspect the cow was
infected when it was bitten by a rabid skunk, and additional
laboratory tests will confirm what type of animal infected the dairy
cow.
The Swan Bros. operators did not vaccinate their dairy herd, which
would have prevented the infection, but they plan to vaccinate their
animals this week.
The milk that may have been infected was not pasteurized.
Pasteurization, a heating-and-cooling treatment that kills organisms
in the milk, would have killed the rabies virus. Milk sold at
commercial stores and restaurants must be pasteurized, and none of
the possibly infected milk was used to make Swan Bros. cheese, which
is shipped across the country.
For information on potential rabies exposure from un-pasteurized Swan
Bros. milk, call the State Health Department hotline at (405)
271-0980.

[Rabies, a _Lyssavirus_, normally affects the neurological tissue.
However, the virus is most often transmitted through saliva or
contact with oral or gastric mucosa (1). Additionally, rabies virus
also has been detected in the kidney, prostate, pancreas, and other
tissues and body fluids (2). In naturally occurring cases, the proven
vehicle for transmission is saliva and neural tissue.
Anecdotal reports exist of rabies transmission by ingestion of milk
by a nursing lamb from its mother (1). However, in all of these
reports, a bite or mucous membrane exposure could not be ruled out.
Transmission of rabies virus in un-pasteurized milk is a theoretical
possibility.
The risk of contracting rabies through milk could be better defined
if samples of milk and mammary tissue were collected from rabid
livestock and assayed for the presence, viability, and infectivity of
rabies virus. Regardless of the amount of viable rabies virus that
may be shed in cow's milk, the theoretical risk for transmission of
rabies from this route can be eliminated if all dairy products are
pasteurized before consumption.
Another source of exposure have included neural tissues, such as a
transplanted corneas, and laboratory aerosols. Recently, the 1st U.S.
instance of human rabies transmission via solid organ transplantation
was documented in 3 recipients of a donor unsuspected of having
rabies; transmission via organ transplantation has also been
documented in other countries.
The development of rabies generally takes 10 to 90 days when the
virus is transmitted through a bite.
