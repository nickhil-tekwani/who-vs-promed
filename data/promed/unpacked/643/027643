Lassa fever situation report -- epidemiological week 15 (12-18 Apr 2021)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Key points:
Current week (15) (12-18 Apr 2021) / Cumulative 2021 week 1-15 / Cumulative 2020 week 1-15
Suspected cases: 43 / 1592 / 4386
Confirmed cases: 6 / 247 / 973
Probable cases: 0 / 3 / 14
Deaths: 0 / 50 / 188
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 0 / 20.2 / 19.3
Number of states affected: 2 / 14 / 27
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 52 / 127

Highlights
- In week 15, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 8 in week 14, 2021, to
6 cases. These were reported from 2 states (Edo and Benue) (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 15, 2021, 50 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 20.2%, which is higher than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (19.3%).
- In total for 2021, 14 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 52 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 79% are from Edo (44%), Ondo (28%), and Taraba (7%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 70 years; median
age: 30 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 10:9 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has decreased compared to that reported for the same period in 2020.
- No new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 15.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
- Conducted 2021 Lassa fever high-burden states preparedness/response engagement meeting
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to states
- The National Emergency Operations Centre alert mode activated 2021 for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment
- Deployment of National Rapid Respond Teams to 3 states to support Lassa fever response

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.

- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).

- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.

- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 6 new confirmed and 43 new suspected cases in week 15 (12-18 Apr 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now no deaths among confirmed cases for week 15 of 2021. Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 15) either.

The report above confirms that, so far this year (2021), Edo, Ondo, and Taraba states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected remained the same at 14, and the number of local government areas [LGAs] with at least one case increased from 51 to 52. Nigeria may now be entering the period of case decline. The peak is not as high so far this year (2021) as in previous years, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years and will be the case again for the year 2021, but at a lower level.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. One hopes that this is why there are fewer cases this year (2021).
