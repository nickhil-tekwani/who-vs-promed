Britain Says May Have Found Goat With BSE
-----------------------------------------------------
Britain said on Tuesday [8 Feb 2005] that a goat confirmed as having
the brain-wasting disease scrapie in 1990 may have had mad cow
disease.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
said it was informed of the possibility by scientists from the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency.
In January 2005 mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), was found in a goat in France, the 1st time the
brain-wasting affliction that ravaged European cattle herds and
killed at least 100 people had been diagnosed in another animal.

Possible BSE in a 1990 UK Goat Sample
--------------------------------------
Scientists at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency have informed Defra
that a goat, confirmed as having scrapie in 1990, may have had BSE.
More sensitive testing methods have found the sample had traits
similar to samples from goats experimentally infected with BSE.
Further tests will now be carried out.
The VLA made the finding following the recent case of BSE in a goat
from France. The VLA had been checking whether methods developed to
discriminate between scrapie and BSE in sheep could also
differentiate these diseases in a goat.
The goat appears to have originated from premises in Scotland;
investigations have revealed that the original keeper is no longer in
business at these premises.
The single result, using just one test method, is insufficient to
confirm that the goat had BSE, and further rapid molecular methods to
discriminate BSE and scrapie cannot be applied because no frozen
tissues are available.
Researchers from the VLA have been asked to carry out tests to follow
up these initial findings. Further work will now need to be performed
and this will take 1-2 years, at the least, to complete.
Defra's Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds, said: "It is
important to put this initial finding into context. It dates back to
1990, the height of the BSE outbreak in cattle, and before the
reinforced feed ban was introduced in 1996. This means that there is
a distinct possibility that the animal, if infected with BSE, was
exposed to contaminated feed.
"In light of the recent case of BSE in a goat from France, the
European Commission says it is important to perform increased
surveillance on goats on a European-wide basis to establish the
current incidence of TSEs in the goat population. In line with this,
Defra will be stepping up its TSE surveillance programme for goats."
Defra will be asking the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
for their comments on this finding at their meeting on the 3 Mar 2005.

British goat may have harboured BSE
------------------------------------------
A British goat which died in 1990 may have had BSE, UK government
officials revealed on Tuesday. The discovery means the infection may
have circulated in goats in the past, and may even be circulating at
low levels today.
This follows the recent disclosure of the 1st natural case of BSE to
be found in a goat -- a French animal that died in 2002. New
Scientist has learned that the British goat was discovered as a
result of the French case, as UK government scientists prepared for
the increased testing of goats after the discovery.
It has long been assumed that sheep and goats may have been exposed
to BSE in feed made from infected cattle. But unlike cattle, both
creatures can transmit such infections between individuals, which
might have kept the disease circulating after infected feed was
banned.
BSE in sheep and goats would also be hard to spot, as both can
naturally develop a similar disease called scrapie which has the same
symptoms, although it is not thought to pose a risk to human
consumers. And, unlike cattle, sheep experimentally infected with BSE
carry the infectious prion in muscle meat, so the infection in sheep
and goats could pose a greater risk to consumers.
For these reasons European Union countries have been testing sheep
and goats for BSE since 2002. These tests discovered the infected
French goat.
"We were involved in helping evaluate the French data in December,"
says Danny Matthews of the UK's Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the
EU reference lab for BSE. It was clear that the EU would probably ask
for increased testing in goats as a result, he says.
In fact, from February 2005, 80 percent of healthy slaughtered goats
over the age of 18 months, plus "high-risk" goats such as those found
dead or unable to stand, should be tested, officials have just
agreed. 3 different test methods -- called western blot, ELISA and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) -- will be used to distinguish scrapie
from BSE.
"We haven't had to test many goats in the UK," says Matthews. "But we
thought we should test our current IHC on goat brain to make sure it
distinguishes BSE." Besides goats and sheep experimentally infected
with scrapie or BSE, they tested 2 brain samples from goats thought
to have died of scrapie.
One of them gave an IHC result that looked like BSE. "We can't do the
other 2 tests, as we processed all the tissue we had from that animal
for IHC," says Matthews. But the team will nevertheless attempt to
extract enough tissue from the IHC test material to do the definitive
BSE test. This involves injecting tissue into mouse brain to see if
BSE develops. But that will not yield results for 2 years.
"What is important now is not what happened back in 1990, but whether
the infection is still circulating in goats," notes Matthews.

[The prevalence of clinical scrapie in goats is generally regarded to
be significantly lower than in sheep. Since April 2002, the EU member
countries have intensified their surveillance activities in small
ruminants, adding healthy animals at slaughterhouses to the
previously tested risk- and clinically-suspect animals.
During 2003, 37 561 healthy goats were tested in the EU
member-states, of which 16 -- in 5 countries -- were found
TSE-positive. The following table presents the published figures from
the said countries:
Country / appx adult goat population / healthy goats tested / TSE-positive
Greece / 3 900 000 / 6425 / 9
Spain / 2 330 000 / 6553 / 1
France /1 030 000 / 11 223 / 3
Italy / 820 000 / 3571 / 2
UK / 88 000/ 193 / 1
The TSE positivity ratio (positives per 10 000 tested) of healthy
goats in the EU15 during 2003 was 4.7. It was 52.4 in the UK,
compared to 14.0 in Greece (second to UK) and 3.6 in France. While
this might reflect the high scrapie incidence in British sheep, it is
also true that more testing for BSE in small ruminants was in place
in the UK. - Mod.AS]
