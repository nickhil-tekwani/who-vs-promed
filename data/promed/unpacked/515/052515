Polio in Tajikistan - Update 29 Apr 2010
------------------
171 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been reported by the
Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan from January (2010)
to present. 32 of these cases are confirmed wild poliovirus type 1
[WPV1]; results are pending for the remaining cases. The majority of
these cases have an onset of paralysis within the past 3 weeks. There
have been 12 deaths.

Of the 32 confirmed wild poliovirus cases, 17 are under the age of 2
years, 14 are between the ages of 2 and 5 years, and one is between
the ages of 6 and 15 years. 66 percent are male. To date, 15 of the
confirmed polio cases had paralysis onset during March [2010], and 17
have had paralysis onset during April [2010]. Information on
vaccination history is available for 21 of the 32 confirmed cases. Of
these cases, 2 (10 percent) have reported to have received less than
3 doses of OPV, and 19 (90 percent) received 3 or more doses of OPV.

All cases are reported from the southwest of the country, including
the capital city Dushanbe. This region borders Afghanistan and
Uzbekistan. Genetic sequencing has now determined that the poliovirus
is most closely related to virus from Uttar Pradesh, India.

In response to the outbreak, the government of Tajikistan confirmed
they are planning 3 supplementary rounds of immunization targeting
every child less than 5 years (approx. 1.1 million children).
Monovalent oral poliovirus type 1 vaccine [MOVP1] will be used to
quickly build immunity levels among children in the country. The 1st
round will begin in the capital Dushanbe and 6 surrounding districts
on [1 May 2010] with other regions to begin vaccination of children
less than 5 years on [4 May 2010]. Two additional national rounds
have been tentatively scheduled for 18-22 May [2010] and [1-5 Jun 2010].

Neighbouring countries are responding to the outbreak by heightening
surveillance at all health care facilities and reporting sites while
reviewing immunization status of children. Uzbekistan (target
population 2.89 million children less than 5 years) is planning 2
national rounds of supplementary immunization with efforts to
synchronize these rounds with Tajikistan in May [2010] and June
[2010]. A campaign in Kyrgyzstan to boost the immunity of children
against vaccine preventable disease including polio, which was
planned by the government as part of European Immunization Week, will
end tomorrow [30 Apr 2010]. Kyrgyzstan is planning to conduct
additional sub-national immunization days in defined geographic areas.

WHO maintains its recommendation not to impose restrictions to the
international movement of persons as a control measure at this time.
It is important that international travellers to and from polio
affected areas are adequately immunized against polio as recommended
in Chapter 6 of International Travel and Health.

[New information in the above WHO report includes some descriptive
epidemiology of the outbreak, including age distribution of the 32
confirmed cases to date (31 out of the 32 cases are 5 years old or
less), and vaccination histories (90 percent of the 21 cases in which
vaccination histories were available had a history of 3 or more doses
of vaccine).

According to newswires, there has been at least one fatality
attributable to polio (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_04_29/en/index.html>), and possibly
as many as 12 fatalities (see
<http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34558&Cr=polio&Cr1=>).

We await further information on results of the investigations on the
additional AFP cases (there were a total of 171 AFP cases reported to
date) in Tajikistan, and the results of the investigations on the 3
reported AFP cases in Uzbekistan.
