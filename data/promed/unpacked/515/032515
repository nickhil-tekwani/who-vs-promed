Since early September 2017, Namibia has reported 643 hepatitis E cases, including 50 that are laboratory confirmed. Three women died post-delivery.

Most cases have been reported from informal settlements within the capital, Windhoek, with 332 (52%) cases reported from Havana and 168 (26%) from Goreagab informal settlements. An estimated 89% of the population of these 2 areas use communal water points, and 62% practice open defecation.

The Ministry of Health has fully funded a national outbreak response plan and procurement of materials for outbreak response is ongoing.

Namibian Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) epidemiologists, Ministry of Health community health workers, and Red Cross volunteers, are conducting active case finding in the community and health facilities, referral to health facilities for treatment, and distribution of water purification tablets and education on hepatitis E prevention to households. Identification of cases among pregnant women and education of pregnant women living in informal settlements about hepatitis E are being prioritized.

The clinical course of hepatitis E is similar to that of hepatitis A with no chronic form of the disease. Jaundice, fever, loss of appetite and lethargy are common symptoms. People are infected primarily through the fecal-oral route, usually through contaminated water or food. There have been several cases of hepatitis E infection in France due to eating raw figatellu, which is made with pig liver.

[This article MAY provide some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 percent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

Of the 7 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation. Those genotypes appear to be transmitted from humans, whereas the others, most notably GT 3, are zoonotic infections spread usually by undercooked pork products. - Mod.LL
