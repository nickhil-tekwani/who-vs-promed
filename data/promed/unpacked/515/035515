The Galician Health Service (SERGAS, according to its initials in Spanish) confirmed that 2 additional positive cases of _Legionella_ [infection] have been detected in the As Gandaras nursing home for the elderly [Lugo Province, Galicia], which is administered by the Conselleria de Traballo e Benestar (Working and Welfare Council). Consequently, there are now 8 affected persons in this facility (see ProMED-mail Legionellosis - Spain (06): (GA) retirement home 20141113.2953454).

According to the SERGAS report, these 2 most recently affected persons have already been admitted in the HULA (initials for the Lucus Augusti University Hospital in Spanish), and are receiving therapy there, as has been the case for the other 5 elderly patients from the same nursing home. [They are said to be] "doing well". Of the 8 persons affected by _Legionella_ [infection], only one has already been discharged from the hospital.

On the other hand, with respect to the positive cases confirmed in the San Salvador nursing home in Guntin Municipality, where a 2nd _Legionella_ outbreak was detected in Lugo Province -- SERGAS confirmed that there are 3 patients still hospitalized in HULA, and all of them are also "doing well".

With respect to the As Gandaras nursing home, a spokesman from the Working and Welfare Council confirmed today [19 Nov 2014] that a "totally independent" circuit "for supplying warm water to this geriatric facility" has been implemented today, for each individual floor in the aforementioned facility.

The spokesman also pointed out that a "totally independent" pipe system has been implemented, in order to supply water for the 2 bathrooms used by healthcare workers in the nursing home, and they are located in the ground floor, one in the ladies' dressing room, and the other in the male dressing room.

The Territorial Authority for Galicia Council in Lugo reported that the implementation of these pipe systems for warm water in As Gandaras nursing home required that provisional "water distribution pipes" had to be placed "outside" the 8-story building. The [remediation] started last Saturday [15 Nov 2014]. The system will be operating until [28 Nov 2014], when a test will be carried out in order to determine if there are still pathogenic bacteria present in the warm water pipe system.

[This outbreak of legionellosis presumably involves legionnaires' disease, the more serious, pneumonic form of legionellosis, rather than Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of legionellosis. There now seem to be 2 outbreaks of legionellosis in Lugo Province at 2 different nursing homes: one at the As Gandaras nursing home in the city of Lugo, and another at the San Salvador nursing home in Guntin, a town 21 km (13 miles) southwest of Lugo.

People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers are particularly at risk for severe disease. Inhalation of infectious aerosols of _Legionella_ species generated from legionella-contaminated water is commonly thought to be the mode of transmission of legionnaires' disease. However, aspiration of legionella-contaminated tap water may be the source for legionella pneumonia in elderly people, who are prone to aspirate (http://legionella.org/media/14950/cab.pdf).

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

The town of Lugo, with a population of 99 241 in 2013, is capital of the province of Lugo in northwestern Spain in the autonomous community of Galicia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugo). - Mod.ML
