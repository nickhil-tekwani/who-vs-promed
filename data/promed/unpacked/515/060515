Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston say the number of typhus cases in Galveston County already has equaled the total for all of 2017.

The bacterial infection, likely spread by fleas on rats and opossums, once was thought eradicated in Galveston County. While rarely fatal, people can become extremely sick with pain and fever.

The Galveston County Health District reports 17 people with the infection so far this year. After years with no instances, the 1st new case was reported in 2012. Another 5 were reported in 2013.

An infectious disease expert at the medical school, Lucas Blanton, tells The Galveston County Daily News it's likely this year's [2018] number is "the tip of the iceberg" because not everyone goes to a clinic or hospital for treatment.

[Galveston is an island city with a population of about 50 000 in 2016 on the Gulf Coast of Texas; it is the county seat and 2nd-largest municipality of Galveston County and is within Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas). A map showing the location of Galveston can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galveston,+TX.

The state of Texas mandates reporting of rickettsial diseases to the Texas Department of State Health Services. A previous ProMED-mail post (ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA: (TX) increase cases, geographic expansion, 2003-2013 20170317.4908356) reported that typhus group rickettsiosis cases, mostly murine typhus, expanded geographically northward from 9 counties in south Texas (below the 28th parallel north) in 2003 to 41 counties in 2013, to include counties above the 28th parallel north, where Galveston is located (see Figure 2 A and B at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/4/16-0958-f2).

Using the number of cases for each Texas county in the news report above between 2008-2016, Nueces county, with a population of 340 223 in 2010, has the highest cumulative incidence (131.4 cases/100 000 population). Hidalgo county, with a population of 774 769 in 2010, has the next highest cumulative incidence of 86.9 cases/100 000. Cameron county, with a population of 406 220 in 2010, has an incidence of 61.8 cases/100 000; and Bexar county with a population of about 1.7 million in 2010, has 8.9 cases/100 000. - Mod.ML
