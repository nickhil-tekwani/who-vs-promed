London rail project faces centuries old anthrax threat
------------------------------------------------------
Officials have warned that an area in the city of London slated for
tunneling as part of the cross-London Crossrail scheme could be a
missing 16th century anthrax burial ground. "We may very well have
here at Number 10 Hayne St. the missing anthrax burial ground that
has been lost for 488 years," Conservative Lord James told the BBC.

A decision on the purchase of 10 Hayne St., currently a parking lot,
is expected to go ahead as planned despite the potential of the
anthrax contaminated bodies.

"Crossrail understands that there is a very small possibility of
buried human remains being encountered during the works at 10 Hayne
Street," Lord Adonis said, the BBC has reported, though, he added, it
is "highly unlikely that the works would release any anthrax spores
or bacteria causing plague." The bodies were buried there as a result
of churches refusing to accept the bodies of 282 victims of anthrax
outbreak that killed the entire population of Hayne St.

The threat of the release of anthrax at the site [was] first raised
by Lord James when the Crossrail Bill was passed in 2009. A deep
exploratory bore hole was dug in May 2009 that revealed human
remains, though no trace of anthrax was found.

Anthrax spores are able to lie dormant for centuries, though if
disturbed, they can spread through the air. Bubonic plague, which is
also feared to be at the site, is also able survive in plague pits.

The Crossrail scheme is meant to link towns by 2017 to the west and
east of London with Canary Wharf, the West End, and Heathrow.

[It will be interesting to see [1] if Crossrail finds the 16th
century burial ground on Hayne Street (records vary in their
reliability) and [2] if they find any evidence of human anthrax
there. Given that there were 282 'victims' it is highly unlikely that
any more than a handful, if that, were autopsied. With the corpses
unopened the amount of sporulation would have been minimal, and thus
the likelihood of recovering any spores less. While folklore would
have anthrax spores as immortal, even in the best circumstances they
do die over time. We just have one observation of a spore count on
the same ground and then there was a 30% over some 13 months. Long
term survival must involve starting with a very high number, e.g.,
Gruinard Island. On the other hand there were 282 bodies and it is in
a densely populated part of London.

It is hard to see but it is almost due west of the Barbican
Underground Station, and between Waterhouse Street and Long Lane, and
close to Smithfield Market.
