["Infection with _A. invadans_ is a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and farmed freshwater and estuarine fish. It has a complex infectious aetiology and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive _A. invadans_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions, typically leading to a granulomatous response. Infection with _A. invadans_ is most commonly known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). It is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis (MG), and ulcerative mycosis (UM)."

"_Aphanomyces invadans_ causes disease and mortality in farmed and wild fish, worldwide. Around 94 species of fish have been confirmed by histological diagnosis to be naturally affected by_ A. invadans_."

EUS has very devastating socio-economic consequences. - Mod.CRD
