[C] Update 30 - Significance of "super spreaders", situation in China 15
Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_15/en/>
Explanation of so-called SARS "super-spreaders"
"Super-spreader" is a term that has been used to describe certain
individuals with atypical pneumonia, now recognized as cases of SARS, who
have been implicated in spreading the disease to numerous other individuals.
The phenomenon of a "super-spreader", which is not a recognized medical
condition, dates back to the early days of the outbreak. At that time, when
SARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were
thought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and
were therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions
of isolation and infection control.
As a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the
absence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and
hospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed
SARS.
Since infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new
cases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly
reduced.
When investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is
important to look for points in the history of case detection and patient
management when procedures for infection control may have broken down.
China
The WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit
military hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military
hospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude
of the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but
hopes to visit others soon.
The decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China's
willingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland.
Yesterday, China's president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was
"very worried" by SARS.
The WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on
the status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon
to other parts of China.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths,
have been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new
cases and 10 deaths compared with the previous day. 9 of the 10 deaths
occurred in Hong Kong SAR. One death was reported in Singapore.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 15 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 3 PM 15 Apr 2003, an additional 42 patients were confirmed to have
atypical pneumonia following previous admission to public hospitals. They
include 11 healthcare workers (3 from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole
Hospital, 3 from Prince of Wales Hospital, 2 from Kwong Wah Hospital, 2
from Princess Margaret Hospital, and one from Queen Elizabeth Hospital).
The remaining 31 were other patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
A total of 243 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged
today. 127 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care units.
9 patients died in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, United Christian Hospital,
Princess Margaret Hospital, and Prince of Wales Hospital. This brought to
56 the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. The deceased
include 4 men and one woman, aged from 45 to 84, who have a history of
chronic diseases. The remaining are a 45-year-old man and 3 women, aged 32,
34, and 37. [according to a table in an annex at the above website link,
these latter 4 deaths were in individuals without a history of chronic
disease. - Mod.MPP]
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ no. discharged cases/ no. deaths
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 291/ 95/ 56
Patients, family members & visitors: 941/ 148/ 0
Total: 1232/ 243/ 56

SARS Situation Update 15 Apr 2003
As at 15 Apr 2003, 1 additional SAR patient has been discharged, bringing
the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 85. 64 SARS
patients remain hospitalised.
There are 4 additional SARS cases reported today, all linked to the
Singapore General Hospital (SGH) cluster. These are patients who had been
earlier admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) as suspect cases and who
have now been diagnosed as having SARS, as they have developed signs of
lung infection on chest-X-ray. They include 1 SGH staff member, 1
inpatient, and 2 visitors. A SARS patient in intensive care died today. He
was a relative of one of the 3 initial index cases.
Information on additional probable cases
So far, 62 persons are linked to the SGH cluster, comprising 41 probable
and 21 suspect SARS cases. They consist of 26 SGH staff, 16 inpatients, and
20 visitors. They are all currently warded in TTSH.
Summary of SARS cases
Below is the summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 85
Hospitalised: 64 (including 18 in intensive care)
Deaths: 11 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)
Total: 162
Suspected: 86 (including 7 children below 18)
Under home quarantine orders: 575

Update 31 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 15 Apr 2003
As of 15 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 296 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to
specific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific
community settings. The information contained in this update is based on
the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 105 probable and 139 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 37 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.

[In the past 24 hours, since the last update, there have been 66 new cases
and 10 new deaths reported. Of the deaths, 9 were from Hong Kong and one
from Singapore. As of 15 Apr 2003 the cumulative totals are 3235 cases and
154 deaths, reported from 22 countries. Of note, there were no reports of
new cases from China. As there has been significant speculation about
spread of SARS throughout China, one wonders whether this is a real "no
cases" versus there was "no reporting" in the past 24 hours. We look
forward to further information on the collaborative investigations in China.
The discussion surrounding the "super-spreaders" in today's WHO update
[1][C] is very interesting and logical (so much for theories proposed by
this moderator in yesterday's posting as well as earlier postings, albeit
this was just in response to earlier suggestions on the part of the
official agencies suggesting there were "super-spreaders"). According to
reports on the epidemiologic studies (which we have not seen as yet) the
"super spreaders" were observed early on in the outbreak when infection
control procedures had not been implemented. Many of the second-generation
cases in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada were related to contact within
the health care environment. Logically, with the introduction of infection
control procedures in the health care environment, this risk has been
markedly reduced. It would be very interesting to see diagrammatic
representations of the spread in the various locations where studied (such
as was presented in the 28 Mar 2003 MMWR article presenting the analyses
of the cases resulting from contact in Hotel M in Hong Kong
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5212a1.htm>) for additional
individuals responsible for multiple next-generation cases, by type of
contact spread involved, and date of onset of symptoms.
The newswires were filled with articles related to SARS, the overwhelming
majority offering no new information not available on the official websites
and presented here. There has been much mention of the economic impact of
this outbreak in terms of industries affected, most notably the travel
industry. This would include the airlines of the affected countries as
well as other airlines from Europe, the United States, and Australia that
have noted significant declines in traffic attributable to both SARS and
political events. Clearly in the global village we now live in, major
outbreaks have global economic impact. - Mod.MPP]
