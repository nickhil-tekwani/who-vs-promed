Since the last report on cases of rickettsioses released on Thu 23 Aug 2012, 8 cases have been confirmed by laboratory tests in the Municipality of Mexicali. However at least 20 more have been reported, still uncorroborated, but could be positive.

This was announced by Jose Guadalupe Bustamante Moreno, Baja California secretary of health, who further explained that the state agency has continued action against this disease, spraying in areas where there have been cases. For example, since the beginning of this campaign, 440 000 houses have been sprayed, 7 times each.

However, he explained that the public must also engage, keeping their homes clean, paying special attention to yards, where people tend to accumulate things that harbor for example ticks that transmit the rickettsiae.

[The outbreak is likely to be Rocky Mountain spotted fever which has a range going through parts of Central and South America. The following article discusses the infection in Mexicali:

Eremeeva ME, Zambrano ML, Anaya L, et al: _Rickettsia rickettsii_ in _Rhipicephalus_ ticks, Mexicali, Mexico. J Med Entomol. 2011; 48(2): 418-21.

Abstract
--------
Circulation of a unique genetic type of _Rickettsia rickettsii_ in ticks of the _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ complex was detected in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. The Mexican _R. rickettsii_ differed from all isolates previously characterized from the endemic regions of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in northern, central, and southern Americas. _Rhipicephalus_ ticks in Mexicali are genetically different from _Rh. sanguineus_ found in the United States. - Mod.LL
