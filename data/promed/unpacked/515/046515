The number of people who have died in Italy after being administered a flu vaccine made by Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has risen to 13. The Italian Medical Agency (AIFA) has warned against panic and stressed there is not proof yet that it was the vaccine that led to the deaths. However it said it had banned 2 batches of the product -- called Fluad -- as a precautionary measure, pending further studies.

AIFA said the European Medical Agency would start examining the problem today [1 Dec 2014], and would report back on [Thu 4 Dec 2014]. The Italian authorities issued a partial ban on Fluad on [Thu 4 Dec 2014] after 3 people died and a 4th had been taken seriously ill within 48 hours of being administered the vaccine. More cases came to light in the following days.

Firms insist on the Fluad's safety, with 65 million doses given in the last 17 years. Italy's regulatory agency has uncovered several additional deaths among patients vaccinated with Novartis' flu shot Fluad after 3 more fatalities prompted the agency to suspend the product last week [week of 24 Nov 2014]. In a statement, the AIFA [Italian Medical Agency] said it now has reports of 13 deaths among patients vaccinated with Fluad between [15 and 28 Nov 2014], with the latest involving an 83-year-old man who had multiple health issues and was on a number of different medications.

On [Fri 28 Nov 2014], the license for 2 batches of Fluad were suspended in Italy after reports of 4 deaths in people who had received the vaccine, although the regulator stressed it was a precautionary measure while an investigation tried to establish whether there was a link to the product. Now, 6 batches are under scrutiny. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also started a review of the situation, with its Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) due to complete its examination on [Thu 4 Dec 2014], according to AIFA.

Fluad has been on the market since 1997 and Novartis insisted that it has a "robust safety history" with some 65 million doses delivered over the last 17 years. The product has also been given to around 70 000 people in the context of clinical trials, said the company. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a manufacturing issue, which would be the most likely cause of an unexpected toxicity in a product that has such extensive use in the market. Preliminary testing had confirmed that the 2 suspect batches "are in conformity with all production and quality standards," said Novartis.

Nevertheless, the Swiss company said it was taking the reports very seriously and was collaborating with AIFA during the investigation. "Patient safety is our 1st priority," it said in a statement. Fluad was temporarily suspended from sale in Canada and Switzerland in 2012 after some batches of the product were found to exhibit protein 'clumping' but were subsequently deemed safe for use. 9 of the 13 Italian deaths have been in people aged over 80, according to AIFA, which reported that there was a roughly equal split between male and female patients. 8 deaths occurred within 24 hours of the vaccine being dosed, with all seen within 13 days, and there were 8 deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes.

The regulatory agency noted that 3.5 million doses of Fluad are being distributed in Italy at the moment and stressed the importance of vaccination in the elderly, saying that up to 8000 deaths a year in older people are partly related to insufficient flu vaccine uptake. Novartis' vaccines business is due to be transferred to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in an asset swap deal that will see the Swiss firm take over the latter's cancer portfolio, although flu vaccines are not included in that transaction and Novartis has said it intends to divest that business separately.

[Fluad is the only flu vaccine that contains Novartis's proprietary adjuvant, MF59. It was first licensed in Europe in 1997 and is now approved in 35 countries, but not in the United States, according to a company fact sheet. Italy's drug regulatory agency, AIFA, suspended 2 vaccine lots on 28 Nov 2014, after 3 people died within 48 hours of being vaccinated, according to Bloomberg News. On 29 Nov 2014 the number of suspicious deaths rose to 11, and subsequently the Agency put the number at 13.

PMLiVE, an online news service that covers the drug industry, reported today [item 2 above] that AIFA said the 13 deaths involved people who received the vaccine between 15 and 28 Nov 2014 and that 6 lots of the vaccine are now under scrutiny. The source reported that one of the death was an 83-year-old man who had multiple medical problems. 9 of the 13 Italian deaths have been in people aged over 80, according to AIFA, which reported that there was a roughly equal split between male and female patients. 8 deaths occurred within 24 hours of administration of the vaccine, and all within 13 days. The wisdom of vaccinating the very elderly should be reassessed.

Today (2 Dec 2014) Novartis said, "All Fluad batches have passed extensive analytical and safety testing and fulfilled all required quality standards. Preliminary results performed by the Italian authorities have not detected any manufacturing defect." The company said the deaths may have been only coincidental, since those who receive the vaccine are elderly.

"Fluad is indicated for and administered to elderly patients with the highest vaccination rates in patients with underlying cardiovascular and other chronic disease, making them particularly vulnerable to sudden clinical events independent of vaccination," Novartis said. "Due to the high level of natural deaths in the target population (estimated at 500 000 per year in Italy alone) and the high number of vaccines distributed (3.5 million in Italy) at times association between natural deaths and vaccinations" does occur.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on 28 Nov 2014 that it was working with AIFA and other European authorities to investigate "the cause of serious adverse events, including deaths, in a small number of elderly patients who had received Fluad flu vaccine." The agency said there was no evidence suggesting a causal link between the vaccine and the deaths. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
