[Since this outbreak is located close to the border with Viet Nam (where 556 outbreaks of ASF has been reported in 23 provinces/cities since February 2019 -- see http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/situation_update.html and ProMED archive list below), it should not be unexpected that African swine fever has now been reported in Cambodia.

Rotanokiri (Rattanakiri) is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondol Kiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos and Viet Nam to the north and east, respectively (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratanakiri_Province). See maps of Cambodia at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/cambodia-administrative-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6402092,11394.
