A fungal disease that threatens to wipe out many amphibians is
thriving because of climate change, a study suggests.
Researchers studying amphibians at a national park in Spain show that
rising temperatures are closely linked to outbreaks of the chytrid
fungus. Chytrid fungus is a major contributor to the decline of
amphibian populations around the world, threatening many species with
extinction.
Details are published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
"We have found an association between increasing temperatures and
amphibian disease in a mountain region in Spain," said Dr Matthew
Fisher of Imperial College London. "This is a global emerging
amphibian pathogen which is one of the worst vertebrate infectious
diseases found so far. It is causing a huge amount of extinction and
disease within amphibian populations."
More than 100 species of amphibians are known to be affected by the
chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_). Some are very
susceptible and die quickly while others which are more resistant are
carriers of the pathogen. The disease is already credited with wiping
out frogs and toads in large numbers in Australia and South America.
Dr Fisher and his Spanish colleagues uncovered an association between
the emergence of the disease and global warming while studying
changes in the number of midwife toads in Spain's Penalara Natural
Park between 1976 and 2002.
The chytrid fungus, or BD as it is sometimes called, infects the
skins of amphibians such as frogs, toads, salamanders and newts and
interferes with their ability to absorb water. Dr Fisher said climate
change could be worsening the impact of the disease in one of 2
ways. Warming temperatures could be reducing the amphibians' ability
to mount a successful immune response to the fungus. Amphibians are
cold-blooded so their ability to respond to the pathogen could change
along with the external temperature.
On the other hand, global warming could be increasing the fungus'
ability to grow faster on the amphibian and cause more
disease. "This is a wake-up call that we are losing biodiversity
fast," Dr Fisher said. "Climate change appears to be changing
patterns of disease and previously resistant species are becoming
highly infected -- even, in a number of cases, becoming extinct."
The Global Amphibian Assessment has warned that 1/3 of the world's
amphibian species are in danger of extinction, many because of the
chytrid fungus.
