Bird die-off perplexes scientists
-------------------------------------
Hundreds of the seabirds known as rhinoceros auklets have washed up on the
Southern Oregon coast, and scientists have not settled on an explanation
for the die-off.
The birds seem to be in good shape off California and Washington, a
researcher said.
"The questions in my mind are: is this something that's widespread in
Oregon? Is it a freak event, like a storm or something that's going to last
longer?" said seabird researcher Dr. Julia Parrish, an associate professor
of biology at the University of Washington.
Explanations include a storm that killed lots of birds as they were
gathering for breeding season, and warming ocean waters that are
inhospitable to the bird's food source.
There were no reports of an increase of dead auklets elsewhere, said
Parrish, executive director of the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team.
Beach observers said the birds started washing up this month [March 2006]
off Southern Oregon, and hundreds of carcasses, as many as 20 to 30 a mile,
were reported last week.
The birds live most of their lives at sea. They are scrappy, constant
fliers and look like little footballs, almost pointy on the ends, black on
top and white underneath.

[Rhinoceros auklets (_Cerorhinca monocerata_) are medium sized birds, about
550 grams, mostly grey/black and white. They have a prominent horn on their
bill during breeding season. They are most often found from British
Columbia, Canada down through Washington State and Oregon.
The cause could be a number of things mentioned in this article or even
domotic acid that is responsible for the die-off of these birds. We look
forward to a definitive report regarding the cause.
