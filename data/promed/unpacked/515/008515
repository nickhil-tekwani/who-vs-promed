The H1N1 pandemic is not yet over, although its most intense activity
has passed in many parts of the world, the World Health Organisation
(WHO) said on Thursday [3 Jun 2010] after a review of the flu
outbreak by independent experts.

The WHO emergency committee, composed of 15 external advisers, said
it remained critical for countries to maintain vigilance concerning
the pandemic, including necessary public health measures for disease
control and surveillance, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in
a statement. "We're still in the pandemic," WHO spokesman Gregory
Hartl told Reuters.

Chan said that pandemic flu activity was expected to continue, and
the committee would meet again by mid-July [2010] to review the
status of the outbreak once more data from the winter influenza
season in the southern hemisphere was available.

The panel met on Tuesday [1 Jun 2010], but Chan had delayed the
announcement until Thursday [3 Jun 2010] as the committee, whose
members were spread around the world for the meeting by
teleconference, put the final touches to the wording of their
recommendation.

Chan's decision, based on the committee's recommendation, means that
the outbreak, widely known as swine flu, remains at phase 6 on the
WHO's pandemic scale, which has been at the top level of 6 since June
2009.

The next meeting will decide to recommend whether to retain that
level, declare the pandemic has passed, or move into a transitional
"post-peak" phase. The U.N. agency's guidance on whether a disease
constitutes a pandemic determines how its 193 member governments
handle an outbreak, including stockpiling vaccines and antivirals.

WHO experts say that the virus remains a threat to some vulnerable
people, notably pregnant women, young children and those with
respiratory problems, and such groups would continue to need
vaccinations. "It is predicted that H1N1 will continue to be the
primary or overwhelming virus among influenza viruses for quite a
while," Hartl said on Tuesday [1 Jun 2010]. "Pandemic or no pandemic,
H1N1 will still exist. If there is no pandemic, it means that H1N1 is
behaving like a normal flu virus."

The WHO has been accused of exaggerating the dangers of the H1N1
outbreak, which emerged in April last year [2009]. Symptoms suffered
by most people infected with the virus have been mild. But WHO
experts fear it could spread easily among people if it were to mutate
into a more dangerous or lethal form. Laboratory tests have confirmed
more than 18 000 deaths from H1N1 infection, according to WHO
figures, but the actual global death toll is much higher and will
take at least a year after the pandemic ends to establish. The virus
is currently most active in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast
Asia, and activity in Africa is low or sporadic.

The emergency committee has been waiting for signs of how the virus
is developing in the southern hemisphere winter before making a full
pronouncement on its state. Chan usually follows the recommendations
of the committee, all of whose members except its chairman,
Australian professor John Mackenzie, are anonymous to protect them
from undue influence.
