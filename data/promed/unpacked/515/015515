Another outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been discovered in village poultry in Viet Nam.

[The HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Tra Vinh mentioned above was reported to the OIE on 26 Feb 2016 in follow-up report no. 6, available with an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19808.

This continuing H5N1 event started on 7 Nov 2015 and was summarized, as of 26 Feb 2016, as follows:

Total outbreaks = 5 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 44 869 / 3889 /3110 / 41759 / 0

Viet Nam applies stamping out policy in relation to HPAI. Since the start of this event, the "measures applied" section of the OIE reports (an immediate notification on 17 Nov 2015 and 5 follow-up reports); links to all at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=19102 indicated "no vaccination". However, in the current (No 6) follow-up reports, this has been changed to "vaccination in response to the outbreak". This change in policy warrants explanation and details on the region where the vaccine is being applied are requested".

Since 2003, Viet Nam has reported 127 human cases of H5N1; in 2014, 2 such cases were reported. - Mod.AS
