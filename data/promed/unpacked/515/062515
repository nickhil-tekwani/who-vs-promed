Outbreak of _Salmonella typhimurium_ PT 8
-----------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of food poisoning involving 60 people
in a large hotel restaurant in Cairns, Queensland. Initial
investigations by officers of the Tropical Public Health Unit
suggested seafood as the likely vehicle. Patrons dining at the
restaurant over several nights experienced illness, suggesting a
food item that had been prepared in advance in bulk and served
over this period. Serotyping of isolates from faecal samples
demonstrated _Salmonella typhimurium_, which was subsequently
phage-typed as phage type 8.
Further investigations strongly indicated pre-prepared egg-based
desserts, and culture of left-over items subsequently yielded
_Salmonella typhimurium_ PT 8 as well. Culture of the remaining
eggs has not yielded any _Salmonella_ spp.

[We are grateful for this official report. So now, where's the
smoking gun? The eggs weren't infected, so it must have been
someone who prepared the dessert. Stay tuned - Mod.JW
