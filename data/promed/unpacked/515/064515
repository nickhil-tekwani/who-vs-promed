Laboratory test results received Tuesday [5 Dec 2012] revealed a horse that had to be euthanized Saturday (1 Dec 20120) at Hawthorne [Race Course] was infected with equine herpesvirus.

A positive result had been expected since the horse, a 2-year-old filly, was discovered lying down in its stall and unable to rise, signs consistent with the serious neurologic form of the virus, known as EHV-1 [equine herpesvirus-1]. The filly had to be euthanized, becoming the 5th fatality resulting from an EHV-1 outbreak that began 14 Oct 2012 at Hawthorne.

The positive test having come back, horses stabled in the barn where the filly was housed, Barn E, will begin training with the group of Hawthorne horses that have been exposed to horses effected by the neurologic strain of the EHV-1 virus. Those horses are permitted on the track later in the morning after regular training hours have ended.

Hawthorne remains under an Illinois Department of Agriculture-imposed quarantine. The quarantine will expire if no horses at the track display neurologic signs of the virus for 28 days. The quarantine clock began its countdown on 1 Dec 2012, the day the lasted infected horse was euthanized.

Meanwhile, horses continue to leave Hawthorne for approved off-site quarantine facilities. The latest departures were 19 horses moved Wednesday (5 Dec 2012) to a facility in Illinois. The 1st trainer granted permission to leave sent horses to Kentucky on 23 Nov 2012. [This trainer] might have hoped to be allowed into his intended winter quarters at Fair Grounds earlier than if he had case remained at Hawthorne, but the New Orleans track issued a bulletin Wednesday (5 Dec 20120) saying that no horses stabled at Hawthorne anytime during the quarantine would be permitted at Fair Grounds "until further notice."
