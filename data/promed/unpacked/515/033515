A team of researchers and technicians of the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC) has been in Ponta de Pedras, in Marajo [Para state], since last Monday [17 Jun 2013] conducting an epidemiological investigation of an outbreak of toxoplasmosis. "It is important to make clear that, in practice, the outbreak has already occurred."

"What we are still having is some people with persistent clinical manifestations that are awaiting test results," explains the team coordinator of the IEC's work in Ponta de Pedras, Dr. Ediclei Lima do Carmo.

Epidemiological research is a field study conducted from diagnosed or suspected cases, and also people who had contact with the areas of occurrence but who are not ill.

The main objectives are to identify evidence of a possible source of infection, the most vulnerable groups, and risk factors, as well as confirm the diagnosis and determine the main epidemiological characteristics. Its ultimate purpose is to guide control measures to minimize the possibility of new outbreaks.

The Secretary of Health of Para State (SESPA) confirmed on Tuesday [25 Jun 2013] 40 cases of toxoplasmosis in Ponta de Pedras on Marajo Island [Para state]. The day before [24 Jun 2013], [SESPA] had confirmed 14 cases. The population is scared and is avoiding the consumption of meat.

The earliest reports began to emerge 2 months ago. A TV Liberal reporter spoke with a resident [who wishes to remain unidentified] of the municipality by phone. In her household there were 5 people with toxoplasmosis. "What worries us is not knowing the source of this disease. And that doctors will not treat people who do not have symptoms, and we are afraid of catching the disease. The suspicion is that it is coming from the meat, and the entire population is now not eating meat," she said.

A SESPA team is in Ponta de Pedras conducting new tests on the population. The technicians are also investigating to find what is causing the outbreak of the disease.

"It is too early to say that it is the meat, chicken or vegetables. The investigation will define it. As soon as the transmission route is defined, we will be able to develop control measures," said Reinaldo Lima, the endemic control coordinator of SESPA.

[Meat infected with _Toxoplasma gondii_ is a well-known source of human infection. However, meat that has been frozen for more than a week or cooked is not infectious. Another route of infection, well documented from Brazil (Bahia-Oliveira LM et al. Highly endemic, waterborne toxoplasmosis in north Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2003;9:55-62), is surface water and water reservoirs contaminated with _T. gondii_ oocysts.

The outbreak in Santa Isabel do Ivai, north-western Parana state, reported by ProMED-mail in 2002 (archive no. 20020112.3237), originated from a water reservoir contaminated with _T. gondii_ oocysts.

We do not know the geographical distribution of cases, but if this outbreak is limited to a small urban area (Ponta de Pedras), it would suggest that it is likely a waterborne outbreak rather than transmitted by meat. It would be expected that meat and meat products were distributed over a larger area, and looking at a map of where the patients live in relation to their water supply would be interesting.
