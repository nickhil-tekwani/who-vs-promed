Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever deaths continues to increase; now 146
-----------------------------------------------
Angola's Marburg fever epidemic has claimed 14 more lives, taking the death
toll in the worst recorded outbreak of this viral disease to 146, the
country's health ministry said on Sun 3 Apr 2005.
While the outbreak has been confined to the northern province of Uige,
residents in the capital Luanda were taking no chances, as they scrambled
for supplies to disinfect their homes, emptying store shelves of household
bleach. "They've literally bought us out. We don't have a single bottle of
bleach left," said one sales assistant in a small Portuguese-run grocery
shop in the teeming city center. "People are really scared about catching
this horrible disease, so they're trying to disinfect everything," said
another shop worker in a large supermarket. Many of the measures the
government has promoted to avoid catching the rare hemorrhagic fever
involve respecting basic rules of hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 1 Apr 2005 that Angola's
outbreak was the deadliest ever from the disease, which is [similar] to
Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The previous record was 123 deaths among 149 cases
in an epidemic during 1998-2000 in the neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo. Most of the victims were gold miners.
The WHO has deployed 20 experts to help combat the viral fever,
characterized by headaches, nausea, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. It is
spread through close contact with bodily fluids, including saliva and
perspiration. The victims have included an Italian doctor who was treating
people with the virus.

A comment on Marburg hemorrhagic fever transmission
-----------------------------------------------
Dan Bausch has much of the thinking correct here [see: ProMED-mail posts
"Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (11): age distr... 20050331.0935, and
Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (12) 20050401.0939]. But the incredible
aspect of this unparalleled outbreak in Africa by a filovirus simply has to
be the equation of 6 months, a 95 percent fatality rate, and 4 out of 5
patients being small children.
I am far less interested in the gene sequences of the strain(s) of Marburg
virus involved than in the ongoing history of what seems most likely to be
the use of dirty needles to immunize young children against one of the
maladies that are differentially significant for that age group. We all
pray that careful epidemiology, in addition to specific diagnosis (thanks
again to Winnipeg and Atlanta) and patient care utilizing, at last, the
basic protective gear for those who answer the call to provide for the
sick, will sort out the tragic, most likely uninformed, human basis for the
ongoing tragedy thrown upon the innocent children of Angola.

[Dr. Johnson's comment and concerns about the possibility that contact of
the less than 5 year olds with the health care sector in Angola may be
responsible for transmission of Marburg fever is a real concern. A major
focus of international partners (such as the World Health Organization
[WHO], the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF], the World Bank, and
others) involved in childhood immunization activities has been "safe
injection practices". The basic focus of this is to guarantee that one
needle and one syringe are used per dose of vaccine administered, and that
the needle and syringe used in immunization activities are safely disposed
of after the single use. There has been a lot of research on the
development of "auto-destructible" syringes that can only be used once, to
prevent a recycling of needles and syringes already used in vaccination
programs into those for use (multiple use) in the curative sector where
medications are administered. (more information on this can be found at
<http://www.who.int/immunization_safety/safe_injections/en/> and
<http://www.childrensvaccine.org/html/safe_injection.htm>.
In a review of the literature on injection practices, Hutin et al (see ref
1 below) found that: "The analysis excluded 4 regions (predominantly
affluent, developed nations) where reuse of injection equipment in the
absence of sterilisation was assumed to be negligible. In the 10 other
regions, the annual ratio of injections per person ranged from 1.7 to 11.3.
Of these, the proportion administered with equipment reused in the absence
of sterilisation ranged from 1.2 percent to 75.0 percent. Reuse was highest
in the South East Asia region "D" (7 countries, mostly located in South
Asia), the eastern Mediterranean region "D" (9 countries, mostly located in
the Middle East crescent), and the western Pacific region "B" (22
countries). No information regarding injection safety was available for
Latin America." They concluded that: "Overuse of injections and unsafe
practices are still common in developing and transitional countries. An
urgent need exists to use injections safely and appropriately, to prevent
healthcare associated infections with HIV and other bloodborne pathogens."
A study prepared byvan Staa and Hardon for the WHO Action programme on
essential drugs (see ref. 2 below) demonstrated a high proportion of
individuals having received injections in the 2 weeks preceding the
study. In Indonesia 40 percent of households had received one or more
injections, in Uganda 30 percent of households had received one or more
injections in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. In both countries, 6-7
out of 10 visits to the health care facilities were associated with the
patient receiving an injection. With respect to injection equipement, in
Indonesia disposable syringes were reused by health care providers, and in
Uganda, households brought their own infection equipment to health
facilities, but sterility procedures were not supervised guaranteed in this
latter case.
Simonson et al (see ref. 3 below) did a literature review addressing the
transmission of bloodborne pathogens related to unsafe injection practices
in the developing world. From this study they estimated that each person
in the developing world receives an average of 1.5 injections per year. In
addition, institutionalized children, and children and adults who are ill
or hospitalized, including those infected with HIV, are often exposed to
10-100 times as many injections. They noted "an average of 95 percent of
injections were therapeutic, the majority of which were judged to be
unnecessary." They found that "at least 50 percent of injections were
unsafe in 14 of 19 countries for which data were available. 18 studies
reported a convincing link between unsafe injections and the transmission
of hepatitis B and C, HIV, Ebola and Lassa virus infections and malaria. 5
studies attributed 20-80 percent of all new hepatitis B infections to
unsafe injections while 3 implicated unsafe injections as a major mode of
transmission of hepatitis C". They concluded that "unsafe injections occur
routinely in most developing world regions, implying a significant
potential for the transmission of any bloodborne pathogen. Unsafe
injections currently account for a significant proportion of all new
hepatitis B and C infections. This situation needs to be addressed
immediately, as a political and policy issue, with responsibilities clearly
defined at the global, country and community levels"
Given the long history of civil unrest with disruption of the health sector
in Angola, it would not be surprising to learn that supplies to the
periphery (and Uige Province is in the northern sector of Angola, a
significant distance from the capital city Luanda) have been somewhat
deficient, and that needles and syringes were reused in health facilities
due to a lack of supplies, in keeping with studies conducted in other
developing countries.
Presumable the epidemiologic studies conducted in Angola will be addressing
these issues in the attempt to define risk factors for development of
Marburg disease in this unprecedented outbreak.
