Ontario Provincial Province (OPP) officers put down 3 raccoons with distemper over the weekend [5-6 Oct 2013] in Collingwood, including one which tried to attack one woman's 3 dogs.

[KDN] came home on Saturday [5 Oct 2013] at 2 pm and saw tiny pawprints leading up to the deck, which is enclosed with a gate. She said she assumed it was a cat and let the dogs into the house.

"I went back outside to unload the car and, lo and behold, they were going absolutely crazy. There was a big, huge raccoon on our deck going in circles."

She said it was trying to get through the patio windows to the dogs. She watched the raccoon slip in between the 4-inch [10 cm] gap between the rails on the deck, despite the animal's size.

As nocturnal animals, seeing raccoons active during the day is a sign they could have a disease.

Dr Erin Marley, a veterinarian at Bellbrae Animal Hospital, said dog owners shouldn't be worried about the virus spreading to their pets if their dogs are up-to-date on their vaccinations.

Marley said the virus spreads through all bodily secretions, primarily respiratory, but also urine. The 1st symptoms are discharges from the eyes and the nose, progressing to vomiting and diarrhea. The last stage is neurological and can range from weakness to seizures.

"The neurological phase is the hardest," said Marley, noting the virus can be fatal at any stage of its development within the animal without treatment.

She said the symptoms of distemper look very similar to rabies and no one should try to contain an animal with these symptoms.

Marley said local authorities -- either police or animal control -- should be contacted immediately if a raccoon exhibits symptoms related to either disease.

The Blue Mountains had a similar issue with distemper in raccoons and skunks earlier this year [2013].

[KDN] called the humane society and didn't get an answer, so she called the police.

"They came along with the animal control and sadly had to shoot it, and (officers said) that was the 4th (call) in Collingwood on Saturday [5 Oct 2013] alone."

Constable Martin Hachey said the OPP have received 150 calls regarding raccoons in roughly the past 6 months, and officers have had to put down about 60 in that time period within the detachment area, which includes Collingwood and The Blue Mountains.

Hachey said officers had to kill 3 animals on Saturday [5 Oct 2013] because they appeared to be diseased.

[KDN] hadn't heard about the animals being an issue in town and contacted her vet, who advised her to clean where the raccoon was with bleach and water. "They said, 'yes, there is an epidemic with distemper in raccoons in the area'."

She said her dogs are small to medium-size and the raccoon was much bigger, and very wide. It pushed over a heavy folding table leaning against the gate.

"It wasn't afraid of my husband when he came home or my neighbor. It wasn't afraid at all."

She wants more people to be aware of the issue to keep their pets safe.

Her vet said any plastic bowls the raccoon came in contact with should be thrown out and stainless steel or glass bowls should be sterilized. "With the bowls being left outside, whether it's food or water, make sure that's cleaned," she said.

Distemper is contagious to dogs, but not humans.

Marley said there is no one reason for the outbreak of the virus.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization.

It is very important to make sure to keep up to date the vaccination schemes, including both rabies and distemper, of all dogs in the area. - Mod.PMB
