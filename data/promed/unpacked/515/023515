The Departmental Health Service (SEDES) of La Paz reported yesterday [30 Nov 2018] that this year [2018], to date, 1101 positive cases of leishmaniasis have been reported. "We have 1101 cases reported and confirmed with a laboratory in the department of La Paz," said Gunder Gutierrez, head of the SEDES vector-borne diseases program. He recommended that people take preventive measures if they visit endemic areas, such as using repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing and avoiding staying out in the open after sunset.

Gutierrez indicated that in the La Paz municipality of Ixiamas, where the Madidi National Park is located, this year [2018] 42 cases were reported, and this sector registered 2. He indicated that there would not be an epidemic in that sector, but if the vector issue is in that place.

According to the authority, to access the medication, patients have to meet a series of requirements, such as the clinical record, epidemiology and personal documents, among others. The Dermatology unit of the Hospital de Clinicas de La Paz reported on Thursday [29 Nov 2018] the outbreak of cases of leishmaniasis in the Madidi, a tourist site that is located in the northeast of the department of La Paz.

The specialists explain that the vector now adapts to the urban areas of the Yungas of La Paz. "We have cases of leishmaniasis in Arcopongo, Palos Blancos, Caranavi, La Asunta, Chulumani and others; in fact, from the Yungas of La Paz, but what is striking is that Madidi patients have begun to arrive," the chief of the Dermatology unit of the Hospital de Clinicas de La Paz, Sandra Encinas, said.

Encinas explained that the Hospital de Clinicas is the only place where the treatment for leishmaniasis is performed. "Before we had few patients, but now we register at least 15 a month," he said.

[Leishmaniasis in Bolivia has been reviewed (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 2012;7(5):e35671 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671).

Bolivia has the highest incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America, with 33 cases per 100 000 population reported in 2006. In the department La Paz, the forest of the Yungas area is highly endemic for CL. Most CL cases are caused by _Leishmania braziliensis_, and 10% to 20% of all CL cases progress to mucosal leishmaniasis, more than anywhere else in the Americas, with the municipality of Palos Blancos in the Yungas region the most affected. In addition, 12% of dogs are seropositive in areas highly endemic for CL. - Mod.EP
