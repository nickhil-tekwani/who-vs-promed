Ukraine is going through a tuberculosis outbreak, and one organization believes it could have been avoided. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation [AHF] Ukraine said at a recent press conference that the outbreak is due to the failure of state procurements to obtain essential medications. The foundation's activists are pushing for immediate measures to be taken to address the crisis, including the distribution of medical supplies to the country.

"In Ukraine, medications are procured annually by the Ministry of Health," AIDS Healthcare Foundation Ukraine head Serhiy Fedorov said. "The inability of the previous procurement team at the ministry to ensure the supply of life-saving medicine for 6 months has had a devastating impact on our country's citizens. Almost 50 000 people will need these drugs early next year -- and even the most inexpensive medications for treatment of regular tuberculosis are unavailable in the country. With almost 9500 patients with drug resistant TB and 8290 people living with HIV and TB, there is an undeniable need for immediate access to these essential medications."

That said, the ministry has made several attempts to get the medications since July [2014] and all but isoniazid, a 1st-line treatment drug, have been procured. Still, the TB drugs have not yet been delivered to the healthcare facilities, and this has forced the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria to provide a short-term urgent supply, but even that amount only covers part of the total needed.

Without adequate medical treatment, TB has the potential to wind up as a full-blown epidemic. "Every individual using public transport or staying in the places with high concentration of people (shops, offices, movie theaters, malls) faces the risk of contracting TB," AIDS Healthcare Foundation Ukraine medical coordinator Dr Yaroslava Lopatina said.

Each year, nearly 30 000 people in Ukraine are diagnosed with tuberculosis, with the disease killing more than 6000 individuals.

After the press conference, AHF Europe had a face-to-face meeting with Alexander Kvitashvili, the newly appointed minister of health of Ukraine, where Kvitashvili confirmed that obtaining TB medications is at the top of his agenda.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is spread from person to person through the air via tiny particles about 1 to 5 microns (micrometres) in diameter that contain _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, called droplet nuclei, which are expelled into the air when a person with untreated pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes. Droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air for several hours, carried by air currents. When another person inhales air that contains these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur. Contagiousness is directly related to the number of _M. tuberculosis_ that is expelled into the air.

People ill with pulmonary TB can infect up to 10-15 other people through close contact in the course of a year. The greater the number of bacilli expelled, the more contagious the person is. Contagiousness is increased if the patient is coughing and has untreated cavitary pulmonary disease. Contagiousness declines rapidly after appropriate treatment is started. Transmission usually requires close, repeated or prolonged contact with an infectious individual in a poorly ventilated environment. Exposure to someone with contagious TB is especially a problem for individuals who are immunosuppressed, such as those who are co-infected with HIV, and as a result are more likely to become sick with TB. People with extrapulmonary TB are usually not contagious.

The inability to rapidly start a person with contagious TB on an appropriate multidrug regimen is a public health hazard and requires immediate corrective action. The news report fails, however, to give reasons for the lack of anti-TB drugs in Ukraine and the inability to distribute points of care those drugs that have been procured. All the anti-TB drugs in a multidrug regimen must be given simultaneously. Starting one drug at a time as they become available will only lead to drug resistance. Multidrug resistant-TB, defined as TB with _M. tuberculosis_ strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, is already a threat to public health in Ukraine and other countries that were former Soviet Union countries (see ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - France (02): ex former Soviet Union, MDR 20130818.1886543).

More information from knowledgeable sources on the reasons for anti-TB drug shortages in Ukraine would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
