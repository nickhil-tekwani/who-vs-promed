An outbreak of FMD registered in the east of Tajikistan
-------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in cattle has been registered in the
Tajikabad region of East Tajikistan. There are 100 affected animals in the
Nushar settlement, the Committee of Emergencies announced today [7 Jun 2007].
The head veterinary officer of Tajikabad region confirmed the outbreak,
noting that only 50 animals are affected. "The focus of infection is
identified, sick animals are isolated, preventive measures are taken in all
the village farms, the trade of beef is prohibited," he said.
"The representatives of veterinary service and Committee of Emergencies
departed to the location to clarify the situation," the head of veterinary
service Mulojan Amirbekov said. According to him, the last outbreak of
disease was registered in Tajikistan in 2004.

According to OIE's Handistatus epidemiological database, foot and mouth
disease (FMD) was last reported in Tajikistan, in large and small
ruminants, in 2003. In May 2007, FMD has been reported from several parts
of Tajikistan's northern neighbour, Kyrgyzstan. An official notification,
confirming the outbreak in Kyrgyzstan as caused by FMD virus serotype A,
was published by the OIE on 7 Jun 2007
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5538>.
The report included the following epidemiological comment:
"FMD serotype O was identified by the OIE's Reference Laboratory of
Pirbright, United Kingdom, on samples received in 2006. This event was not
officially notified by the country to the OIE despite the request made on
12 July 2006."
Official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the current information on FMD
in Tajikistan is expected, followed by a detailed notification to the OIE.
