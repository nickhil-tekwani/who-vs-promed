JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS - BELGIUM EX CHINA (04)

In response to the request for further discussion about how to prevent
Japanese encephalitis (JE) infections in travelers to endemic and seasonal
epidemic areas of JE (ProMED-mail post 20050413.1070) - Mod.RY], it seems
to me that one way of preventing JEV infection (not "JE infection") would
be to get vaccinated. I suspect Belgians would have access to the Austrian
vaccine. A nosocomial infection sounds like a stretch [prison allusion? -
Mod.SH]. The Chinese certainly should be able to diagnose a JEV infection,
so I suspect the patient did not have JEV infection when she was first ill.
A 10 year old might be quite stressed moving from Belgium to China; has
anyone considered a herpesvirus infection as the cause of the 1st illness?
She was seronegative for JEV antibodies when 1st tested (in China) but, in
her 2nd illness or phase of illness, she had on 24 Aug 2004: IgG = 32 IgM =
256; and on 2 Oct 2004: IgG = 256 IgM = 32.
The 24 Aug 2004 results were rather high for IgM and low for IgG,
suggesting the infection was fairly recent (within the past 2 weeks or so),
and the 2 Oct 2004 diagnostically significant increase in IgG and
diagnostically significant decrease in IgM indicated recent infection
(which we already knew). My guess, and it is purely a guess, is that the
patient had been infected a week or 2 at most before 24 Aug 2004. Admission
in mid-July 2004 suggests that it was for a 1st illness. Had she been
infected with JEV in early July 2004, her IgG and IgM likely would have
been detectable by the time of her hospitalization and, if not, then her
IgG titer would have been >32 by 24 Aug 2004. I am guessing the presence of
2 illnesses, the 2nd having been JEV. However, (a) individuals are
individuals and do not all react as textbooks indicate, (b) I am assuming
the IgM assays were antibody capture ELISAs, and (c) I am in Colorado and
the patient is a long way from here, so my guesses are just that. Too bad
the Chinese did not do PCR for JEV RNA in her blood when she was 1st
hospitalized. It could be done now if the blood is still available. It is
an interesting case.

[Among the points raised by Dr Calisher, I find his assumption (a)
intriguing, in that immune responses do not always follow the pattern that
textbooks indicate for all individuals. It is not unusual that there are
occasional slow immune responses, as in other viral infections such as HIV.
