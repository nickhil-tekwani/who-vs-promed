[1] Breakthrough infections
Date: Sun 22 Aug 2021

For most of the year, Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the northern tip of Cape Cod, has around 3000 residents. In summertime, however, it becomes a vacation destination and gay mecca. Thousands of visitors typically descend for festivals, concerts, parades, comedy shows, and parties organized around themed weeks. Almost all of this has been suspended during the pandemic; in June [2021], Provincetown didn't record a single coronavirus case. Then, in early July [2021], thousands of gay men arrived for Circuit Party week. The crowds thrummed with a sense of post-pandemic exuberance. The weather was rainy, and people squeezed into indoor venues "to the point you could hardly move," one reveller, from Ohio, told the Washington Post. Another, speaking with NPR [National Public Radio], recalled that it would "get so incredibly hot in these clubs that you would just be wet with sweat, so you'd have to step outside for a moment just to get a breath of fresh air."

Not long afterward, dozens of attendees developed symptoms of COVID-19. Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly identified 469 new cases among Massachusetts residents. Almost all of the infections were due to the highly contagious delta variant, and nearly 3/4 occurred in vaccinated people. By mid-July [2021], the test-positivity rate in Provincetown had soared to over 15%. Perhaps the most concerning finding about the outbreak was that, judging by their nasal swabs, vaccinated and unvaccinated people were harboring similar levels of the virus.

To some, this discovery suggested that immunized individuals might spread delta more readily than previously thought; it prompted the CDC to recommend that all Americans, regardless of vaccination status, resume wearing masks in public, indoor spaces when in locales with "substantial" or "high" COVID transmission. (According to the agency's definition, those designations apply to more than 90% of counties in the US.)

Many people heard about these findings late last month [July 2021], when they appeared on slide 17 of an internal document from the CDC, which was widely published in newspapers. The deck contained a few other concerning messages -- that some 35 000 vaccinated people experience symptomatic coronavirus infections each week; that the proportion of vaccinated individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 has increased; that the delta variant likely inflicts more severe disease than its predecessors. A single phrase in the deck was quoted in headlines: "The war has changed."

Even before Americans learned of the Provincetown outbreak, nearly 2/3 said that they were worried about the rise of delta. Vaccinated people were much more likely to express concern, a sign that fear of breakthrough infection was starting to puncture the promise of post-pandemic life. Since then, American optimism has cratered, with a 49-point drop in the number of survey respondents who say that our situation is getting better. We're now more pessimistic about COVID-19 than at any point since January [2021], when we were in the midst of the nation's deadliest weeks.

But to what degree has the war really changed? How much do we actually know about breakthrough infections and their possible dangers? Understanding the risks is not easy. The lockdown mind-set, despite its obvious drawbacks, was cognitively simple; life in the liminal state asks us to carry a heavier mental load. This is especially true because the term "breakthrough infection" is vague. A breakthrough infection could be an illness that knocks you flat, a tickle in your nose, or nothing. Regular reports of breakthroughs suggest that we should be scared. But what exactly should we be scared of?

In one sense, defining a breakthrough infection is straightforward: you have one if you test positive 2 or more weeks after completing all recommended doses of a COVID vaccine. But, in another sense, the meaning of the term is unclear. A highly sensitive PCR test has detected some of the virus's genetic code inside your nose. So what?

"Your body doesn't produce infinite amounts of antibodies," Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization who studies the push and pull between hosts and pathogens, told me. "Your lymph nodes are not, like, the horn of plenty." It's possible to be exposed to more virus than the antibodies in your nose can handle. Still, Rasmussen said, "When you've been immunized and get an 'infection' " -- she raised her hands in scare quotes -- "or, I should say, when you test positive by PCR, that doesn't mean there's a robust viral infection raging in your body. Even if some cells do get infected, other parts of the immune system spring into action and stop it from spreading." She went on, "Is that an infection? That's a philosophical question. Technically, some cells got infected and the virus started to replicate. But the immune system prevented you from getting sick and shedding copious amounts of virus that can go on to infect someone else."

Rasmussen thinks that, when it comes to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases, the term "breakthrough infection" is somewhat misleading. "It doesn't describe how vaccines work very well," she said. In such cases, the vaccines have actually succeeded, and there's no meaningful sense in which the virus has broken through. Instead of using the breakthrough metaphor, Rasmussen suggests imagining an encounter between 2 armies. "The immune system has multiple specialized units that can be deployed strategically and dynamically," she said. "The virus has some tricks up its sleeve, but, compared to the human immune system, it doesn't have as much at its disposal. It's like 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Troy': one army usually kicks the other's ass. If you're vaccinated, your immune system is ready, it's better equipped, and it usually kicks the virus's ass."

But not always. In some cases, the virus gains a foothold, multiplies, and challenges even a primed immune system, inflicting real disease: a true breakthrough. Michel Nussenzweig, a molecular immunologist at Rockefeller University, told me that 3 main factors influence the course of events. First, there are your antibody levels; 2nd, there's your antibodies' affinity for a particular variant; and, 3rd, there's the amount of virus to which you've been exposed. Whether a small viral incursion escalates into a major battle depends on how those factors combine.

Antibody levels rise and fall: right after infection or vaccination, B cells in our blood produce huge numbers of them, but, as the months pass, antibody levels decline. The key question is how these declines affect the course of a coronavirus infection. Declines might make it easier for the virus to establish a foothold in your body, but not necessarily translate into a substantial weakening of your immunity. Nussenzweig pointed me to a recent study done in Australia. The researchers found that, when a vaccinated person's antibody levels fall to around 20% of the typical post-infection level, protection against symptomatic infection drops to 50%. Protection against severe disease, however, doesn't fall to 50% until antibodies wane to just 3% of post-infection levels.

Many factors could account for the persistence of immune protection despite declines in antibodies. Part of the story may have to do with memory B cells, immune cells that hang around, sometimes for decades, for the specific purpose of quickly restarting our antibody response when a familiar pathogen reappears. T cells, which also continue to circulate long after an infection, also play a role, by hunting for infected cells. These and other systems come online quickly upon reinfection: like a computer coming out of sleep mode, the immune system snaps to life. All this means that lower antibody levels aren't as bad as they sound. A little protection goes a long way.

Antibody levels, antibody affinity, and viral dose: these 3 factors form the bedrock of the breakthrough-infection story.

Denominators, definitions, delta: these are the challenges we face in understanding breakthrough risk. Without knowing how many vaccinated people have actually been exposed to the virus, it's hard to calculate the true risk of breakthrough infection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. As no vaccine is 100% effective, breakthrough infections are expected to occur.

Methods
We analyzed the virological characteristics of 161 vaccine breakthrough infections in a population of 24 706 vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs), using RT-PCR and virus culture.

Results
The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was identified in the majority of cases. Despite similar Ct-values, we demonstrate lower probability of infectious virus detection in respiratory samples of vaccinated HCWs with breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated HCWs with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, infectious virus was found in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the 1st 3 days of illness.

Conclusions
We conclude that rare vaccine breakthrough infections occur, but infectious virus shedding is reduced in these cases.

Discussion
----------
In this study we assessed the virological kinetics of mild COVID-19 breakthrough infections upon immunization with several vaccines. Our data support that the SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus shedding is lower in vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections (caused by primarily the delta variant) than in unvaccinated individuals with primary infections (caused by SARS-CoV-2 D614G). Nevertheless, virus culture was positive in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the 1st 3 days of illness. Despite the reduced viral viability, the infectivity of individuals with breakthrough infections should not be neglected.

[3] US: date of 1st deaths

In a significant twist that could reshape our understanding of the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, death records now indicate the 1st COVID-related deaths in California and across the country occurred in January 2020, weeks earlier than originally thought and before officials knew the virus was circulating here.

A half dozen death certificates from that month in 6 different states -- California, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin -- have been quietly amended to list COVID-19 as a contributing factor, suggesting the virus's deadly path quickly reached far beyond coastal regions that were the country's early known hotspots.

Up until now, the 6 Feb 2020, death of San Jose's [PD] had been considered the country's 1st coronavirus fatality, although where and how she was infected remains unknown.

Even less is known about what are now believed to be the country's earliest victims of the pandemic. The Bay Area News Group discovered evidence of them in provisional coronavirus death counts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) -- widely considered the definitive source for death data in the United States -- and confirmed the information through interviews with state and federal public health officials. But amid privacy concerns and fierce debate over pandemic policies, the names, precise locations, and circumstances behind these deaths have not been publicly revealed.

That is frustrating to some experts.

"We need to sit back and really assess what was this thing, when it started, how did we handle it, did we create more of a problem than we needed to, could we have handled things differently?" said Matthew Memoli, director of the clinical studies unit at the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. "There's a lot to think about here."

For instance, the far-flung nature of the deaths -- in the West, Midwest, and South -- might suggest that restrictions on travel and social interactions should have been used in more places much earlier -- and that such rapid response could be a more critical tool in the next pandemic. In January [2020], when the United States announced it would begin limiting travel from China and other international hotspots, the virus may already have been speeding across state borders.

While California, Georgia, Alabama, and Oklahoma acknowledged or didn't dispute that a death certificate in their states from January 2020 had been changed to include COVID, none of the states would provide further details to reporters from this news organization, citing privacy laws. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services now lists the probable COVID death of a 50-59-year-old woman on 22 Jan 2020, in its data. Kansas did not respond to a request for comment.

This new data appears to be the result of months-long efforts by so-called certifiers -- the coroners, medical examiners, and doctors across the country tasked with explaining when and why people die -- to take a closer look at deaths that occurred in the months before the outbreak.

The Bay Area News Group first reported in April [2021] that the CDC was investigating why multiple COVID-related fatalities before [PD's] death began appearing earlier this year [2021] in state and federal records. At the time, most of those were explained away as incorrect dates and other data glitches.

But this past week, the federal agency told this news organization that it had worked with state officials to contact the certifiers in 5 cases -- while waiting to hear back from a 6th -- and confirmed that death certificates from January 2020 have now been intentionally revised to include COVID.

"Certifiers are reluctant to amend death certificates unless there's a good reason to do so," said Robert Anderson, chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch at the NCHS.

But what led a coroner or doctor to make such a significant and possibly historic change in these cases is unclear. Anderson, whose team collects death data from every state, said his agency isn't provided that level of detail.

When someone dies for unknown reasons, death certificates can be updated months and even years after a person has died to reflect new information. During the pandemic, a coroner who originally attributed an early 2020 death broadly to a respiratory virus might later learn the person had traveled to China, where the virus originated, or had contact with someone who had, and reach the conclusion that they had COVID. Coronavirus testing was not common in early 2020, but if health workers took blood at the time, a medical examiner could later test the sample for the virus or antibodies, or do a PCR test for the virus on a tissue sample if an autopsy was performed.

It's likely, said John Swartzberg, an infectious disease expert and professor emeritus at UC Berkeley [California], that these early cases were initially written off as colds or flus.

[PD's] mysterious death wasn't originally attributed to COVID. It took more than 2 months for tests to reveal the otherwise healthy 57-year-old San Jose woman had been infected with the COVID-19 virus when she died.

The existence of January 2020 deaths would dramatically revise the timeline of COVID's arrival in the United States. China first announced a mysterious viral pneumonia in late December 2019, and reported the 1st death from the illness on [9 Jan 2020]. The US originally recorded its 1st case in mid-January when a traveler tested positive after returning from Wuhan, China. The 1st deaths reported in the United States, in late February [2020], were also tied to travel.

In its current death count, which reflects the 6 newly discovered fatalities, the NCHS now lists the country's 1st COVID death during the week of 5-11 Jan 2020 -- the 1st full week of 2020. The agency is in the final stages of preparing its 2020 annual mortality report, a review and analysis of all deaths in the United States last year [2020].

Swartzberg thinks -- and the new death data suggests -- it's entirely possible that COVID was present in the United States as early as December or even November [2019]. The time from infection to death from COVID is typically around 3 weeks.

"I would certainly guess the virus was introduced on multiple occasions before it was identified as a problem," Swartzberg said, noting that states like Alabama and Oklahoma don't generally see a lot of travel to and from China.

Memoli of the National Institutes of Health agrees. "I always thought it had to have been here in the US well before we identified it as a big problem," Memoli said. His team is studying thousands of people across the country, and their research suggests that by July 2020, there were about 5 unidentified cases for every known case and possibly more. That information may also suggest, Memoli said, the virus was spreading earlier than previously thought. So too does a CDC analysis of thousands of blood samples from 9 states. The samples, collected by the American Red Cross in December 2019 and January 2020, found evidence of antibodies to COVID-19 in all 9 states, but there is no record of whether any of those people got sick or died.

Some states, including California, are choosing not to recognize the amended death certificates in their official COVID death counts, however. The California Department of Public Health acknowledged in a statement to this news organization that a death certificate from January 2020 now lists COVID as a significant condition contributing to death. "However," the department said, "there was no laboratory confirmation of COVID for this individual and as such is not a confirmed COVID death." Anderson, whose agency is tabulating the country's official death count, sees it differently.

"The death certificate is the permanent record for the decedent," he said. "If COVID is on the death certificate, then it is a COVID death. You can't just ignore it."

The system for tracking mortality data, he said, relies on the medical expertise of death certifiers, since the CDC compiles records on approximately 3 million deaths in the US every year. In their months-long review before finalizing the data for publication, the CDC follows up on anything out of the ordinary, like these early COVID deaths, to make sure there were no unintentional errors made by the certifiers or during data entry.

But experts say a deeper analysis is needed. For instance, it might be possible, depending on what evidence remains, to examine the viral characteristics in the 6 early deaths and determine the origin of the strains and whether they were related.

[It's not really surprising that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the US earlier than first thought. It is generally the case with a newly emerging virus that it is not immediately recognized until there is a cluster of similar cases. Furthermore, the focus of attention was on China initially. It will be interesting to sequence these early strains if that is still possible. - Mod.LK]

[4] Booster shots
[A] Effectiveness of 3rd dose
Date: Sun 22 Aug 2021 5:47 p.m. PDT

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-22/beating-back-delta-will-take-extra-covid-shot-for-privileged-few?sref=fnwLs0dR


The roll-out of a 3rd dose of COVID vaccine has sparked debate on ethical and political grounds, since a large swath of the human population is yet to receive any inoculation. But the case for boosters on scientific grounds is building.

The reason is delta. The most-infectious coronavirus variant to emerge so far is in a race with the human immune system, and there's mounting evidence that delta is winning, at least initially. Fully vaccinated individuals infected with the variant have peak virus levels in the upper airways as high as those lacking immunity, a large study from the UK showed last week. [https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/results/new-studies]

That suggests people with delta-induced breakthrough infections also may be capable of transmitting the virus, frustrating efforts to curb the COVID pandemic. Waning antibody levels in some highly vaccinated populations such as Israel have prompted calls to offer boosters to blunt fresh waves of hospitalizations.

"The science is the boosters work, and they will definitely help," said Shane Crotty, a virologist and professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology's Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research in California.

In fully vaccinated, healthy adults, booster shots from Moderna Inc. as well as Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE cause antibodies to rebound to peak levels, if not well beyond, Crotty said in a Zoom interview Friday [20 Aug 2021]. Those antibodies are also likely to be more durable and adept at fighting a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 strains, he said.

That's especially helpful in fighting delta. Researchers in China found the strain is detectable in patients 4 days after picking up the virus -- 2 days earlier than was previously observed -- indicating the strain makes individuals infectious sooner.

People infected with delta were also found to have significantly higher amounts of virus in their upper airways compared with infections caused by other strains.

"It's inherently tougher to stop with antibodies because there's more of it and it's a tougher challenge for the immune system," Crotty said.

Bolstering antibody levels with an extra dose of vaccine may enable the immune system to swiftly block delta on its arrival in the nose and throat, preventing the coronavirus from not only infecting cells and causing illness, but also stopping it from spreading, he said. A slower antibody response, on the other hand, may increase infectiousness and worsen symptoms.

"It's a race between the virus and your immune system," Crotty said. The faster the virus replicates, the less time antibodies have to block an infection. Still, even when a delayed antibody response does lead to infection, immunity generated by either vaccination or a natural infection is usually enough to prevent it causing severe illness in an otherwise healthy person, he said.

Most pediatric vaccine regimens are administered over 3 shots, Crotty said. "A lot of that is about the mechanics of immune memory generation, that it's frequently taken 3 exposures to get that," he said.

Three studies published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week showed that, although delta may be hastening a decline in the effectiveness of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, including among nursing home residents, the vaccines remained a reliable shield against hospitalization over a 6-month period.

Delta can cause breakthrough infections and illness in people with lower antibody levels, said Andrew Pekosz, a professor of molecular microbiology at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

"The good news is that vaccine efficacy against severe disease is still maintained," he said. In addition, fully immunized people infected with delta may be infectious for a shorter period compared with individuals lacking immunity, reducing their propensity to transmit the virus, Pekosz said. It's possible the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals could be further reduced with 3rd shots using a different inoculation, delivery via a nasal spray, or using smaller amounts of the same vaccine, he said.

"We are still working out the mechanics of how best to use these vaccines for maximum protection," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. "Our challenge is going to be how to continue to use these vaccines to maximize the most important aspect of public health: preventing infections."

Curbing spread is also key to preventing the emergence of variants even more dangerous than delta, he said.

That goal must be sought globally with equity and solidarity, Osterholm said.

"It's a worldwide epidemic that will continue until you take care of it around the world," he said. "From a humanitarian standpoint, this is obviously critical."

In the US, unvaccinated people are now swamping medical institutions in large swaths of the country, Johns Hopkins' Pekosz said. "Vaccination would keep people out of the hospital, and that is the most important thing that vaccinations can do."

La Jolla's Crotty estimates that more than 90% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is from unvaccinated people. "In the US, we've got so many of those," he said.

"If you have 2 doses of vaccine, it's way more valuable for those 2 doses to go to an unvaccinated person than people getting boosters if you want to talk about transmission," Crotty said. "But if you can't convince the people to get the damn things, and somebody else wants them now, will it actually help the other person? Yeah, it will help them."

[B] Ethics
Date: Wed 18 Aug 2021

https://www.axios.com/covid-vaccine-booster-shots-ethics-coronavirus-inequity-87fb734a-3a68-4439-aeff-3634e6a77d80.html


The Biden administration is expected to soon recommend booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone, but that decision fails fundamental ethics tests, according to interviews with physicians and medical ethicists.

Why it matters: There is still a global shortage of vaccines. Even amid concerns of the spreading delta variant, experts say it's difficult to justify a 3rd dose for relatively healthy people in the US when many others haven't gotten their 1st.

Driving the news: The booster shots would likely be administered around 8 months after someone received their 2 mRNA vaccine doses from Pfizer or Moderna, or after their single Johnson & Johnson shot, according to initial reports.

- An independent CDC panel and the FDA have not signed off on this plan yet.
- This possible plan comes a week after the CDC and FDA formally recommended the nation's 9 million immunocompromised people get a 3rd dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.
- Data have indicated for months that the immunocompromised, especially organ transplant patients, were less protected from the 2-shot course.
- A 3rd dose for the immunocompromised is reasonable, ethicists say, because 3 doses should have been their default regimen, and it will give a boost in protection to a group that is more likely to end up in the hospital from COVID-19.

Yes, but: "Once you get to anybody who wants to get a 3rd dose, then I think other people in other countries start to have a rightful basis for complaint," said Govind Persad, a health policy and ethics professor at the University of Denver.

- The vaccines appear to be less effective as time goes on, but there's no rigorous data quantifying that yet.
- The vaccines still prevent almost all instances of death and hospitalization from severe disease.
- The risk of vaccinated people with normal immune systems passing the delta variant on to other vaccinated people also appears very low.
- Meanwhile, the coronavirus is raging in low-vaccinated places like Botswana, Cuba, and Iran, which "translates into disparities in mortality rates from COVID-19," ethicists wrote in JAMA last week. [Schaefer GO, Leland RJ, Emanuel EJ. Making Vaccines Available to Other Countries Before Offering Domestic Booster Vaccinations. JAMA. 2021; doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.13226.]
"We have people in sizable numbers who have zero protection," said Ruth Faden, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University and member of the World Health Organization's panel that advised against boosters except for high-risk people. "The global ethics case is clear."

Reality check: The US has bought enough vaccine doses to immunize everyone, and that stockpile has come at the expense of other countries.

- Experts agree no vaccine should be wasted or allowed to expire, and it also may not be logistically feasible for the US to ship some of its surplus doses elsewhere.
- But variants have become a top concern precisely because of the maldistribution of vaccines.
- "This virus has proven what most pathogens do: They mutate," said Doug Diekema, a bioethicist and physician at Seattle Children's Hospital. "The best way to stop that is to stop transmission, and to do that, you have to get as many people vaccinated as possible."

The bottom line: "The delta variant didn't come from nowhere," Faden said. "To have a better chance of containing this pandemic, we have a self-interested reason in seeing vaccination coverage go up in people outside of our country."

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries including Iran (36 419), UK (31 976), the USA (25 850), Japan (25 144), India (24 735), Russia (20 564), Malaysia (19 807), Turkey (18 622), Thailand (17 491), France (17 300), Philippines (15 584), Brazil (14 404), Indonesia (12 408), Viet Nam (11 352), and South Africa (10 748) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. It seems that there has been a sudden 'weekend' drop in the number of reported cases and many countries not reporting. A global total of 7564 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 20 Aug 2021 to late 21 Aug 2021). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 19.7% increase in daily reported cases and 59.3% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 212.58 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.44 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
