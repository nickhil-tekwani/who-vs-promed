Lindsay Farm is recalling raw drinking milk in New Zealand after one person needed hospital treatment for a _Campylobacter_ infection. Rachel Eyre, Hawke's Bay medical officer of health, said illness from the raw milk was campylobacteriosis, but more tests were being undertaken by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) to identify the strain. Dr. Eyre said a Hawke's Bay resident needed hospital treatment after becoming sick on 4 Aug 2020 but has since been discharged. The link to raw milk was made through a patient interview, she said.

Lindsay Farm brand unpasteurized drinking milk received on and between 3 Jul 2020 and 11 Aug 2020, in a 2-liter plastic bottle is affected, as it may contain _Campylobacter_. The product is sold via drop-off points between Dannevirke and Auckland and can be returned to the company for a refund.

The farm, based in Hawkes Bay, was one of those raided in December 2019 by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) following a 2-year review of the Raw Milk for Sale to Consumers Regulations 2015. It is one of New Zealand's largest producers of raw milk. The rules allow raw milk to be sold by farmers on the premises or through delivery to a customer's home.

Melinda Sando, MPI national manager food compliance, said there was one confirmed case of campylobacteriosis. "It is possible that there may be other people who experienced illness, and anyone concerned about their health should seek medical advice. People who have experienced illness and want to report this can contact the Hawkes Bay District Health Board," she said.

MPI advised the public not to consume the implicated product or heat it to 70 deg C (158 deg F) and hold at this temperature for one minute before drinking it. People who ingest _Campylobacter_ are likely to become ill within 2 to 5 days, although it can take up to 10 days. Symptoms include muscle pain, headaches, and fever, diarrhea that can be bloody and abdominal pain. The illness lasts about 5 days.

[The following is from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) information sheet regarding unpasteurized milk (http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm):

"Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 1993 through 2012, there were 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk or raw milk products like ice cream, soft cheese, or yogurt. They resulted in 1909 illnesses and 144 hospitalizations. The CDC points out that most foodborne illnesses are not a part of recognized outbreaks, and for every illness reported, many others occur.

"Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, and goats -- or any other animal -- that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. Raw milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, _Listeria_, _Campylobacter_, and others that cause foodborne illness, often called 'food poisoning.'

"These bacteria can seriously injure the health of anyone who drinks raw milk or eats products made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems (such as transplant patients and individuals with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes), children, older adults, and pregnant women. In fact, CDC finds that foodborne illness from raw milk especially affects children and teenagers.

"'Pasteurized milk' explained:
Pasteurization is a widely used process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. First developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, Q fever, and brucellosis.

"Research shows no meaningful difference in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk contains low levels of the type of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food spoilage, so storing your pasteurized milk in the refrigerator is still important.

"Raw milk and pasteurization: debunking milk myths:
While pasteurization has helped provide safe, nutrient-rich milk and cheese for over 120 years, some people continue to believe that pasteurization harms milk and that raw milk is a safe, healthier alternative.

"Here are some common myths and proven facts about milk and pasteurization:
- Pasteurizing milk DOES NOT cause lactose intolerance and allergic reactions. Both raw milk and pasteurized milk can cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to milk proteins.
- Raw milk DOES NOT kill dangerous pathogens by itself.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT reduce milk's nutritional value.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT mean that it is safe to leave milk out of the refrigerator for extended time, particularly after it has been opened.
- Pasteurization DOES kill harmful bacteria.
- Pasteurization DOES save lives." - Mod.LL
