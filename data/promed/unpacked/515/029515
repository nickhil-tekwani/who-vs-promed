The number of hantavirus [infection] cases in Los Santos province has increased to 13 cases, 4 with fever and 9 with [hantavirus] cardiopulmonary syndrome.

Carlos Muñoz, epidemiology coordinator of the Ministry of Health in Los Santos, stated that the last 2 cases are a 25-year-old-man from La Concepción de Pocrí, and a 44-year-old woman from El Cacao in Tonosí.

Muñoz stated that currently there are 4 hospitalized patients, 2 without assisted ventilation but in the intensive care unit and 2 in wards soon to leave the hospital.

In comparison to the expected increase in each 4-year cycle, the number of cases has been a little less.

Muñoz indicated that this year maize [corn] production has increased and in the 18 years that hantavirus [virus cases] have occurred in Los Santos, the people have not become aware [of the risk] and continue storing maize within or near their homes.

In 2017, 23 cases were registered.

"Obviously, when the mice are left without food and water in the field, they approach houses where they can find food," Muñoz said.

The 23 cases in 2017 and the 13 cases registered in 2018, make 36 cases of hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province.

[Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The number of cases has increased to 13 so far this year (2018) and last year (2017) ended with 23 cases, 16 with hantavirus fever and 7 with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situations in which the patients acquired their infections are not mentioned but the implication is that exposure occurred in rural areas where grain storage is a problem. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva. - Mod.TY
