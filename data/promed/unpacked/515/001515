Italian olives tainted with botulinum toxin sickened 2 members of a
Helsinki family last week [week of 17 Oct 2011]. Both individuals
reported having eaten Gaudiano Organic Olives Stuffed with Almonds.
Lab tests confirmed that the jar from which the 2 patients had eaten
the olives contained botulinum toxin.

The tainted olives were packed in 314 ml glass jars, with a "best
before" date of 09/2012. They were imported into Finland by Kespro as
early as September 2010. The olives were sold in Finland to K-food
stores KCM Big Apple (Espoo), KCM Jumbo (Vantaa), and KSM South Centre
(Rovaniemi), and to a few restaurants. The olives have been withdrawn
from sale in Finland, and consumers who purchased this product are
asked to return it to the store.

Germany's Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety has
learned that some of these olives also were distributed in Germany,
and is asking its citizens to dispose of any of the implicated jars of
olives "with household waste".

According to a notice posted 21 Oct 2011 on the Rapid Alert System for
Foods and Feeds (RASFF) and updated this morning (24 Oct 2011), these
olives also were distributed to the UK and the USA. So far, neither
the US Food and Drug Administration nor Britain's Food Standards
Agency has issued a Consumer Alert or a public health advisory of any
sort.

eFood Alert Advisory to Consumers in Finland, Germany, the United
Kingdom and the USA:
Check your pantry for Gaudiano Organic Olives Stuffed with Almonds
(Product of Italy; Best before 09/2012), and discard the product in a
safe manner. DO NOT TASTE THIS PRODUCT. If you have consumed even a
tiny amount of this product and begin to experience any symptoms of
botulism, including blurred vision or difficulty swallowing, seek
immediate medical attention.

[Based on this report, it appears that the potentially
toxin-containing olives were also imported in to the USA and Germany.
Germany and UK appear to have issued warnings regarding the product
but no alert seems to have yet been released from the USA. - Mod.LL]
