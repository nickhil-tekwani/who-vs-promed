The Health Ministry has confirmed the 2nd case of human infection from avian influenza H5N1 in the country this year [2014], which claimed the life of a 33-year-old man in Jakarta.

The ministry's health research and development center head, Tjandra Yoga Aditama, said that the victim was pronounced dead at Pondok Kopi Islamic Hospital, East Jakarta, last month [May 2014].

"The laboratory confirmed the H5N1 [infection], based on real-time and conventional PCR [polymerase chain reaction] diagnostics on the victim's specimen," he said in a press statement released on Tuesday [17 Jun 2014].

It is the 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of human infection of avian influenza following a case in Wonogiri, Central Java.

On [20 Apr 2014], a 2-year-old toddler died of avian flu following exposure to live poultry. An inquiry by the Health Ministry found that prior to RNA's death, almost 70 chickens had died from apparent avian flu infection.

According to Tjandra, there have been 17 confirmed cases worldwide of avian flu in humans this year [2014]. Cambodia has recorded the most so far, with 9 cases, while Indonesia, Egypt, Viet Nam and China have recorded 2 cases each.

Cumulatively, Indonesia has witnessed 197 cases of humans infected with avian flu, making it the nation with the highest number of H5N1 human infection cases to date. Egypt and Viet Nam follow with 175 cases and 127 cases, respectively.
