Six pet stores in metropolotan Atlanta, including the Pet Company store at
the Duluth mall, have been quarantined after a highly infectious parasite
known as giardia, which travels between pets and humans, was found in 138
puppies.
The Duluth store is still open. Staff there said the puppies are being kept
in a kennel behind glass and staff is handling them with precautions,
including changing gloves frequently and washing their hands. Staff said
the puppies, which are on medication, can be purchased, but not touched, by
customers and can only be taken home after they are cleared from
quarantine. They did not specify when that might be.
Store staff referred further questions to the Pet Company headquarters in
New Jersey. A spokesperson there said a statement would be released before
the end of the day and declined to comment further. The statement did not
arrive.
Georgia Department of Agriculture officials warned people who have bought
or touched a puppy from a Pet Company store since January 2006 to contact a
physician if they have flu-like symptoms. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms for giardiasis include: diarrhea,
gas or flatulence, greasy stools, stomach cramps, upset stomach or nausea.
If someone has been infected and is treating the symptoms without the
proper antibiotic, symptoms will recur, Department of Agriculture officials
said.
Department officials said that giardia can be spread by feces and can be
found in drinking and recreational water. They said it's possible the
parasite was transferred if the infected puppies were touched and people
did not wash their hands properly, officials said.
The 6 malls where 138 of 151 puppies tested positive for giardia include:
Gwinnett Place in Duluth, Arbor Place in Douglasville, Southlake Mall in
Morrow, Stonecrest Mall in Lithonia, Town Center Mall in Kennesaw and
Cumberland Mall in Atlanta.
The Department of Agriculture said it has issued a stop sale/stop movement
order for the puppies, so they must remain in the pet stores. Officials
said precautions, such as proper washing of hands, should be taken when
handling the puppies. Department officials said the problem came to light
after a woman bought a puppy in Douglasville in January 2006 and it got sick.
She wasn't satisfied with the response from Pet Company officials and
reported the problem to the Department of Agriculture this month. The
department tested puppies at all Pet Company stores in the metropolitan
Atlanta area.

[Giardia in dogs in North America has been reported at between and 8 and 50
percent, especially in puppies in shelters, kennels and pet stores. The
prevalence in cats tends to be lower, at about 4 per cent. Most infections
are subclinical or show only transient softening of the stool early in the
infection, although diarrhea may be acute and short-lived, chronic, or
intermittent in dogs and cats.
Treatment for Giardia includes bathing the infected animal and
decontamination of the animalï¿½s environment with a quarternary
ammonium-based disinfectant. Drugs that may be used include metronidazole,
albendazole, fenbendazole, and quanacrine.
GiardiaVax is a commercial Giardia vaccine for use in dogs that may help
prevent infection and reduce the duration of carriage. - Mod.TG]
