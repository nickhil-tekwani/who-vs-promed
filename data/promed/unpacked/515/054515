Ministry investigates mystery cattle illness
--------------------------------------------
Agriculture authorities in the town of Dhulam are growing
increasingly concerned at reports of cattle deaths seemingly due to
the consumption of barley and berseem [Egyptian clover] following the
death of 4 sheep and 2 camels on Friday [12 Jun 2009]. In addition, 4
other sheep are also reported to have fallen ill in the town, which
lies east of Makkah.

Mut'ib Al-Oteibi, a local cattle owner, said that 2 of his camels 1st
showed signs of illness last week [1-5 Jun 2009], and added that
teams from the Ministry of Agriculture had not taken samples for
analysis but had instead conducted a routine examination. The camels
died on Friday [12 Jun 2009]. According to the head of the ministry
branch in Dhulam, Abdullah Al-Shahrani, samples from both animals and
fodder have been sent for analysis to the Ministry of Agriculture to
discover the source of the as yet unidentified illness. Al-Shahrani,
citing veterinary reports, said that the death of Al-Oteibi's camels
were due to blood poisoning and inflammations. "The illness is not
contagious," Al-Shahrani said.

[Data on the etiology of these cases -- seemingly fodder-related
intoxications -- will be appreciated. This rather minor, local event
is being posted in view of past experience in Saudi Arabia which was
indicative of the need for improved control upon animal feed. A major
livestock intoxication took place in Saudi Arabia in 2007 -- also,
reportedly, starting with few "mysterious" cases. - Mod.AS
