An outbreak of whooping cough in Wright County has schools and public
health officials taking measures to contain the disease. Health
officials have confirmed 46 cases of the contagious disease in the
Maple Lake area. Most of the cases were diagnosed in students from
Maple Lake Elementary and St Timothy's Catholic School.

Officials said they are working to identify students with whooping
cough, or pertussis, and get them out of the classroom. School
officials have sent letters home to parents of children who are in
class with students who have been diagnosed.

Pertussis cases tend to come in waves. The last wave in Minnesota
peaked in 2005 with more than 1500 confirmed cases. In 2009,
Minnesota reported more than 1000 cases.

There is a vaccine, but it loses its effectiveness over time. Health
officials believe that is why they're seeing more cases among 5th and
6th graders who received the vaccine before they entered kindergarten.

Health officials say people with pertussis should stay home until
they have completed 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

[Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and
adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without
considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains.
As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis -
Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): "There are now many studies
which show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with
changes in the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have
shown that more virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe
to be (partly) responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The
P3 strains have emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of
sudden upsurges in infectious diseases should include changes in the
pathogen population. This is even true for pertussis.
