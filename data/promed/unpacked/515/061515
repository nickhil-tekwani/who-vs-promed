We report the identification of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in Ireland. The organism was resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, including carbapenems, and PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of the blaNDM-1 gene, carried on a 98kb plasmid. The organism was isolated from an infant who was born in India and moved to Ireland at the age of 4 months. This is the 1st reported isolation of an NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain in Ireland.

Case report
-----------
A 6 month old infant presented to the family doctor in May 2011 with a non-specific febrile illness. The child had been born in Kolkata, eastern India, by uncomplicated full term vaginal delivery. The mother and child spent 3 to 4 days in hospital after the birth. The family (2 parents and child) moved to Ireland when the child was 4 months old. The child, who had no underlying illness or past medical history of note, was treated empirically with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a suspected urinary tract infection shortly after arrival in Ireland; however, no urine sample was submitted for testing at this time. 6 weeks later, the child presented again with a low-grade fever. A urine sample showed a white cell count of 1700 and greater than 5 logs of bacteria/mL on culture. The isolate was identified as _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and was resistant to meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 mg/L), but susceptible to ciprofloxacin. After treatment with a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin, there was a good clinical response. A repeat urine sample after completion of ciprofloxacin therapy grew more than 5 logs of bacteria/mL of an isolate identified as _Escherichia coli_ resistant to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and cefoxitin but susceptible to ertapenem and trimethoprim. The child received a 5 day course of trimethoprim and remains clinically well. A renal ultrasound was normal.

A rectal swab from the child, taken 2 weeks after the initial positive urine sample, yielded multiple isolates of _K. pneumoniae_ including both carbapenem-resistant and carbapenem-susceptible but extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant isolates.

The case was investigated by the local Department of Public Health in accordance with international protocols (1). Family screening for carriage of the NDM-1-producing strain was carried out on both urine and rectal samples of the parents. _E. coli_ with a similar susceptibility pattern to the 2nd urinary isolate from the child was isolated from rectal swabs from the parents, but carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ was not detected.

Laboratory characterization
---------------------------
The carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ isolate from the initial positive urine sample (isolate number 2661) was referred to the Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Ecology Group at the National University of Ireland, Galway for further characterisation. Meropenem and ertapenem MICs were both greater than 32 mg/L as determined by Etest. The full susceptibility profile, as determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk diffusion method (2), is shown in the Table [see original URL. - Mod.LL]. The isolate was confirmed as a carbapenemase producer by the modified Hodge test of the CLSI, and metallo-beta-lactamase activity was indicated by a commercial synergy test (Rosco Diagnostica, Denmark). PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of blaNDM-1, and plasmid analysis revealed this was carried on a 98kb plasmid (data not shown) (3,4). PFGE analysis using XbaI was carried out on 2 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates from the child (the carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ and a carbapenem-sensitive _K. pneumoniae_ rectal swab isolate) and on _E. coli_ isolated from the child and from both parents (5). The PFGE profiles of the 2 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates from the child were not similar (data not shown). PFGE profiles of the 3 _E. coli_ isolates were indistinguishable (1 from each of the parents and 1 from the child).

Discussion
----------
Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates have been reported in hospital outbreaks in Ireland (6), but isolates producing NDM-1 have not previously been identified in Ireland.

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a major threat to current approaches to treatment of life-threatening Enterobacteriaceae infection. In addition to resistance to almost all available beta-lactam agents, many strains are frequently resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

NDM-1-producing _K. pneumoniae_ was first recognised in a Swedish patient in 2008 who was repatriated to Sweden from the Indian subcontinent (7). Since then, NDM-1-producing isolates have been identified in patients in the UK who had a history of receiving health care in India and Pakistan (8). The majority of reported clinical cases related to NDM-1-producing isolates to date have been in adults. However, NDM-1-producing _E. coli_ has recently been reported from rectal screens of neonates returning to France after having attended health care facilities in Egypt and India (9). 2 cases of neonatal sepsis associated with NDM-1-positive _K. pneumoniae_ have been reported from a neonatal intensive care unit in a tertiary referral hospital in Kolkata, India (10).

The source of colonization/infection with NDM-1-producing _K. pnemoniae_ in the child reported here cannot be established unequivocally. However, the fact that the child was born and lived the 1st few months in India, including a stay of a few days in hospital after birth, is likely to be of relevance given the reported high levels of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in India (11). Although such organisms were not detected in either parent, a single rectal swab may not identify carriage, particularly if the organism is present in small numbers (12), and the parents may therefore potentially be colonized.

This case highlights the importance of testing isolates from routine clinical samples for susceptibility to carbapenem even in low-incidence areas to maximise the likelihood of detection of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, in order to guide therapy and prevent onward spread through implementation of transmission-based precautions and enhanced environmental cleaning (as was done in this case). Early recognition and reporting in low-incidence areas also provides an opportunity to establish national measures to prevent such isolates becoming endemic in health care settings. This report also highlights the importance of considering the possibility of carbapenem-resistant isolates in people returning from the Indian subcontinent.

[This NDM-1 gene cassette of wide-spectrum antimicrobial resistance appears to have developed in the Indian subcontinent, as in the above report, where the use of antimicrobial agents is quite poorly controlled. Organisms carrying this resistance combination have continue to be introduced into western Europe, the USA, and Canada. The best methods of control are rapid recognition by standard microbiologic/nucleic acid methodology in patients having the appropriate medical/travel history and aggressive handwashing techniques.

The amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA will no doubt serve as an efficient multiplier of these isolates, just as intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly related to the lack of control of antimicrobial usage in intensive care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and emergency room (ER) physicians who often react with a lack of wisdom and "cookbook" protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once the patient moves out of the intensive care unit or ER, the physicians do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures, not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is recognized -- that is, using these agents only when rational, in combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and meaningful improvement in a patient's life -- the medical community will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic options will exist. - Mod.LL
