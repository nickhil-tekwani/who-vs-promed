Between January and February [2016], 18 affected people have been registered for the virus [infection] in the country, that is to say 6 more than in the same period of 2015. Fatalities for that time declined from 42% to 22%.

Every summer vacation period dozens of Chileans relax in the central regions of the center and south of the country, tarnished by fatal infections of hantaviruses.

In fact, according to the numbers released by the Ministry of Health, just in January and February of this year [2016] the virus has now affected 18 people, 6 more than those infected in 2015 for the same dates. These cases have occurred in Maule (5 cases), Aysén (3 cases), Los Lagos (2 cases), Los Ríos (2 cases), Biobío (2 cases), O'Higgins (1 case), La Araucanía (1 case) and in the Región Metropolitana (2 cases).

In contrast to the number of cases however, the case fatality rate -- people who have died of the disease -- has declined from 42% in 2015 (with 5 fatal victims) to 22% this year [2016] with 4 people who have died of the infection.

"These figures are encouraging because, historically, 4 people died of every 10 infected, whereas in this January [2016] 2 people died," stated Fernando Fuenzalida of the Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health.

Fuenzalida explained that the reasons for this decline in fatalities is due to diverse situations, "Most likely is that people, when they begin to have symptoms, go quickly to their physicians, thus beginning the diagnosis process that permits arrival at treatment, " he said.

According to the case registry of the Ministry of Health, the groups most vulnerable for the hantavirus infection are agricultural workers and inhabitants of rural areas in the south/central [regions], whereas between 10-15% of infections correspond to summer visitors. Also, during the current year [2016] we have observed an increase in disease from [a] hantavirus [infection] in individuals over 60 years of age who now constitute 25% of those infected.

Case numbers by year
Year / No. Cases / No. Fatalities
2015 / 58 / 25
2014 / 56 / 18
2013 / 52 / 18
2012 / 55 / 17
2011 / 65 / 21

[One hopes that there indeed has been a decline in the case fatality rate, but with small numbers that interpretation must be made with caution. Chile has taken some active steps in recent years to provide rapid laboratory diagnosis by decentralizing laboratory services to the affected region. The prompt diagnosis no doubt helps clinicians provide timely and aggressive supportive treatment of patients with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

Much of central and southern Chile is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the patients acquired their hantavirus infections, but may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
