Health Authorities in Amazonas reported today [6 Jan 2010] that 7
children have died in the district of Nieva, presumably of a
bat-related rabies outbreak. The disease has been found in several
specimens of bats that live in the area, and all the victims showed
the typical symptoms of rabies. However, the doctors have not been
able to perform any autopsy to confirm the cause of these deaths due
to cultural issues, since the natives consider that would be an insult.

Elias Bohorquez Medina, Amazonas Health Director, explained that
Nieva, located in the province of Condorcanqui, is the home of Awajun
and Wampis indigenous peoples, but also has many species of bats.

Bohorquez explained that the apus (chief tribe leaders) are
convincing their people to allow vaccination to prevent the disease.

[If these were really human rabies cases, as seems likely, the bat
species probably involved in these suspected rabies cases is the
vampire _Desmodus rotundus_. This bat is common in the lowland
American tropics and a well-known rabies vector. Although _D.
rotundus_ prefers to feed on cattle and horses, it will attack humans
when preferred mammalian hosts are not available. There is a history
in Amazonian Peru of recent vampire bat attacks and human rabies
cases from hematophagous bat bites. Between July 2006 and 15 Feb
2007, health networks of Mazuko (Madre de Dios), San Gaban (Puno),
and Huepetuhe (Madre de Dios) reported 27, 370, and 130 cases of
vampire bat bites respectively, for a total of 527 people bitten.
More than 20 persons have died from rabies transmitted by the bite of
hematophagous bats in Puno and Madre de Dios (see ProMED archive no.
20070306.0786).
