Panama disease spreads to banana plantations in La Libertad
-----------------------------------------------------------
Panama disease destroyed more than 170 hectares of banana from the Gros Michel variety in the last 10 years in the district of Chocope [Ascope Province], region of La Libertad. The Gros Michel variety started to disappear with the arrival of the fungus and now it can only be found in Chocope.

Sergio Prettell, alderman of Chocope, said the district currently has 30 hectares of this banana. Ten years ago, there were over 200 acres dedicated to this variety. "Producers lose 80 percent of their crops to this fungus. So we risk losing a flagship product in our region," he said.

Juan Carlos Rojas, INIA [Instituto Nacional de Innovacion Agraria] said, "Before, the fungus was only in the jungle, but now it has come up north." He advised the producers of organic bananas to beware of any outbreak and to apply strict control of this pest. He also stated that INIA would research better banana varieties resistant to the new strain of Panama disease, which has already devastated crops in Asia and Africa [TR4, see comment below].

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Gros Michel, which was the main commercial variety in the New World, was virtually wiped out by the initial epidemic due to a race 1 strain (see links below for PD history). It is remarkable that the variety has survived in a pocket of Peru for a century, and loss of this historic gene pool would be regrettable.

Gros Michel was replaced by Cavendish varieties which are resistant to the original fungal strain and include most of the commercial eating bananas today. However, they have proved susceptible to new strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510). Tropical race 4 (TR4) is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia and has recently also been reported for the 1st time outside that area (ProMED-mail posts 20131107.2044265 and 20131206.2095450). It is of great concern worldwide.
