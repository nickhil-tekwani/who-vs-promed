An outbreak of salmonellosis has occurred from popular restaurant in
Stockholm as mentioned in earlier postings. The number of reported persons
is now 105. The causative agents are _S. enterica_ serotypes Bareilly and
Virchow.
The source of the outbreak is believed to be inadequate handling of mung
beans during sprouting since no rinsing of the beans was performed. No
salmonella were found in food samples from the restaurant including mung
beans.
The first reported case had a meal at the restaurant on 28 Sep 2006. After
16 Oct 2006, when mung beans sprouts were removed from the menu, no cases
were reported.
The Swedish surveillance system includes both reports from the physician
caring for the patient and from the laboratory which isolates the
microorganism. The report from the physician includes place and country
where the patient has contracted the infection. Thereby it is possible to
discriminate between domestic and travel-associated cases. In Sweden about
500 to 800 domestic cases are reported each year since the majority of
reported cases are travel-associated. The total number of reported cases is
about 3500 to 5000 per year. The current outbreak is the largest in the
Stockholm area in 25 years.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr de Jong for this first-hand follow-up report.
Moderator MPP has prepared this bibliography on salmonellosis and bean
sprouts:
Bean sprouts have been a source of salmonellosis outbreaks in the past. They
have been the bane of the radiation movement as they do not survive
radiation intact.
The Canadians had a good review of this in
