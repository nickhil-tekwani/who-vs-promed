The veterinary service of the Ministry of Agro-Industry was notified of a suspected case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in Rodrigues yesterday [Wed 10 Mar 2021] by the Agriculture Commission.

Samples taken for analysis will be sent to the ANSES laboratory in France, thanks to the support and logistical facilitation of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC).

The International Organization of Epizootics (OIE) has also been notified of this suspected case. As a precautionary measure, no transport of livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs) from Rodrigues to Mauritius will be authorized until further notice.

[Rodrigues is one of the 4 islands enclosed in the Republic of Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km (1200 miles) off the southeast coast of the African continent, east of Madagascar. The main island, called Mauritius, is about 600 km [about 373 miles] southwest of Rodrigues; the other islands are Agalega and St. Brandon.

In July 2016, Mauritius suffered its 1st OIE-reported FMD outbreak, starting in Rodrigues, most likely introduced by import of animals from the African continent, spreading to the main island, Mauritius. The OIE "immediate notification" included the following epidemiological comments: "1st case in Rodrigues was on 7 Jul 2016 and treated as an isolated case. Since there was a continuous increase in the number of cases, blood samples were collected and analysed at the Animal Health Laboratory at Reduit, in Mauritius. 1st positive FMD diagnosis was done by competitive ELISA. Another positive diagnosis from cattle in Mauritius was on 5 Aug 2016 by competitive ELISA. Confirmation from Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) in South Africa is awaited. The French Food Security Agency (ANSES) has confirmed FMD virus by PCR and virus isolation; serotype O has been confirmed by antigen detection ELISA on viral isolate;" (20160819.4424865).

Confirmation and serotyping of the current event are anticipated. - Mod.AS
