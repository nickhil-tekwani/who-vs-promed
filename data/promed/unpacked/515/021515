[Dourine is a venereal disease of horses, donkeys and mules. It is
caused by the parasite _Typanosoma equiperidum_ and can be found in
both acute and chronic forms, causing neurological signs and
emaciation. Mortality rates can be significant. The disease was
formerly widespread but is now considered to only occur regularly in
part of Asia and parts of Africa. There is occasional reporting of
Dourine in the Middle East and Europe, with the largest recent
outbreak being hundreds of cases in Russia from 2008 to 2010.

This is the 2nd report from Italy within the last 2 weeks. The 1st
one was in Sicily and now this one is on the mainland is southern
Italy near Naples. The Veterinary Science team at DEFRA in the UK has
issued an assessment of the current Italian situation and their
recommendations on trade restrictions and prevention for owners is
quoted below. For the full document see
http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/dourine-italy-010611.pdf.

On this basis and taking into account the current level of trade from
Italy, we consider the risk of introduction of Dourine into the UK in
horses originating in Italy is now higher than negligible and may be
considered "very low" (very rare but cannot be excluded occur) or
"low" (rare but does occur). More details of the cases in Italy may
allow us to downgrade the risk level. Consideration is being given to
increasing the level of checks on consignments of horses for breeding
and reproduction originating in Italy beyond those required for
compliance with EU trade.

We recommend that horse owners and keepers of horses consigned for
breeding purposes are advised of the current situation in Italy, are
familiar with the clinical signs for Dourine as well other diseases of
equidae and of the requirement to notify authorities about suspect
disease.

The location of this new outbreak can be seen appended to the OIE
report referenced above or at the Healthmap website. - Mod.PC]
