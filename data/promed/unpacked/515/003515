Between 1993 and 1997, there were 98 gnathostomosis cases clinically
identified in Acapulco, Mexico. Intermittent cutaneous migratory swellings
were the most common manifestation. Larvae were identified in 26 cases,
while in 72, the final diagnosis was made on the basis of epidemiologic
data, food habits, and positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
Western blot results.
Gnathostomosis is a foodborne zoonotic disease caused by several species of
nematode _Gnathostoma_. The life cycle of this parasite is as follows:
Adult parasites of _G. spinigerum_ are found in the stomach of mammals
(e.g., dogs and cats). Feces containing ova reach the water (i.e., when
domestic parasitized animals live at the shore of a lagoon). Free-swimming
first-stage larvae are formed, which are ingested by the minute copepod
crustacean cyclops, and become second-stage larvae. Freshwater fish eating
the cyclops are the second intermediate host. Larvae develop to the third
state (L3) in the fish muscles. Consumption of this fish by cats, dogs, or
other mammals results in development of adults in the gut, closing the
cycle. Humans acquire the infection by consuming raw or undercooked
freshwater fish. When a human host ingests a larva, no further development
occurs, but the larva migrates through subcutaneous tissue and internal
organs where it produces migratory swelling in the skin and other symptoms
depending on the site or organ affected. In most cases, symptoms are not
serious; however, if the parasite migrates to vital organs of the host, it
can cause severe illness or even death.
With the highest prevalence in Southeast Asia, gnathostomosis is now an
emerging public health problem in Peru, Ecuador and, since 1970, in Mexico.
In the 1970s and 1980s a few cases were reported in towns around Presidente
Miguel Aleman Dam and Papaloapan River basin in the Gulf of Mexico. The
parasites may have spread when new dams built on rivers of the Pacific
Ocean coast were unnoticeably seeded with infected fish. Inability to
interrupt the parasite's life cycle and lack of effective medical treatment
make preventive measures critical in controlling the disease. Therefore,
travelers to disease-endemic areas must be warned of the possibility of
acquiring gnathostomosis and be instructed to avoid ingesting any form of
raw fish. To protect the general population of disease-endemic areas,
public campaigns should be implemented and encouraged against eating or
selling raw or poorly cooked freshwater fish, especially in the form of
sashimi or "ceviche" (a spicy lime-marinated fish salad of South American
origin now very popular in Mexico).
