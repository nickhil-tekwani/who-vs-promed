PETERSBURG E. COLI OUTBREAK TRACED TO BEEF
Dr. John R. Lumpkin, state public health director, today announced that
contaminated beef has been pinpointed as the cause of an _E. coli_ 0157:H7
outbreak that has sickened more than 300 persons in three states who
attended a Labor Day weekend party near downstate Petersburg.
State public health laboratory technicians, using sophisticated genetic
testing, were able to positively match the DNA makeup of the _E. coli_
0157:H7 found in the beef served at the Sept. 4 party with the specific _E.
coli_ bacteria in stool samples taken from infected persons.
"Through the combined efforts of state and local health departments, in
less than two weeks from the time we were notified of a potential food
borne illness outbreak, we have been able to identify beef as the food item
that made people sick," Dr. Lumpkin said. "The so-called 'fingerprinting'
of the bacteria that was performed at the Department's Chicago laboratory
indicates to a 97.5 percent certainty the strains are related."
In addition to meat samples provided by partygoers, laboratory tests of cow
manure collected from the farm where the party was held also were
genetically matched with human stool samples. This suggests that the cow
slaughtered for the party may have been infected with a specific _E. coli_
and that other cows in the herd have exactly the same organism that made
people ill.
How the beef became contaminated is unknown. Outbreaks of _E. coli_
[infection related to beef generally are linked to the meat not being
cooked thoroughly to at least 145 degrees, which would kill the bacteria,
or were not held at a sufficient temperature before served.
A total of 329 persons from three states -- Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky
-- have reported illness associated with attending the party, which was
held in a cow pasture; 22 required hospitalization. Only an elderly man
from Menard County remains in the hospital and his condition is listed as
serious, but stable. Fifty-one of those sickened are culture positive for
_E. coli_ 0157:H7.
In Illinois, those ill are from 12 counties -- Christian, Cook, Kane,
Logan, Macon, Macoupin, Mason, McLean, Menard, Sangamon, Tazewell and
Woodford.
The number of secondary infections stands at three, down two from previous
reports. Two children from Menard County who attend day care had been
identified as suspect cases, but lab results received today found they were
negative for _E. coli_ 0157:H7. Secondary infections have occurred in
persons who were not at the party, but who lived or had contact with
someone who attended the party and became sick.
State and local health department officials have interviewed 670 persons
who attended the Labor Day weekend event. Organizers have estimated that
as many as 1800 persons may have been in attendance.
"Every outbreak we investigate teaches an important lesson," Dr. Lumpkin
said. "In this case, it provides us a reminder of how important it is to
cook beef thoroughly and, once cooked, to keep it at 140 degrees or
refrigerated at 41 degrees until served."
_E. coli_ 0157:H7 causes severe, often bloody diarrhea and painful
abdominal cramps. In some persons, particularly children younger than 5
years of age and the elderly, the infection can lead to hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS), which can result in stroke, seizures and death. In this
outbreak, no cases of HUS have been identified.
While this severe strain of _E. coli_ comes from the intestines of cattle,
it has been linked to outbreaks related to many different foods and to
water. A recent outbreak in New York that sickened about 800 people was
traced to a water well that was contaminated with cow waste. In Illinois in
1996, there was an outbreak of _E. coli_ that was associated with red leaf
lettuce. The lettuce was apparently contaminated in the field when the
farmer used water for irrigation that contained cow waste.
Most cases, however, are linked to undercooked beef and, in particular,
ground beef. The ground beef can become contaminated with fecal matter when
the animals are slaughtered. When the meat is ground, fecal organisms on
the outside of the meat are mixed throughout the ground beef. These
bacteria can survive unless the meat is thoroughly cooked. Work surfaces
that come in contact with ground beef also should be thoroughly cleaned
before using again.
The bacteria are present in the stools of infected persons and can be
passed from one person to another if hygiene and hand washing habits are
inadequate.
