A veterinary surgery in Malmesbury has told the BBC it's treating a dog from Hullavington which is suspected of having Alabama Rot. This is a condition that causes blood clots, skin lesions and potential kidney failure in dogs.

As many as 2 other cases have been discovered in Wiltshire this year [2018], both of which were diagnosed after post-mortem examination.

All 3 dogs affected were walked within a 10 mile radius.

[This report adds little fact but it might result in effective surveillance maps, which could lead to better awareness and clear some epidemiology questions. This syndrome may have a specific ecology. If that is the case, it could be GARP-mapped to show new areas where it has yet to be reported but in the meanwhile should be visited with caution. - Mod.MHJ
