[1] WHO update

As of 16 Apr 2013 (18:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. Of the latest laboratory confirmed cases, one is from Jiangsu Province, one from Zhejiang Province, and one from Anhui Province.

The patients include:

* a 60-year-old man from Jiangsu who became ill on 6 Apr 2013;
* a 68-year-old woman from Zhejiang who became ill on 3 Apr 2013;
* a 60-year-old man from Anhui who became ill on 10 Apr 2013.

Additionally, one patient earlier reported from Jiangsu has died.

To date, a total of 63 patients have been laboratory-confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 14 deaths. More than 1000 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

About this Disease Outbreak News

1. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources.

2. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported.

3. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.

[4] Traditional Chinese medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of 24 of the 77 H7N9 cases reported across China as of Wednesday [17 Apr 2013], according to the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Citing the case of a Beijing girl who was discharged from a hospital Wednesday [17 Apr 2013] afternoon, Liu Qingquan, a member of the TCM expert team for the prevention and control of human infections of H7N9, said at a press briefing that TCM was administered 15 hours after the patient took Western medicines when her temperature hit 39.8 C [103.64 F]. The patient began to sweat 3 hours later. After 5 hours, her temperature fell below 37.5 C [99.5]. She was also given other TCM remedies to ensure her bowel health.

Xu Zhiren, a senior official with the administration, said clinical practices have proven the outstanding effects of TCM when used at an early stage of an illness, and it also has a role to play in moderate and severe cases. According to Xu, the administration has set up a TCM emergency response system for public incidents, with 229 clinical bases established for the prevention and control of infectious diseases at provincial and city levels.

[5] No poultry contact in some cases
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2013
Source: Fox News, Reuters report [edited]
http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/04/17/no-poultry-contact-in-some-china-bird-flu-cases-who-says/


The World Health Organization [WHO] said on Wednesday [17 Apr 2013] that a number of people who have tested positive for a new strain of bird flu in China have had no history of contact with poultry, adding to the mystery about the virus that has killed 16 people to date. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl confirmed that "there are people who have no history of contact with poultry," after a top Chinese scientist was quoted as saying that about 40 percent of those with the H7N9 virus had had no contact with fowl. "This is one of the puzzles still (to) be solved and therefore argues for a wide investigation net," Hartl said in emailed comments, though he added he did not know the exact percentage.

China has warned that the number of infections could rise from the current 77. The latest victims are from the commercial capital of Shanghai, where the majority of the cases have been found, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013]. China reported 3 new outbreaks to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) this week, bringing the total number of places to 11, the OIE said on its website.

The exact source of infection remains unknown, and no human-to-human spread of the virus has been confirmed. Samples have tested positive in some poultry markets that remain the focus of investigation by China and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. Zeng Guang, the chief scientist in charge of epidemiology at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre (CDPCC), said about 40 percent of the victims had no clear history of poultry exposure, the Beijing News reported on Wednesday [17 Apr 2013]. "How did these people get infected? It's a mystery," Zeng was quoted as saying. According to a Reuters analysis of the infections, based on state media reports, only 10 of the 77 cases as of Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] have had contact with poultry.

WHO said no H7N9 vaccine was currently being produced. "Such a decision will depend, for WHO's part, on public health considerations," it said. "We must see how H7N9 develops before any such decision is considered." The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in early April 2013 it had started work on a vaccine just in case it was needed. China's poultry sector has recorded losses of more than 10 billion yuan (USD 1.6 billion) since reports emerged of the new strain 2 weeks ago, an official at the country's National Poultry Industry Association said on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013].

Authorities have slaughtered thousands of birds and closed live poultry markets in Shanghai and Beijing in an attempt to reduce the rate of human infection. An international team of flu experts will go to China this week to help with investigations into the virus, WHO said on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013]. China said on Sunday [14 Apr 2013] the virus had spread outside the Yangtze River delta region in eastern China, with cases reported in the capital Beijing and the central province of Henan.

Animal infections of the H7N9 avian flu have only been detected in live poultry markets and a single wild pigeon, agricultural authorities said Wednesday [17 Apr 2013]. Of the 47 801 samples collected from more than 1000 poultry markets, habitats, farms and slaughterhouses across the country, 39 samples have tested positive for the virus, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

Of the 39 positive samples, 38 came from live poultry markets in east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, central China's Anhui Province and the city of Shanghai.

A wild pigeon tested positive for the virus in Jiangsu. The virus has not been detected in pigs, the ministry said.
