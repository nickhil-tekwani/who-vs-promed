New Mexico state health officials are reporting 2 confirmed cases of tularemia in 2019 among 2 residents of Santa Fe County: a 57 year old man and a 72 year old woman.

"Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets, so I would encourage people in Santa Fe County to follow precautions to avoid getting infected," said Department of Health cabinet secretary, Kathy Kunkel. "People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals such as rabbits or rodents or are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies. Provide your own protection against insect bites and improve your pet's safety by not letting them roam loose or scavenge rodents."

Tularemia is a rare infection caused by the bacteria _Francisella tularensis_ that can spread through insect bites, with deer flies and ticks being the primary vectors in New Mexico. It can also be spread through handling infected animal tissues in situations such as hunting, trapping and skinning of rabbits or other rodents or during the clean-up of rodent carcasses while gardening.

Dogs and cats can be infected if they are allowed to roam and scavenge dead animals or are not protected from tick bites. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick: If they are not diagnosed and treated by their veterinarian, they can give the disease to people. Direct inoculation from an animal bite is very rare but can occur if the animal is infected.

Tularemia symptoms in people may include sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches and joint pain. Other symptoms may include swollen and painful lymph glands especially in the anatomical region where the bacteria 1st gained entry into the body.

[The clinical manifestations of tularemia in these 2 cases are not stated.

Tularemia is a bacterial infection that affects, aside from people, more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released. The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-spore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp.

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors. - Mod.LL
