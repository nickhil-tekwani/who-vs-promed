The number of people seeking medical assistance in the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo, for food poisoning has increased overnight from 300 to 425,
officials at the Sarajevo Clinic Hospital said on Fri 11 May 2007. The
clinic's officials told reporters in Sarajevo that more than 60 people
arrived into hospital in the last couple of hours, where more than 350
people have been treated in the last 48 hours. More than 100 people were
hospitalized due to severe salmonella poisoning.
The director of the hospital, Faris Gavrankapetanovic, said more patients
were expected in the next 72 hours. All the patients, according to the
clinic, had eaten chicken sandwiches in a popular fast food and pizzeria
restaurant in the city's center. The restaurant is located near several
schools and a local bus station in downtown Sarajevo.
