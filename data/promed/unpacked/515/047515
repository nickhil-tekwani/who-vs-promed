Amerithrax review: lessons for future investigations
----------------------------------------------------------
Article highlights
- Most news coverage of the National Academy of Sciences review of the
FBI's Amerithrax investigation has focused on its failure to
conclusively show that Army scientist Bruce Ivins was the lone
perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax attacks.
- The academy report also detailed many significant methodological and
organizational problems in the scientific portion of the Amerithrax
probe.
- If the FBI doesn't address these scientific problems, its
investigation of future bio-attacks may not support effective
prosecutions or help a president decide how to respond, if the attack
is state sponsored.

When the National Academy of Sciences issued its review of the FBI
anthrax investigation earlier this year [2011], the press fixated
primarily on one point: The report found no conclusive evidence that
Bruce Ivins, the Army scientist the government contends was
responsible for a series of anthrax-laced letters mailed in 2001,
produced them. Far less attention was devoted to the academy's
comments on the FBI's problems with methodology -- particularly the
thoroughness of its research and its use of new technologies -- and
organization, especially at the start of the probe, when there was no
structure for directing its scientific efforts. If the FBI fails to
address these problems, it will remain ill-equipped to produce
evidence for future bio-attack cases that stand up in court. Further,
it will be unable to provide a president with sufficient information
to support a possible retaliatory decision in the case of a
state-sponsored bio-attack.

Perhaps the most astonishing result of the academy's analysis involves
the scope of the FBI's findings in regard to the 5 anthrax letters at
the heart of the case. After years of investigation, the bureau
answered only a small number of the questions that it pursued: when
the anthrax was produced, whether the material in all the letters was
the same, and whether it had been weaponized. But other key questions
relating to how and where the material was produced remained
unanswered, making a determination of the material's origin and the
perpetrator's identity problematic.

Early in the investigation, the FBI determined that the anthrax in the
envelopes was of the virulent Ames strain and was produced in 2
separate batches with "differences in spore concentrations, color,
contaminants, texture, growth media remnants, and observed debris."
The presence of silicon in the material was initially deemed
indicative of weaponization, as silicon dioxide has been used in past
state bioweapons programs to enhance dispersion. Further analysis of
the anthrax, however, indicated that the silicon was located within
the spores, as the product of the spores' natural growth process,
rather than on their surface, where such dispersant material would
normally reside. Carbon dating also determined that the spores were
produced between 1998 and 2001, providing a possible chronological
link with Ivins's flask, labeled RMR-1029, which had been stored at US
Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)
since 1997. The FBI theorized that the flask was the source of the
anthrax used in the 2001 attacks.

But genetic analysis was not able to ascertain the origin of the
material in the 5 letters, which were sent to New York and Florida
media outlets and to US senators Patrick Leahy and Thomas Daschle in
Washington, DC. It also couldn't identify the production methods used.
Indeed, the academy's analysis concluded that the RMR-1029 flask was
not the immediate source of the letter material because it presented
characteristics not shared with the letters. For example, unlike the
anthrax spores in the letters, the RMR-1029 spores did not contain
silicon in the coat. In addition, the RMR-1029 sample tested positive
for the purification compounds meglumine and diatrizoate, which the
letter samples did not contain, possibly indicating that a different
purification method was used for the letter material. Therefore, the
academy's report concludes, if the letter material was indeed derived
from the RMR-1029, several additional preparation steps involving
cultivation, purification, and drying would have been necessary.

But the FBI investigation was not able to clarify what methods might
have been used to grow, purify, concentrate, and dry the anthrax sent
in the letters. Given these uncertainties, the FBI was unable to
determine the amount of time needed to produce the powdered anthrax,
the type of skills, and the equipment required to make it, the quality
of the starting material, and the amount of liquid anthrax required to
produce the 5 grams or so of dried anthrax in the letters.

...

To ensure the thoroughness of future scientific investigations, the
academy also suggests that relevant government agencies create and
periodically update protocols and experimental designs for collecting
and analyzing samples, preserving evidence, and otherwise buttressing
the strength of biological cases in court. Equally important is the
creation of a repository of all evidentiary material, so it can be
compared with material in future events. The report emphasizes the
importance of keeping abreast of new technological developments, as
well; technological advances could not only support ongoing
investigations, they could help in the review of past probes. For
example, new genetic-sequencing technologies that emerged in the past
decade could be used today to further investigate the Amerithrax
samples, even though the criminal case is closed. Similar to the DNA
analysis used so effectively in murder cases, these technologies could
reinforce the case against Ivins, whose 2008 suicide precluded a
public review of the case. Or the new technologies could point in a
new direction altogether.

Finally, it is important to ask the question of what relative weight
should be assigned to scientific information, as compared to other
evidence gathered during a criminal investigation. The FBI indicated
that questions relating to the production of the anthrax in the
letters -- whether someone had the skills required or the time needed
for spore preparation -- were not the only criteria used to eliminate
suspects. But what weight was given to these criteria? Considering
that the FBI never precisely established the required skills and spore
preparation time, one may wonder whether the case would have been able
to withstand the scrutiny of a trial.

But read the full article.

It must be pointed out that the FBI (27 Oct 2011) continues to deny
the reports by Frontline and this moderator and his colleagues; see
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/opinion/the-anthrax-investigation-the-view-from-the-fbi.html.

At the same time Greg Gordon and Stephen Engelberg (McClatchy
Newspapers and ProPublica) have pointed out (24 Oct 2011) that the
laboratory security at USAMRIID in 2001 lacked rigor; see
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/10/24/128012/secret-reports-suggest-ivins-and.html

And lastly I would point out that the microencapsulation hypothesis
put forward by MHJ-BR-SJ in relation to the letter spores could be
readily and relatively cheaply tested using _B. cereus_ or _B.
subtilis_ or even Sterne spores, and then comparing the silicon and
tin levels in the test encapsulated spore coats to the levels found by
the FBI in the spores from the NY Post, Leahy, and Daschle letters. -
