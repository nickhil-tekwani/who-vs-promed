Mass food poisoning hits China workers
---------------------------------------
About 400 Chinese construction workers are being treated in hospital after
falling ill from food poisoning. The mass poisoning is being traced to a
construction site canteen. According to workers, the canteen served the
same leftovers each day until they were finished.
The workers -- from Yangtze River Construction -- were building a new plant
for South Korean electronics giant Samsung in Suzhou city in China's
eastern Jiangsu province. The men were all suffering from vomiting, stomach
aches, and fever.
Preliminary investigations by the police and Centre for Disease Control
ruled it was food poisoning, according to the Beijing Times
newspaper. Food poisoning in China normally peaks in the summer months
when food is not adequately protected from the heat.
On Fri 22 Aug 2003, 60 students from Yangzhou University were hospitalized,
complaining of vomiting and dizziness, in a suspected food poisoning case.
About 140 people died from food poisoning in the country in 2002, but
figures are declining on a year-to-year basis, according to the Chinese
government.
Deliberate poisonings have also been reported. Chinese police arrested the
head of a nursery school on suspicion of poisoning 70 children and 2
teachers at a rival school in November 2002. The man had opened his own
school one month prior to the attack but was reportedly jealous of his
rival's success. There was another mass poisoning in September 2002 by a
restaurant owner who was said to be envious of his business rivals in the
eastern city of Nanjing.

[The 2 reported outbreaks, one in construction workers and the other in
students, are likely to be unrelated despite the fact that they have
occurred in the same province in China. No information is given regarding
how many cases occurred that were not hospitalized.
Without more information regarding the incubation period, it is difficult
to speculate on an etiology. Short-incubation illnesses (less than 18
hours) without fever are likely to be related to preformed toxins, such as
_S. aureus_ (mostly vomiting, less than 6-hour incubation period) and _C.
perfringens_ (more diarrhea, incubation period 12-18 hours). These
illnesses tend to be less than 24 hours in duration. Illnesses with longer
incubation periods, fever, and more prolonged symptoms are more likely due
to the in situ replication of enteric pathogens, and may include
_Salmonella sp._, _Shigella sp._, or _E. coli_. Food- or water-borne
viruses such as the noroviruses can also be considered. - Mod.LL]
