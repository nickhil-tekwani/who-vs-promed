The number of newly diagnosed cases of syphilis in Japan totaled 4518 in 2016, exceeding 4000 for the 1st time since 1974, according to data compiled by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases by [Tue 17 Jan 2017].

The sexually transmitted infection is on the rise particularly among women in their 20s, the institute said. According to analysis of new infections reported over the 1st 11 months last year [2015], nearly one-third of the patients were women, with women in their 20s accounting for around half of the female patients, according to the institute. The cause behind the rapid increase in cases remains unclear.

The number of newly diagnosed syphilis cases had declined since 1967 when they exceeded 10 000. The spread of medical remedies had reduced the number of patients to below 1000 in recent years, but the number of cases started increasing again in 2011.

Syphilis is caused by bacteria called _Treponema [pallidum]_. In the primary stage, the disease presents as only minor tumors [ulcers, called chancres, not tumors], in affected areas, such as the genital area and lips. But the infection can eventually cause inflammation throughout the body if untreated. And if pregnant women are infected, syphilis could lead to stillbirth or diseases affecting infants [called congenital syphilis].

The health ministry urges people to be tested immediately if they may have been exposed to the infection through sexual contact with many people they do not know well.

[Similar to what is being reported in the USA, primary and secondary syphilis, the contagious stages of syphilis, have been increasing among women in Japan. ProMED-mail posted a report last year [2016] from Tomimasa Sunagawa of the Japanese Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases that, "From around 2010 to 2013, much of this increase [in syphilis notifications] was attributed to male cases, and among them, mostly MSM [men who have sex with men]. However, since around 2014, the ongoing increase has been attributed more to heterosexual transmission rather than to MSM, for both men and women. And, from week 1 to 43 in 2015 [29 Dec 2014 to 25 Oct 2015], the reported number of heterosexual cases among men surpassed that of cases in MSM, and for women, the number of reported cases has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2014." These trends in women have continued in 2016 according to the news report above. - Mod.ML
