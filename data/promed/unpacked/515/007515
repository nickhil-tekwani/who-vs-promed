The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reported today [31 May 2013; Viral hepatitis homepage, outbreaks http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Outbreaks/2013/A1b-03-31/index.html] that 30 people in 5 states have contracted hepatitis A in an outbreak possibly linked to a frozen berry blend. The same strain, genotype 1B, was involved in an outbreak in Europe this year [2013] linked to frozen berries [see ProMED-mail Hepatitis A - EU: Nordic countries, foodborne, frozen berries 20130417.1653060] and a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, tied to a frozen berry blend, the agency said.

Patients' ages range from 25 to 71 years, and 2/3 are women. Illness-onset dates range from 28 Apr 2013 to 17 May 2013, and 9 of the patients have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Of 17 patients interviewed, 11 (65 per cent) reported eating Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend, a frozen berry and pomegranate seed mix, and 11 people who provided purchase information said they bought this product at Costco markets. Costco has removed the products from its shelves and alerted customers who bought the mix since late February [2013]. Patients are from Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and California. Preliminary lab studies of samples from 2 patients indicated genotype 1B, a strain rarely seen in the Americas, said CDC. It circulates in North Africa and the Middle East. The berry mix contains ingredients from the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Turkey. "Hepatitis A is a human disease and usually occurs when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand hygiene," said CDC.

[This is the 3rd outbreak of hepatitis A associated with consumption of meals incorporating frozen berries. The previous reports emanated from Canada and northern Europe. The outbreak strain was identified as of hepatitis A virus genotype 1B, a strain rarely seen in the Americas but common in the North Africa and Middle East regions.

This genotype was responsible for the recent outbreaks in Europe. However it is possible that another component in the mixture could be the culprit. In the 2012 outbreak in Canada pomegranate seeds from Egypt were thought to be the source of the infection. Further analysis should be conducted to resolve the source of the infection. - Mod.CP]
