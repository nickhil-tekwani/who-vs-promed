Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - WHO update 3
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
is continuing to respond to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever in the Province of Kasai Occidental with the
support of a wide range of international partners.
As of 27 Sep 2007, there has been a total of 17 laboratory-confirmed
cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever reported in the Mweka and Luebo
health zone, Kasai Occidental Province, along with additional
confirmations of other etiologies associated with this outbreak,
including typhoid and _Shigella dysenteriae type 1_. The last
confirmed case of Ebola died on 22 Sep 2007 in Kampungu MSF isolation
ward and was buried safely. Mobile laboratories, installed by
specialists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
the United States and the National Public Health Agency of Canada in
2 of the affected villages are enabling the teams on the ground to
conduct rapid and precise diagnosis of new suspected Ebola cases
within 2 to 6 hours.
Teams on the ground are focusing on breaking the chain of
transmission and are continuing to monitor additional suspected cases
in isolation facilities and to trace contacts. The national health
authorities are putting in place stringent infection control measures
in health centres and hospitals in the affected area to minimize the
risk of infection among health care workers. Information and training
material on infection control is being prepared and disseminated to
provincial health authorities across the country in case additional
cases are identified beyond the currently affected area.
The local health authorities in the affected area are working closely
with social mobilization experts and communication teams to develop
key information messages for the local communities. Journalists are
preparing and broadcasting radio sketches on the prevention of Ebola
as well as providing communities with information on how to recognize
its early symptoms and alert the relevant authorities. It is
estimated that up to 60 percent of the local population is being
reached through these radio broadcasts.
The communications teams are also working through local civil society
groups including women and youth associations, churches, military
units, schools and markets to reach as wide a spectrum of the
population as possible. These activities are essential to alert the
communities to the risk of transmission while at the same time
reducing the panic and fear that are frequently associated with
outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever.
Retrospective investigations of hospital records are underway to
determine the progress the outbreak took in its initial stages and to
document the spread of the epidemic in the 1st few months.
