Prof. Steve Berger sent in the following item from Gideon that helps
to put Pogosta virus infections in historical perspective. - Mod.TY]

Pogosta disease
Time and place
--------------
- Pogosta disease was first described in the Pogosta region of
Northern Karelia [eastern Finland] in 1974.

- The disease is reported from all parts of Finland, however, North
Karelia remains the region with highest incidence, with rates as high
as 80 per 100 000.

- Extensive epidemics were recorded in 1974, 1981 (thousands of
cases), 1988, and 1995.

- Incidence peaks during August to September.

- Disease incidence follows a 7-year cycle.

- Highest rates are reported in the age group 45 to 65.

Graph notes
------------
The graph can be accessed through the Source URL above.

- 2183 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported during 1981 to 1996
(average rate 2.7 per 100 000 per year).

Individual years:
1995 - cases were distributed throughout the country, with highest
incidence in central Finland, Savo, and North Karelia.

2003 - included 105 cases in Lansi-Suomi and 50 in Ita-Suomi

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 1.7 percent of 'suspected rubella' [cases] in Finland (1973 to 1989)

- 11 percent of persons suspected of having viral infection -- 17
percent in western Finland, 9 percent in northern and southern Finland

- 0.6 percent of women of childbearing age (1992)

- 5.2 percent of humans (Sindbis virus, 1999 to 2003)

- 27.4 percent of resident grouse (_Tetrao urogallus_, _T. tetrix_,
_Bonasa bonasia_, _Lagopus lagopus_) in 2003, 1.4 percent in 2004

The principal vectors are mosquitoes (_Culex_ & _Culiseta_ species),
and the presumed reservoirs are tetranoid (grouse) and migratory birds.

- During an epidemic in 1981, 65 percent of black grouse and
capercaillie were found to be seropositive.
