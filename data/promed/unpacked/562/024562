[This is the 1st reported case of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the oblast (province) of Voronezh, located in the central belt of the European part of Russia; a leap of about 400 km (about 250 mi) north-westwards from the location of the closest earlier LSD outbreak, in Volgograd oblast. This can be seen in the map showing the accumulated 270 outbreaks in Russia since 25 May 2016 (http://tinyurl.com/zdgq9cd; click on the north-west part of the cluster, zoom in). Notably, the affected establishment is a backyard farm which held a single animal, found LSD-infected. It will be interesting to be informed if this animal was born on the farm/kept there long, or introduced recently.

The 1st LSD outbreak in the region was reported in July 2014 from Azerbaijan. During 2015, LSD was reported from Dagestan, Chechnya, and (the disputed territory) South Ossetia, as well as from Armenia, a former member of the Soviet Union. The disease recurred in May 2016, massively spreading north, east, and now westwards.

Russia's delegate, Dr N Lebedev, presented the epidemic situation on LSD in the Russian Federation, as of 4 Jul 2016, during the 1st meeting of the 'Standing Group of Experts on Lumpy Skin Disease in Europe' (under the Global Framework for the progressive control of Transboundary Animal Diseases/GF-TAD's umbrella), held in Brussels 4-5 Jul 2016. According to the report, the total number of outbreaks as for 4 Jul 2016 was 155, reported from the following Federation's territories (in parentheses, number of outbreaks): Astrakhan oblast (3), Krasnodar kraj (1), Republic of Dagestan (27), Kalmykia Republic (40), Chechen Republic (60), Stavropolsky kraj (24 (see with map in slide 11 of the presentation, at http://web.oie.int/RR-Europe/eng/Regprog/docs/docs/LSD1/LSD1%20-%20Russia.pdf).

The said presentation also includes the following data from the Russian Federation:

1. Laboratory diagnosis
-----------------------
LSD is diagnosed based on the epidemical data, clinical signs, post-mortem findings and laboratory tests. FGBI "ARRIAH" [Federal Centre for Animal Health] performs comprehensive diagnosis which includes:
- virological tests: virus isolation;
- molecular biology techniques: capripoxvirus detection and identification using multiplex PCR (2007), study of capripoxvirus genome fragments by sequencing;
- antigen determination;
- Bioassay in naturally susceptible animals.

2. Measures taken in case of infection
--------------------------------------
Legal basis of the control: Order of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation no. 81 of May 17, 2005 (Moscow) "Approval of the List of Quarantine and Highly Dangerous Animal Diseases", as follows:
- no cattle movements and regrouping;
- in case of new disease cases the diseased and suspect animals shall be isolated in the same facilities where they were housed;
- no marketing of animals, their slaughter products and feed;
- samples of pathological materials shall be collected from disease suspected animals and/ or from dead cattle and shall be urgently (within 24 hours) sent for testing;
- comprehensive measures shall be taken to prevent spread of the disease and to eradicate it taking into account potential confirmation of lumpy skin disease diagnosis.

3. Measures taken for the infection eradication
-----------------------------------------------
According to quarantine requirements in case of the outbreak confirmation on a farm the cattle owners shall do the following:
- stop all cattle movements and regrouping;
- ban entrance of unauthorized persons to the farm excluding animal handlers and veterinarians;
- stop slaughter of animals kept on the farm as well as marketing of animals, their slaughter products and feed;
- ban exit and entrance of vehicles to the LSD outbreak as well as exit of personnel without decontamination;
- as soon as the 1st LSD cases occurred in a herd the diseased and contact animals shall be withdrawn from the herd. Such animals shall be bloodlessly killed under the due control of the official veterinarians;
- in order to prevent the disease spread all LSD susceptible animals located in the outbreak shall be treated with repellents and insecticides. The animals are also subject to vaccination.

4. LSD prevention
-----------------
Heterologous live attenuated vaccine is used for the disease specific prophylaxis.
Currently preclinical trials of the homologous LCD vaccine are in process.

FGBI ARRIAH has performed a series of experiments determining the potency of live attenuated sheep pox virus vaccine based on "ARRIAH" strain:
- at the OIE recommended dose of 104 TCID50 [median tissue culture infective dose], this vaccine confers full protection in cattle challenged with virulent LSDV.
The vaccines in our portfolio:
- freeze-dried live attenuated sheep pox virus vaccine (50 and 100 doses)
- freeze-dried live attenuated goat pox virus vaccine (50 and 100 doses)
- freeze-dried live attenuated sheep and goat pox virus vaccine (50 and 100 doses)

Subscribers are encouraged to access the full presentation, which also includes pictures of clinical cases and maps.

Since July 2016, the disease continued its spread in Dagestan, Astrakhan, Kalmykia Republic, Volgograd, Rostov, and now Voronezh. The disease has already invaded Kazakhstan and threatens to spread further into central Asian and south east European countries. This may continue throughout the remaining summer/fall months. - Mod.AS]
