An Ebola victim from Sierra Leone buried in Pita
------------------------------------------------
The government measure prohibiting inter-city transfer of corpses has no effect. A Guinean national, infected with Ebola virus disease [EVD] in Sierra Leone, died in Conakry [Guinea]. The next day his body was conveyed to Pita [Guinea] for burial. Consequently his native village, Kollaguel, now lives in psychosis, it was learned on Sunday [27 Jul 2014] at Pita.

According to our sources, the victim was hit by EVD in Sierra Leone. Transported to Conakry, more precisely Dixinn, the victim did not survive. Thus his kinfolk decided to convey the body for burial in Pita, actually to Kollaguel in Doghol Touma. Pending determination of the chain of contamination, a team of the Red Cross is on the way to Doghol Touma, sub-prefecture located within 50 miles of Pita Centre.

Ebola Virus: Lagos, FG Urge Citizens Not to Panic as No Nigerian Is Infected
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lagos State Government on Monday [28 Jul 2014] called on all Nigerians to be calm and not panic, assuring them that both the State and Federal Governments [FG] are well prepared to ensure that the Ebola virus disease [EVD] did not spread and that no Nigerian is infected with the virus.

Addressing a joint Ministerial Press briefing of the Lagos State Ministry of Health and Federal Ministry of Health on developments concerning the disease, the Commissioner for Health, Dr Jide Idris, affirmed that there has been only one case of imported Ebola, resulting in the death of a Liberian diplomat in Lagos. He added that health authorities were being very pro-active about the detection of the ebolavirus in the Liberian, who was on his way to Calabar for a conference, by ensuring that all contacts are being actively followed.

Dr Idris said part of the measures taken after the death of the Liberian was the demobilization of the private hospital where he was admitted and elimination of the primary source of infection, adding that the decontamination process in all affected areas has commenced. He added that the corpse of the victim has since been cremated, and the ash is awaiting further directives from the Liberian Embassy, and commended the role of the Management of the hospital and their ability to detect a high-risk patient within 24 hours. Adhering strictly to WHO guidelines, the body of the deceased patient was decontaminated using 10 percent sodium hypochlorite and cremated, with the permission of the government of Liberia. A cremation urn has been prepared for dispatch to the family. The vehicle that conveyed the remains was also fully decontaminated," he added.

In terms of contact tracing, Dr Idris informed that so far a total of 59 contacts was registered consisting of 44 hospital contacts (38 healthcare workers and 6 laboratory staff) and 15 airport contacts comprising 3 ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] staff (driver, Liaison, and Protocol officers), the Nigerian Ambassador to Monrovia, 2 nursing staff and 5 airport passenger handlers. He explained that out of the number, 20 contacts had been physically screened of which 50 percent are of the type 1 contact and another 50 percent were type 2 contacts. The airline manifest has not been provided by the airline at the time of this report and therefore, the precise number of passenger contacts is yet to be ascertained, especially as 2 flights were involved (Monrovia-Lome (Togo) and Lome-Lagos). There was no report of a medical incident filed. Dr Idris added that an isolation ward was designated by the Lagos State Ministry of Health at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, for case management, while the designation of 3 other health facilities is underway. A total of 100 PPE [personal protective equipment] was procured by the NCDC/FMOH and distributed to the private hospital and the State Ministry of Health. WHO also donated 250 PPE to the NCDC/FMOH [Nigeria Centre for Disease Control/Federal Ministry of Health].

The Commissioner also said a call-in team was established for the public to dial in and obtain information on the Ebola virus disease while toll-free lines were obtained from a telecommunication service provider to be used for answering questions, creating awareness, and receiving notifications of any suspected case, just as public awareness creation through social media such as Twitter and Facebook accounts was also activated. He stressed that in recognition of the importance of involving the community early in the response, traditional and religious leaders were alerted about the disease and requested to report [any cases?] promptly to health-care workers.

The Special Adviser on Health, Dr (Mrs.) Yewande Adeshina, also appealed to operators of traditional health care centres to be wary of patients with fever symptoms who show signs of extreme weakness and diarrhea and immediately alert health authorities about such patients. The President of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Professor Oyewale Tomori, who was also at the briefing, said all the contact persons are being screened on a continuous basis to look for any possible signs of the disease. He commended the timely action taken by the Lagos State Government and the private hospital, adding that there is absolutely no need for people to panic, as the golden rule is to observe the personal hygiene of always washing the hands regularly with soap.

The briefing was attended by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information and Strategy, Mr. Lateef Raji and Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health, Dr Modele Osunkiyesi, Permanent Secretary, Health Services Commission, Dr Hamid Balogun and Permanent Secretary Primary Health Care Board, Dr Kayode Oguntimehin.

[3] Liberia: finance ministry shutdown
Date: Mon 28 Jul 2014

http://frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/politic/2475-liberia-finance-ministry-in-24-hour-shutdown-after-ebola-death


Liberia Finance Ministry In 24-Hour Shutdown After Ebola Death
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the wake of the rapid spread of the deadly ebolavirus and the recent untimely death of Mr. Patrick Sawyer, Coordinator of the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] National Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, having contracted the virus, the Ministry wishes to announce the following measures to ensure public safety and instill confidence in users of services at the Ministry.

At the very highest level of the Ministry, all senior officials coming in direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sawyer have been placed on the prescribed 21 days observation period starting 20 Jul 2014, the day Mr. Sawyer departed the country for Nigeria. All concerned senior officials have been requested to telecommute up until when certified by the Ministry of Health to return to active duty.

Further to this measure, the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh, has requested the Ministry of Health to immediately quarantine and properly sanitize both the former Ministry of Finance and the former Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs buildings, including the newly constructed National Authorizing Office of the European Union. Due to these measures, the Ministry will be temporarily shut down 12:00 PM on Monday, 28 Jul 2014, and reopened on Tuesday, 29 Jul 2014. All employees, who made no contact but have been traumatized as a result of the situation in the last few days and would like to take some time off, are free to stay home until when is necessary to return to duty. However, all essential employees still working at the Ministry are asked to observe the following measures strictly:

- Use of the elevator is restricted to only 4 persons per trip;
- Absolutely, no clustering on the stairways;
- No gathering of more than 5 persons except for meetings in conference spaces or spatial environment;
- Absolutely no handshakes, hugging or other physical bodily contact [This is an overabundance of caution; only contact with the excretions or blood of a person already showing symptoms is dangerous. - Mod.JW];
- Please report any suspicious illness or strange conditions among employees;
- Only persons with genuine business dealings and transactions would be permitted on the premises;
- All employees are further encouraged to wear long sleeve clothing to minimize any possible risk of exposure.

In addition to these measures, the Ministry has put in place a thorough sanitary program and admonishes all staff to use the hand washer or personalized sanitizers or disposable gloves available at the Ministry's entrance.

These measures take immediate effect as the MFDP [Ministry of Finance and Development Planning] treats this crisis seriously and will work to continue our support to the ongoing national response effort. Consistent with the President's message and pledge, the MFDP, with support from our other partners, is committed to providing the full range of support required to address this situation in coming days. Notwithstanding, the general public is advised to carry out their normal transactional businesses at the Ministry and follow closely the measures announced in the interest of public health.

Meanwhile, the MFDP tax policy unit will review, in conjunction with the Liberia Revenue Authority, a proposal for the relaxation of tariffs and duties on the importation of sanitary materials and other bleach products during the period of this situation.

[4] Liberia: 2nd American aid worker infected
Date: Sun 27 Jul 2014
Source: Associated Press (AP) [summ., edited]
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/american-doctor-africa-gets-treatment-ebola


A 2nd American aid worker has tested positive for the Ebola virus disease [EVD] at the same hospital in Liberia where an American doctor became infected while helping to combat an outbreak of the deadly disease, a relief group official said Sunday [27 Jul 2014]. Ken Isaacs, a vice president of Samaritan's Purse, told the Associated Press [AP] that Dr. Kent Brantly -- the 33-year-old medical director for the group's EVD care center on the outskirts of the Liberian capital of Monrovia -- was stable but in very serious condition. "We are hopeful and prayerful," Isaacs told AP by telephone from the group's headquarters in Boone, North Carolina. He said the doctor quickly recognized the symptoms and sought speedy treatment.

Isaacs identified the 2nd American, Nancy Writebol, as a worker with an allied aid group SIM, or Serving in Mission, which runs the hospital where Samaritan's Purse has an EVD care center on the grounds. He said she was in stable but serious condition. "She is showing full symptoms of the disease," Isaacs said. He added that Writebol had been working as a hygienist who decontaminated those entering and leaving the EVD care area at the hospital. He said both Americans have since been isolated and are under intensive treatment.

Isaacs, the Christian relief group's vice president of program and government relations, said the fact that health care workers have been infected underscores the severity of the West Africa outbreak that has killed hundreds in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. "It's been a shock to everyone on our team to have 2 of our players get pounded with the disease," said Isaacs, adding health ministries in those poor nations are challenged to respond. "Our team is frankly getting tired."

Brantly's wife and children had been living with him in Liberia but flew home to the USA about a week ago, before the doctor started showing any signs of illness, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse. "They have shown absolutely no symptoms," she said.

[5] Liberia: closes borders

Ebola outbreak: Liberia shuts most border points
------------------------------------------------
Most border crossings in Liberia have been closed, and communities hit by an Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak face quarantine to try to halt the spread of the virus. Screening centres are also being set up at the few major entry points that will remain open, such as the main airport.

There are to be more areas for people to wash their hands to help stop the spread of the virus.

In a statement on Sunday night [27 Jul 2014], Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the special Ebola task force she was heading would ensure that "communities that are seriously affected will be quarantined and travels in and out of such communities restricted". The BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in the capital, Monrovia, says her new orders include strict observation at the international airport of all outgoing and incoming passengers, who are now liable for inspection and testing. All government facilities and public places are to install public access for washing of hands and all hotels, restaurants, and film centres are to play 5-minute information clips on EVD awareness and prevention.

Over the weekend prominent Liberian doctor Samuel Brisbane died after a 3-week battle with the virus. President Johnson Sirleaf urged people to co-operate with health workers and EVD awareness campaigners. Last month [June 2014] she warned that anyone caught hiding suspected EVD patients would be prosecuted. Experts say the disease creates fear within communities and sick people are often stigmatised. Liberian Senator Peter Coleman, a doctor and former health minister, told the BBC that authorities needed to approach religious leaders to spread the message about Ebola as "people don't seem to believe anything the government now says".

Nigeria
-------
Meanwhile, Nigeria largest's airline, Arik Air, has suspended all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone after a man with EVD flew to Nigeria last week. Nigeria has put all its entry points on red alert after confirming that a Liberian man died of Ebola after arriving at Lagos airport on Tuesday [22 Jul 2014]. Arik Air said it took the decision to halt flights as a precautionary measure. "We feel especially compelled to take the business decision to immediately suspend flight services into the 2 Ebola affected countries due to our interest in the well-being of Nigerians," the airline, which operates routes across West Africa, said in a statement.

[6] Sierra Leone: riot, correction
Date: Mon 28 Jul 2014
Re: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (103): Liberia, Sierra Leone 20140727.2637578

[Yesterday I posted the wrong story (above) under a Bloomberg byline. The source of that report was actually https://birdflu666.wordpress.com, which has a scurrilous headline, and which incorrectly stated that the Kenema hospital lab operated by Tulane University was funded by the George Soros and Bill Gates [Foundations]. That is quite wrong. It also, as I commented at the time, misinterpreted a WHO/CDC statement on in-hospital spread.

As if there is not enough misinformation about EVD among the people of West Africa, it is reprehensible that bloggers are spreading misinformation on the internet about American organizations who are only trying to help. The Tulane team is currently working in Nigeria on the EVD crisis there.

Below is the correct original text. I regret the error. - Mod.JW]

Sierra Leone Police Use Tear Gas to Curb Ebola-Related Riot
-----------------------------------------------------------
Residents of Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone threw stones at a hospital and a police station, spurred by a rumor that health workers were using Ebola virus disease [EVD] as a ruse to kill people and collect body parts, a police official said.

The rumor was spread by a mentally ill former nurse, now in custody, who went to the city's main market and told people Ebola was a hoax, police Assistant Inspector General Karrow Kamara said by phone. Police had to use tear gas to stop the crowd from destroying the Kenema Government Hospital, he said. "Many people are saying there is no EVD, and some others have been calling for the relocation of the EVD treatment unit outside the premises of the Kenema hospital," Kamara said.

More than 600 people have died from the disease in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria said today [25 Jul 2014] a Liberian man died of the ebolavirus, the 1st case in Africa's largest economy.

[As reported above, regrettably, misinformation about EVD is not only rife in West Africa, but also on the internet.

Regarding washing the body before burial, a Nigerian correspondent writes: "Death in an epidemic is considered as a martyr's death in Islam, and often ritual bathing may not be necessary for that. Additionally, a panel of medics and clerics can waive the ritual bath after discussing the risk to the living." Unfortunately, relatives may insist on opening the body bag and manually inspecting the corpse because of false rumors that body parts may have been removed.

WHO has detailed recommendations for international air transport in case of a passenger presenting with symptoms compatible with EVD (fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding) on board of an aircraft. Also:

"3.1.4. Screening passengers at points of entry (ports, airports or ground crossing) is not recommended. Screening of passengers at points of entry (arrival or departure) is costly and expected to have very limited impact because it is very unlikely to detect any arriving person infected with EVD. This is particularly true for EVD with its incubation period of 2-21 days and symptoms that are not specific. As part of this, the use of thermal scanners that rely on the presence of 'fever' in arriving passengers is costly, unlikely to detect any arriving person infected with EVD and is not encouraged. Travel restrictions, closure of borders at points of entry are not recommended" (http://who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en).
