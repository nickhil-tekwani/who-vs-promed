The Ministry of Health has halted application of a [suspected]
defective yellow
fever (YF) vaccine already given to 304 people in Tenerife.
A total of 5 people, among them the leader of Unio, have required
health assistance following the administration of defective YF
vaccines. One of these individuals remains in the HUC [University
Hospital of the Canary Islands] affected by hepatitis. The Ministry
hopes that there will be no further cases.
In Tenerife, 4 patients have had to receive health assistance in
units outside the capital that administered the defective YF vaccine.
One of these is the hepatitis patient who is in serious condition in
the HUC.
Health officials argue that the 4 cases of adverse reaction could
simply be the result of a coincidence caused by a normal reaction to
this type of vaccine. After administration of the vaccine, these 4
individuals suffered nausea, vomiting and headache.
The Ministry of Health explained that until they have the results of
the analysis of the vaccine in question next week [week of 17 Jun
2007], they will not know what provoked these reactions. These
reactions could be due to individual responses, to errors in
manufacture [of the vaccine], or inadequate handling by breaking the
cold chain. The Ministry underscored that this latter cause, based on
their observations, seems unlikely, since it [the vaccine] did not
have a bad odor nor have mold [contaminants].

[Although YF vaccine can produce adverse reactions, some eventually
fatal, they are rare. The incidence of adverse reactions is not well
known, but is in the area of one in a million doses applied.
Hepatitis is one of these adverse events. What causes one to take
note is that, apparently, these 5 persons who had reactions received
vaccine from the same lot.
Problems in vaccine fabrication or "with the cold chain" are not
convincing explanations. Cold chain problems would result only in an
ineffective vaccine due to inadequate potency, nothing more.
Manufacturing problems do not
explain this problem either. A better explanation is needed. - Mod.JLS]
[In a 12 Jun 2007 follow up article from El Dia
<http://www.eldia.es/2007-06-12/vivir/vivir17.htm>
[in Spanish, trans. & summ. Mod. TY] the Canary Islands government has
distributed a different lot of YF vaccine to replace the suspected lot
and informed health units in the islands and other countries of the
lot that is thought to have produced the 5 adverse reactions. The
Carlos III Hospital is continuing its investigation of the suspicious
vaccine lot. The hepatitis case associated with the vaccine has
improved. Jose Segura of the Tenerife Sanitary Area indicated that 10
per cent of the YF vaccinates are [normally] expected to have a mild
headache and fever following vaccination.
[ProMED requests further information about the analysis of the
suspected YF vaccine lot as it becomes available. As Mod.JLS points
out above, adverse reactions to YF vaccine, although very rare, are
not unknown. Nonetheless, YF vaccine remains one of the safest and
most effective of viral vaccines.
ProMED archive 20041118.3093 reports a fatal YF vaccine case in a
26-year-old woman but indicates that most fatal YF vaccine instances
are in individuals over age 50 years. In that archive, Mod. JW
indicated that the 2002 MMWR report referenced below describes the 1st
US case of fatal YF vaccine reaction in a person aged less than 50
years; of the 12 cases reported worldwide, 5 were in people under 50
years of age, and one case was 16 years old. - Mod.TY]
[Note that Spain had a YF vaccine-associated death in 2004 -- see refs. below.
