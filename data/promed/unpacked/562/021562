Germany's Ministry of Food and Agriculture said on Wednesday [9 Sep 2020] it had a suspected case of African swine fever [ASF] in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

The suspected case concerned a wild boar carcass found a few kilometers from the German-Polish border. A sample of the carcass was being taken for tests at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut laboratory, the ministry said in a statement.

"As soon as the analysis is completed, Federal (Agriculture) Minister Julia Kloeckner will provide information about the results tomorrow [Thu 10 Sep 2020]," the ministry added.

[Introduction of ASF into eastern Germany was feared since the start, on 4 Nov 2019, of a new, extensive outbreak in western Poland. Previously, ASF was restricted to the eastern territories of Poland. The new event, which involved mainly wild boars, affected 3 western Polish provinces, 2 of them bordering east Germany. Few outbreaks involved domestic swine farms.

This west Poland event was summarized in OIE's reporting system, updated on 13 Jul 2020, as follows:
Total outbreaks = 505 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / not available / 1134 / 1134 / 0 / 0
Domestic swine / 33 887 / 405 / 311 / 33 576 / 0

OIE's interactive map showing all outbreaks in western Poland is available at https://tinyurl.com/y6dvlctx (zoom in to the required resolution).

As published today (Wed 9 Sep 2020) in a press release by Germany's Ministry of Agriculture (thanks to Sabine Zentis), a single wild boar carcass was found a few kilometers western to the Polish border, in the district Spree-Neisse, situated in the southeast of the German state of Brandenburg (map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg#/media/File:Brandenburg,_administrative_divisions_-_de_-_colored.svg).

Germany's large pig population is currently seriously threatened by ASF, an incurable, viral disease against which no vaccine is available. This virus has never been reported in Germany before.

ASF is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
