Coconut lethal yellowing on the Southern Coast of the Dominican
Republic is associated with a new 16Sr IV group phytoplasma
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coconut palm (_Cocos nucifera_) is an important economic and
landscape crop in the Dominican Republic. Lethal yellowing (LY), a
phytoplasma disease of coconut palm, was 1st reported in the northern
coastal provinces of Puerto Plata, Santiago, Dajabon, and Luperon in
1962. No further spread of LY was reported between 1969 and 1986,
which is attributed to quarantine and eradication programs in the
affected provinces, but natural barrier, such as, topography, edaphic
factors, and an abundance of non-host palms could also have contributed.
Dead or dying coconut palms with symptoms of LY were 1st recognized
at Boca Chica on the southern coast during February 2006. Leaf,
inflorescence or trunk tissues from 5 diseased palms were tested for
phytoplasma infection using a nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
with primers P1/P7 followed by LY group-specific primers
LY16Sf/LY16Sr. A product (1.39 kb) was amplified from all 5 affected
palms but not from a symptomless coconut palm. Endonuclease digests
of nested PCR products showed no differences in fragment patterns
amongst the 5 diseased palms. However, these patterns were atypical
of the LY phytoplasma belonging to the 16SrIV-A subgroup. Comparison
of near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence obtained after
amplification with primers P1/P7 indicated this phytoplasma was most
similar (99.9 percent) to the strain associated with Yucatan coconut
lethal decline (LDY), a subgroup 16SrIV-B member, but belonging to a
newly identified subgroup, 16SrIV-E, while sharing only 98.3 percent
identity with LY phytoplasma.
This is the 1st report of a new 16SrIV group phytoplasma associated
with yellowing coconut palms in the Dominican Republic.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) was 1st reported from the Caribbean region and
by 1981 it had killed 90 percent of the Jamaica Tall variety of
coconut palms in Jamaica. Using material sampled in Jamaica, a
phytoplasma cause was identified.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes has shown that
phytoplasmas are a unique taxonomic group of small, unculturable,
intracellular, plant parasitic bacteria within the group of the
Mollicutes. 16S rRNA sequences were adopted as a framework for formal
taxonomic classification. Within the phytoplasmas, as many as 20
groups and numerous subgroups have been resolved. The taxonomic rank
of species has been proposed to describe each of the primary
phylogenetically coherent phytoplasma groups.
One of the primary groups defined by molecular classifications is the
palm lethal yellowing group (type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
palmae), which was designated as group 16SrIV. Today, the 16SrIV
group also includes the Tanzanian coconut lethal decline group (type
member _C._ P. cocostanzaniae)
_C._ P. palmae was isolated from Florida material and can infect a
large number of palm species. Different strains associated with
decline of coconut (strain LDY) and yellows disease of the cyclanth
(strain CPY), have since been identified from other sources. Several
other distinct strains were found associated with leaf yellowing
syndromes of coconut palm in LY-free areas of Mexico.
LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in affected areas and
is spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa. Transmission is
thought to occur by the planthopper _Myndus crudus_, but
seed-transmission cannot be excluded. Symptoms may be suppressed by
tetracycline, but commercial control of LY is primarily achieved by
replanting with resistant varieties such as Malayan Dwarfs (see
earlier ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643).
Other phytoplasmas have been found to cause diseases in crops such as
grapevine, papaya, rice, potato, citrus, pome, and stone fruit.
