A number of Humboldt penguins at Longleat [Safari and Adventure Park, Wiltshire] have died today [21 Sep 2016] due to an outbreak of avian malaria in the colony.

It is thought that this would have been contracted through an airborne mosquito.

While this disease does not affect humans, Longleat has taken the decision to close Penguin Island to visitors in order to give their team additional space and time to care for their remaining birds and to allow the "heartbroken" keepers time themselves to get through the experience.

Keepers will be spending the next few weeks doing everything they can to care and treat the remaining penguins in Longleat's collection in the hope that their health improves and they get better.

Humboldt penguins are medium-sized penguins, growing to 56-70 cm [22-28 in] long and a weight of 3.6-5.9 kg [7.9-13 lb]. They have a black head with a white border which runs from behind the eye, around the black ear-coverts, and chin, and joins at the throat.

Due to a declining population caused in part by over-fishing, climate change, and ocean acidification, the current status of the species is threatened.

[Avian malaria is a disease caused by protozoans in the genus _Plasmodium_, which are transmitted by mosquitos. _Plasmodium_ infections are naturally acquired in populations of some penguin species (such as African black-footed penguins) where they are often subclinical. There have been reports of mortality in captive colonies.

It is known that, within limits, arthropod populations are favored by heat and moisture. Therefore, it is expected that climate change will influence vector-borne diseases. In fact, a number of vector-borne human and domestic animal diseases (including malaria, African trypanosomiasis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, plague, dengue, African horse sickness, bluetongue), have increased in incidence or geographic range in recent decades . - Mod.PMB
