Vaccination? Not for the USA, but perhaps for Europe
----------------------------------------------------
[The current policy of APHIS [US Department of Agriculture's Animal &
Plant Health Inspection Service is that FMD vaccine will only be used in
the USA under 5 circumstances: if an outbreak has not been contained within
6 months, if it affects 25% of the livestock in a given area, if the
cost/benefit ratio of slaughter approaches 1:2, if the disease becomes
endemic in the wildlife of 3 or more states, or if slaughter is found to be
illegal.
Of course, as is happening in Europe, the policy on vaccination could
change in the face of a crisis. But it will be a complete waste of time to
argue the pros and cons of vaccinating in the USA when the disease reaches
there -­ the word "when" is used deliberately -- for the following reasons.
The US stockpile contains 2.5 million doses of type O vaccine, the type
that is causing the current pandemic. But there are 8 million head of
cattle in Texas alone, not to mention sheep and pigs. Given the massive
daily movements of livestock in the USA, and the time needed to vaccinate
2.5 million head, it would just be a diversion of scarce resources to
attempt vaccination there.
Even ring vaccination around outbreaks would be useless. The British
experience has shown that, by the time a new outbreak is detected, the
disease has already spread far beyond that locality. And vaccination of a
strip along the Mexican or Canadian border would not help. Cattle are no
longer herded from one country to another; one truck crosses those borders
every few seconds, and does not stop until it is far inside the USA.
The kindest thing would be for the US to give its vaccine stock back to
Europe, where it came from, to help the crisis there, and concentrate on
other means of control when the pandemic arrives. Alternatively, the
vaccine could be given now to protect US breeding stock or rare breeds
there which are not going to enter the food chain.
