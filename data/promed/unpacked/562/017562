A strain of bubonic plague as deadly as that which caused the Black Death could make a reappearance on Earth, scientists have said in a stark warning. Research into one of the most devastating pandemics in human history - the Plague of Justinian, where half the world's population died - found evidence that such an episode could happen again. Scientists who isolated genetic traces of the plague from the teeth of 2 1500-year-old victims found it was caused by a distinctly different bacterial strain from that responsible for the later Black Death.

Both scourges were triggered by the bubonic plague bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, which can be spread from rats [or other infected rodents - Mod. LL] to humans by fleas. The new research shows that the 2 infectious organisms were distinct strains. While the Justinian strain vanished from the Earth, the Black Death strain gave rise to another pandemic in the late 1800s. The discovery suggests that a new deadly strain of plague could strike again without warning.

Dr Dave Wagner, a member of the international team of scientists from Northern Arizona University in the USA, said: "We know the bacterium _Y. pestis_ has jumped from rodents into humans throughout history and rodent reservoirs of plague still exist today in many parts of the world.

"If the Justinian plague could erupt in the human population, cause a massive pandemic, and then die out, it suggests it could happen again. Fortunately we now have antibiotics that could be used to effectively treat plague, which lessens the chances of another large-scale human pandemic." The Plague of Justinian struck in the 6th century and is estimated to have killed between 30 million and 50 million people as it spread across Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe - virtually half the world's population at the time. Some 800 years later, the Black Death wiped out 50 million Europeans between 1347 and 1351.

The scientists managed to recover tiny DNA fragments of the bacterium from the teeth of two Justinian plague victims buried in Bavaria, Germany. From these short remnants they reconstructed the genome of the Justinian strain of _Y. pestis_ and compared it with a database of more than 100 contemporary strains.

The findings, published online in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, revealed that the strain responsible for the Justinian plague was an evolutionary "dead end". It came, did its damage, and disappeared from the Earth, having no connection with the later Black Death.

The 19th century pandemic which spread across the globe from Hong Kong was a likely descendant of the more successful Black Death strain, said the scientists.

Experts now think the Justinian strain of _Y. pestis_ originated in Asia, not in Africa as originally thought. But there was no molecular evidence of a link with earlier smaller epidemics such as the Plague of Athens in 430 BC and the Antonine Plague between the years 165 and 180.
These outbreaks could also represent separate, independent emergences of Y. pestis strains capable of infecting humans, it is believed.

"This study raises intriguing questions about why a pathogen that was both so successful and so deadly died out," said Australian co-author Dr Edward Holmes, from the University of Sydney. "One testable possibility is that human populations evolved to become less susceptible."

Background
----------
_Yersinia pestis_ has caused at least three human plague pandemics. The second (Black Death, 14--17th centuries) and third (19--20th centuries) have been genetically characterised, but there is only a limited understanding of the first pandemic, the Plague of Justinian (6--8th centuries). To address this gap, we sequenced and analysed draft genomes of _Y. pestis_ obtained from two individuals who died in the first pandemic.

Methods
-------
Teeth were removed from two individuals (known as A120 and A76) from the early medieval Aschheim-Bajuwarenring cemetery (Aschheim, Bavaria, Germany). We isolated DNA from the teeth using a modified phenol-chloroform method. We screened DNA extracts for the presence of the _Y. pestis_ specific pla gene on the pPCP1 plasmid using primers and standards from an established assay, enriched the DNA, and then sequenced it. We reconstructed draft genomes of the infectious _Y. pestis_ strains, compared them with a database of genomes from 131 _Y. pestis_ strains from the second and third pandemics, and constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.

Findings
-------
Radiocarbon dating of both individuals (A120 to 533 AD [plus or minus 98 years]; A76 to 504 AD [plus or minus 61 years]) places them in the timeframe of the first pandemic. Our phylogeny contains a novel branch (100 percent bootstrap at all relevant nodes) leading to the two Justinian samples. This branch has no known contemporary representatives, and thus is either extinct or unsampled in wild rodent reservoirs. The Justinian branch is interleaved between two extant groups, 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2, and is distant from strains associated with the second and third pandemics.

Interpretation
------------
We conclude that the _Y. pestis_ lineages that caused the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death 800 years later were independent emergences from rodents into human beings. These results show that rodent species worldwide represent important reservoirs for the repeated emergence of diverse lineages of _Y. pestis_ into human populations.

Once again, this is another study that underscores how Mother Nature remains the World's best bioterrorist. with MERS-CoV, influenza H5N1 and H7N9, and others, she continues to challenge us. This moderator hopes that a more virulent plague strain will not be part of her handiwork.- mod. LL]
