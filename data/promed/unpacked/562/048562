Testing will continue this week to try to learn why 55 residents of the Greenspring assisted-living center in Springfield have become ill, 20 have been hospitalized, and 2 have died in recent weeks. County health officials say the center has been closed to new admissions while efforts to pinpoint the cause of the infections continue.

"The individuals who died were hospitalized with pneumonia. Both were older adults and had complex medical problems. The Health Department does not know the full medical history and the extent to which the pneumonia contributed to the deaths," said spokesman John Silcox in a news release [Fri 12 Jul 2019]. Health Department officials said that tests [have] so far been negative for common viral and bacterial infections, including [influenza] and legionnaires' disease [LD]. Samples have been sent to the Virginia Health Department in Richmond and forwarded to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for additional testing.

Greenspring is located on a 58-acre [about 23 ha] campus. It features a comprehensive continuing care neighborhood that includes assisted living, memory care, short-term rehabilitation, and long-term care. Greenspring is operated by Erickson Living, which has facilities housing 24 000 people in 11 states.

County health officials have said Erickson is doing an "excellent job" of managing the outbreak.

[The news article above updates information on an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness that has now affected 55 individuals, 20 of whom were hospitalized, 2 with a pneumonia that was fatal, in the past 2 weeks in the assisted-living and skilled-nursing sections of a retirement community in northern Virginia. Symptoms included fever, cough, body aches, wheezing, hoarseness, and general weakness. The specific cause of the outbreak has not yet been identified, although the article reports "tests [have] so far been negative for common viral and bacterial infections, including [influenza] and legionnaires' disease [LD]." The viral and bacterial infections that were ruled out are not specified.

We have only been told that 2 of the 55 affected individuals had pneumonia. Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of legionella infection, would still be a possible cause for those cases without pneumonia. Sputum culture and the urinary antigen test for LD are usually negative in Pontiac fever. Symptoms of Pontiac fever (fever, malaise, and muscle aches) are less severe than LD, and resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Pontiac fever develops within hours to 3 days after exposure vs 2 to 10 days for LD. Attack rates for Pontiac fever are high; up to 95% of exposed persons become ill vs less than 5% for LD. Unlike LD, there appear to be no predisposing host conditions for Pontiac fever (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html). A more detailed description of the clinical presentation and prior health status of the affected individuals and whether they were staff or residents would be helpful.

_Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae_ and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infections occur year-round, but are characterized by their slow spread through closed populations, unlike the outbreak described in the news article above.

Greenspring is a retirement community, with independent living, assisted living, memory care, short- and long-term nursing care units, supported by a staff of more than 1200 in Springfield, Fairfax County in northern Virginia (https://www.ericksonliving.com/greenspring/about). Springfield, along with collective areas with Springfield addresses, having an estimated population of more than 100 000 residents in 2010, is located in the Washington Metropolitan Area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Virginia).
