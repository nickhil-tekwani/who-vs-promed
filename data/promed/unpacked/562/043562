South Korea continued its efforts to prevent the spread of bird flu [avian influenza] Tuesday [21 Jan 2014] amid the discovery of a new suspected case of the virus.

With the latest suspected case of avian influenza (AI) at a duck farm in Gochang, 300 kilometers [186 mi] southwest of Seoul in North Jeolla Province, the total number of suspected and confirmed AI cases came to 9. Four of the cases have been confirmed through DNA tests that identified the highly pathogenic strain of the H5N8 virus.

The new case was reported shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs noted a 3-day cessation in new cases, raising hopes that the virus may have been contained.

About 200 000 poultry have been slaughtered at the affected farms and others within potential infection range since last week [week of 13 Jan 2014].

Efforts to contain the animal disease included a temporary lockdown at all poultry farms in North and South Jeolla provinces where the affected farms are located.

The lockdown was lifted after 48 hours as the government apparently sought to reserve such a measure as a last resort. Under the current law, the lockdown can be extended only once for 48 hours.

The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was found in a group of migratory ducks found dead last week [week of 13 Jan 2014] at a reservoir near the affected farms, possibly indicating the source of the animal disease and the difficulties in trying to contain it.

"The most important point in our quarantine efforts is to prevent the flow of any source of infection, such as excrements of migratory birds, into poultry farms," Kwon Jae-han, the ministry official in charge of livestock policy, told a press briefing.

The AI virus has an incubation period of up to 3 weeks. "This means avian influenza could break out at any time throughout the winter season when the disease is most rampant," he said.

The country has reported 4 outbreaks of bird flu since 2003. The most recent outbreak in 2010-11 led to the culling of over 6 million animals, causing over 80 billion won (USD 75 million) in damages, according to the ministry.

Several more poultry farms in North Jeolla Province reported cases of suspected bird flu Tuesday [21 Jan 2014], but the government said that doesn't mean the disease is spreading to other regions beyond the already-designated "danger zone."

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs lifted a "lockdown" order Monday night [20 Jan 2014] that had banned the movement of poultry, farmers and workers within South and North Jeolla provinces and Gwangju [Gyeonggi province].

One duck farm near the west coast in Gochang, North Jeolla Province, reported the deaths of ducks with likely symptoms of avian influenza Tuesday morning [21 Jan 2014]. It is 19 kilometers [12 mi] away from the farm that reported the 1st outbreak.

The agriculture ministry, however, found that it is run by the same owner of the farm in Buan who had reported the 2nd outbreak of bird flu. Having tracked movements of his feed-carrying trucks, the government concluded that the disease was only transmitted from one farm to the other.

Around noon, another farm in Jeongeup in North Jeolla Province reported suspected symptoms of bird flu -- the 1st case to take place outside Gochang and Buan.

The agriculture ministry said that although it took place in a different administrative district, the farm in Jeongeup is within the "danger zone" -- an area within 3 kilometers [2 mi] from bird flu-struck farms that the government regularly inspects. It won't consider it as a new outbreak or spread of the disease.

Within the danger zones in or near Gochang and Buan, the government found 6 poultry farms with suspected symptoms of bird flu and one was confirmed to be infected with highly pathogenic virus. Ducks in all 6 farms were culled.

In the meantime, tens of thousands of Baikal teals have left the Dongrim Reservoir where some 60 of them were found dead, infected with the H5N8 strain of avian influenza. These species of migratory birds are suspected to have spread the disease as they flew over the farms.

The teals that left Dongrim are believed to have moved to Geumgang Lake in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, with the number of the birds increasing from some 50 000 to 250 000, according to the local migratory bird observatory.

On Tuesday [21 Jan 2014], however, the number shrank to some 100 000 as food was covered by snow and became scarce.

There is also the fear that ducks from the bird-flu struck farm in Buan have been supplied to a slaughterhouse in Naju, South Jeolla Province, according to Yonhap News Agency. The government hasn't confirmed yet if the slaughtered ducks have been distributed to consumers.

Kwon Jae-han, the ministry official in charge of livestock policy, told a press briefing that the most important point in quarantine efforts is to prevent the flow of any source of infection, such as excrement of migratory birds, into poultry farms.

The AI virus has an incubation period of up to 3 weeks. "This means avian influenza could break out at any time throughout the winter season when the disease is most rampant," he said

[The term 'HPAI' (highly pathogenic avian influenza) relates to the assessment of the virus's virulence in chickens; see updated text in section "B. Diagnostic techniques 2. Assessment of pathogenicity", of OIE's Manual, Chapter 2.3.4. -- Avian influenza, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.

So far, the current HPAI H5N8 epizootic in South Korea has affected duck farms only, causing -- as expected -- minimal rates of morbidity and mortality. Much higher rates might be expected if/when the virus penetrates into chicken flocks. - Mod.AS
