H1N1 follows ethnic pattern
---------------------------
State and federal health officials wanted to know what kind of people
were hospitalized with swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus
infection], so they studied Anchorage residents who tested positive
and were admitted at 4 area hospitals over several weeks -- a total of
59 people. The biggest surprise, according to state epidemiologist Dr
Joe McLaughlin: People from 2 ethnic groups -- Alaska Natives and
American Indians, and Asians and Pacific Islanders -- were
hospitalized at higher rates than those in any other ethnic groups.
The rate for Alaska Natives was 4.5 times greater than for white
people, at 50 per 100 000, said McLaughlin. Asians and Pacific
Islanders weren't far behind Alaska Natives, at a rate of 41
hospitalizations per 100 000.

As expected, most people of all races who were hospitalized -- 71
percent -- had another medical condition that put them at higher risk
of complications from the flu. The most common pre-existing health
problem was asthma, which affected 17 of those admitted, said Dr Jay
Wenger, an epidemiologist with the Arctic Investigation Program of the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Wenger was
one of the report's authors. Heart disease was next with 10 people,
and other lung diseases were next with 6 people. People might have had
more than one underlying condition. 9 of the 59 people were so
seriously ill they were treated in intensive care units; 1 of the 59
died.

The researchers studied Anchorage residents hospitalized from 1 Sep
2009 through 21 Oct 2009 at Providence Alaska Medical Center, Alaska
Regional Hospital, the Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital, and Alaska
Native Medical Center. They eliminated anybody not from Anchorage,
even if they were hospitalized there, so they could compare the
results against Anchorage's known demographics.

None of the people had received the [pandemic] H1N1 swine flu vaccine,
which was first available in Alaska in limited quantities in early
October [2009]. But most of the patients -- 73 percent -- were in one
of the 5 priority groups established by the CDC for getting vaccinated.

Wenger said researchers suspected in advance that Alaska Natives might
be especially affected by swine [pandemic] flu because prior studies
show that the highest rates of respiratory diseases in Alaska occur in
Native people. The fact that a greater proportion of Alaska Natives
are younger than 24 than the population as whole also might have
contributed to Alaska Natives' higher rates of serious illness with
swine [pandemic] flu in the study, said McLaughlin. Young people all
across the country are more vulnerable to the swine [pandemic] flu
that's taken hold this year [2009], compared with normal, seasonal flu
viruses. 58 percent of the Alaska Native and Asian-Pacific Islander
patients hospitalized in Anchorage during the study were young --
under age 25. Only 29 percent of the whites hospitalized were under 25.

The researchers picked Anchorage to study first because there are more
patients there. Wenger said the CDC will also help the state look at
people hospitalized in some other parts of Alaska, including the
Yukon-Kuskokwim delta.

[This limited survey of patients in Anchorage, Alaska, concludes that
ethnicity may be a factor influencing the severity of response to
infection by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus. However, the
design of the study lacks a matched control group and is too limited
in scope to discriminate confounding sociological and demographic
factors. It does support, however, the observation that younger age
groups, and those with underlying medical conditions, are at greater
risk of severe reaction to pandemic (H1N1) virus infection. - Mod.CP]
