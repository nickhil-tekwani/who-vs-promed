Rift Valley fever virus, a virus that has killed nearly 80 people in
Kenya, has spread to the Somali border town of Doble, where thousands
of refugees fleeing conflict are assembled, officials said on Friday
12 Jan 2007. The disease had been largely confined to remote parts of
Kenya's North Eastern and Coast provinces. However, the disease which
is spread through the movement of infected livestock, has crossed
over to neighbouring Somalia.
"In Doble, there were reports of people falling sick and animals
dying," Kariuki Njenga, a virologist with the Centre for Disease
Control, told Reuters. "There are also reports of animals aborting
for the last 2 weeks. These are some of the symptoms of the Rift Valley Fever."
Although transmission from animals to humans is rare, the disease
develops into a much more severe illness once it crosses over causing
victims to abort, vomit blood or bleed to death. The disease is
transmitted to humans through mosquito bites or frequent contact with
contaminated animals.
"Four more people have died of Rift Valley Fever in the region today.
This brings the total death toll to 78. There are now 214 confirmed
cases since 14 Dec 2006," said Ahmed Omar, medical officer for North
East province.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said its teams were having
difficulties getting help to affected people as heavy rains over
Kenya had made roads impassable, meaning the disease could spread to
other areas. The WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres and other agencies
have deployed teams of experts to reinforce local hospitals and
clinics and stop the epidemic spreading any further

[The human death toll from Rift Valley fever in the region has
increased fro 68 on Fri 5 Jan 2007 to the current total of 78. The
number of known cases is now 214 in Kenya plus an unknown number in
the town of Doble across the border in Somalia. - Mod.CP]

RE: PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - Somalia: susp, RFI
-----------------------------------------------------
It is interesting, if rather disheartening, to watch another RVF
epizootic emerge and evolve in eastern Africa and to note that it is
such a close recapitulation of events that occurred in 1997/8 and
decades before. It is a recapitulation not only with respect to
disease evolution but also in terms of national and international
preparedness -- or lack of it.
Those who followed ProMED in those days will be aware that the
epizootic attracted intense international attention and was closely
reported in postings, which contain much useful information. Despite
seminal work on developing early warning systems based on remote
sensing, led by Vincent Martin, Glyn Davies and Kenneth Linthicum
inter alia, it seems that the capacity to respond has not improved
greatly in the high-risk countries in Africa.
As warned by FAO EMPRES, in the face of an established El Nino event,
if continuing rainfall maintains inundation, we are likely to see in
the next weeks the progressive emergence of foci of RVF and other
diseases across a broad swathe of country from southern Ethiopia and
Somalia to northern Tanzania with devastating effects on the health
of communities and livelihoods based on livestock production and
trade. [See further, in section 3 of this posting, data from the
FAO/EMPRES analysis and outlook, published ahead of the current RVF
outbreak -- namely in November 2006. - Mod.AS]
In addition, re-emergence of disease in West Africa is a real
possibility. Are the national authorities themselves taking action to
limit impact? Should major epizootics develop, this time will it
bring about investment in establishing systematic early warning and
response systems for the future, or will there be a flurry of
exuberant activity followed by _Aedes_ eggs settling into the dried
mud of dambos and heads re-buried in the sands of Africa like the
proverbial ostrich?
One other issue I would like to raise is that whenever there are
reports of RVF outbreaks, the possibility of the disease spreading to
other areas is described, as it is in your posting of 11 Jan 2006
[20070111.0112]. I wish to suggest that this is an incorrect concept,
and I would be grateful if others more knowledgeable than me could
comment. Certainly as an RVF epizootic evolves, one sees first the
emergence of RVF in a small number of sites and then asynchronous
appearance of additional foci of disease over an extended time.
Superficially this can give an appearance of the disease spreading
like a contagious disease, and of course there might be some local
spread by movement of vectors and viraemic livestock, yet, in fact,
infection is primarily emerging from dormancy at different times in
different sites as conditions there become suitable for the emergence
and build-up of primary and secondary vector populations, possibly
also reflecting density of susceptible hosts available to amplify
infection. Lateral spread seems to play only a minor role in
epizootic development.
This is not a trivial, pedantic issue. Undoubtedly area-wide
vaccination has a place in RVF control to suppress emergence and
development of epizootics but the concept of disease spreading out
from a focus tends to mislead people into conceiving that vaccination
buffer zones can contain infection. That is unlikely given that the
virus has already been seeded into and established long ago in
suitable habitats across a broad area.

The above web-site includes the section "EMPRES WATCH" as well as a
pdf document titled "Possible RVF activity in the Horn of Africa" (7
pages), dated November 2006; recommended reading. It is available
on-line at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//217874/EW_hornafrica_nov06_rvf.pdf>.
The following 2 last sections of the said document are herewith copied.
5. Recommendations
------------------
The Risk maps presented in this review were obtained from the
analysis of environmental data alerts and depict specific areas of
Africa that could face new outbreaks of vector-borne diseases and
more specifically Rift Valley fever. Countries located in high risk
areas of RVF and those which recently experienced RVF should activate
and increase disease surveillance according to OIE standards in
particular those countries located in areas associated with the
previous occurrence of RVF. If there are no reports of clinical signs
compatible with RVF, disease surveillance should focus on mosquitoes
and serology of susceptible ruminants only.
FAO encourages these countries to activate their early warning,
prevention and contingency plans.
Importing countries of meat or animals from RVF risk areas should not
apply trade restrictions if disease surveillance is in place in
countries/zones at risk with negative results. The OIE standards
clearly separate "RVF infection free country or zone" from "RVF
infected countries/zones without disease".
In the 1st case the country is out of the historical distribution
area, a surveillance programme is in place and 4 years have elapsed
since the last epidemic.
In the 2nd, the country is considered free but disease has not
occurred in humans and animals in the past 6 months and climatic
changes predisposing to outbreaks of RVF have not occurred during this time.
A 3rd classification is "RVF infected country/zone with disease,"
meaning clinical disease in humans and animals has occurred within
the past 6 months. Even in presence of disease or infection, the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Code accepts trade of ruminants and meat
from infected countries if certain specific conditions of quarantine
or vaccination are met. This is based on timely and prompt
notification of infection
6. FAO in action
----------------
1. The EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System for the Transboundary
Animal Diseases) programme provides, at an international level, an
overall initiative for coordination of the RVF-Early Warning System,
where data integration and analysis are performed before being
disseminated to recipient countries, international organizations and
key stakeholders in the form of RVF bulletins and risk assessments.
EMPRES promotes the use of remote sensing for forecasting RVF and
other arboviruses occurrence and field validation studies on a
country and regional basis, and its use may allow for preventive
measures to be taken such as the vaccination of susceptible livestock
and mosquito larval control methods.
2. The regional task forces in Kenya have been alerted. FAO office in
Kenya is currently monitoring the situation and is promoting field
assessment mission in flooded areas. Results are expected in the near future.

[Dr Roeder's observations, based upon his expertise and experience in
the East African arena, are highly valued. One wonders if the timely
EMPRES warnings could have helped to set in motion better
preparedness for the evolving outbreak. Certainly, the unstable
political situation in the Horn of Africa has played its role in
delaying adequate response. - Mod.AS]
