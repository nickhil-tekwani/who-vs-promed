The National Confederation of Municipal Health Officials (CONFUSAM) accused the Government of a delayed response and negligence when facing the recent increase in cases of meningitis in Chile.

Between January and October 2012, 87 cases of [meningococcal] meningitis type W135 have already been confirmed, while in all of 2011 there were only 73 cases reported.

For Esteban Maturana, leader of the organization [CONFUSAM], the negligence lies in "the existing controls of the Ministry of Health," specifically the "surveillance system which verifies the number of cases, and this system has alerts which signal when there is a health problem."

The Government recently announced a round of vaccines that will arrive in the country on Monday morning [15 Oct 2012], and [vaccination] will be focused on children less than 4 years of age, the population most vulnerable for this disease.

For the senator of the PPD [Partido por la Democracia/Party for Democracy], Guido Girardi, the announcement by the government is important, even if it was late, and he urged authorities to also include an educational campaign. "Better late than never, always. I think the important thing is to begin with a public health action, as has already been announced, [the need for vaccination], but I hope that vaccination [activities] are accompanied by an educational campaign, which I think is as important as the vaccine," he said.

A total of 73 cases of meningitis have been recorded so far this year [2012] in Chile, a figure that exceeds the notifications for the same period of 2011 (46 cases). The health authority is keeping under surveillance serogroup W135, which has been detected in 42 percent of cases from January [2012] to date. Children under 4 years of age are the most affected group and accounted for 45 percent of all reported cases; children between 5 and 9 years of age accounted for 7 percent; and 45 percent of the cases occurred in people over 20 years of age. 17 cases occurred in children under one year (23 percent), who had the highest incidence rate of 6.7 cases per 100 000 children.

According to the epidemiological report of the Ministry of Health (Minsal), the Region of Valparaiso has the highest incidence rate (0.9 per 100 000 population), followed by the [Santiago] Metropolitan Region. No epidemiological link between the most affected areas has been identified.

There have been 14 deaths (CFR 19 percent) reported this year [2012], higher than expected; 5 of the deaths were due to W135; 1 due to B; 1 due to C, and 3 unidentified.

By this time of year, there are usually between 56 and 60 cases. The Health Secretary, Jorge Diaz, said that the increase in reported cases this year "is small and does not constitute an outbreak."

[From the news reports above, there are discrepancies in the number of cases and the meningococcal serogroups that are causing meningococcal meningitis in Chile. A clarification would be appreciated.

There are 5 common meningococcal serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides: A, B, C, W135, and Y, and a 6th type (X) has recently emerged in Africa. Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines can immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W135, and Y. Serogroup B remains a major cause of severe invasive disease in infants and adolescents worldwide; but, because the serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule, the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic. To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. The components and the type of the vaccine being used in Chile are not stated in the news reports above.

The Valparaiso Region and Santiago Metropolitan Region (or simply Metropolitan Region), 2 of Chile's 15 administrative divisions, are adjacent to each other in the center of Chile. A map of Chile's regions can be seen at http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif.
