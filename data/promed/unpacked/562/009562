Public Health officials in San Luis Obispo County [California] are warning about cases of viral meningitis discovered at Cal Poly.

So far 5 students [in the past month] have been diagnosed with the infection. County Public Health officials stress these are cases of viral meningitis and not the more dangerous bacterial meningitis.

"People with viral meningitis usually complain they've got the worst headache of their life", says Ann McDowell, epidemiologist with the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, "they're feeling nauseous, they might throw up, a stiff neck, they are sensitive to light, those are the most common symptoms that you see." Meningitis, be it viral or bacterial, must be reported to the local county public health department wherever it is detected. So far no bacterial meningitis has been detected on or off the Cal Poly campus.

"Viral meningitis is contagious person to person only if you are in close proximity and sharing personal fluids", McDowell says, "so if you are sharing cups or eating utensils, or personal hygiene, or if you are hugging or kissing or in close contact with somebody you can you can spread it but it's very rare to spread viral meningitis."

Cal Poly students we spoke with say they were alerted about the viral meningitis cases on campus by the University via email. "I'm glad that I'm aware of it", says Cal Poly student Erin Clark, "but I feel like that's a pretty low percentage of people affected." "Wash your hands more, don't go to class if you're feeling real bad, professors are really understanding", adds Cal Poly student Martha Limon, "go to the health center, even if its just a cough, just go to the health center."

There's no vaccine or antibiotic for viral meningitis, treatment includes plenty of rest and fluids, full recovery can take up to 10 days.

[The term "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord, and implies lack of brain and spinal cord involvement (otherwise called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively). In viral meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating. The symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.

The non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. However, other causes of viral meningitis include mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. Some bacteria and non-infectious causes of meningitis can produce a CSF picture simulating viral meningitis. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.

Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through the respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.

California Polytechnic State University, also known as Cal Poly, is a public university located in San Luis Obispo, California, United States, with almost 20 000 undergraduate and 1000 postgraduate students (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Polytechnic_State_University). San Luis Obispo, with a population of over 45 000, is a coastal city located about midway between the California cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California). - Mod.ML
