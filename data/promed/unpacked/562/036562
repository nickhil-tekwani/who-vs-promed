The containment of a devastating banana disease and the development of disease tolerant plants have become the Australian banana industry's top priorities after the Northern Territory government advised its previous quarantine restrictions were not working.

The banana industry's peak body, the Australian Banana Growers' Council (ABGC), said the industry must now take action to stop the spread of Tropical Race 4 (TR4) from the Northern Territory to banana growing regions in Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales. Action also had to be taken to accelerate the development of banana [varieties] tolerant to TR4.

The government on 25 Jul 2012 unexpectedly announced the immediate lifting of quarantine restrictions on properties infected with TR4. "TR4 has devastated Northern Territory banana growing to the point that there is only one commercial plantation left," ABGC said. "The immediate issue is to reduce the risk of the spread of TR4 across the Northern Territory's borders. TR4 has destroyed the industry in those parts of many countries where it entered the soil and no one wants it to spread to Queensland or other states."

The ABGC would be seeking a collaborative, national approach to the fight against the spread of TR4 [and] would also be seeking to ensure that the industry's research and development program increases its focus on developing TR4-tolerant banana varieties. They said it was essential no banana plants be moved interstate from the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is the only place in Australia where TR4 has been detected.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish varieties (see links below), which include most of the commercial eating bananas, are attacked by temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510).

TR4 was reported in Australia for the first time in 1997 in the Darwin area of the Northern Territory. Race 1 and temperate race 4 are present in other parts of the country (ProMED-mail posts 20081212.3908 & 20071024.3451). The cancellation of quarantine restrictions in the Northern Territory increases pressure on the other states to prevent entrance of TR4 to the main Australian commercial banana growing regions and increases considerably the risk of spread of this strain in the country.
