Cases of hepatitis E are spreading across camps in Gedaref and Kassala states, Eastern Sudan, infecting hundreds of refugees from Tigray [Ethiopia] and posing a risk to local Sudanese communities.

In the past few weeks, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical teams in Gedaref's Umm Rakouba camp and Al Hashaba/Village 8 transit centre have received 278 patients, of which 16 were hospitalized, including 3 pregnant women. Many patients have acute jaundice syndrome, a tell-tale sign of the virus, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Umm Rakouba camp is now recording a daily average of 15 cases of hepatitis E. 6 cases have also been identified in Al-Tanideba, while 3 cases have been identified in Hamdayet.

In both Al-Tanideba and Umm Rakouba, latrines are scarce or unusable. In Umm Rakouba, there are only 175 latrines for 20 000 people, while in Al-Tanideba many latrines have been destroyed by heavy rain and wind. Together the 2 camps host about 40 000 people.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology, including genotypes that are zoonotic. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas zoonotic genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation, such as occurs with displaced populations, increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
