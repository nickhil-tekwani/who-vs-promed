There have been eight confirmed cases of cholera and another two suspected
cases reported in the last week in Hong Kong. The strains have so far been
indistinguishable, [all] with resistance to commonly used drugs apart from
quinolones, suggesting a point source. While the media has suggested that
the source has been traced to contaminated chicken feet produced in a local
factory, this has not been confirmed yet, and not all patients have eaten
food from this factory.
Cholera is uncommon in Hong Kong, and previous outbreaks have been traced to
contaminated sea water in which live seafood was kept in restaurants. These
outbreaks tend to occur at the same time as heavy rains and flooding.
There are plenty of places in Hong Kong where food hygiene is substandard,
and the public health authorities have a daunting task in trying to locate
the source of this outbreak. It is to be hoped that the investigation will
be allowed to proceed scientifically and professionally rather than as a
knee-jerk response to pressure from the media.

=95Source of cholera outbreak in Hong Kong identified:
Chicken and ducks' feet contaminated with human excrement were yesterday
blamed for Hong Kong's cholera outbreak. Water used to defrost meat and wash
utensils at a Yuen Long food processing business became a breeding ground
for the deadly bacteria after sewage from staff toilets seeped into the
factory well, health chiefs said. At least six out of the eight cholera
victims were found to have eaten chicken or ducks' feet processed at the
factory. A prosecution order was served on the owner of the factory by the
Regional Services Department yesterday, after inspectors found the premises
to be in "very poor" condition. "We have strong evidence the well water,
which is near the toilets, had been contaminated by the discharge tanks.
This water was then used to wash utensils, to process food, especially after
the feet were cooked, the water was used to cool [them] down," he said.=20

Hong Kong health authorities on Wed, 14 May contacted 200 food outlets and
ordered them not to sell fried chicken and duck feet supplied to them from a
Yuen Long food factory. The factory has been indentified as the source of
four of the cholera infections in the latest outbreak that has so far felled
nine people. Over 4 tons of cholera infected fried poultry feet were seized
at the processing location and destroyed. =20
It is reported that employees at the plant defrosted the poultry parts,
cooled food and washed utensils with well-water that might have been
contaminated by human excrement seeping from two nearby latrines. The
factory was issued a summons on Tue and was asked to suspend operations and
instructed to fill up or disinfect the well on its premises. =20
The well was just four metres away from two dry toilets which used big
septic tanks for disposal just outside the food preparation area. The health
authorities believed that the well water, which is close to the toilets, has
been contaminated by (human) discharge from the tanks. The health authority
found buckets and tanks filled with water used to defrost chicken and ducks'
feet overnight. This water was used to wash utensils, to process food,
especially after the feet were cooked, the water was used to cool them down.
While the plant has been licensed for over 10 years, it is classified as
Category C, the lowest hygienic standard, and is subject to inspections at
least once every two weeks. It has been prosecuted four times in the past 10
years and fined from $350 to $1,000.
Asked why a licensed food factory (classified as Category C - the lowest
hygienic standard and is subject to inspections at least once every two
weeks) was allowed to have have such an unacceptable hygiene condition,
Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun said "It is impossible to
send someone there for 24 hours a day."
Other food plants are being investigated. Of the 9 cases, one is reported
to have been discharged from the hospital and one is reported to be in a=
coma.
