Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Article 10.4.1, point 4, this outbreak does not change the disease-free status of Sweden as this is a wild bird and therefore does not fall within the OIE definition of poultry.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Institute (SVA) national laboratory / barnacle goose / 1 / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 3 Nov 2021 / positive

The HPAI epidemic of 2020-2021 is the largest that has occurred in Europe, with almost 4000 HPAI episodes reported in around 30 European countries. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMB]
