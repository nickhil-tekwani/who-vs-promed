At least 8 people have died of and 82 infected with Japanese Encephalitis [JE] in flood-hit Assam in the past 9 days. This has prompted the health department to ask district authorities to constitute District Rapid Response Teams (DRRT) and to keep a close watch on the situation.

Japanese Encephalitis and Malaria kill many people in Assam every year, specifically during the monsoon flood season which usually starts in May and stretches to October.

According to the National Health Mission (NHM), since [1 Jul 2022], at least 8 people have died and 82 people have fallen ill after being infected by the vector-borne disease.

Assam Health Department's Principal Secretary Avinash Joshi and NHM Director Dr MS Lakshmi Priya on Saturday [9 Jul 2022] conducted a meeting through video conferencing with district authorities and asked them to constitute DRRTs by [16 Jul 2022] to deal with the situation.

The NHM has also issued a Standard Operating Procedure and guidelines to tackle the situation arising from the outbreak.

Last year [2021] at least 40 deaths were reported in the northeastern state due to Japanese Encephalitis, officials said.

[Assam has been a state of very active Japanese (JE) virus transmission in recent years and now, again in 2022. In just the past 3 days, the number of deaths has increased from 6 to 8 and the number of JE cases from 48 to 82. Interestingly, none of these 82 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome as was the situation for those 48 cases in the previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). No mention is made in the above report if any of these affected individuals reported above had been vaccinated against JE or if a vaccination campaign is planned. Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission so more cases are likely to continue to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY
