Five of the six South African giraffes imported to a south China zoo last
month have died of a mystery ailment.
According to the Xinhua news agency, the sixth giraffe at the Nanning Zoo
in the Guangxi Autonomous Region is suffering from the same symptoms as the
deceased animals, shortness of breath, abdominal distension and physical
weakness. Bile continues to spill from the giraffe's mouth and snout, the
report said.
According to Xinhua, medical experts and local police are conducting an
investigation into the deaths, an indication that the animals may have been
intentionally poisoned.
