The outbreak of EVD in the DRC is at a key juncture. Recent trends (Fig. 1) suggest that control measures are working. Over the past week, contact follow-up rates have substantially improved, most patients recently admitted to Ebola treatment centres (ETC) received therapeutics within hours of being confirmed, and ring vaccination activities have scaled to reach contacts (and their contacts) of most confirmed cases reported in the last 3 weeks. However, the outbreak trend must be interpreted with caution. Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 24 Aug 2018, 13 additional confirmed and probable cases have been reported, the majority (n=8) were from the city of Beni. Moreover, substantial risks remain, posed by potential undocumented chains of transmission; 4 of the 13 new cases were not known contacts. Likewise, sporadic instances of high-risk behaviours in some communities (such as unsafe burials and reluctance towards contact tracing, vaccination, and admission to ETCs if symptoms developed), poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in some community health centres, and delays in patients reaching ETCs when symptoms develop all have the potential to further propagate the outbreak.

As of 29 Aug 2018, a total of 116 EVD cases (86 confirmed and 30 probable), including 77 deaths (47 confirmed and 30 probable) have been reported in 5 health zones in North Kivu (Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Mabalako, Musienene) and one health zone in Ituri (Mandima). Eight suspected cases from Mabalako (n=5) and Beni (n=3) are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD. The majority of cases (65 confirmed and 21 probable) have been reported from Mabalako Health Zone (Fig. 2). The median age of confirmed and probable cases is 35 years (interquartile range 19-45.5 years), and 56 percent were female (Fig. 3).

Fifteen cases have been reported among health workers, of which 14 were laboratory confirmed; one has died. All health-worker exposures likely occurred in health facilities outside of the dedicated ETCs. WHO and partners continue to work with health workers and communities to increase awareness on IPC measures, as well as vaccinate those at risk of infection.

In addition to the ongoing response activities within outbreak affected areas, the MoH, WHO, and partners will be implementing a 30-day strategic plan to ensure operational readiness measures against EVD are strengthened in all provinces of the DRC. The 1st phase of implementation will prioritise 6 provinces at highest risk of case importations: South Kivu, Maniema, Ituri, Tanganika, Haut Uele, and Bas Uele. The main objective is to ensure that these provinces implement essential operational readiness measures, including enhancing surveillance, IPC, and social mobilization to mitigate, rapidly detect, investigate, and effectively respond to a possible outbreak of EVD.

[The graphs included in the above reports contain essential information and should be viewed at the URLs provided above. The DRC MOH webpage graph provides a current breakdown of total cases by sex, age, and probable vs. confirmed. But to assess control efforts, the cumulative number of cases is often less instructive than the trending number of cases. That is why Fig. 1 in the WHO report, the number of new EVD cases reported week-by-week, is meaningful.

The good news (albeit quite preliminary) is that the number of new cases over the last 3 weeks has been trending downwards, which may be a sign of real progress in outbreak control. Also encouraging is the fact that no new cases of Ebola have developed in healthcare workers since the establishment of Ebola treatment centers, a sign of more effective quarantine and other infection prevention and control measures.

The troubling news is there continues to be new Ebola cases in individuals who were not known contacts of registered patients [4 out of the 13 new cases 24-31 Aug). In addition, there have been several "Ebola community deaths" as noted in the 30 Aug DRC MOH report (Ebola update (80) 20180830.5996306), which presumably occurred outside of quarantined treatment centers. These "de novo" cases of Ebola indicate that there continue to be unknown disease foci and transmission chains, which could quickly reverse the downward weekly trend in new cases. - Mod.LXL]

Public health response
The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include response coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 29 Aug 2018, 2444 contacts remain under surveillance, of which 79-97 percent were followed up with daily during the past 7 days. During this period, contact tracing teams have faced, and are working to overcome, many challenges, including community refusal in some areas, insecurity, and the movement of contacts, making them hard to follow. The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to systematically monitor and rapidly investigate all alerts in all provinces of the DRC and in neighbouring countries.

As of 29 Aug 2018, 26 vaccination rings have been defined, and 4 additional rings are being defined. Vaccination teams have been vaccinating these rings, which include the contacts and the contacts of contacts of 44 recently confirmed cases from the last 21 days. As of 30 Aug 2018, over 5130 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of which over 1040 healthcare or frontline workers and over 1340 are children. More than 7000 additional doses of vaccine have been transported to Beni to supplement doses currently in place, and additional doses (2160) arrived on 29 Aug 2018 from the USA.

As of 30 Aug 2018, WHO has deployed over 180 multidisciplinary specialists to support response activities, including logisticians, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, communicators, clinical care specialists, community engagement specialists, and emergency coordinators. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the DRC and in neighbouring countries.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), respectively. MSF opened a 7-bed transit center in Makeke on 9 Aug 2018. International Medical Corps (IMC) is planning on establishing an ETC in Makeke, which will then replace the transit center. ETCs are providing therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board.

For the 1st time, there is regulatory and ethical approval to provide access to 5 investigational Ebola therapeutics under the MEURI framework for people infected with EVD. Three are already in use (mAb114, Remdesivir (GS5734), and ZMapp), and more may follow (REGN3470-3471-3479 and Faviripir). To date, 20 patients have received investigational therapeutics: 13 mAb 114, 5 remdisivir, and 2 zMAPP.

A team of IPC specialists are holding daily training with healthcare and frontline workers, assessing and decontaminating facilities, and providing essential hand hygiene solutions and personal protective equipment. A team of experts deployed by WHO are supplementing local capacity, working with dozens of healthcare centres to identify areas requiring strengthening, and provide training and supplies as needed. They are assisting the health centres to set up triage to ensure that patients with suspected Ebola can be separated and treated away from other patients to reduce the risk of the disease spreading.

The MOH, WHO, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni and Mutembo. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups and motorbike taxi drivers are engaged with to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care-seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely across Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, and safe and dignified burials.

From 6-8 Aug 2018, Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys were conducted on 335 individuals in Mabalako and Beni and found that there was a high level of awareness on EVD (76 percent). However, it was also found that there was a low level of knowledge on EVD transmission and prevention (22 percent) and low level of knowledge of the EVD vaccine (23 percent). The 2nd KAP survey is planned for the week of 8 Sep 2018. A community feedback mechanism for collecting feedback, questions, complaints, and rumours to inform localized community engagement strategies is established to adapt risk communication and community engagement strategies to community needs.

The Red Cross of the DRC, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), is responding to the current EVD outbreak in North Kivu with Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB). As of 29 Aug 2018, 10 SDB teams are operational in Beni, Mangina, Butembo, Bunia, and Mambasa. As of 29 Aug 2018, 80 SDBs have been successfully conducted. As of 27 Aug 2018, 34 Points of Entry (PoE) in North Kivu are functional with health-screening activities, and the total number of alerts from these PoEs to this date is 36.

WHO risk assessment

This latest outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public-health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

[I have little to add to this comprehensive WHO summary and assessment of current Ebola response. What I find encouraging is the systematic effort to numerically track the ring vaccination campaign, despite the very unstable and sometimes chaotic conditions under which the vaccinators must operate. Also noteworthy is the comparatively rapid introduction of not just one but multiple new investigational therapeutics, only months after they were 1st contemplated for use during the earlier Equateur outbreak. The numbers of patients eventually treated with these different experimental medicines may be too small to draw meaningful conclusions (although small numbers would in fact be "a consummation devoutly to be wished"), but the regulatory framework and implementation process used in the DRC may serve as a model for conducting future drug trials in the midst of an unpredictable outbreak. For our previous discussions of experimental therapeutics for Ebola, see the following: Ebola update (59) 20180804.5946851, Ebola update (39) 20180620.5865023, and Ebola update (29) 20180608.5845483. For a perspective on the challenges of doing clinical trials during an active outbreak in a poor and unstable country, see article below. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Clinical trials
- Fri 31 Aug 2018. Experimental Ebola drugs face tough test in war zone
[Nature, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06132-7#ref-CR1

Health workers fighting the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC have given nearly 20 people experimental drugs to treat the virus since mid-August [2018]. But because the drugs have been dispensed on a case-by-case, "compassionate use" basis, it is hard to know whether any are effective. Now, desperate to determine which therapy works best, researchers from the DRC and US governments, the World Health Organization, and other groups are meeting this week to plan a clinical trial that will compare multiple drugs as the outbreak continues.

For ethical reasons, the trial scientists say they do not intend to give any study participants a placebo. Instead, they hope to compare the 2 experimental medicines now in use to ZMapp, an antibody therapy that showed promise in limited tests 3 years ago during a major Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Patients in the coming trial would receive one of these 3 drugs at random. The study design draws on a flexible clinical-trial framework that the WHO expects to unveil early next week. The framework is intended for use in multiple Ebola outbreaks, to produce data that can be pooled over time.

The scientists working on the DRC trial hope to launch the effort in the coming weeks. "A clinical trial will give us the scientific evidence we need," says Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director-general of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, which will lead the study.

But planning for the trial is complicated by the realities of working in a conflict zone: the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where fighting has killed more than 5 million people over the past 2 decades. Instability in the region could prevent clinicians from giving patients repeated infusions of drugs and collecting the biochemical data that a trial would require. "We can't control what happens around a treatment centre," Muyembe-Tamfum says. "Armed groups can do what they want."

The current outbreak began on [1 Aug 2018] and has grown to include 115 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola, including 77 people who have died, the DRC health ministry said on [28 Aug 2018]. Public-health workers have vaccinated 4645 people, and doctors have given 3 people the antiviral drug remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences of Foster City, California. Another 13 patients have received mAb114, an experimental treatment derived from antibodies found in the blood of a person who contracted Ebola in 1995 and survived.

That swift response is a major shift from the handling of the Ebola epidemic that struck West Africa in 2014. Experimental drugs were not used widely in West Africa then, because there was no proof of their safety or efficacy: clinical trials did not begin until the outbreak was near its end. That delay helped to drive the death rate among Africans infected with Ebola to 63 percent. But several Westerners infected with Ebola received the nascent therapies in top hospitals; the fatality rate for this group of patients was just 18 percent. The controversy over this disparity eventually prompted the WHO to develop guidelines aimed at ensuring wider access to experimental treatments during future Ebola outbreaks.

But the only way to determine how well a drug works -- and to rule out confounding factors, such as overall quality of medical care -- is through a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Thus far, researchers have not managed to complete a trial of any experimental Ebola drug, because outbreaks of the disease have ended before enough patients enrolled in the studies. So the WHO has been working with international experts to create a basic trial design that can be adapted as data accumulate and logistical challenges change.

Muyembe-Tamfum says that the trial being planned now for the DRC will make use of that framework. It is likely to test 3 drugs: mAb114, remdesivir, and ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical in San Diego, California.

Although there are fewer data on mAb114 than on the other 2 drugs, it has attracted researchers because it is relatively simple to administer. Patients require just one dose, and the medicine is stable when refrigerated, an advantage in hot countries such as the DRC that lack steady electricity supplies.

But the inclusion of ZMapp complicates the trial plan, because the drug must be kept frozen and is given as multiple hours-long infusions, delivered under the watchful eyes of clinicians. "If you have 50 patients, this would require a huge number of doctors," says Augustin Augier, the secretary-general of Paris-based ALIMA, one of the main medical organizations treating patients in the latest Ebola outbreak. "But if ZMapp turns out to be 2 times more superior to the other drugs, you will want to use it anyways."

Stationing a large number of medical professionals in an Ebola unit is particularly fraught during the latest outbreak, because those people could become targets for the more than 100 militias roving the eastern DRC. If armed groups show up at a treatment centre, health workers might leave rather than risk their lives, and any clinical trial could come to a halt. "We are far better off than we were in West Africa, but this outbreak has tough challenges with security," says Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.

But Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, who helps to lead the WHO's Ebola Research and Development team, is unfazed. "Every trial has its own challenges," she says. "That's why we are coming out with an approach that's flexible."
