2022 Monkeypox Outbreak: Global Trends
--------------------------------------

Key figures
-----------
Confirmed cases: 79 151
Deaths: 49
Countries reporting cases: 110

1. Overview
This report provides a global overview of the monkeypox epidemiological situation as reported to WHO as of 10 Nov 2022. The report focuses on laboratory confirmed cases (for the WHO European region, both confirmed and probable cases are included within confirmed case counts and detailed case data) as defined by the WHO's working case definition published in the Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox interim guidance. Note that countries may use their own case definitions separate from those outlined in the above document. This report should be considered in the context of other WHO information products associated with the 2022 monkeypox outbreak, and monkeypox in general:

- The biweekly Situation Report provides a comprehensive update of the monkeypox situation and response activities across a variety of domains such as epidemiology, clinical management and communications, replacing the previous Disease Outbreak News format;
- This global epidemiological report provides in-depth epidemiological information about the monkeypox situation, based primarily on case report forms provided by Member States to WHO under Article 6 of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005).

Links to these products can be see in more detail at the end of the report.

Since 1 Jan 2022, cases of monkeypox have been reported to WHO from 110 Member States across all 6 WHO regions. As of 10 Nov 2022 at 17:00 CET, a total of 79 151 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1345 probable cases, including 49 deaths, have been reported to WHO. Since 13 May 2022, a high proportion of these cases have been reported from countries without previously documented monkeypox transmission. This is the 1st time that cases and sustained chains of transmission have been reported in countries without direct or immediate epidemiological links to areas of West or Central Africa.

With the exception of countries (throughout this document, any use of the word "country" should be considered shorthand for a country, area, or territory) in West and Central Africa, the ongoing outbreak of monkeypox continues to primarily affect men who have sex with men who have reported recent sex with one or multiple partners. At present there is no signal suggesting sustained transmission beyond these networks.

Confirmation of one case of monkeypox, in a country, is considered an outbreak. The unexpected appearance of monkeypox in several regions in the initial absence of epidemiological links to areas in West and Central Africa, suggests that there may have been undetected transmission for some time.

WHO assesses the global risk as Moderate. Regionally, WHO assesses the risk in the Region of the Americas as High and as Moderate in the African Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, European Region and the South-East Asia Region. The risk in the Western Pacific Region is assessed as Low. The IHR Emergency Committee on the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox held its 3rd meeting on 20 Oct 2022. Having considered the views of committee members and advisors as well as other factors in line with the International Health Regulations (2005), the WHO Director-General determined that this outbreak continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern and issued revised temporary recommendations in relation to the outbreak.

The Gorgas Institute for Health Studies has confirmed 21 cases of monkeypox in men between the ages of 25 and 29 since the infection was first identified in Panama in July [2022] reports the Ministry of Health (MINSA).

Of these cases, 16 have been managed on an outpatient basis and 5 have had to be hospitalized for another type of chronic disease.

The head of the Department of Epidemiology of the MINSA, Lourdes Moreno, reported that 78 people suspected of monkeypox have been investigated and that the health regions where the cases have been detected are Panama Metro, West Panama, and San Miguelito.

"We want to call attention to people who are testing positive, to please inform their contacts that they have monkeypox, with the aim that people who are close contacts have the opportunity to be treated in a timely manner and receive the monkeypox vaccine, which is already in our country," Moreno highlighted.

Summary
------

What is already known about this topic?
An earlier analysis of 2891 US monkeypox cases found that up to 99% occurred in men, 94% of whom reported male-to-male sexual contact.

What is added by this report?
CDC's emergency response focused on surveillance, laboratory testing, medical countermeasures, and education. A total of 26 384 US monkeypox cases were reported during 17 May to 6 Oct 2022. Among 59% of persons with data on gender and recent sexual or close intimate contact, 70% reported recent male-to-male sexual contact. Black and Hispanic persons continue to be disproportionately affected.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health monkeypox prevention efforts, including vaccination, should continue to prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, Black and Hispanic persons, and persons who are immunocompromised.
