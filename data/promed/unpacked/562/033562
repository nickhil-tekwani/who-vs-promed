Mosquito samples in Coachella and North Shore tested positive for sickness-inducing Saint Louis encephalitis virus for the 1st time this year [2019], the Coachella Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District reported today [17 Oct 2019].

The test, conducted on Wednesday [16 Oct 2019], showed that mosquito season may last longer this year [2019] than usual, said Tammy Gordon, public information officer for the district.

Most people infected with Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) show no signs of apparent illness, but symptoms for those who become ill include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). No human cases of SLEV have been reported in the county in 2019.

In the past 2 weeks, West Nile virus has also been detected in mosquito samples from La Quinta, Mecca and Oasis, Gordon said. There have been 10 human cases of West Nile virus in Riverside County in 2019. Similar to SLEV, most people infected with West Nile virus do not feel sick, though some may develop a fever or other symptoms, according to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/).

District officials will increase mosquito surveillance in these areas and search for standing bodies of water. "Any standing water source left on your property can be enough for mosquitoes to lay eggs," Gordon said. "We can't do it alone; we need everyone to go outside and eliminate any standing water they find on their property. The cooling temperatures can still be an active time for mosquitoes."

Earlier this summer [2019], the district also detected an invasive mosquito species called _Aedes aegypti_ in Desert Hot Springs. This mosquito is capable of transmitting harmful viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika.

Residents can reduce mosquitoes near their homes by inspecting their yards for standing water, clearing rain gutters, cleaning bird baths and pet water bowls weekly and cleaning new potted plant containers, where mosquitoes may lay their eggs.

Residents should avoid going outside in the hours around dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. Gordon also encourages people to wear long-sleeve shirts and ensure that windows and doors are in good repair to prevent mosquitoes from entering the home.

[The detection of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus in mosquitoes in this area is a warning of risk to humans there, and the advice offered by the district officials should be followed. South of this area , 2 El Centro residents have been infected with the virus, indicating that transmission is occurring over a fairly broad geographic area in Southern California currently (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) 20190823.6636345). Cases of SLE virus-caused encephalitis occur sporadically in southern California and adjoining southwestern states, so the detection of the virus in mosquitoes and the occurrence of 2 cases this year (2019) in southern California are not surprising. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. The virus also is found in the southeastern USA with occasional incursions into the midwestern states. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that less than 1% of SLE virus infections are clinically apparent, and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/technical/symptoms.html).

Wild birds are the SLE virus reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLE virus was detected are not mentioned in the above report.
