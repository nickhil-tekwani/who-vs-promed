[West Nile virus was detected in 3 more dead crows found in Bergen County,
state and federal health officials said Friday. Two dead birds in Westwood
and one in River Edge were identified [as having had West Nile by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Dennis McGowan,
spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Health. The crows were found
early this week, bringing to 4 the number of infected birds in Bergen
County. A dead crow with the mosquito-borne virus was found in River Edge
earlier in June, and two others were found in Rockland County, N.Y.
"This is a cause for concern but not for alarm," said Bergen County
Executive William "Pat" Schuber. The county Mosquito Control Division
planned Friday to sample water basins in neighborhoods where the crows were
found, and to ground spray for mosquito larvae or adults where needed,
Schuber said. There will be no aerial spraying of residential areas in
Bergen County, Schuber spokesman Thom Ammirato said. Only "a real state of
emergency" would cause the county to reconsider that policy, Ammirato said.
That the infected birds were found in Bergen County does not mean they
picked up the virus here, Ammirato reiterated. The county has increased its
budget for mosquito control to $1.2 million, and has a "really sizable
force" of 26 employees, he said. To date, the state Department of Health
has tested 191 dead birds from all 21 New Jersey counties except Camden and
Cape May, where birds were not found, McGowan said. Only the Bergen birds
tested positive, he said. Blood samples from 121 sentinel chickens posted
in all New Jersey counties, and samples from 170 mosquito pools in all
counties except Mercer, Ocean, and Warren, tested negative for West Nile,
McGowan said. McGowan did not know why samples were incomplete in those
counties. Chickens exposed to infected mosquitoes do not become ill but
develop antibodies that indicate the virus is present.
No people have shown symptoms that require blood testing for the virus,
McGowan said. There are no plans for random blood sampling of people in New
Jersey, McGowan said. "That would be way down the line. That's way
premature. We don't even have anybody in the state with the disease yet,"
he said.
