Experts say research into a malady killing Tasmanian platypuses is
being overshadowed by the Tasmanian devil's facial tumour disease.
The platypus disease is spreading beyond northern Tasmania with
affected animals being found in the east, west and south of Campbell
Town. There has also been a new outbreak in the Meander River at
Deloraine where many animals have already died.
The disease affects the animal's organs and causes lesions on the
skin. There is no cure.
Platypus expert Professor Nigel Forteath says research came to a halt
after the death of renowned scientist Dr Barry Munday."We've all
heard about the devil disease, I would hope the disease problem in
the platypus has not been swept aside, our problem is to get the
funding and reincarnate the fantastic work Dr Munday did," he said.
The State Government says the platypus is regarded as common and
species considered 'at risk' are given priority.

[Although the local government may consider the platypus to be "common," the
rest of the world may not agree. The platypus is a unique creature and --
aside from zoos -- it does not appear to be found anywhere else naturally
than Australia. The disease of one unique creature, the Tasmanian devil,
should not overshadow the disease and needs of another unique creature.
It would be helpful if Professor Nigel Forteath could tell us more
about the characteristics of the disease and what causes may have
been eliminated. - Mod.TG]
