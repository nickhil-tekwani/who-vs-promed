[The notification above reports an unexpected increase of Q fever
incidence in goat farms in 8 Dutch provinces, totalling 18 outbreaks.
In addition, it reports that 63 dairy-goat holdings have been found
infected by the targeted surveillance; these are now liable to
modified stamping out.

It may be assumed that the "outbreaks" mean "premises with abortions
lab-confirmed as Q fever related".

The current OIE notification does not specify the time interval
relevant to the given increase, as pertaining to the 18 outbreaks
reported; obtaining this data will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
