There is a small possibility of anthrax infecting the 110 936 cows in
Bojonegoro, East Java, a local official said.

East Java, especially Bojonegoro, has not been an anthrax endemic
area for a long time now. There's only a small chance for the disease
to spread to Bojonegoro," Head of the Bojonegoro Animal Husbandry and
Fishery Office Tukiwa Yusa said here Friday [14 Nov 2008]. In the
days toward the Idul Adha (Muslim day of sacrifice), animal
monitoring has been stepped up in Bojonegoro and other areas where
livestock come in and out of East Java to Central Java the other way
around. [Sic. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax-carrying animals are marked by bleeding noses, ears, and
vaginas. "(We) should be alert and aware of such symptoms on an
animal," he said.

But anthrax had never been found in cows from Bojonegoro and other
areas in East Java. So people must not be afraid in this case. With
the Idul Adha coming up, alertness for anthrax should be stepped up
by the population and ranches in Bojonegoro, he said. Tukiwa said
that he did not know the exact number of animals coming to and
leaving East Java via the monitoring post at Padangan sub-district.
But not many cows passed Bojonegoro.

[This disease has been a steady presence in Central and West Java,
with frequent human deaths in the latter. East Java has not had any
reported livestock or human cases for many years. Something must have
triggered this official statement, possibly in relation to livestock
movements into East Java. One must be cautious, as the level of
monitoring will be in doubt when there are no data at hand on the
numbers of animals passing through the Padangan border post. In
addition, diagnosing livestock anthrax on blood extravasation is in
no way reliable. In reality, such events are truly the exception not
the rule. The one constant is unexpected sudden death in the initial
cases, i.e. before folk start checking and looking for animals with
fevers. It would be appreciated if one of our Indonesian members
would enlighten us as to what is behind this no-news release.
