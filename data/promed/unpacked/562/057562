[New World screwworms (NWS), _Cochliomyia hominivorax_, are fly larvae that infest living tissue of warm-blooded animals, causing a condition known as myiasis. Female NWS flies lay their eggs at the edges of wounds or on mucous membranes. The eggs hatch into larvae, which burrow into the tissue and continue to feed and grow. Infestations of NWS can be fatal if untreated. NWS is currently known to exist in parts of every country in South America except Chile, and in five countries in the Caribbean, but is not resident in the United States." (Source: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/nws_myiasis_disease_strategy.pdf

According to a press release published on 1 Jul 2021, by the Panama-USA Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworms (COPEG) on its website, a sample from a 7-day-old calf with a navel wound was identified as positive to myiasis caused by _Cochliomyia hominivorax_. The farm is located in the community of Palmas Bellas, Corregimiento de Torti, district of Chepo, province of Panama. This location is within the permanent biological barrier for the prevention of New World Screwworm where robust activities of epidemiological surveillance and inspection of animals are constantly carried out.

Following protocols established by COPEG to address positive cases within this barrier, a team of veterinarians, field inspectors, and health educators were dispatched to conduct epidemiological tracebacks which involved visiting the 68 farms within a 5-kilometer [3 mi] perimeter and checking all the animals. During this investigation, an additional positive case was detected in a 10-year-old bovine which had been recently dehorned.

Panama's recent (1 Jun 2021) self-declaration of freedom (excluding the Darien and the Comarca Embera-Wounnan) from myiasis by _C. hominivorax_ (New World Screwworm), will be preserved by having made the timely notification to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), demonstrating the capacity for timely detection and rapid response to achieve the containment of these cases. The full press release is available (in Spanish) at https://www.copeg.org/?p=3136.

"Humans can be affected similarly to animals. The disease can quickly become debilitating if it affects the eyes, mouth, nasal, or frontal sinuses, or the ears." (Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2015.
