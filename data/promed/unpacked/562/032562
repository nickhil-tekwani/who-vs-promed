News: Organization of a press conference in Goma on the introduction of the 2nd Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo:

- The coordination of the Ebola response to the epidemic organized this Tue 12 Nov 2019 jointly with the international non-governmental organization Doctors Without Borders of France (MSF/France), a press conference on the introduction of the 2nd Ebola vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, at the Karibu Hotel in Goma, capital of the province North Kivu;

- During this press conference, the coordinator of the response, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, announced that vaccination with this 2nd vaccine will start on Thu 14 Nov 2019 in 2 health areas of Karisimbi in Goma, including Majengo and Kahembe. The beginning of the vaccination will thus precede the official launch of the introduction of this vaccine, which will intervene in the days to come;

- This vaccine will be administered intramuscularly in 2 doses with an interval of 56 days. It targets adults and children over 12 months old. It has a strong immune response, and its dose has the advantage of increasing this response by making it more sustainable in order to protect populations against a possible Ebola outbreak, according to a member of the consortium that took care of the study of this vaccine, Dr. Hugo Kavunga, project manager INRB, member of the consortium;

- Everyone is eligible for this vaccine, including children over the age of 1, even pregnant and lactating women. In addition, for women of childbearing age, they will be offered a pregnancy test. Those who do not want it will always be vaccinated. Pregnant women will be followed, said Vaccine Project Coordinator at MSF/France, Dr. Veronique Urbaniak;

- The choice of vaccination site was made after several studies, and it is in order to protect the population against possible epidemics that Majengo and Kahembe were selected;

- The vaccine is called Ad26.Zebov/MVA-BN-Filo. It is of Belgian-American origin and is named Johnson & Johnson. It has already been used in Sierra Leone in West Africa, Uganda and soon Rwanda. This 2nd vaccine complements the 1st in-use vaccine in belt strategy and has already saved more than 3000 people so far;

- In addition to the speakers, 2 other members of the consortium took part in the press conference, including the London School Project Investigator Dr. Dan Baush and the Epicenter's Immunization Coordinator Marie Burton.

Vaccination
- Preparation of the launch of the 2nd Ebola vaccine, J & J in Kahembe and Majengo Health Areas in Karisimbi, Goma, North Kivu;

- 37 participants, including 4 high-risk contacts, 6 contacts, 7 CPs and 20 front-line staff, were vaccinated from the confirmed case of 9 Nov 2019 in the Bingo Health Area in Mabalako, North Kivu;

- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 250 622 people have been vaccinated;

- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points
- Disruption of activities at PoC VIRENDI (SC BUTEMBO) following clashes between FARDC soldiers and incivists not otherwise identified;

- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature rise) at the sanitary control points is 116 184 525;

- To date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[2] Vaccine news
- Tue 12 Nov 2019. WHO OKs Merck Ebola vaccine
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/who-oks-merck-ebola-vaccine-paving-way-stockpile
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [12 Nov 2019] that it has prequalified Merck's Ebola vaccine, a move that comes just one day after the European Commission granted full approval for VSV-EBOV, which is in use on a compassionate basis and under further study in the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

According to a statement sent to journalists, the WHO said prequalification means the vaccine meets the WHO's quality, safety, and efficacy standards, paving the way for United Nations agencies and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to buy the vaccine for use in at-risk countries.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said in the statement that prequalification marks a historical step toward ensuring that the people who most need the vaccine are able to receive it. "Five years ago, we had no vaccine and no therapeutics for Ebola. With a prequalified vaccine and experimental therapeutics, Ebola is now preventable and treatable," he said.

Today's WHO announcement made good on Tedros's comments yesterday [11 Nov 2019] in the wake of the European Commission's full licensure announcement, the world's 1st for any Ebola vaccine. On Twitter, he said the WHO's prequalification was expected within days.

In mid-October [2019], the European Medicines Agency (EMA) conditionally approved the vaccine under the Ervebo brand name for active immunization of people 18 years and older to protect against Ebola.

To speed the WHO prequalification process, the group reviewed the vaccine's safety and efficacy data as soon as they were available, and representatives from the WHO's prequalification team were on hand for the EMA's evaluation process to address program suitability for Africa's at-risk countries.

In today's [12 Nov 2019] announcement, the WHO said it is facilitating VSV-EBOV's licensing in at-risk countries and, with support from the EMA, has worked closely with many African nations to quickly approve the vaccine following the WHO's recommendation.

In a statement welcoming yesterday's [11 Nov 2019] European Commission approval, Seth Berkley, MD, Gavi's chief executive officer, said the vaccine has "huge potential" and has already been used to protect more than 250 000 people in the DRC and has the potential to make major Ebola outbreaks a thing of the past.

The European Commission approval paves the way for a Gavi-supported stockpile, he said. "It's also important to credit the unprecedented global effort from African countries that helped generate the evidence as well as Merck, WHO, donor governments, partners and regulatory agencies in making this authorisation happen."

At its next meeting in December [2019], Gavi's board is expected to decide on a long-term Ebola vaccine program that would include creating a global stockpile, which it said hinges on the WHO's prequalification decisions for vaccines and the WHO vaccine advisory group's recommendations for their use.

Alongside the stockpile, the board will also consider, if recommended, future support for preventive vaccination of groups outside of outbreak settings, such as healthcare workers in high-risk countries.

Gavi and Merck have supported the stockpile of investigational Ebola vaccine, and Gavi has offered prepaid commitments to all Ebola vaccine manufacturers with products in phase 1 clinical trials to buy doses of vaccine when they are licensed and available. Gavi has also provided USD 15.1 million to the WHO to cover vaccination operational costs in the DRC and neighboring countries.

No new cases today [12 Nov 2019]
For the 3rd day in a row, the DRC reported no new Ebola cases, keeping the total at 3287, including 118 listed as probable, according to numbers reflected on the WHO's Ebola online dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 545 suspected cases. Also, no new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 2192.

- Wed 13 Nov 2019. Johnson & Johnson vaccine
[7 sur 7, in French, trans., edited]

[Byline: Glody Murhabazi]

Approximately 22 000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are already in the city of Goma, North Kivu, to help prevent Ebola.

In front of the press of Goma chief town of the province of North Kivu this Tue 12 Nov 2019, the general coordinator of response to the Ebola virus disease, Dr. Steve Ahuka, accompanied by experts from the laboratory of the National Institute of Research Biomedicals (INRB) and the Non-Governmental Organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), announced the start of the vaccination for Thu 14 Nov 2019 in the health zone of Karisimbi, mainly the health areas of Majengo and Kahembe districts.

Compared with other vaccines, J & J has very few side effects, except for some headaches and a small fever, according to the explanations provided to 7SUR7.CD by response.

"Every vaccine has side effects, but J & J has very little; the person may have a small fever, diarrhea, migraine, but there is a follow-up program that is planned, and we assure the population that all the measures are taken," explained Dr. Hugo Kavunga, researcher at the INRB laboratory of Jean-Jacques Muyembe.

This vaccine will be given in 2 doses in 56 days for adults and children 1 year of age and older. Pregnant and [nursing?] women will also benefit.

[The J & J vaccine can be administered to children over 1 year of age, while the Erbevo vaccine is only recommended for people over the age of 18. Thus, this new vaccine will be a great addition to the tools at hand to control Ebola virus, as it will protect young children. - Mod.LK
