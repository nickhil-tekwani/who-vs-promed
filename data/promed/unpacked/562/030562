Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, legal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: Range of snakehead species imported for ornamental aquatic purposes and held at the importers wholesale premises. Imported 2 weeks prior to observations. Snakeheads species imported: _Channa aurantimaculata_, _Channa bleheri_, _Channa guchua_, _Channa sp blue_, _Channa emerald_. Clinical signs observed in _Channa aurantimaculata_. Infected animals observed by official inspection with lesions, necrotic patches and fungal-like growths. Animals sampled under suspicion of epizootic ulcerative syndrome and reference material obtained, all snakeheads on the holding systems voluntarily submitted for sampling and culling.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, stamping out, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is a disease of freshwater and brackishwater fish that has other synonyms such as mycotic granulomatosis (MG), red spot disease (RSD) and ulcerative mycosis (UM). More than 100 species of fish species with a wide geographic distribution have been reported to be affected by EUS. EUS outbreaks occur only when a number of causal factors combine.

The causative agent of this disease is the fungus, _Aphanomyces invadans_. There are a number of sufficient causes that lead to exposure of the dermis to fungal spore germination. In the early stages, red spots or small haemorrhagic lesions are found on the body surface. Intermediate stage lesions become small ulcers. Advanced stage lesions expand into large necrotic open ulcers resulting in death. See more at https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/83971

The orange-spotted snakehead (_Channa aurantimaculata_) is a species of snakehead fish. Its body is of brownish colour intermixed with vertical orange stripes. Males have taller dorsal fins with more intense coloration, and narrower heads. It is endemic to Brahmaputra River basin. Its type locality is Dibrugarh, the most northeastern area of Assam, India. Dibrughar is the same type locality as that of _Channa bleheri_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange-spotted_snakehead.
