Several cases of turtle meat food poisoning were reported in Ndrondroni in the south of Comoros since last Saturday [22 Dec 2012]. The local authorities announced 3 deaths and over 30 hospitalizations.

The turtle meat began to cause serious problems on Sat 22 Dec 2012. These cases of food poisoning are due to the consumption of turtle meat, which is very popular in Mwali.

According to a source related by the newspaper Al Watwan, the cause of the food poisoning was a male turtle that "is not edible." For many years, the Comorian authorities have declared a ban on the consumption of turtle meat and eggs. Three deaths were reported following consumption of this prohibited meat. The 1st victim was an unborn child. The mother ate some turtle meat and was hospitalized.

Al Watwan reports that "the doctors did all they could to deliver the baby and save the mother after they realized the baby could not be saved. Two boys also died after they ate turtle meat."

Over 30 people suffered acute stomach pain, and also vomiting for some of them, and were admitted to a healthcare center in the district of Nyumashiwa and to the hospital on the island of Fomboni, where they received intensive care.

[Chelonitoxism is a form of poisoning from the flesh of turtles, generally from marine turtles. There is no antidote for it, and treatment is symptomatic. Generally, 80-90 percent of consumers are affected, and death is not an uncommon side effect. The causative toxins are currently unidentified. Children appear to be more sensitive to the toxin than adults.

Turtles are reasonably high on the food chain and may consume a number of toxins or potential toxins as they feed and migrate. These toxins are likely to bioaccumulate in the turtle.

Turtles, in their long migratory lives, accumulate in their bodies elevated levels of contaminants present in the marine environment: mercury, cadmium, POPs (persistent organic pollutants), and a cocktail of different pesticides. Inorganic mercury, in contact with water organisms, becomes methyl-mercury, a highly toxic form of mercury. Small fish feed on tiny contaminated organisms; larger fish feed on small fish, accumulating mercury in their bodies, and, unable to expel these heavy metals through digestion, these remain in the organic system, poisoning it. Being high up in the marine food-chain, migratory species such as the largest fish (tuna, swordfish, marlin, sharks, king mackerel, etc.), dolphins, whales, and turtles end up carrying very high concentrations of methyl-mercury in their flesh, blood, organs and eggs.

Ongoing studies show that sea turtles and eggs carry bacteria: mycobacteria (which may cause TB), salmonella, vibrio (which may cause cholera), _E. coli_, chlamydia (causing a pneumonia-like disease), leptospira, as well as arsenic, and potentially lethal toxins from ingesting algal blooms (red tides).

Data from 2003-2004 showed that 80 percent of samples from green turtles in Baja California exhibited high antibody levels to leptospira. People with leptospirosis often show no symptoms, but left untreated, it can cause kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, or death.

Cooking may kill bacteria and fungi, but cooking does not eliminate the harmful toxins, which once ingested, remain in our bodies. It is important to underline that cooking turtle meat or eggs cannot get rid of heavy metals.

The article does not give us much specific data, such as the type of turtle consumed and the length of time between consumption and onset of signs. We do know that it caused acute vomiting, but that is also present with a number of toxins.
