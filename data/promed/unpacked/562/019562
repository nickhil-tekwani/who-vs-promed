Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Suspicion on the disease for two neighbouring holdings (Spickovina 1 and Spickovina 2) was notified at the same time on [8 Mar 2017] following an increased mortality in birds (all poultry heads on both holdings were found dead). According to the observation of authorised veterinarian on the neighbouring area there are two small ponds on which wild ducks gather. AI subtype H5N5 in poultry was confirmed on [13 Mar 2017]. Following the confirmation of AI, the measures were applied on 15 holdings on [14 Mar 2017], and approximately 248 poultry heads were killed and destroyed. A total of 3 neighbouring holdings were additionally tested and 2 (out of 3; Spickovina 3 and Spickovina 4) reacted positively to avian influenza. There were no clinical signs (including mortality) on those holdings. Virus sequencing was finished on [15 Mar 2017]; highly pathogenic avian influenza is confirmed. Conducting of measures according to the Directive 2005/94 is still ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection / disinfestations, stamping out, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
