The Missouri Department of Agriculture, working in conjunction with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and Missouri State University, has confirmed the 1st finding of an Asian longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) in in Greene County, Missouri. Missouri becomes the 16th state with a presence of the tick species, following the 1st confirmed report of the Asian longhorned tick in the United States in 2017.

Asian longhorned ticks are light brown in color and are very small, often smaller than a sesame seed. Unlike other ticks, a single female Asian longhorned tick can produce offspring (as many as 1000 at a time) without mating. That means individual animals could host thousands of ticks, which can cause great stress on a heavily infested animal.

The Department encourages producers to continue protective measures and to check their livestock regularly for ticks. Keeping grass and weeds trimmed and clearing away brush are important tick prevention practices. If you spot any unusual looking ticks or large infestations on your animals, contact your local veterinarian.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Asian longhorned tick appears to be less attracted to human skin. However, ticks of any kind should be removed immediately, as they can carry diseases that affect human health. Use EPA-approved insect repellent when you will be in or near tall grasses or wooded areas.

Research on the presence of tick species in Missouri continues through a partnership between the Missouri Department of Conservation and A.T. Still University. Residents are asked to send ticks to the University through September 2022 so that University researchers can study the distribution of ticks in Missouri and any human pathogens transmitted by those ticks. For more information, or to find out how to submit a sample, visit Missouri ticks and tick-borne pathogen surveillance (http://atsu.edu).

[With the discovery of the Asian longhorn tick in Missouri, another state is added to its geographic range in the USA. This invasive tick continues to spread rather quickly in the Eastern and Midwestern USA. The US Department of Agriculture APHIS publishes information updated monthly on the occurrence of this invasive tick over time in states and counties and the hosts upon which it was found. The latest update, as of 15 May 2020, reports the presence of the tick in 15 states (see numbers, hosts, and a map at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/tick/downloads/longhorned-tick-sitrep.pdf).

As mentioned above, the discovery of the tick in Missouri brings the total to 16 states. The above report and the 12 May 2021 USDA update mention the importance of this tick for human and animal health. The tick can reproduce parthenogenetically (without a male); as such, a single fed female tick can create a population. It is also a known/suspected vector of several viral, bacterial, and protozoan agents of livestock and human diseases in other parts of the world, although none of these pathogens has been found in the ticks tested in the USA so far. This 3-host tick could spread pathogens among a diverse host range, on which it feeds side-by-side with other tick species. Curiously, the above Missouri report does not mention the need to prevent tick infestation on livestock through tick control dips or sprays.
