A comment
--------------
Some assumptions are being made in the original reporting and in the
commentary about this case, which may lead to some misunderstandings
about how rabies is transmitted in connection with eating dogs:

In the Catanduanes Tribune report it was stated that: "The patient
died the following morning. Unknown to him, the dog did not escape to
the mountains but was instead caught and slaughtered by residents,
who cooked the meat as "pulutan" [a cooked meal] during drinking
session that same day."

The most familiar form of eating dog meat is in the form of spiced
chunks cooked in a hot-pot stew, but this is hardly the only form.
Approximately 100 different dishes may be made from a single dog,
depending on the local dog-cooking conventions, and not all of them
are cooked. Sometimes the brains, tongue, and/or testicles are eaten
raw. Sometimes uncooked "cold cuts" are eaten in sandwich wraps.

Exactly how the dog in this report was eaten is relevant. If all of
the eaten parts were cooked, presumably the rabies transmission risk
would be low, but if high-risk parts were eaten raw, or with minimal
cooking, that the rest of the dog was cooked may be irrelevant.

The report further stated that: "Upon learning of the victim's death,
12 people presented themselves at the EBMC Animal Bite Center for
anti-rabies injections." The moderator commented that presumably
because they may have had contact with saliva of the rabid dog or
been injured. Rabies cannot be contracted by consumption of cooked
meat from a rabid animal.

In fact rabies was linked to 2 human fatalities in the Philippines in
2005/2006. In both cases most of the meat was cooked, but it was
never clear whether the victims were infected by cooked meat or by raw tidbits.

This is what is known: "A 4-year-old child of Barangay Molobolo,
Cauayan, Negros Occidental died last December [2009] of rabies and
encephalitis, days after neighbors gave her dog meat" at a drinking
party, according to Margaux C Ortiz of The Philippine Inquirer in
Makati City on 1 Feb 2006. The girl's father said his daughter
suffered from high fever and exhibited symptoms of rabies shortly
after eating the meat." Hospitalized on 13 Dec 2005, the child died a
few hours later. Animal Kingdom Foundation veterinarian Winston
Samaniego told Ortiz that the rabies virus may have attacked her as
rapidly as it did by entering her nervous system though a tooth
cavity. "I am now appealing to everyone to stop eating dogs to avoid
this kind of tragedy," said the child's father.

In June 2006, the Philippines Sun Star reported that: "One man died
and 23 others are under observation after eating rabid dogs in
Maasin, Iloilo. The deceased died after he cooked and ate a rabid
dog. He also fed the meal to his relatives. Not contented, they
cooked and ate 2 more rabid dogs." Greg Salido Quimpo of Animal
Kingdom Foundation reported that: "The victim's mother is a village
councilor. She passed a resolution banning the eating of dogs."

[It may be that transmission of rabies can occur as a consequence of
butchering of rabid animals and the unwise consumption of raw dog
meat. However in the current outbreak in the province of Catanduanes,
where children during the school vacation period are the predominate
victims, transmission is likely to be through direct contact with
live rabid animals. - Mod.CP]
