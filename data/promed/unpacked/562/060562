Multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to imported Maradol papayas
---------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 11 Aug 2017, 34 more ill people were added to this investigation from 11 states.

As of [16 Aug 2017], 173 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Kiambu (51), _S._ Thompson (111), _S._ Agona (7), or _S._ Gaminara (4) have been reported from 21 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is shown:

States / Case count
Connecticut / 6
Delaware / 4
Iowa / 2
Illinois / 3
Kentucky / 4
Louisiana / 1
Maryland / 8
Massachusetts / 8
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 4
Missouri / 1
North Carolina / 5
New Jersey / 36
New York / 50
Ohio / 1
Oklahoma / 4
Pennsylvania / 8
Tennessee / 1
Texas / 9
Virginia / 16
Wisconsin / 1
Total / 173

New Jersey and New York together account for 50 per cent of the cases and the epicurve can be seen at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-07-17/epi.html.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [17 May 2017] to [31 Jul 2017]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 95, with a median age of 38. Some information is not available for all of the ill people. Among 169 ill people, 101 (60 per cent) are female. Among 135 people, 91 (67 per cent) are of Hispanic ethnicity. Among 136 people, 58 (43 per cent) have been hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.

Illnesses that occurred after [18 Jul 2017], might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation update
--------------------
As was reported in the update on [4 Aug 2017], FDA tested other papayas imported from Mexico and isolated several types of salmonella bacteria, including _S._ Agona, _S._ Kiambu, _S._ Gaminara, _S._ Thompson, and _S._ Senftenberg. Investigators compared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing results of salmonella isolates from the papayas to isolates from ill people in the CDC PulseNet database. CDC has now identified 11 people infected with the same strains of either _S._ Agona (7) or _S._Gaminara (4). These 11 illnesses have been added to the case count for this outbreak. Among 5 for whom information was available, all 5 (100 per cent) reported eating or possibly eating papayas in the week before becoming ill.

This investigation is ongoing. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[The epicurve clearly shows the change in serotype cases over time; the 1st 5 weeks of the cluster of salmonellosis were almost all serotype Kiambu with sporadic cases after that, the next 3 weeks were almost all related to serotype Thompson, and since 18 Jul 2017, a majority of the cases have been serotype Agona. The cases of serotype Gaminara and most of the cases of serotype Agona have likely occurred after the curve's dates. It is not surprising that cases of Agona and Gaminara are now being reported as they had already been isolated from papayas that were recalled. - Mod.LL
