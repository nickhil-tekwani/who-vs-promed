During April - May 1998, 11 states reported an increase in Salmonella
serotype Agona cases to CDC. As of June 4, 1998, 188 cases have been
reported and 40 persons were hospitalized. Cases have been reported from
Illinois (46), Indiana (29), Michigan (15), Ohio (21), Missouri (18), New
York (22), Pennsylvania (20), Iowa (7), Kansas (3), West Virginia (2), and
Wisconsin (5). No deaths have been reported.
With coordination from CDC, a case-control study was conducted by state
health departments from involved states to identify common source
exposures. Consumption of Millville brand Toasted Oats cereal, distributed
by Aldi's supermarkets in the aforementioned states, is associated with
these cases of S. Agona infections in April- May 1998.

[Thanks Brent for forwarding this material from a CDC press release. I
have cut some part of the press release we covered in our first posting.
However, I thought the geographic distribution might be of interest to some
of our readers and it's always good to know a case control study has been
completed. - Mod.PC

Cereal linked to salmonella poisoning
A toasted oat cereal sold at Aldi supermarkets was identified by health
officials Thursday as the likely source of an unusual type of salmonella
that has stricken at least 188 people in 11 states since early April. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged people not to eat
Millville brand toasted oat cereals until federal and state investigations
into the outbreak are completed. Millville brand cereals are sold at Aldi
supermarkets. A spokesman for Aldi did not immediately return a call. Aldi
Inc., with headquarters in Batavia, Ill., has 505 stores around the country.
Forty people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, said
Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman. The CDC reported 188 cases of salmonella
poisoning in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin and West Virginia. But that number was
sure to go up as states reported newly confirmed cases. All the people were
sickened by a strain of salmonella bacteria called agona, which accounts
for only about 500 to 1,000 of the estimated 2 million to 4 million
salmonella cases in the United States each year, the CDC said.
Like other strains, it leads to flu-like symptoms such as headache,
diarrhea, vomiting and fever that can last one to 12 days. Salmonella is
rarely fatal. It is most often spread through raw or undercooked meat,
eggs, fish and poultry, but in recent years fresh fruits and vegetables
have been implicated in outbreaks.
The latest outbreak hit Illinois the hardest, with 46 cases since April 1,
including a dozen who required hospitalization and three news cases
confirmed Thursday. Authorities would typically see four cases of any
single salmonella strain in the same time period, said Tony Sanders, state
health department spokesman. Nearly half of the state's cases were in Cook
County, which includes Chicago.
