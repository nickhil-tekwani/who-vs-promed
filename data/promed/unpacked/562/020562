An investigation into the blood-thinning drug heparin continues,
according to the company that manufactures it. Erin Gardiner, a
spokeswoman for the Illinois-based Baxter Healthcare Corp., said an
analysis of 9 lots of heparin that caused allergic-type reactions in
patients is still ongoing. The company issued a recall last week
[14-18 Jan 2008].
A total of 3 cardiac patients at HealthPark Medical Center went into
shock last week after being given the drug, which is used in
open-heart and vascular surgeries and dialysis. A 4th died from blood
clots in the brain, prompting Lee Memorial officials to question
whether the blood-thinning drug was ineffective.
Lee Memorial officials said they pulled the recalled supplies out of
circulation as soon as the recall was announced.

Some heparin in use in North America is extracted from the intestinal
mucosa of pigs, harvested during slaughter by pork-production
establishments with personnel trained for that purpose. The mucosa
sludge is dried and shipped in granular form to the heparin
manufacturing facility in the USA. According to Wikipedia, heparin is
also extracted from bovine lung mucosa.
One can see, therefore, that a very minor error in the extraction
process might contaminate the final product with extremely small
amounts of allergenic proteins or peptides. The source material is
not necessarily the problem: even if heparin were to be produced by
genetically-engineered bacteria, the same risk of contamination would exist.
