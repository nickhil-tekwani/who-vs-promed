A redfin virus is believed to be responsible for a fish kill in Lake Ginninderra last week [4-10 Feb 2013].

Staff from Territory and Municipal Services (TAMS) and the Environment Sustainable and Development Directorate were called out to clean up many hundreds of dead fish on Thursday last week [7 Feb 2013].

A TAMS spokesman said the majority of dead fish were redfin, an introduced species, and a virus is the suspected cause.

"Tissue samples of the dead fish have been sent for laboratory testing in Sydney with results expected early next week," the spokesman said. "Epizootic haematopoietic necrosis (EHN), or redfin virus, which has previously been reported in Lake Ginninderra and Lake Burley Griffin, is believed responsible. EHN poses no risk to human health."

He said there was no correlation between the fish kill and the recent release of more than 30 000 golden perch fingerlings into the lake.

[EHNV is a member of the genus _Ranavirus_ in the family Iridoviridae. Since the recognition of disease due to EHNV in Australia in 1986, similar systemic necrotising iridovirus syndromes have been reported in farmed fish. Natural EHNV infections are known from only 2 teleost species, redfin perch (_Perca fluviatilis_, picture at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/PercheCommune.jpg) and rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_); however, a number of other species are susceptible to EHNV experimentally, including several perch species.

The redfin, or European perch, is a native of Europe and was 1st released into Australian streams in 1888 but did not become established in the Canberra region until recently. There, EHNV is known to cause mass mortalities in juvenile redfin during the summer months. The disease raises concern for a number of native fish species that are highly susceptible to the disease (Macquarie Perch, Silver Perch, Murray Cod, and Mountain Galaxias).
