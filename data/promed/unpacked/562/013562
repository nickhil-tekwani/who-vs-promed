[This small ruminant disease of many names (kata from the West African
pidgin language, PPR from French, stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex and
pseudorinderpest) speak to its importance in West Africa and beyond,
including the Middle East and Asia. Thoughtful comments from Adama Diallo
and Nick Honhold on the world distribution are referenced below. Even
ProMED-mail's own Mod.AS sent in a posting in his former official capacity.
PPR has an important economic impact and can result in high mortality,
especially when small ruminants from different geographical areas are mixed
together, thereby promoting the spread to animals without adequate
immunity. Stress also plays a role. I remember a lesson learned when I was
a veterinary student helping to assemble foundation animal husbandry stock
for the IITA in Ibadan. We made the mistake of buying the foundation
animals in the Ibadan's central market. Over the next month, we lost over
90 percent of the animals meant to be our foundation stock, which
progressively showed typical signs of PPR -- mucopurulent nasal discharge,
necrotic oral lesions, and gastroenteritis. - Mod.PC]
