Re: Chronic wasting disease, cervids - USA (New Mexico)
--------------------------------------------------
Around the time the positive deer was tested (within 3-5 months of the
positive deer), 2 other deer from the missile range were tested for CWD,
and neither was positive. Although it is true that testing for CWD in NM
has not been a priority, it has been on the rule-out list for vets in NM
for some cases. I myself have seen a few deer on the missile range with
symptoms similar to the ones described for CWD, only to come up negative.
It will be interesting to see how this develops.
