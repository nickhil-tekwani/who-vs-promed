SAC warns blue tongue disease is on move
-----------------------------------------
Global warming and the growth of international travel pose increasing
threats to animal health. The expansion of the European Union is another
factor which could allow the spread of diseases, including blue tongue.
This disease, which primarily affects sheep but can occur in all ruminants,
has been spreading throughout much of southern Europe and North Africa and
there are fears it may spread further north, according to Brian Hosie, of
the Scottish Agricultural College.
Hosie, who is also president of the British Sheep Veterinary Association,
said: "Blue tongue is a viral disease spread by a midge. It has in the past
normally been associated with the tropics but in recent years has been
quite common in the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Hungary [According to
the OIE data, Bluetongue has never been recorded in Romania nor Hungary. -
Mod. AS]. "What is more worrying is Italian scientists have discovered the
disease is now being spread by another species of midge common in that part
of Europe."
Typical symptoms include nasal congestion, breathing problems, lameness and
a reluctance to move. There can also be reproductive problems. Fatality
rates are normally in excess of 30 percent and animals which recover tend
to remain unhealthy.
The disease has also been found in northern Australia. However, in the
European context the major concern has been an outbreak in southern Spain
which has now spread to Morocco [It seems that the direction of spread
might have been the opposite one. - Mod.AS]. More than 1000 cases have been
reported, with 13 000 animals at risk within 142 separate outbreaks. The EU
has imposed import and movement restrictions on infected areas.
Tropical breeds of sheep tend to have a higher resistance. However, there
are fears that if the disease spreads into northern Europe the casualty
rate could be high.
Hosie explained: "There is no doubt the threat of blue tongue is real. Our
generally warmer climate means there is a possibility we could see some
exotic diseases not normally associated with northern latitudes. Midges
could easily be blown north or carried by thermals."
There is a vaccine, but in the event of a UK outbreak it is probable the
government would adopt a slaughter policy, with quarantine and movement
restrictions [see comment].
The BSVA, in conjunction with the department of the environment, food and
rural affairs, held a course 18 months ago to alert the profession to the
dangers. Some research has been conducted at the government's animal
disease centre at Pirbright in Surrey. Should farmers observe suspicious
symptoms they should contact their veterinary surgeon.
The message from the veterinary profession is that every effort must be
made to keep blue tongue out of the country.

[Killing affected or exposed sheep for the control of bluetongue is
unlikely to be an effective, or scientifically justifiable policy. The
disease spreads with infected, wind-bourne midges (notably _Culicoides
imicola_, and according to some recent investigations, potentially also
other species such as _C. obsoletus_ and _C. pulicaris_), while bovines
serve as the reservoir or rather amplifier of the virus. Viraemic cattle
generally do not show clinical symptoms, while the duration of their
viraemia is generally longer than in sheep. The value of quarantine and
movement restrictions in sheep is also questionable.
