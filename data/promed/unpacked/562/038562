Vaccine virus for novel H3N2 based on 2010 swine flu strain
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got a head start
on preparing a vaccine against the novel swine-origin influenza strain
recently found in 4 states by using a slightly different swine-origin
strain that cropped up last year, CDC officials said today. Since
early September, the CDC has reported 10 infections with a
swine-origin H3N2 reassortant strain that includes the M gene from the
2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. On 22 Nov 2011 the CDC reported
that it had prepared a vaccine virus and was providing it to vaccine
manufacturers as a precaution in case the novel virus spreads.

A flu update from the World Health Organization (WHO) today [2 Dec
2011] revealed that the vaccine virus is based on an isolate that was
collected in Minnesota in 2010. A CDC official told CIDRAP News that
the isolate is from a pair of swine-origin H3N2 infections that
occurred in Minnesota in November 2010. Those cases were among 5
swine-origin H3N2 cases reported in 3 states during the 2010-11 flu
season. The 2010 strain is not an exact match for the recent novel
H3N2 isolates, but it is close enough to be the basis for a vaccine,
said Michael Shaw PhD, associate director for laboratory science in
the CDC's Influenza Division. "Since we were seeing these cases
popping up sporadically, over the summer the decision was made to go
ahead and try to make a high-yield reassortant [for a vaccine], and it
turned out to be a good decision, to have it in reserve," Shaw said.
He said it takes several weeks to prepare a flu vaccine virus. In the
case of the 2009 pandemic, the task took about 6 weeks, from April 15
to the end of May, which was considered fast, he noted. The reason the
Minnesota isolate was chosen was that it was the only one available at
the time that grew in eggs, Shaw explained. "Vaccine strains need to
be egg-derived, because inactivated vaccines are grown in eggs," he
said. "This one from November 2010 is not like the new reassortant in
that it doesn't have that M gene from the H1N1 strain. But the HA
[hemagglutinin] is close enough to be a good vaccine match."

Hemagglutinin is the viral surface protein that is recognized and
targeted by the human immune system. The protein often mutates, making
it necessary to formulate new vaccines. Shaw said the hemagglutinin of
the 2010 isolate is very closely related to the version found on the
recent swine-origin viruses. "We've characterized it genetically and
antigenically, so it would be an acceptable vaccine strain, which is
why we decided to distribute it to the manufacturers, so they can get
some experience with it and grow it, in case they have to scale up."

To make a vaccine virus, the CDC first takes clinical isolates and
puts them in eggs to see if they will grow, Shaw explained. Once an
isolate that grows in eggs is identified, it is recombined with a
laboratory strain that grows well in eggs. That task is handled by a
separate lab at New York Medical College. The desired product is a
"high-yield reassortant": a virus with internal genes from the lab
strain and surface genes from the clinical isolate. After a high-yield
reassortant is obtained, it must be characterized to make sure it
hasn't changed too much in the course of the lab manipulations, Shaw
said. "There's a great deal of consultation with the FDA [Food and
Drug Administration] and the WHO to reach the conclusion that it is
the best one for its purposes," he added. "So about 6 weeks for the
pandemic one, that's a very good timeline."

Since the creation of the vaccine virus from the 2010 isolate, the CDC
has succeeded in growing one of the more recent novel H3N2 viruses,
from an Indiana case, in eggs, but "we don't have a high-yield
reassortant available for it," Shaw said. "For now the Minnesota one
is the only one that's egg-derived and for which we have a high-yield
reassortant."

Shaw said no more infections with the novel H3N2 strain have been
reported since the 3 that were cited in Iowa children on Nov 22. Those
cases were believed to involve person-to-person transmission, since
the children attended the same daycare center and none of them had any
exposure to pigs. 9 of the 10 recent cases have been in children; all
the patients recovered. Besides the Iowa illnesses, the cases include
2 in Indiana, 3 in Pennsylvania, and 2 in Maine.

[It is considered by the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)that there has already been some very limited
human-to-human transmission of the swine origin H3N2 reassortant and
similar viruses in the USA. Most of these cases experienced only mild
disease. Those hospitalised had underlying conditions, and all
patients recovered completely.

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC), although such viruses are known to be present in pigs in North
America, none have been found in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA countries).
However, surveillance for influenza in pigs is weak in both North
America and Europe. (See ProMED-mail archived report below on risk
assessment).

Nonetheless the preemptive development of a candidate vaccine virus by
the US CDC is a prudent and commendable initiative. - Mod.CP]
