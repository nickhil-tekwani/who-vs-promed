Anthrax found in 4 New Jersey post offices
-----------------------------------------------------
TRENTON, N.J. -- Anthrax has been discovered at 4 more New Jersey post
offices in a potential break in the search for the source of contaminated
letters sent to New York and Washington, D.C., The Associated Press learned
Friday. Tests found minute traces of anthrax in each of the small satellite
offices, a state official said on condition of anonymity. Details were
expected to be released at a news conference later Friday.
The post offices are in Rocky Hill, Princeton Borough, Trenton and Jackson
Township, the source said. Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco ordered the
testing at the smaller post offices after an accountant who works near the
Hamilton plant contracted skin anthrax. She was the first person in New
Jersey to contract the disease who was not a postal worker. 15 samples were
taken at each of the 4 post offices; one sample from each came back positive.

FBI releases profile of anthrax mailer
---------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON -- The anthrax mailings probably are the work of a man who is
familiar with hazardous material, works where he has little contact with
other people and may have held a grudge against letters' addressees, the
FBI said Friday. In a fresh appeal to the public for help in solving the
anthrax mailings, FBI officials released a profile of the suspected mailer
developed by the agency's behavioral experts. The profile does not address
the question of whether the person is foreign or from the United States.
FBI officials said the person may work in a laboratory and "is apparently
comfortable working with extremely hazardous material. He probably has a
scientific background to some extent, or at least a strong interest in
science." The person "did not select his victims randomly," making the
effort to find a correct address and zip code of each victim and ensuring
that the proper postage was used.
NBC, the New York Post and Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., were selected, the FBI
said, because "these targets are probably very important to the offender.
They may have been the focus of previous expressions of contempt which may
have been communicated to others or observed by others." The person who
mailed the letters "lacks the personal skills necessary to confront
others," the FBI said, suggesting that the man may have held a grudge
against the targets for a long time.
After the 11 Sep hijacker attacks, FBI officials said the person may have
become more secretive and changed his usual pattern of activity. "He may
have displayed a passive disinterest in the events which otherwise
captivated the nation," the FBI said. "He also may have started taking
antibiotics unexpectedly." During the course of the anthrax mailings and
intense media coverage, the man may have altered his physical appearance,
displayed pronounced anxiety or noticeable mood swings, and may have
appeared more withdrawn or unusually preoccupied, the profile said.
