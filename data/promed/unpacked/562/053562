Saskatchewan man develops anthrax in quarantine area
-----------------------------------------------
A man in Melfort, Saskatchewan has developed skin anthrax in the midst of
the largest outbreak of the disease among livestock in the province's
history. The man is being treated with antibiotics and is expected to
recover fully, according to a news release issued Friday [14 Jul 2006] by
the provincial government. Cutaneous or skin anthrax is the most common and
least serious form of the disease.
Federal officials who are investigating the suspicious deaths of 149
livestock -- mostly cattle -- in Saskatchewan have quarantined 36 farms as
of Friday [14 Jul 2006] because of the anthrax outbreak. Most of the farms
under quarantine are in the Melfort area, northeast of Saskatoon, and
around Wynyard, north of Regina.
According to the news release, cutaneous anthrax can be contracted when a
person has a break in their skin -- through a cut or abrasion -- that comes
into direct contact with anthrax spores on a sick or dead animal. A
resulting itchy bump appears one to 12 days later. Within 36 hours, the
bump turns into a blister and then a skin ulcer with a black center. In
most cases, the lesion disappears in about 6 weeks. But in some cases,
symptoms can include headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting.
Cutaneous anthrax is not a significant public health problem because the
disease is usually not transmitted from person to person, Ross Findlater,
chief medical officer for the province, said in the news release. "In the
case of cutaneous anthrax, there is small theoretical risk of infection
from direct contact with the lesions on another person's body before
antibiotics are started," Findlater said. However, he said, it is not of
major public health concern because cutaneous anthrax responds to
antibiotics very well.

[An earlier CBC report was issued:
<http://www.cbc.ca/cp/health/060714/x071404.html>
and had this fellow being treated as an outpatient. According to Dr. Sandra
Stephens, this individual did a "postmortem" for a neighbor; the animal, it
was later determined, had died from anthrax. There is some justice in this
world, as one should never, but never do a necropsy on a suspect anthrax
case. Firstly, it results in a high possibility of significant
environmental contamination, and certainly sporulation will follow.
Secondly, get a blood swab into the nearest laboratory PDQ for them to
culture it. Thirdly, if you have the facilities, make and fix a blood
smear, stain it with polychrome methylene blue (Loeffler's or M'Fadyean's)
stain, and look for capsulated box car gram positive organisms.
Anthrax cutaneous lesions do respond well to antibiotic treatment, but it
must be prompt, otherwise it can carry a 10 percent lethality risk. The
lesion is pathognomic in that it will be as described above, itchy, but not
locally painful in spite of the edema and the inflamed lymph nodes in one's
axilla. The skin lesion is slow to heal and impatient surgeons are tempted
to excise the area. Don't. I know of a butt-less Aussi from this. Just give
it time, and the edema goes down, and it all heals really very nicely. If
you ever see someone with a US quarter-sized mild scar on their forearm,
you will know what caused it.
[From Sandra Stephenson:] As of 14 Jul 2006, 36 premises are involved with
32 quarantined premises (26 confirmed, 6 awaiting test results); 2 premises
had negative samples, and anthrax could not be ruled out on another 2
premises because of questions concerning the samples submitted. The total
mortality to date is 149 animals: Cattle (123), horses (3), Swine (1),
sheep (1), bison (13) in the counties of Kinistino, Willow Creek, Spalding,
and St. Peter. Some 69 percent of carcasses have been burnt, 28 percent
buried, and 3 percent are inaccessible (i.e. out in the swamp in the water,
while the authorities decide what to do with them). - Mod.MHJ]
