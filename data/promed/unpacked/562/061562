HPAI H5N1 in wild birds in Russia (final draft)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Disease report
-----------------
Russia has reported an outbreak of H5N1 HPAI in 58 wild birds found dead in
Respublika Tyva Region (OIE, 2009) [a map is included at the above URL].

2. Situation assessment
------------------------
In February [2009], Hong Kong reported 11 incidents of H5N1 HPAI involving
both wild birds (2 corvids, a heron, and a falcon) and poultry which were
found dead, either washed up along the coast line or inland (OIE, 2009a).
In May [2009], an outbreak of H5N1 HPAI was reported in wild birds at Lake
Qinghai in China (OIE, 2009a). The report suggests that 107 great crested
grebes, 3 bar headed geese, and 11 brown headed gulls were found dead.
Mongolia reported an outbreak of H5 HPAI in migratory whooper swans from
Arkhangai region in May 2009 (OIE, 2009a).

These reports seem to follow a similar pattern that occurred in South East
Asia and southern Siberia in Russia in 2005 (DEFRA, 2005). With a benefit
of hindsight we know that these reports in 2005 signalled the start of a
wider dissemination of HPAI H5N1 to many countries across Europe and Asia.
To what extent the current reports will result in further detections
remains to be seen. It also remains uncertain whether these reports suggest
the re-emergence of the strain similar to that isolated in 2005 or an
involvement of a new strain.

The current level of reported cases, although not as high as those in
2005/2006 are the highest since that period. Previous reports suggest that
more than 6000 wild birds were affected in lake Qinghai in 2005. In 2006
this number was around 900. Numbers in Mongolia were fewer in 2005 and
2006. In 2006 more than 4000 H5N1 HPAI infected grebes were reported from
the area of Uvs Noor lake, Russia. Russia also reported more than 120
outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI in domestic poultry in 6 districts. Dead wild birds
were also reported from the same districts [a map is available at the above
URL].

Following this period, H5N1 HPAI infections were widely reported in Europe,
Asia and Africa during 2006 (OIE, 2006).

Studies on samples collected during the developments in 2005 and 2006
suggested that migratory whooper swans in Mongolia may act as sentinel
species which become infected as a result of contact with other wild birds
(Newman and others, 2009). Further work on a migratory pathway between
Mongolia, Lake Qinghai and Myanmar supports the phylogenetic relationship
between the isolates that were obtained from wild birds from these areas at
that time (Prosser and others, 2009).

There has been an increase in the overall numbers of H5N1 HPAI reported
from domestic poultry during 2009 in South East Asia and Egypt. The
corresponding increase in the number of incidents in wild birds suggests
that surveillance of wild birds in these areas is working.

Many epidemic diseases cycle from one year to the next, often related to
population changes and longevity of immune responses. DEFRA supports a wild
bird surveillance programme in line with European Commission recommendations.

3. Conclusions
--------------
We continue to consider there is an ongoing low risk of a highly pathogenic
avian influenza (of H5 or H7) occurring in the UK domestic poultry and that
this risk has not significantly changed because of the most recent reports.
This emphasises the importance of any poultry keepers to maintain vigilance
for any signs of clinical disease in their birds, promptly report suspected
cases and uphold appropriate levels of biosecurity at any time of the year.

We continue to monitor any further developments and will report on these
outbreaks as necessary.
