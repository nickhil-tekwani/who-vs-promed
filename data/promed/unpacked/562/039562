Outbreak of Trichinellosis in Krasnodar Region, Russia
---------------------------------------------------
KRASNODAR: Police detained on Monday 2 suspect suppliers of infected meat
that caused an outbreak of trichinellosis in a village in Russia's southern
Krasnodar region. Regional deputy administration head Yury Shvartsberg
told Itar-Tass on Monday that the 2 persons had been charged with violation
of sanitary-epidemiological rules. Both work in the sausage department of
Kievskaya animal farm. A total of 448 people have been affected by
trichinellosis in the village of Kievskaya after they took part in a local
festivity devoted to harvest on 15 Dec, at which pork barbecue was lavishly
served. Of these, 194 have been hospitalised, including 20 children.

[_Trichinella_ spp. is found worldwide in many carnivores and is prevalent
in Russia and other former members of the Soviet Union, including the
Baltic countries. Infection can be acquired from several sources like
eating undercooked wild boar; an outbreak in France in 1998 was due to
imported horse meat from Serbia. In the outbreak reported here, the source
seems to have been domestic pigs used in sausage. Pigs are most probably
infected from small rodents. Sausages are a particularly important source
of infection, because the meat may be used raw, or may not be thoroughly
boiled and/or used smoked, which rarely inactivates _Trichinella_. The
basic problem, however, is the lack of veterinary controls. - Mod.EP
