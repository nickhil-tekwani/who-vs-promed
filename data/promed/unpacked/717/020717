The residents of Kodandaramapuram SC Colony have been asked not to enter the village following anthrax scare. As many as 25 persons were subjected to medical tests after hospitalisation of 4 residents with suspected anthrax a couple of days ago. When some media persons went to the colony, the residents told them not to bother them. They said they were already facing a 'boycott' from the panchayat after the death of A. on [Mon 29 Oct 2018] of suspected anthrax.

A. was one of the 4 persons who were admitted to Ruia Hospital in Tirupati after they had symptoms of anthrax. The district authorities, however, denied the reports that anthrax surfaced in the village.

"Because of media reports, the villagers have decided not to allow the residents of SC Colony, mainly those who ate dead cow meat, to enter the village." They said by publishing the news about Ananadaiah's death, the media was putting the colony in focus and the people in surrounding villages might also take a similar decision. The colony people grabbed the cameras and deleted all the content and warned the reporters against covering the report about anthrax scare.

A., who was undergoing treatment at Ruia Hospital for suspected anthrax, died on [Mon 29 Oct 2018]. He was first admitted to Puttur area hospital where doctors referred him to Ruia Hospital. The deceased was one of the several residents of Kodnadaramapuram SC Colony who consumed dead cow meat a few days ago.

Two of the residents were rushed to Puttur hospital after they suffered from diarrhoea. After their medical check-up, doctors alerted health officials after which they immediately swung into action and took blood samples of 25 persons who ate the meat of a dead cow. The same day 4 more people were treated for abscesses on their hands, chest, legs and other parts of the body. Doctors at Ruia Hospital and Puthur medical officers kept prevalence of anthrax a secret.

[Meningeal anthrax is not an uncommon lesion in anthrax, just not frequently noted. Once the infection becomes systemic this lesion has a probability of occurring. Early on patient A. had been noted with brain symptoms, which were initially put down to malaria.

Members should note how important it is to make clear to their people that anthrax is not contagious. This outbreak has got away from public health crowd control and gossip is ruling the streets. People have to realise that humans are in fact hard to infect with this disease. We are moderately resistant. Unfortunately, once infected we can die. Cattle, on the other hand, are easy to infect but hard to kill and people see dead livestock lying around and expect the worst. And can behave accordingly.
