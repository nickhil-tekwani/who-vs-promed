New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: South District, [Tainan Shi]
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Dec 2010
Outbreak status: resolved (24 Dec 2010)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: swine
Susceptible: 161
Cases: 10
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: during the routine active FMD serological
surveillance, NSP [non-structural protein] antibody was detected on a
pig farm. The investigation showed that all pigs on the farm are
clinically healthy. Samples for serological tests and virus isolation
were collected and sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health
Research Institute). The laboratory confirmed 10 positive results for
NSP and all negative for virus isolation and RT-PCR. A total of 2 pig
farms and 8 goat farms within 3-km [2 mi] radius of the index farm
have been under vigilant monitoring and no clinical or
epidemiological evidence of infection has been found.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s); no treatment of affected animals.
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division: Tainan Shi
Species: swine
Total vaccinated: 146
Details: inactivated vaccine, type O
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (national
laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: antibody detection ELISA
Test date: 24 Dec 2010
Result: positive
Species: swine
Test: reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Test date: 24 Dec 2010

[This is the 4th event this year of FMD virus serotype O. The 1st 2
were actual clinical outbreaks which were eradicated by a quick,
effective stamping out policy. These last 2 only involved serological
evidence of disease and were negative for virus isolation and reverse
transcriptase PCR testing. This outbreak, like the previous one, will
be handled by ring vaccination around the outbreak.

In 1997 Taiwan basically lost a thriving swine industry because of
the introduction of FMD and subsequent trade bans from other
countries like Japan as the disease spread across Taiwan. So it is
not at all surprising that the animal health authorities in Taiwan do
routine FMD surveillance and then quickly stamp out any animals found
to be clinically ill or testing positive to definitive laboratory
tests and using vaccination where appropriate -- as in this case. - Mod.PC]
