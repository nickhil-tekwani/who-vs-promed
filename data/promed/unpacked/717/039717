[This report was issued on 9 May 2014 with a cut-off date of 7 May 2014 and represents one more case and one more death. The rest of the report is essentially the same as in the 8 May 2014 WHO report with a cut-off of 5 May 2014.

The source URL appears to be the 8 May 2014 update. I cannot find this 9 May 2014 update on the WHO Disease Outbreak News website. - Mod.JW
