Kazakh veterinarians will inspect border areas of Kyrgyzstan, Serik
Suleimenov, chairman of the State Inspection Committee in the
agro-industrial complex of Kazakhstan said Wednesday [26 Aug 2009],
Centrasia.ru reported.

According to the on-line edition, import of meat from Kyrgyzstan was
restricted after sheep-pox virus was found in pathogenic material
delivered from Kyrgyzstan this spring [see comment]. But Bishkek
[capital of Kyrgyzstan] makes efforts to lift the ban.

"As of today, there is an agreement that we [Kazakhstan] will inspect
4 regions[of Kyrgystan]: Naryn, Chui, Issyk-Kul and Talas, where we
take blood samples from animals for foot-and-mouth disease, pox and
heterogeneous proteins tests," Suleimenov said.[Naryn borders China,
Talas & Chui border Kazakhstan, and Issyk-Kul borders both Kazakhstan
& China -- see map at:
<http://www.envsec.org/centasia/maps/kyrgyzstan_pol96.jpg> . - Mod.JW]

The border will be opened for import only if concerns proved to be
invalid. "There is information that Kyrgyz suppliers deal with
re-exportation of Chinese meat that represents an epizootic danger for
us," the chairman said. However, the data will not be checked in the
course of the coming inspection.

[The above is rather confusing information. What does "pathogenic
material" (allegedly imported and including sheep pox virus) mean?
Which live animals? Which of their products (e.g. wool)? How was the
virus "found"? If it was revealed in the spring, why are the steps
being taken only now? And what are "heterogeneous proteins tests"? The
apparent trade dispute between the 2 countries adds to the ambiguity.

We have decided to post this newswire in order to try to obtain
updated information on the sheep pox situation in the region. While
Kazakhstan reported to the OIE about the absence of the disease
throughout 2008, no information from Kyrgyzstan is available for the
2nd half of that year. - Mod.AS]

[China reported to the OIE 138 cases with 17 deaths due to sheep &
goat pox in December 2008 in Xinjiang province, which borders on
Kyrgystan -- see map at :
