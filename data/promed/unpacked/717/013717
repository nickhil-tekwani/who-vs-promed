A 2nd possible human case of a dangerous viral infection has surfaced
in Kalamazoo County [Michigan]. Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]
[virus] has already sickened and killed dozens of horses in Barry,
Calhoun, Cass, and St Joseph Counties. Mosquitoes carry the virus and
can infect both horses and humans, but human cases are rare. The
Centers for Disease Control says there is a 33 percent mortality rate
for those infected with EEE [virus], and many of those who survive
suffer significant brain damage.

The virus is passed on through infected mosquitoes and officials say
the reason they've seen so many cases in 2010 is because of the hot,
humid weather, which is encouraging the growth of mosquitoes.

The good news is that most people don't get an infection from the
virus, and some [who become infected] don't show signs or symptoms of
serious illness. "It's only about 5 percent of people infected with
this virus that will get encephalitis, which is infection of the
brain and spinal cord," said Dr Richard Tooker, chief medical officer
in Kalamazoo County. "That's obviously serious, and the symptoms
would be pretty profound. People will have headaches, stiff neck,
perhaps nausea, and vomiting. They may act confused, delirious and
that may progress even to coma." Dr Tooker says since 1964 there have
only been 13 cases of EEE [virus infection] in humans in Michigan, so
he says it's not a common illness.

Dr Tooker did however advise that people take precautions to avoid
mosquitoes by replacing broken screens, wearing insect repellant and
long-sleeved clothing, and dumping out standing water. He says it
takes no more than a teaspoon of water for mosquito larvae to grow.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ellen Black for sending in this report. This is
the 2nd suspected case of human EEE virus infection in southwest
Michigan in August (2010). The disease has been reported to have
killed at least 67 horses in this area in Michigan, and has been
declared the worst outbreak of EEE virus infection in Michigan in 30
years. It is likely that transmission will continue until killing
frosts come, usually in early October in this part of the Upper
Midwestern USA. Equine animals in Michigan that have not been
vaccinated against EEE virus should be immunized immediately.
Unfortunately, there is no commercially available EEE virus vaccine
for human use, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive
measure that people can take.

As Mod.TG noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20100814.2790, the
Michigan Emerging Disease web page at
<http://www.michigan.gov/emergingdiseases> provides a map of the
affected counties and shows that as well as some confirmed cases,
many more are presumed to have died of EEE without laboratory confirmation.
