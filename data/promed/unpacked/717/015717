Heavy rains have destroyed at least 30 per cent of the capsicum crop
in Himachal Pradesh, pushing up prices across India. The state is a
major capsicum producer of the region which is grown on about 1200
hectares [2965 acres] with annually 100 000 tonnes of the crop.

Director for agriculture, JC Rana, said the maximum damage was
witnessed in the prominent capsicum belt of Kandaghat in Solan
district. "Most of the crop in Kandaghat has been hit by fungus
disease alternaria blight due to high humidity, cloudy conditions, and
water stagnation in the fields," he added.

A vegetable grower in Kandaghat said, "Some of the areas located
along the banks of water channels have been severely affected by water
logging. The damage could be up to 60 per cent." The excessive rains
also took a toll on other crops like cabbage, tomatoes, and beans.

Rana said the capsicum grown in polyhouses [plastic growth tunnels]
is not affected by the fungus disease.

[A number of species of _Alternaria_ fungi, including _A. alternata_
and _A. solani_, can cause serious yield losses in capsicum crops.
Symptoms may include leaf spots leading to defoliation, fruit rots,
and stem lesions on seedlings or transplants. Fruit and seedling
infections often occur on areas with previous injuries due to, for
example, mechanical damage during handling, insects, sun scald, or
other pathogens. Internal fruit rot without external signs of
infection can occur when flowers are infected. Field infections are
favoured by wet conditions late in the growing season. Thus in the
report above, it is likely that plants grown in polyhouses have not
been seriously affected because they were protected from the excessive
moisture and mechanical damage due to the heavy rains.

The fungi are spread with contaminated plant material (including crop
debris, transplants, and seed), by mechanical means (including insect
and human activities), wind, and rain. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer
plants of solanaceous crops may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management includes use of certified clean propagation material,
fungicides, crop rotation, and use of cultivars with reduced
susceptibility. Biocontrol with _Trichoderma_ has been shown to be
promising.

Different _Alternaria_ species can cause diseases in a wide range of
crops. Recent examples from India include _A. solani_ causing early
blight of potato and tomato, _A. alternata_ causing leaf blight of
tea, and _A. porri_ causing purple blotch of onion.
