Raw ground tuna in sushi rolls and other sushi dishes could be the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak that has sickened at least 9 people in Maricopa County, county health officials said. 9 people have had the same rare strain of Salmonella [specifically _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi] and 3 of those individuals have been hospitalized. Those individuals fell ill with the same rare strain from 3-16 Apr 2015. No Arizona cases have been reported outside Maricopa County.

County health officials have interviewed 8 of the 9 people with the same rare strain, and all of them consumed ground tuna at multiple Maricopa County restaurants, said Dr. Bob England, director of Maricopa County Department of Public Health. England said that the contaminated tuna is likely being shipped to area restaurants. That could mean that a food distributor of manufacturer is the source of contamination, but health and food safety investigators have not yet identified a source, England said.

Because health officials have not identified the source, England said people should be cautious about eating raw ground tuna commonly found in spicy tuna rolls or other sushi dishes. "It's a good idea to certainly think twice," England said. "The contamination is happening prior to the delivery of the tuna (to area restaurants). It is not just a matter of stopping the sale of tuna at a particular restaurant."

California health officials said the strain found in California is similar to 1 found in a 2010 outbreak, which was later tracked to an overseas factory.

[Although not specifically stated, the serotype here is likely the d-tartrate-fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This organism has well-characterized animal reservoirs and has been involved in several recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail as noted below. It is not clear if the New Mexico strain has been linked to the strain in Southern California reported in April 2015 -- see ProMED archive below.

The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al. Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12: 507-10 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. - Mod.LL]
