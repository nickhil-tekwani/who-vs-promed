[Seasonal occurrence of WNV in Greece started in the summer of 2010. During the disease season, August-October 2010, 25 outbreaks were reported to the OIE. In 2011 (July-September) 17 outbreaks were reported, and during July-October 2012, 14.

During the period July 2012 to October 2013, as covered in OIE's cumulative "Event summary: West Nile Fever, Greece" cumulative report updated and closed on 1 Nov 2013, 24 outbreaks were reported. See the relevant reports and an interactive map covering the said period at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=12164.

The following introductory summary to West Nile Fever chapter 2.1.20. is derived from OIE's terrestrial manual (Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013).

"West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses."
