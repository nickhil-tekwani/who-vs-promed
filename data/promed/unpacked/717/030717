Summary
------
Long-term SARS-CoV-2 shedding was observed from the upper respiratory tract of a female immunocompromised patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was observed up to 70 days, and genomic and subgenomic RNA up to 105 days past initial diagnosis. The infection was not cleared after a 1st treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting limited impact on SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract within this patient. Several weeks after a 2nd convalescent plasma transfusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was no longer detected. We observed marked within-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with continuous turnover of dominant viral variants. However, replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial tissues were not affected. Our data indicate that certain immunocompromised patients may shed infectious virus for longer durations than previously recognized. Detection of subgenomic RNA is recommended in persistently SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals as a proxy for shedding of infectious virus.

---
...In contrast to the prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the longest detected shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus is up to 20 days after the initial positive test result (van Kampen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b). The probability of isolating SARS-CoV-2 decreases with lower viral load, when the duration of symptoms exceeds 15 days, and upon the generation of detectable neutralizing antibodies (van Kampen et al., 2020).

Infectious SARS-CoV-2 [via cell culture isolation] was successfully cultured from the nasopharyngeal swabs collected at day 49 and day 70.

Convalescent plasma treatment did not clear SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract.

An estimated 3 million people in the USA have some form of immunocompromising condition, including HIV infection, solid-organ transplant recipients, haemopoietic stem-cell transplants, patients receiving chemotherapy and patients receiving corticosteroids (Kunisaki and Janoff, 2009). This transient or chronic immunocompromised patient population is at higher risk of respiratory disease complications with respiratory infections such as influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 (Kunisaki and Janoff, 2009).

[There are several important points raised in the paper, the most important being that infectious virus can be shed by immunocompromised patients up to 103 days. While this case represents a single patient, prolonged shedding of virus in immunosuppressed individuals has been noted with MERS, pH1N1 and other viruses. The 2nd point is that the investigators were able to detect infectious virus and not only RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs at 49 and 70 days. This begs the question whether there was sufficient viral load to be transmissible. Another important finding was that convalescent plasma treatment did not clear SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract, possibly because of the difficulty of reaching that location where the virus was sequestered following IV administration of antibodies (Ikegami et al., 2020) compared with the lower respiratory tract (Mira et al., 2020). Eventually the virus did clear after the development of low neutralizing antibody titers.

It will be important to follow viral persistence in more patients to understand the mechanism persistence and eventual clearance. The proportion of the infected population that sheds SARS-CoV-2 is not known.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 mitigation measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders and public mask mandate) and fundamental public health interventions (e.g., case investigations and contact tracing with prompt isolation or quarantine) are primary approaches to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.

What is added by this report?
State-mandated stay-at-home orders and public mask mandates coupled with case investigations with contact tracing contributed to an 82% reduction in COVID-19 incidence, 88% reduction in hospitalizations, and 100% reduction in mortality in Delaware during late April-June [2020].

What are the implications for public health practice?
The combination of state-mandated community mitigation efforts and routine public health interventions can reduce the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

---
Mitigation measures, including stay-at-home orders and public mask wearing, together with routine public health interventions such as case investigation with contact tracing and immediate self-quarantine after exposure, are recommended to prevent and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3; see source URL for complete references). On 11 Mar 2020, the 1st COVID-19 case in Delaware was reported to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH). The state responded to ongoing community transmission with investigation of all identified cases (commencing 11 Mar 2020), issuance of statewide stay-at-home orders (24 Mar 2020-1 Jun 2020), a statewide public mask mandate (from 28 Apr 2020), and contact tracing (starting 12 May 2020). The relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March-June 2020. Incidence declined by 82%, hospitalization by 88%, and mortality by 100% from late April to June 2020, as the mask mandate and contact tracing were added to case investigations and the stay-at-home order. Among 9762 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during 11 Mar 2020-25 Jun 2020, two-thirds (6527, 67%) of patients were interviewed, and 5823 (60%) reported completing isolation. Among 2834 contacts reported, 882 (31%) were interviewed and among these contacts, 721 (82%) reported completing quarantine. Implementation of mitigation measures, including mandated mask use coupled with public health interventions, was followed by reductions in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality. The combination of state-mandated community mitigation efforts and routine public health interventions can reduce the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

Using laboratory and case investigation data, changes in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality in Delaware during 11 Mar 2020-25 Jun 2020 were assessed. Laboratory data from the Delaware Electronic Reporting and Surveillance System (DERSS) and case investigation data from Delaware DPH were obtained. DERSS data included case classification (e.g., laboratory-confirmed or probable [see source URL for definition of probable case]); case investigation data included hospitalization status and outcome, including death. Incidence was defined as the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients per 10 000 Delaware residents per week (4). Hospitalization and mortality rates were calculated similarly, as the number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized or died per 10 000 persons per week. Percent change was calculated to describe the magnitude of rate change. Delaware mitigation and public health interventions included 1) case investigations (starting 11 Mar 2020), which involved interviewing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, asking each to immediately self-isolate while collecting information on demographic characteristics, potential exposure source, symptoms, and close contacts [see source URL for list of symptoms and definition of close contacts used]; 2) statewide mandated stay-at-home order (24 Mar 2020-1 Jun 2020; https://governor.delaware.gov/health-soe/fifth-state-of-emergency/); 3) statewide mandated mask use in public (instituted 28 Apr 2020; https://governor.delaware.gov/health-soe/thirteenth-state-of-emergency/); and 4) contact tracing (starting 12 May 2020), wherein close contacts were interviewed and asked to self-quarantine and report symptoms for 14 days following an exposure. Changes in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality from March through June [2020] were assessed.

After the initial case report and stay-at-home order, COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality rates increased, peaking during the week of 13 Apr 2020 at 15.0, 2.0, and 0.8 per 10 000 persons, respectively (Figure; see source URL). After the peak, incidence declined by 18%, hospitalizations by 20%, and deaths by 13%, before increasing slightly during the week of 20 Apr 2020. Rates declined again the same week the mask mandate went into effect (28 Apr 2020) and continued to decline by 82% (incidence), 88% (hospitalization) and 100% (mortality) from late April through June [2020], as contact tracing was added to case investigations, the stay-at-home order, and the mask mandate.

During 11 Mar 2020-25 Jun 2020, a total of 9762 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified in DERSS; among these cases, 6527 (67%) patients were interviewed and asked to self-isolate, among whom 5823 (89%) had been released from isolation [see source URL for details regarding isolation release] at the time of data collection. Median patient age was 41 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 28-54 years), and 55% were female (Table; see source URL). The median interval from receiving a positive test result to interview was 8 days (IQR = 6-12 days) and from DPH's receipt of case report to interview was 5 days (IQR = 2-8 days). Patients who were not interviewed were those who did not respond to call attempts (1134, 12%), were in a hospital/long-term care facility at time of contact (788, 8%), did not have an available phone number (673, 7%), had died (433, 4%), or were not interviewed for other reasons [see source URL for further explanation] (207, 2%). Among interviewed patients, 5742 (88%) reported having any COVID-19-related symptoms before the interview date, and 55% reported close contact with someone with diagnosed COVID-19.

Among 6527 interviewed patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 5390 (83%) either refused to name contacts or could not recall contacts. The mean number of contacts reported per patient who reported one or more contacts was 2.5 (IQR = 1-3). Among the 2834 contacts reported, complete contact information was obtained for 1869 (66%), and 882 (47%) of those were interviewed and asked to self-quarantine. The median interval from patient interview to contact interview was 2 days (IQR = 1-4 days). The median age of interviewed contacts was 25 years (IQR = 14-47 years), 433 (49%) were female, 721 (82%) did not develop symptoms during quarantine, and 771 (87%) lived in the same household as someone with confirmed COVID-19. Overall, 161 (18%) of the 882 contacts who were reached experienced symptoms during quarantine and were urged to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. A manual search of DERSS data determined that among 161 symptomatic contacts, 20 (12%) were tested, 4 of whom (3%) received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Reasons for not interviewing contacts included that the contact did not respond to call attempts (265, 14%), had no available phone number (208, 11%), refused (88, 5%), was a non-Delaware resident (20, 1%), or other reasons (406, 22%).

Discussion
----------
A stay-at-home order and case investigations instituted weeks before the peak in COVID-19 cases (week of 13 Apr 2020) in Delaware likely contributed to the subsequent decline observed in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and deaths. As expected, the impact on incidence was not immediate but occurred weeks after measures were implemented, as new cases represented exposure that occurred during previous weeks. Additional steep declines in reports of new cases occurred after a public mask use mandate was issued in late April [2020]. Masks are critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from persons with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection (5). Wearing masks can prevent respiratory droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 from traveling into the air and being transmitted to other persons and thus can reduce exposures and infections (6,7).

Early detection, self-isolation, and investigation of COVID-19 cases and self-quarantine of close contacts can be effective in preventing community transmission, if contacts are identified and reached soon after exposure (8). Because of limited resources and the growing number of cases, contact tracing in Delaware officially began in May [2020] when the Delaware National Guard was activated to assist Delaware DPH. In Delaware, contacts were monitored until symptom onset or quarantine completion. Testing was recommended for contacts reporting symptoms; however, no active follow-up was performed because of constrained resources. Case investigation was completed among contacts who received positive test results; therefore, having active follow-up and referral systems for testing contacts could expand disease prevention and containment opportunities.

Several barriers to case investigation and contact tracing were identified. First, low numbers of contacts were identified: 83% of interviewed patients either refused to disclose contacts or could not recall contacts. Second, cases were contacted a median of 8 days after receiving their positive test result and 5 days after report of this result to DPH. Earlier initiation of case investigation might increase recall and early identification of close contacts and thus prevent further disease transmission. Lastly, 22% of contacts could not be reached for reasons designated as "other," an interaction outcome in case investigations and contact tracing reserved for circumstances interviewers could not address without additional information. Daily and weekly data monitoring to provide additional information for those with "other" as an interaction outcome could increase the number of persons reached. These barriers to contact tracing might have limited effectiveness and were missed opportunities to recommend other mitigation strategies (e.g., testing, quarantine, or isolation).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, data on adherence to the state-mandated stay-at-home order and use of masks in public were not available. Second, adherence to self-quarantine was self-reported. Finally, because of the observational design of the study, the decline in COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality could not be attributed to the relative contribution of each mitigation measure.

A combination of mitigation measures including stay-at-home orders, mandated mask use in public, and case investigations with contact tracing can reduce COVID-19 incidence and associated deaths (9). No single mitigation strategy is likely to be effective alone. These strategies are effective in limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and reducing community transmission when implemented as part of a multicomponent strategy (10). In Delaware, state-mandated community mitigation efforts, such as stay-at-home orders, coupled with mask use, likely contributed to the decline in new COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, hospitalization, and mortality can be reduced with statewide mitigation strategies implemented in tandem with the routine public health interventions of case investigation with contact tracing, and immediate self-isolation of cases and self-quarantine of contacts.

[Another study confirming the efficacy of the simple NPIs. The observed 82% reduction in incidence, 88% reduction in hospitalizations, and 100% reduction in mortality is hard to argue with. The significant challenge the public health sector here had was in contact tracing. Delaware is not the only state that has encountered challenges in contact tracing with cases refusing to give names of contacts or contacts refusing to follow through with interviews and control measures. These data are from April through June 2020; follow-up information would be nice to have to see if the contact tracing has been improving or is staying the same. If so, there's a definite role for the medical anthropologists to work on why this challenge is there, and how to frame discussions with cases and their contacts moving forward.

The Pew Research Center conducted a survey on contact tracing challenges in July 2020. The survey showed that 58% of US adults would be very or somewhat likely to speak with a public health official when contacted by phone or text message to speak about the coronavirus outbreak. Also, 77% reported they would be somewhat comfortable sharing information with a public health official about places they have recently visited; 49% said they would be similarly comfortable sharing location data from their cellphone. And 93% of adults say they definitely or probably would quarantine themselves for at least 14 days if they were told they should do so by a public health official because they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. That said, when asked about speaking with a public health official who might contact them about the outbreak via phone or text, 41% say they would be not at all or not too likely to do so. And 40% had similar discomfort about speaking with a public official showing up at their residence to talk about COVID-19.

The survey looked at Americans' openness to answering phone calls from unknown numbers and finds some evidence that even starting the contact tracing process might be challenging. Only 19% of Americans say they generally answer their cellphones when a call is received from an unknown phone number. Some 67% say they don't answer but would check a voicemail if one is left. And 14% say they generally don't answer and would ignore a voicemail.

The survey found that people's phone-answering habits with their views about personal records and concern regarding scams relate to whether they would be comfortable or likely to engage with contact tracing steps. Those who usually ignore both calls and voicemails from unknown numbers, those who think people often pretend to be someone else in order to steal others' personal information, and those who are less confident that public health organizations will keep these records safe are less likely to say they would be comfortable or likely to engage with the contact tracing process. (Excerpted from a report by the Pew Research Center, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/10/30/the-challenges-of-contact-tracing-as-u-s-battles-covid-19/). The report is very interesting in its entirety, including the tables. There's also a section that relates to the politicization of the USA's response to the pandemic that is fascinating. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 6 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov6_1604701865.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 28.7% of daily case numbers and 37.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 21.1 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Canada. Chile and Costa Rica reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 53.1% of daily case numbers and 41.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 12.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (6 Nov 2020) include Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include France, followed by Italy, Poland, UK, Spain, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic, and Switzerland. There were 20 additional countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.7% of daily case numbers and 8.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.24 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Pakistan, and UAE. Libya, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Somalia and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.34 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Botswana, Ethiopia, Algeria, Angola, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.74% of daily case numbers and 0.74% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.75 million cases. The Philippines has resumed its dominance followed by Malaysia, Japan, French Polynesia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 10.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 10.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.5 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: The Americas region combined with the European region account for 80% of daily reported cases and 79% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours. That said, the European region has 28 countries reporting more than 1000 cases per day and an additional 7 countries reporting more than 500 cases in the past 24 hours. Cases have somewhat declined in the South East Asian region, while overall case numbers are just above 4000 from the Western Pacific region and just over 6000 in the Africa region.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (139 064), France (60 486), India (49 851), and Italy (37 802) have been dominant. A global total of 9156 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (5-6 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 49.6 million cases.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, India, France, Italy, Poland (27 086), UK (23 287), Spain (22 516), Germany (22 246), Russia (20 582), Brazil (18 247), Argentina (11 786), Czech Republic (11 552), Belgium (11 128), and Romania (10 260). A total of 57 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours representing 26.3% of reporting countries; 31 of the 57 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the Africa region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.6%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 22.8%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA, as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 30.4% and in reported deaths is 20.4%. Similarly, in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in reported cases is 22.4% and in reported deaths is 14.9%.

Impression: Global daily reported cases continue to increase where the daily increase has surpassed 600 000 new cases and with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The Africa region has several countries with increased reporting as well. All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential, having surpassed the 10 million cumulative case mark, with the state of Texas having reported over 1 million cases and Florida will be crossing 1 million cases in the coming week if daily reports continue at the same rate. - Mod.MPP]
