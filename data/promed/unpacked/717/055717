Nova Scotia's first case of Lyme disease
----------------------------------------
Health officials have confirmed the first case of Lyme disease in Nova
Scotia. The provincial health department said on Friday that a person
living on the province's South Shore contracted the disease, which is
caused by tick bites.
"The risk of Lyme disease is still very low," said Dr Richard Gould, a
provincial health officer. "It is highly treatable and the public should
not be worried." The patient is recovering and [like most Lyme disease
patients - Mod.LL] did not require hospital admission.
Gould said the discovery of the disease in Nova Scotia was not unexpected
because it has been present in the eastern United States for years, and the
tick most closely associated with the disease [as well as the usual
vertebrate reservoirs - Mod.LL] are present in the province.
