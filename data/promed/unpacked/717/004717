Re.: Salmonellosis, redpoll finches - USA (MN): suspected, and Undiagnosed
deaths, redpoll finches - USA (AK)
-----------------------------------------------
Please find below a preliminary report from the Washington Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory and collaborators regarding the cause of Redpoll
mortality in the Fairbanks, Alaska area.
The mass mortality of Redpolls (_Carduelis flammea_) in the Fairbanks,
Alaska area was associated with infection by the bacterium _Escherichia
albertii_.
This organism was isolated in high numbers and in pure cultures from
tissues and intestines from a total of 5 Redpolls from a 132 km diameter
region around Fairbanks, AK. The Redpoll mortalities were associated with
only mild enteritis, in marked contrast to the typical findings in
mortality due to avian salmonellosis. All of the _E. albertii_ isolates
were indistinguishable by PFGE [Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis]. Other
birds and Redpolls that were known to have died of other causes were
cultured as controls, and were negative for _E. albertii_ or other
coliforms. Other avian mortality events occurring during the same time
period, including Redpoll mortality from the Juneau, AK area, were found to
be associated with Group B Salmonella.
_E. albertii_ is a recently described member of the Enterobacteriaceae that
has been associated with diarrheal illness in humans in Bangladesh (Huys,
2003) but has not been previously associated with disease or infection in
animals. The _E. albertii_ isolated from these Redpolls appears to be very
similar to the atypical _E. coli_ previously reported from finch mortality
in Scotland (Foster, 1998).
Our identification of _E. albertii_ was established by 16S rDNA gene
sequence and by phenotypic similarity to previously reported _E. albertii_.
PCR and DNA sequencing were also used to confirm the presence of genes for
intimin and for cytolethal distending toxin. The Redpoll isolates exhibit
several biochemical reactions atypical for _E. coli_, including lack of
lactose fermentation. The isolates also exhibit biochemical reactions
atypical of previously reported _E. albertii_ isolates, including
production of indole from tryptophan. In addition, the intimin and
cytolethal distending toxin gene sequences differed significantly from
those previously reported from _E. albertii_ and the Scottish finch isolates.

[From the said information, it appears that the recent mortalities in North
American finches are attributed to more than one causal agent. Isolations
of Group B Salmonellae (which ones?), _E.albertii_ (of which the
pathogenicity to other avian or mammalian species needs further studies) or
other coliforms from organs (not only digestive tract) of dead finches are
significant but not exclusive components of the final diagnosis.
Epidemiological observations (which may be supported by experimental
infection trials), as well as gross and histopathological findings, are
essential in the final confirmation of Salmonellosis or Colibacillosis.
The described findings of Enterobacteriaceae do not necessarily preclude
the possibility of concurrent infections, including viral ones. Additional
field and laboratory investigations might be in place.
The published precautionary hygienic measures for the handling of bird
feeders are in place in both cases. - Mod.AS]
