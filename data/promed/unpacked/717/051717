Measles outbreak in Bong
------------------------
There is a report of a measles outbreak around the Zulu Hill community in Fuamah District, Bong County. Bong County Health Officer, Dr. Sampson Arzoaquoi, told the New Dawn Bong County Correspondent in Gbarnga that there's a number of children showing signs and symptoms of measles in the Community, located around the St. Paul River. Dr. Arzoaquoi also reported another suspected measles outbreak in Jorquelleh District and Gbarnga, adding that specimens have already been sent to Monrovia for laboratory verification. Dr. Arzoaquoi noted that the necessary measures are also being taken by the Bong County Health and Social Welfare Team to avoid the degeneration of the situation. The Bong County Health Officer disclosed that a 21-man team has already been dispatched to the Zulu Hill community, fully empowered to observe the situation and immunize children. He expressed the preparedness of the County Health Team to handle the measles outbreak and any unfavorable health situation that might emerge. He said while the County Health and Social Welfare Team may have to take the blame for not immunizing children, it must be understood that the team was also overwhelmed by the Ebola crisis. The Bong County Health Officer admonished citizens not to panic about news of the suspected outbreak of measles. The result of the laboratory test is expected to be released very soon. The report by the County Health officer comes amid concerns among Bong County about the preparedness of the County Health Team to deal with the situation, especially when Ebola is still present.

Measles vaccines confirmed safe after 12-year-study
---------------------------------------------------
The measles vaccines have been some of the most scrutinized vaccines concerning safety and adverse events in recent years. Now a 12-year study of 2 types of measles-containing vaccines, published Monday [5 Jan 2015] in Pediatrics, found that 7 main adverse outcomes were unlikely after either vaccine, while confirming that both vaccine formulations are associated with fever and febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after vaccination in one-year-old children.

The study, conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, included children aged 12 to 23 months from January 2000 through June 2012 who received measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) or separately administered, same-day measles-mumps-rubella and varicella (MMR + V) vaccines. A total of 123 200 MMRV doses and 584 987 MMR + V doses were evaluated. Comparing MMRV with MMR + V, no increased risk of 7 main neurological, blood or immune system disorders (immune thrombocytopenia purpura, anaphylaxis, ataxia, arthritis, meningitis/encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Kawasaki disease) was detected. No new safety concerns were identified after either vaccine, and most outcomes studied were unlikely after either vaccine. "This study did not identify any new safety concerns comparing MMRV with MMR + V or after either the MMRV or the MMR + V vaccine," said lead author Nicola P. Klein, MD, PhD, co-director of the Vaccine Study Center. "In fact, there were few or zero events for several outcomes following vaccination. The findings indicate that even if an increased risk for these outcomes exists, the risk is low and rare. This should reassure parents that these outcomes are unlikely after either vaccine."

The study also confirmed the findings from previous studies that MMRV and MMR + V are associated with fever and febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after vaccination among one-year-old children, and that MMRV versus MMR + V is associated with an increased risk of seizures during that interval. While febrile seizures are the most common neurologic adverse events following immunization with measles-containing vaccines, the risk is small -- less than one febrile seizure per 1000 injections. Other previous studies have not found any increased risk for fever or febrile seizures following either vaccine among 4-6 year old children. "This level of safety monitoring for vaccines can give the public confidence that vaccine surveillance is ongoing and that if a safety problem existed, it would be detected," said Klein. "Our findings offer reassurance that adverse outcomes of measles-containing vaccines are extremely rare and unlikely, and that parents of one-year-old children can choose MMR + V instead of MMRV vaccines to reduce the low risk of fever and febrile seizures."

Measles outbreak associated with Disney Theme Park
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 19 people from 3 states who visited Disney theme parks in California last month [December 2014] have now fallen ill with measles, health officials said Friday [9 Jan 2015]. The patients all visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between [15 and 20 Dec 2014], the California Department of Public Health and the Orange County Health Agency said. 16 of the cases were in California, 2 in Utah, and 1 is in Colorado, officials said.

Officials in California said that of the 16 cases in the state they have only verified that 2 were fully vaccinated against the disease. Some were partially vaccinated and at least 2 were too young to be vaccinated. More people might have been exposed when measles patients were treated at 2 local hospitals and a lab, said Nicole Stanfield, a spokeswoman for the Orange County's health care agency. Stanfield urged anyone with measles symptoms to call their doctor before seeking medical attention to avoid exposing others to the highly contagious illness.

"The medical provider may visit them in the car or may have a special room for them to go where they're not contaminating everyone else in the waiting room," she said. 9 cases had been reported earlier in the week with 10 more emerging Thursday [8 Jan 2015] and Friday [9 Jan 2015] in California and Colorado, where the El Paso County Public Health department said a patient was diagnosed with measles at a Colorado Springs hospital after visiting a California theme park. Of the California cases, 8 were in Orange County, 2 in Riverside County, 2 in San Diego County with the rest spread around the state. Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually 1st appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Health experts say the best prevention against measles is vaccination. While officials declared measles eliminated in the United States in 2000 because of a lack of continuous transmission, the illness is still brought into the country by foreign visitors or unvaccinated Americans.

Health Officials Worried About Potential Measles Outbreak In Utah County
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two adolescent siblings infected with measles visited a number of public places in Utah County [Utah state] between [26 Dec 2014] and [4 Jan 2015] and now health officials are worried that because of the number of people exposed they could have an epidemic on their hands. The Orem siblings contracted the virus at Disneyland on Wednesday, 17 Dec [2014], and became contagious after returning to Utah and developing symptoms.

On Friday, 26 Dec [2014], they were at a Macey's Grocery Store on 800 North & State Street in Orem, the Cinemark Movie 8 theater in Provo and the Carmike Wynnsong 12 theater in Provo. They attended church at the Geneva Heights LDS Chapel on Sunday [28 Dec 2014] and the next day, they were at the WalMart on Sandhill Road in Orem from 9-11pm. All crowded public places where someone could have contracted the virus even if they didn't have any contact with those siblings.

"The virus is airborne," Excecutive Director of the Utah County Health Department Dr. Joseph Miner said. "Actually after a person is in a room and leaves, the virus can float around in the air for a couple of hours so the person doesn't need to be in the room. That's why our hours for these particular locations include that period of time afterward that they weren't there but the virus could still be there."

The incubation period is 10-12 days so people could start getting the symptoms in the next few days. If you've been vaccinated like 90 percent of all Utahns, then you've got nothing to worry about but if you haven't had the vaccine and think you've been exposed then you're asked to quarantine yourself inside your home for 21 straight days. "There's quite a few people who are doing that right now," Utah State Epidemiologist Dr. Allyn Nakashima said. "If you have to go to work we can help you with those issues, the County Health Department and we have letters saying this is a necessary thing for public health."

With infants and people who have compromised immune systems particularly vulnerable, they want to nip this outbreak in the bud. "We can get a head start to make sure these cases don't spread because measles is so contagious," Dr. Miner said. "You can get many, many cases in a hurry, gets out of control among unimmunized individuals, susceptible individuals."

The following is the Utah Department of Health's list of potential exposure
sites:

- Friday, 26 Dec 2014 -- Macey's Grocery Store in Orem, 5 pm-11 pm
- Friday, 26 Dec 2014 -- Cinemark Movies 8 in Provo, 4 pm-8 pm
- Friday, 26 Dec 2014 -- Carmike Wynnsong 12 in Provo, 10 pm-Closing
- Sunday, 28 Dec 2014 -- Geneva Heights LDS Church in Orem, 12:30 pm-7 pm
- Monday, 29 Dec 2014 -- Walmart, Sandhill Road, Orem, 9 pm-11 pm
- Friday, 2 Jan 2015 -- Orem Community Hospital, Lobby, Lab or Gift Shop, 4:30 pm-7pm
- Saturday, 3 Jan 2015 -- Timpanogos Regional Hospital, ER Waiting Room, 12:30
pm-3:30 pm
- Saturday, 3 Jan 2015 -- Timpanogos Regional Hospital, Lab Waiting Room, 1:30
pm-3:30 pm
- Sunday, 4 Jan 2015 -- Timpanogos Regional Hospital, Lab Waiting Room, 1:45
pm-3:45 pm

Measles linked to RMIT University graduation prompts health warning
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Victoria Department of Health in Australia has been notified of 2 confirmed cases of measles in individuals not vaccinated for measles who became ill after attendance at an RMIT graduation ceremony at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium on 17 Dec 2014. Health authorities advise the public to consider the possibility of measles in any person who is susceptible to measles and develops a compatible illness and who attended the RMIT graduation ceremony at Etihad Stadium on 17 Dec 2014. In addition, be alert for measles in patients presenting with a fever and rash, or with a prodrome after an established exposure. Measles has an incubation period of up to 18 days (average 14 days from exposure to rash) so illness acquired from this event could begin up to 4 Jan 2015, and remain infectious for many days after that. Measles is highly infectious (airborne transmission) and one probable case has been identified at one of these venues. Other secondary cases are likely to occur. The Victoria Department of Health says measles initially presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza. A generalized maculopapular rash is then seen 2 to 5 days after the onset of the prodrome. Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa may be present for 3 to 4 days prior to rash onset but not at time of rash. Individuals, especially children, are typically unwell. The most important clinical predictors are the following features: generalised maculopapular rash, usually lasting 3 or more days, and fever (at least 38 degrees C, if measured) present at the time of rash onset, and cough or coryza or conjunctivitis. Measles is highly infectious and can persist in the environment for at least 30 minutes. The incubation period is variable and averages 10 days (range: 7­18 days) from exposure to the onset of fever, with an average of 14 days from exposure to the onset of rash. The infectious period of patients with measles is 5 days before, to 4 days after, the appearance of the rash.

Perhaps the most remarkable of these measles reports is that emanating from Liberia, where viruses other than Ebola virus are still a matter of concern. - Mod.CP]
