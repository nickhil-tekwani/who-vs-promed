Disease hits Brazilian passionfruit crops
-----------------------------------------
Constant rains in the central west part of Sao Paulo have created
humid conditions for passionfruit farms, leading to fungal disease
outbreaks. Some farmers have lost between 90 and 100 per cent of their
passionfruit plantations to the disease known as "anthracnose".

Agronomist Norberto Filho said the disease meant plant leaves and
fruit became light yellow, and plant care was essential as rains still
made fumigation difficult. If crops are wiped out from anthracnose,
farmers should generally wait between 60 and 70 days to replant after
disease eradication.

[Anthracnose of passionfruit (_Passiflora_ species) is one of the
most destructive diseases of the crop. It is caused by the fungi
_Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_)
and other _Colletotrichum_ and _Glomerella_ species, but not much is
known about the disease. Symptoms may occur pre- or post-harvest and
include dark, sunken lesions on the fruits. Under humid conditions,
small black dots (spore cases) of the fungus appear on the affected
area. These areas later take on a dry parchment-like appearance and
the skin breaks easily.

The fungi survive on crop debris and spread occurs mainly with
infected plant material and by mechanical means. Disease management
may include removal of infected crop debris to reduce inoculum, crop
rotation, fungicides (although effectiveness may be limited),
biocontrol organisms (for example _Trichoderma_ species), and cultural
measures (reduction of moisture in the crop).

Brazil is the world's largest producer of passionfruit with an
estimated cultivation area of almost 50 000 ha [about 124 000 acres].
This recent outbreak of anthracnose may be considered a threat to the
national crop.

_G. cingulata_ and related species have been reported to cause
anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.
