A newly discovered pathogenic species infecting goats in China can also affect humans, warn researchers at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.

Anaplasmosis, formerly known as gall sickness, is a disease of ruminants caused by several different pathogens in the _Anaplasma_ group. All the _Anaplasma_ species are transmitted by ticks.

The disease results in rapid loss of condition in the infected animal. The most common species infecting goats is _Anaplasma ovis_, and it is more severe in goats than in sheep. Overt clinical signs and mortality is rare and recovered cases remain persistent carriers.

Some _Anaplasma_ species are known to infect humans, so the researchers investigated the potential for human pathogenicity of a newly discovered _Anaplasma_ species infecting goats in China. The researchers collected blood samples from patients with a history of tick bite over 2 months at Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, to detect the novel _Anaplasma_ species. Of 477 patients assessed, 28 were infected with the novel _Anaplasma_ species according to PCR and sequencing, and the pathogen was also isolated in vitro from 3 patients.

Phylogenetic analyses showed that the pathogen was distinct from all known _Anaplasma_ species. The researchers dubbed it _Anaplasma capra_, as it was also found in goats.

Antibodies formed against the new pathogen were detectable in many of the patients, and all 28 patients developed symptoms, including fever in 23, headache in 14, malaise in 13, dizziness in 9, myalgia in 4, and chills in 4. Additionally, 10 of 28 patients had rash or eschar, 8 had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 3 had stiff neck. 5 patients were admitted to hospital because of severe disease.

The emergence of _A. capra_ as a cause of human disease suggests that individuals living in or travelling to endemic regions in northern China should take precautions to reduce their risk of exposure to this novel tick-borne pathogen.

"Abstract
----
Background. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Anaplasma ovis_ cause human infections. We investigated the potential for human pathogenicity of a newly discovered _Anaplasma_ species infecting goats in China.

Methods. We collected blood samples from patients with a history of tick bite in the preceding 2 months at Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital of Heilongjiang Province from 1 May to 10 Jun 2014, to detect the novel _Anaplasma_ species by PCR. We inoculated positive samples into cell cultures. We characterised the isolated pathogen by morphological and phylogenetic analyses. We tested serum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assay.

Findings. 28 (6 percent) of 477 patients assessed were infected with the novel _Anaplasma_ species according to PCR and sequencing. We isolated the pathogen in vitro from 3 patients. Phylogenetic analyses of rrs, gltA, groEL, msp2, and msp4 showed that the pathogen was distinct from all known _Anaplasma_ species. We provisionally nominate it _Anaplasma capra_. 22 (92 percent) of 24 patients with data available had seroconversion or a 4-fold increase in antibody titres. All 28 patients developed non-specific febrile manifestations, including fever in 23 (82 percent), headache in 14 (50 percent), malaise in 13 (46 percent), dizziness in 9 (32 percent), myalgia in 4 (14 percent), and chills in 4 (14 percent). Additionally, 10 (36 percent) of 28 patients had rash or eschar, 8 (29 percent) had lymphadenopathy, 8 (29 percent) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 3 (11 percent) had stiff neck. 5 patients were admitted to hospital because of severe disease. 6 (35 percent) of 17 patients with data available had high hepatic aminotransferase concentrations.

Interpretation. The emergence of _A. capra_ as a cause of human disease suggests that individuals living in or travelling to endemic regions in northern China should take precautions to reduce their risk of exposure to this novel tick-borne pathogen."

Anaplasmosis has been documented in both humans in several provinces and in animals in China. In a ProMED-mail report in 2008 (Undiagnosed hem. disease - China (02): (SD), anaplasmosis Archive Number: 20080805.2400), 4 cases with human granulocytic anaplasmosis were identified in Wanjiakou village in Shandong province in 2008; the diagnosis was laboratory confirmed by PCR and sequencing analysis (ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed hem. disease - China (02): (SD), anaplasmosis 20080805.2400). Of the 4 patients, 2 died with fever, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. ProMED-mail moderator MPP noted that the DNA of _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the pathogen that usually causes anaplasmosis, had been detected in _Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks in 2006, and seroprevalence surveys in farm workers had documented anaplasmosis in China in 2008.

Anaplasmosis is often associated with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or increased liver enzyme levels in patients with a history of tick exposure within the prior 3 weeks. Anaplasmosis can be severe and even life-threatening if untreated or initiation of antibiotic therapy is delayed in elderly and in immunocompromised patients. However, as the ProMED-mail moderator noted, in most patients anaplasmosis is a mild disease and a case fatality rate of 2 out of 4 cases (50 percent) would be unusual.

The diagnosis of anaplasmosis can be confirmed by a 4-fold increase in antibody titer by IFA (indirect immunofluorescence assay) in acute and convalescent-phase serum samples, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of anaplasma DNA in a clinical specimen, immunostaining of _A. phagocytophilum_ antigen in a tissue sample, or isolation of _A. phagocytophilum_ from a clinical specimen in cell culture (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ehrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis 2008 Case definition. September 2008 (date cited). Available at
http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/casedef/ehrlichiosis_2008.htm).

However, a clinically similar tick-borne illness was subsequently described in China and found to be caused by the Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) virus, a newly identified member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110317.0853). Major clinical symptoms in patients included fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and there was a high initial case fatality rate of 30 per cent (ProMED-mail post Bunyavirus disease, human - China (HE), susp.
Archive Number: 20120805.1229337). The SFTS virus was found to be widespread in China in both the human population and domestic animals (especially goats) harboring ticks. See ProMED-mail posts Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea: (HN) Archive Number: 20140525.2496906 and Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update Archive Number: 20130526.1738022.

In 2010, a variant of _Anaplasma ovis_, which infects goats and sheep worldwide, was detected in a Cypriot patient following a tick bite, although no additional human cases have been reported (Chochlakis D, Ioannou I, Tselentis Y, and Psaroulaki A: Human anaplasmosis. Emerg Infect Dis 2010; 16: pp. 1031-1032).

The published study referred to in the news report identified an additional new, tick-borne, human pathogen in northern China provisionally named _Anaplasma capra_, because it was also found in goats. PCR and sequencing showed nucleotide variations signifying a phylogenetically distinct _Anaplasma_ species. Li et al studied 477 patients who lived in northeastern China where _A. capra_ had been identified in ticks and goats and who sought treatment at a hospital for a tick bite within the prior 2 months between 1 May and 10 Jun 2014. 28 (6 percent) of the 477 patients were found to be infected with the new _Anaplasma_ species according to nested PCR. The nucleotide sequences amplified from all positive samples were identical to each other, and to the corresponding sequences detected in goats. _A. capra_ was also detected in 3 percent of _Ixodes persulcatus_ and none of 181 _Haemaphysalis concinna_ ticks, suggesting _I. persulcatus_ as a vector.

The disease caused by _A. capra_ presented with an undifferentiated influenza-like illness, including fever, headache, malaise, dizziness, and chills. Li et al noted several features of _A. capra_ infection that differ from _A. phagocytophilum_ infection (also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis, or HGA): morulae (intracytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions of anaplasma) were not seen in peripheral blood samples; leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased hepatic aminotransferase concentrations were uncommon; and skin rash was more common rash and 3 patients had an eschar. As with _A. phagocytophilum_ infection, patients with _A. capra_ infection responded to doxycycline therapy.

To exclude other tick-borne infections, Li et al did PCR or real-time PCR for _A. phagocytophilum_, _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ , spotted fever group rickettsia, _Babesia_ spp, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato, _Francisella tularensis_ , severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. All 28 patients with _A. capra_ infection were negative for these pathogens.

Mudanjiang is a prefecture-level city, located 248 km (154 mi) from Vladivostok, Russia, with a population of 2.8 million people in 2010, in southernmost Heilongjiang Province (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudanjiang). Heilongjiang province is located in northeastern China and borders Jilin Province to the south, Inner Mongolia to the west, and Russia to the north and east. - Mod.ML
