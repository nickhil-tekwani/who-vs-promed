"Pig Fever" is sweeping through the expanding Chinese swine industry,
according to swine veterinarians who have traveled there this fall
[2006].
University of Nottingham, England swine veterinarians Steven McOrist
and Stan Done observed the outbreak firsthand during a recent visit
to China's swine veterinary centers.
China's hog industry is "rapidly consolidating" on a scale similar to
that in the U.S., McOrist says. This includes the segmentation of
farrowing and finishing, with 500- to 1000-head sow barns and
"routine off-site finishing" popping up around Chinese cities.
Comprising a possible combination of Porcine Reproductive and
Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and
other diseases, this year's "Pig Fever" outbreak has swept through
this growing number of Chinese finishing facilities, resulting in
more than one million culls.
"Clinical signs were predominant in finishers and consisted of
lethargy, reduced or loss of appetite, high fever and deaths, with
occasional coughing only. Pigs and photos we examined also indicated
generalized blue skin discoloration in some affected pigs," McOrist
says. "Diagnostic tests we assessed from reliable centers showed
active PRRS and PCV2 infections, with common secondary _Pasteurella_
infections. Many of the affected farms were also positive for hog
cholera infections."
The presence of other disease pathogens in general could have created
conditions favorable for the development of a more severe strain of
PRRS, McOrist adds.
"One likely situation is that a more acute and lethal form of PRRS,
not unlike the previous SAMS (Swine Abortion and Mortality Syndrome)
outbreaks in the U.S.A., has now emerged in China, and this is the
published suggestion of the Chinese authorities," he says. "It is
also possible that 'normal' PRDC (Porcine Respiratory Disease
Complex) and PCVAD outbreaks on affected farms had become complicated
by active hog cholera."
Controls have been introduced in an effort to control the outbreak
that has claimed more than one million swine deaths in the past year.
McOrist urges heightened observation and intensive treatment for
swine populations where symptoms of porcine respiratory diseases are
observed.
"Control was being attempted through increased PRRS vaccinations, but
few other noteworthy suggestions were apparent," McOrist observes.
"[Swine practitioners and producers] are urged to be vigilant for
more lethal PRRS cases."
