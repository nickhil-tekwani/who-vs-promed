Mecca pilgrims brought back cholera-infected water
French health authorities said on Friday that traces of cholera [presumably
small numbers of cholera bacilli - Mod.ES were detected in water brought
back to France by local Moslems who recently returned from the Haj
pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
The disclosure follows the discovery in recent weeks of 14 cases of
meningitis, four of them fatal, among returning pilgrims.
The regional health authority in this region of eastern France said it had
decided to check the quality of 2700 litres (700 gallons)of water, brought
back from Mecca in 10
large barrels, and said a lab check uncovered the [contaminants.
The water was brought back by a local Moslem association for distribution
to members of the large Moslem community in the Alsace who were unable to
travel to Mecca for the annual pilgrimage.
The health authority called on local Moslems not to drink water brought
back individually by pilgrims, as is often the case according to tradition
for those unable to travel to Mecca personally.
