Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus were recently found in the Arava and Gilboa regions of Israel, according to a statement by the Environmental Protection Ministry on Wednesday [19 Aug 2020]. The Environmental Protection Ministry asked the Eilot and Gilboa regional councils to monitor the situation and carry out immediate pest control if necessary.

The virus-carrying mosquitoes were found during standard monitoring operations by the ministry in July [2020].

West Nile Virus is transferred by mosquitoes to humans. It takes about 7-14 days for those bitten by infected mosquitoes to develop symptoms, including, fever, headaches, weakness, joint and muscle pain, inflammation of the eyelid, rashes, and occasionally nausea and diarrhea.

"Mosquito pests develop in the summer when temperatures are high and there is stagnant water. Such events will increase in frequency in the coming years, as climate change worsens," said the ministry in a statement. "It is important to avoid sewers and stagnant water accumulation, and we call on the authorities to urgently address places where pests are detected, and also call on the public to be vigilant and take all measures to prevent bites and mosquito pests."

The Environmental Protection Ministry recommends avoiding allowing standing water, using devices and sprays to repel mosquitoes, wearing clothing that covers most of your skin, turning on fans inside your home, and setting up mosquito nets.

[This report alerts the general public and public health officials that the West Nile virus (WNV) transmission is now underway, and precautions to avoid mosquito bites should be taken. The species of positive mosquitoes is not given, but another report indicates that the available information states they are _Culex pipiens_, a known vector of the virus. The virus in mosquitoes is acquired from birds.

Human cases of WNV infection are not new in Israel, and the virus is endemic there, with 40-160 cases reported annually. As Mod.AS previously noted, "Clinical WNF cases were initially suspected in Israel in 1941; the virus was isolated and identified in 1951 during an extensive outbreak, which recurred in 1952-1953. WNF [West Nile fever] in Israel is seasonal, recurring annually. During 2017, a total of 39 human cases and 3 cases in horses were reported. According to 22 Aug 2018 information, the number of human cases this year [2018] is about twice the number during the same period in 2017." (See West Nile virus (22): Middle East (Israel) 20180824.5984197.)

Mod.UBA previously noted, "One of the primary routes of WNV transmission is via migrating birds, and Israel is located on a central migratory path between Africa and Eurasia (Leshem Y, Yom-Tov Y. Routes of migrating soaring birds in Israel. International J Avian Sci. 1998; 140: 41-52). Most West Nile fever (WNF) cases reported in recent years were among residents of the coastal plain (Bassal R, Shohat T, Kaufman Z, et al. The seroprevalence of West Nile Virus in Israel: A nationwide cross-sectional study. PLoS One. 2017; 12(6): e0179774. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0179774; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179774).

"Diverse WNV lineages, clades, and clusters have been isolated from mosquitoes in Israel during the past 15 years, and the Mediterranean subtype of WNV lineage 1 has been found to permanently circulate in the region (Lustig Y, Hindiyeh M, Orshan L, et al. Mosquito surveillance for 15 years reveals high genetic diversity among West Nile Viruses in Israel. J Infect Dis. 2016; 213: 1107-14. pmid:26597260; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/213/7/1107/2912151)." (See West Nile virus (19): Middle East (Israel) mosquitoes positive 20180819.5973174.)

A nationwide cross-sectional study by Bassal, et al., reported high (11.1%) seroprevalence of WNV in Israel in 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179774).

There have been equine WNV cases in Israel in the past. There is a vaccine available for equine animals but not for humans. Vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only preventive measures that can be taken for people. - Mod.TY
