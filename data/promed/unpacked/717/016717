PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2011 (03)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 9 Mar
2011 has increased by one to 171. A total of 4 definite/probable
patients remain alive so the total number of definite or probable vCJD
cases becomes 175.

Although a new case of vCJD has been identified in 2011, the overall
picture is still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases
were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the
year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004,
5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, and
1 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 9 Mar 2011], there have been 27 referrals,
11 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 1 case of GSS, 1 case of familial CJD,
1 case of vCJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990 there have been 2758 referrals, 1216
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 171 cases of vCJD, 65 cases of iatrogenic
CJD, 83 cases of familial CJD, and 44 of GSS.

During the 1st 2 months of 2011, there were 290 referrals, 3
confirmed fatal cases of sporadic CJD, and none of familial CJD,
iatrogenic CJD, or vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD have been recorded
in France since records began in 1992. There was 1 case in 1996, 1 in
2000, 1 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in

Cumulative data 1 Jan 2010 to 31 October 2010
---------------------------------------------
During the 10 month period 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Oct 2010, there were 333
referrals, 213 of whom were classified as prion disease cases,
comprising 158 cases of sporadic CJD, 33 of familial CJD, and none of
iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

Overall of 3831 referrals examined since screening began in 1996 or
thereabouts, diagnosis is still pending in 18 cases, and another 18
cases have been considered inconclusive. [This is a measure of the
difficulty in achieving unequivocal diagnoses. - Mod.CP]

During the same period a total of 2265 prion disease cases have been
screened, a figure which includes 23 (22 during 2010) cases with type
determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. 3 cases of vCJD recorded in the USA during the same period
have been attributed to infection in the UK in 2 cases, and in Saudi
Arabia in the other.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) biannual update (2011/1)
--------------------------------------------------------
This 6 monthly report provides an update on reports of incidents of
potential iatrogenic (healthcare acquired) exposure to CJD, and on the
National Anonymous Tonsil Archive. The data are correct as of 26 Jan
2011.

For numbers of CJD case reports, readers should consult data provided
by the national CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU), Edinburgh
(<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>, or part [1] of this Prion
Update). The latest yearly analysis of vCJD reports (onsets and
deaths) is also available from the NCJDSU website
[<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdqdec06.htm>].

Reports of incidents of potential iatrogenic exposure to CJD via
surgery: 2000 to 31 Dec 2010

A surgical incident occurs when a patient with or at risk of CJD has
undergone surgery without the appropriate infection control guidance
being followed [<http://www.dh.gov.uk/ab/ACDP/TSEguidance/index.htm>].
This could happen if a patient undergoes surgery during the incubation
period of CJD, or because information about CJD risk factors is not
available at the time of surgery. If this happens, surgical
instruments that may be contaminated with the infectious agent that
causes CJD, could pose a transmission risk when they are reused on
other patients.

Advice has been issued for the 20 surgical incidents that were
reported to the CJD Incidents Panel in 2010. The number of CJD
surgical incidents reported to the CJD Incidents Panel from 2000 to 31
Dec 2010 by the diagnosis of the index patient are shown in a table in
the original text. Overall, 45 per cent of surgical incidents result
from surgery on index cases diagnosed with sporadic CJD.

Information about the CJD Incidents Panel can be found on the HPA
website
[<http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1204031511121>].

The HPA report also contains detailed information on:
- surgical incidents resulting in at-risk patients: since 2000 to 31
Dec 2010, there have been 25 surgical incidents, in which the Panel
has advised that 158 patients should be considered to have an
increased risk of CJD.
- patient denotifications
- current "at-risk" patients resulting from surgical instruments:
there are 12 surgical incidents in which 120 patients are still
considered to be at risk of CJD.

Currently, 78 of these at-risk patients have been notified that they
are at risk of CJD. Local decisions have been taken not to notify 4
patients in these incidents. The Panel is currently advising on one
other incident in which approximately 18 at-risk patients (one of whom
is known to have died) are to be advised that they have an increased
risk of CJD.
- reports of blood incidents 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2010: the diagnosis
in 2009 of a vCJD case, who had previously received blood
transfusions, resulted in 10 individuals being identified as alive and
at risk of vCJD. 2 of these individuals had donated blood to the case,
and 8 others had received blood components from these 2 donors. 9 of
these patients were notified of their exposure and asked to follow
public health advice. A local decision was taken not to notify the
10th recipient.
- monitoring of patients "at increased risk" of CJD: the CJD
Incidents Panel and the ACDP [Advisory Committee on Dangerous
Pathogens] TSE Working Group have identified a range of individuals
and groups who may have been exposed to an increased risk of CJD as a
consequence of their medical care. The risks of iatrogenic CJD
transmission to these different individuals are very uncertain, but
potentially devastating. The CJD Incidents Panel has advised that
these individuals are informed of their risk and asked to follow
public health precautions to avoid transmitting the infection to
others.
- 6 monthly update on the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive -- end of
January 2011: the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive (NATA) has
received a total of 91 083 tonsil pairs up to the end of January 2011
from hospitals in England and Scotland, about 17 419 of which are from
the birth cohort of in which most vCJD cases have arisen (1961-1985).
A further 3000 tonsil pairs have been received from the Medical
Research Council Prion Unit at UCL Institute for Neurology, National
Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Therefore the total number of
tonsil pairs in the archive as at end of January was 94 083. The
number of collection forms that were completed but no tonsil tissue
collected was 2 509 (1 643 due to patient objection and 871 due to
clinical pathology being requested).

[5] Prions in peripheral tissue

[ref: Andreoletti O, Orge L, Benestad SL et al: Atypical/Nor98
scrapie infectivity in sheep peripheral tissues PLoS Pathog. 2011;
7(2): e1001285. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001285]
---------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Atypical/Nor98 scrapie was first identified in 1998 in Norway. It is
now considered as a worldwide disease of small ruminants and currently
represents a significant part of the detected transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE) cases in Europe. Atypical/Nor98 scrapie cases
were reported in ARR/ARR sheep, which are highly resistant to BSE and
other small ruminants TSE agents. The biology and pathogenesis of the
Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in its natural host is still poorly
understood. However, based on the absence of detectable abnormal PrP
in peripheral tissues of affected individuals, human and animal
exposure risk to this specific TSE agent has been considered low.

In this study we demonstrate that infectivity can accumulate, even if
no abnormal PrP is detectable, in lymphoid tissues, nerves, and
muscles from natural and/or experimental Atypical/Nor98 scrapie cases.
Evidence is provided that, in comparison to other TSE agents, samples
containing Atypical/Nor98 scrapie infectivity could remain PrPSc
negative. This feature will impact detection of Atypical/Nor98 scrapie
cases in the field, and highlights the need to review current
evaluations of the disease prevalence and potential transmissibility.

Finally, an estimate is made of the infectivity loads accumulating in
peripheral tissues in both Atypical/Nor98 and classical scrapie cases
that currently enter the food chain. The results obtained indicate
that dietary exposure risk to small ruminants TSE agents may be higher
than commonly believed.

Author summary
--------------
Following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis and the
identification of its zoonotic properties, a sanitary policy has been
implemented based on both eradication of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE) in food-producing animals and exclusion of
known infectious materials from the food chain.

Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a prion disease of small ruminants
identified worldwide. Currently it represents a significant part of
the TSE cases detected in Europe. The restricted tissue distribution
of Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in its natural host and the low
detected prevalence of secondary cases in affected flocks meant that
it is believed to be a poorly transmissible disease. This has led to
the view that Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a spontaneous disorder for
which human and animal exposure risk remains low.

In this study we demonstrate that in affected individuals,
Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent can disseminate in lymphoid tissues,
nerves, and muscles, challenging the idea that it is a
brain-restricted infectious agent. Evidence for the deficiencies in
the current methods applied for monitoring Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is
provided that would indicate an underestimation in the prevalence in
the general population and in the affected flocks. These elements
challenge the hypothesis on the biology of this recently identified
TSE agent.

commonly believed. - Mod.AS]

[6] Taiwan: suspected case statement

Department of Health censured for downplaying probable human mad cow
disease death
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) was censured by the Control Yuan [see
comment below] on Tuesday [15 Feb 2011] for downplaying a probable
case of death from [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) last year
[2010]. The top government watchdog said the incident indicates that
the DOH lacks a flexible mechanism to guide the release of information
on major diseases. The way the DOH handled the incident was
questionable because it failed to clear up the truth or disperse
people's doubts about the case, the Control Yuan said.

A Taiwanese man, who lived in the United Kingdom [UK] from 1989 to
1997, died in May 2010 from what appeared to be [variant] CJD, a
disease linked to eating tissue from cattle infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy [BSE], or mad cow disease. The patient, who
began to show symptoms such as memory loss and hypersomnia, was
reported to health authorities as a suspected CJD case in March 2009.
While the man's family refused to give permission for an autopsy, a
medical team determined that it was an "extremely likely case" of
[variant] CJD based on his MRI and EEG [magnetic resonance imaging and
electroencephalograms]. However, the DOH did not publish the details
until 8 Dec 2010, 6 months after his death and after the case had been
reported by local media.

According to the Control Yuan, the DOH chose to gloss over the
incident because at the time it was first reported to the health
authorities in March 2009, Taiwan was negotiating sensitive beef trade
issues with the United States. An investigation by the Control Yuan
shows that the DOH never notified the National Security Council --
which was leading the Taiwan-US beef trade talks -- about the
suspected CJD case.

This gave people the impression that the DOH's decision on whether to
release disease information was based solely on "political
considerations," the Control Yuan said.

[The Control Yuan, one of the 5 branches of the Republic of China
government in Taipei, is an investigatory agency that monitors the
other branches of government. It may be compared to the Court of
Auditors of the European Union, the Government Accountability Office
of the United States, or a standing commission for administrative
inquiry (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Yuan>).

This suspected case of vCJD in Taiwan has been described in detail in
parts (4) and (5) of the ProMED-mail Prion disease update 2011 (01)
archive number 20110110.0119. Prion protein gene analysis showed that
the victim was homozygous for methionine at codon 129, but since the
victim's body was cremated it was not possible to confirm the
diagnosis by detection of a BSE-like prion. Diagnosis was based on
symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalograms. The
fact that the patient had been resident for a lengthy period in the
UK, however, was compatible with the diagnosis of vCJD. It is likely
that the patient contracted vCJD while in the UK and even if it this
information had been disclosed, it would not have been an impediment
to the beef trade talks between officials in Taiwan and the USA.
