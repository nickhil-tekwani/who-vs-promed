As several areas across the country battled flooding, yesterday [9 Nov 2022] health officials warned people against wading through floodwaters. This, as more leptospirosis cases have been reported at hospitals recently. Endocrinologist Dr Joel Teelucksingh told Guardian Media that he has noted a spike in people seeking treatment for the bacterial disease.

"With respect to leptospirosis, we have been seeing patients being admitted to the nation's hospitals. This is an infection which is acquired, so from waters or soil that has become infected with dog or rat urine usually, but it may also be transmitted by pigs or cattle and disease. Bacteria enters into the skin or mucous membranes of the human being, and it lives on soil, or in water for perhaps weeks or months," Dr Teelucksingh said.

Guardian Media reached out to Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh to confirm the rise in cases. Deyalsingh promised to check with the Accident and Emergency Departments before commenting.

However, the Ministry of Health issued a statement yesterday [9 Nov 2022] to advise the public to protect themselves against leptospirosis. It urged people to wear protective clothing when venturing into flood waters as well as inspect food carefully and discard any open containers, even sealed packaging such as flour or cereal.

The ministry also noted that the symptoms, which are high fever, headaches, chills, muscle pains, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), rash and diarrhoea, can be mistaken for other diseases. It may take between 2 days and 4 weeks before a person exhibits symptoms.

Teelucksingh added, "There is a minority of individuals infected, who potentially may have life-threatening complications of leptospirosis, in which there may be liver damage to the kidneys and the lining of the brain. And this will cause meningitis. The use of antibiotics -- because it is a potentially treatable infection, particularly in the early stages -- you will be monitored, particularly in terms of blood investigations, your urine output, and if necessary, you may even have to be sent for dialysis."

People are advised to visit the nearest health centre or their doctor immediately if they believe they may have leptospirosis.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to urine of infected animals or to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that, when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). - Mod.ML
