A wild rabbit found [13 Jun 2018] in Tinley Park [Cook county] has tested positive for tularemia. Cook County Animal and Rabies Control urges residents to avoid touching live or dead wildlife.

Tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The bacterium is present in some wildlife in northeast Illinois. Some animals, such as wild rabbits, muskrats, and beavers, may be carriers, but are unaffected by the bacterium. Generally, wild animals do not exhibit signs.

A person can be infected with tularemia through a tick bite or exposure to infected animals, such as rabbits.

To avoid exposure:
- do not handle wild animals;
- keep pets away from wild animals;
- be alert for dead rabbits, especially when mowing the grass. Do not mow over a dead rabbit;
- if you find a dead rabbit, call Cook County Animal and Rabies Control, (708) 974-6140;
- if you find a sick rabbit or other animal in your yard, leave it alone and keep pets away, then contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator;

Symptoms of disease in humans include: fever, flu-like symptoms; rashes or red lesions on skin.

In pets, symptoms can include: fever, enlarged lymph nodes in the head and neck, abdominal pain, jaundice, lethargy.

If you or your pet experience these symptoms, seek medical attention and contact Cook County Animal and Rabies Control at (708) 974-6140.

[Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread through contact with infected animals, or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
