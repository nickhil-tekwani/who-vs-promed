The manager of the analysis and food technology Laboratory at the
School of Veterinary and Animal Science at the Universidad Autnoma
Benito Juarez de Oaxaca (UABJO), Isabel Jimnez Seres, recommended
that the general population cook their pork, after (discovering) a
resurgence of trichinosis.

The researcher said that this parasite, which can be fatal to humans,
was believed extinct in Oaxaca, however, following an investigation,
it has been detected in pig meat purchased in the Maihuatian de
Porfirio Diaz market.

Dr. Soledad Jimenez Janet Jimenez, in a thesis supported by the
Hospital Siglo XXI, Mexican Institute of Social Security, reviewed
the results of samples taken in different markets and could detect
the presence of the parasite in the meat sold in these centers of
commerce.

The specialist said that health officials no longer believed that
trichinosis existed in the state, but the discovery by the Veterinary
School UABJO proved otherwise.

Seres Jimenez reported that in Oaxaca, the largest animal product
consumed is pork, so that health authorities should take action on
the matter, and that they had been already notified of the outcome of
the investigation.

She commented that this parasite causes joint pains, while other
(symptoms) are confused with symptoms of gastritis; there is no
nausea and diarrhea, and, as it is believed that trichinosis no
longer exists in Oaxaca, doctors have a hard time finding the right
treatment to combat it.

Unfortunately, stated Jimnez Seres, the parasite is detected
accurately when people die, and therefore, she considers that the
Ministry of Health should pay attention to the discovery that they
made. She mentioned that there is no municipal (control) in Miahuatn,
and this could be the main problem, because in Oaxaca, 90 percent of
pigs are raised in backyards under low hygienic conditions.

In this regard, she recommended that consumers cook pork to more than
72 C, while they would continue their research working with the
health authorities.

Trichinosis is a disease caused by eating undercooked meat containing
cysts of the nematode _Trichinella spiralis_, a parasite that can be
found in meat such as pork, bear, fox, rat, horse and lion.

Wild animals, especially carnivores or omnivores, are considered a
possible source of roundworm disease. When a person eats meat from an
infected animal, Trichinella cysts enter the intestines and grow into
adult worms.

The worms produce other worms that move through the intestinal wall
into the bloodstream. These organisms tend to invade muscle tissues,
including the heart and the diaphragm (the breathing muscle under the
lungs), and can also affect the lungs and brain.

[The article states that Trichinella was believed to be extinct in
Oaxaca, but probably the statement refers to domestic pigs alone.
Trichinellae most probably are still found in wild animals and may be
transmitted to domestic pigs (Masuoka PM et al. Predicted geographic
ranges for North American sylvatic Trichinella species. J Parasitol.
2009;95:829-37). - Mod.EP]
