[Michael E. Nesemann, the US Foreign Service Regional Medical Officer
based in Warsaw, and covering the Baltics, has forwarded the report
reproduced below. He added the comment that: "On returning from
Tallinn, where our Embassy nurse told me of the Estonian Public
Health Service's announcement that they had seen a significant
increase in animal rabies over the last year or so. Our locally
hired Embassy doctor in Vilnius had said the same thing several
months ago, and then today I received the following electronic
clipping from our acting Deputy Chief of Mission in Vilnius. I am
wondering whether anyone out there has more data on Baltic rabies or
ideas as to why it may be seemingly increasing." Consequently
ProMED-mail is posting this report as a "Request for information". -

Lithuania: 6-year-old Boy Dies of Rabies
------------------------------------------
Experts have confirmed that the cause of death of a 6-year-old boy
who died in Vilnius last week was rabies. Cases of deaths from rabies
in Lithuania are registered every 3 or 4 years, the Public Health
Care Service of the Health Ministry has reported. According to the
press release, a boy who lived in Alytus fell ill at the end of
February 2004, he had a cold and fever. The boy who was brought to
the Clinical Hospital of Infectious. Diseases of Republican Vilnius
University Hospital died on 10 Mar 2004. Test results received from
the National Veterinary Laboratory a few days later confirmed the boy
died of rabies.
Specialists of Vilnius, Alytus, and Prienai public health centers are
currently conducting an epidemiological analysis, trying to find out
whether the child had contacts with domestic or wild animals that
could have hurt him and infected with rabies virus. According to the
press release, 1108 cases of [wild and domestic animal] rabies were
recorded in Lithuania during 2003, which is 175 cases more than in
2002. Rabies was mostly spread among wild animals, 796 cases, (71.8
percent), with another 312 rabies cases (28.2 percent) registered
among domestic animals. Nearly 12 000 persons bitten by domestic or
wild animals consulted doctors in 2003, 7016 of whom were vaccinated
against rabies.
