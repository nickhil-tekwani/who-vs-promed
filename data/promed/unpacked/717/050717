The fourth likely case of mad cow disease in Denmark has been discovered by
the Danish food authorities.
After 2 preliminary tests have returned positive, the third and final test
is expected to verify the case. The result will be published on 22 Aug
2001. If confirmed, this will reportedly be the first case of mad cow
disease to be verified since the European Union introduced tough new tests
on all cows aged over 30 months.
The first case of mad cow disease in Denmark was discovered last February
in Northern Jutland, and 2 more cases were found in Jutland earlier this
year. This case, if confirmed, would be the first on Zealand, reported DR,
the Danish broadcasting corporation.

Denmark had an imported case in 1992. The rest are this year and last,
which suggests that there may be more in the pipeline. - Mod.MHJ
