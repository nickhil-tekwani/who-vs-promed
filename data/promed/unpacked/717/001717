[1] South Africa: 3rd wave
Date: Sun 4 Jul 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/04/health-service-buckling-as-third-coronavirus-wave-fuelled-by-delta-variant-sweeps-across-south-africa


The health system in Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city, is being overwhelmed by a massive wave of infections driven by the Delta variant, the winter in the southern hemisphere and a faltering vaccine campaign.

The new variant is now dominant in Africa's most developed country, where the official death toll is now more than 60 000, though excess mortality statistics suggest more than 170 000 may have died from COVID.

Across Africa, the Delta variant is fueling an aggressive 3rd wave of infections, with case numbers climbing faster than all earlier peaks, according to the World Health Organization.

WHO experts warned last week that infections across Africa have increased for 6 consecutive weeks, up by 25% last week, reaching 202 000 positive cases. South Africa accounted for more than half of Africa's cases last week, although it is one of the few countries where testing is extensive. On [1 Jul 2021] alone more than 21 000 cases were registered.

Authorities in South Africa have been unable to stem the spread of the new variant, only moving to impose new restrictions after a massive wave of infections ravaged the country's economic heartland.

President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week that the country's health system was "buckling" as he imposed a 2-week ban on all gatherings, indoors and outdoors, along with the sale of alcohol and travel to or from the worst hit areas of the country, such as Gauteng, its most populous and economically productive province. An extended curfew was also imposed, and schools shut early for holidays.

"We have overcome 2 decisive waves but now we have a new hill to climb, a great challenge, a massive resurgence of infections... a devastating wave," he said.

Anger and frustration have grown after repeated promises to accelerate the faltering vaccination campaign have been broken. Only 3 million jabs have been delivered to a population of 60 million. Acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said that delivery of vaccines would gather pace in coming weeks, with all those over 50, as well as police, teachers and soldiers, being targeted.

However, a series of corruption scandals involving COVID spending has undermined trust in the government. The health minister has been suspended pending an investigation into corruption allegations.

The surge in infections has laid bare the weakness of the public health services, with hospitals overflowing and shortages of oxygen, but above all a lack of trained personnel. The much-publicised arrival of military doctors has been described by health practitioners as "a very late drop in a very big ocean".

Last [Thu 1 Jul 2021] the South African Medical Association threatened to take the government to court because scores of new junior doctors cannot find placements despite staff shortages.

The vaccine drive has been halted over weekends and public holidays to rest health workers but also because there is no budget for overtime, officials have admitted.

In many parts of the country volunteer organisations are filling gaps. Some patients in Johannesburg who have failed to find a bed on a public ward are being cared for at a makeshift COVID ward set up by a Muslim charity in the city.

"We don't see dead people. The funeral services see dead people. We see death. That's the difference. We see death happening. We try to get to patients on time but unfortunately we can't always do that," said Anees Kara, a volunteer doctor.

Studies of blood donors released on [Fri 2 Jul 2021] have revealed that almost half of the population may have already been infected by the virus, though the 3rd wave appears set to be the worst yet.

The WHO has said the speed and scale of Africa's 3rd wave is unprecedented. "The rampant spread of more contagious variants pushes the threat to Africa up to a whole new level. More transmission means more serious illness and more deaths, so everyone must act now and boost prevention measures to stop an emergency becoming a tragedy," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.

A total of 8 vaccines have been approved for the WHO emergency-use listing, but shipments to Africa have, in effect, dried up. "While supply challenges grind on, dose-sharing can help plug the gap. We are grateful for the pledges made by our international partners, but we need urgent action on allocations. Africa must not be left languishing in the throes of its worst wave yet," said Moeti.

Only 15 million people - 1.2% of the African population - are fully vaccinated.

["South Africa has recorded over 2 million cases and 61 500 deaths so far during the pandemic, the data from the Department of Health showed, while 3.3 million people have been vaccinated -- about 5% of the population.

"The low vaccination rate has resulted from a mixture of bad luck and bureaucratic failures. The government had to destroy 2 million contaminated Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine doses earlier this year 2021, while efforts to replace them have run up against global supply bottlenecks.

"President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticised what he called global "vaccine apartheid," with rich countries with plentiful vaccine supplies hoarding them while poorer countries wait. To tackle this problem, South Africa on Sat 3 Jul 2021 approved China's Sinovac vaccine against COVID-19, as growing evidence emerges of its effectiveness."

[2] USA (California): delta variant
Date: Sun 4 Jul 2021 7:04 PM
Source: Los Angeles Times [edited]
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-04/delta-variant-spreads-rapidly-now-california-most-dominant-strain-coronavirus-COVID-19


The highly infectious Delta has become California's most identified variant of the coronavirus, a troubling development that underscores its danger to unvaccinated populations.

New data released by the California Department of Public Health say 35.6% of coronavirus variants analyzed in June [2021] have been identified as Delta, which was first identified in India. That's a dramatic increase from May [2021], when Delta accounted for just 5.6% of analyzed coronavirus cases in California and was the state's 4th most identified variant.

Delta is now more widespread than the previous dominant strain, Alpha, which was first identified in the United Kingdom and accounted for 34.3% of analyzed coronavirus cases in June [2021]. Alpha was the state's most dominant strain in April and May [2021], outpacing the California variant, now known as Epsilon, which currently occurs in less than 2% of analyzed cases.

The rapid rise of Delta is prompting some public health officials to issue new warnings, urging more caution at a time when vaccinated people are putting away masks and getting back to normal life. Although those who have been fully vaccinated are believed to have high levels of protection, there is growing concern about the virus spreading among people who have not been inoculated.

Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have been ticking up in Los Angeles County, where some 4 million people, including 1.3 million who are not yet eligible, have not had a single dose of vaccine.

Delta might be twice as contagious as the initial variants of the coronavirus that spread rapidly around the globe last year [2020].

"The rapid increase in the Delta variant suggests that this strain is more easily transmitted between people than other strains circulating in California," the state Department of Public Health said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.

Delta is California's dominant variant [2021]:
Delta - May (5.6%), June (35.6%);
Alpha - May (58.0%), June (34.3%);
Gamma - May (11.5%), June (19.7%);
Iota - May (10.8%), June (6.6%)
[Source: California Department of Public Health]

"Nevertheless, there is evidence that vaccines available in the U.S. are effective against the Delta variant," state officials added.

Delta is also spreading rapidly nationwide. The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said recent data show that 25% of analyzed coronavirus cases nationwide are of the Delta variant. In some areas of the country, nearly half of analyzed cases are Delta.

By contrast, from [9 to 22 May 2021], Delta made up less than 3% of analyzed coronavirus samples nationwide.

There are reports of rapidly increasing Delta cases confirmed in Los Angeles County too. The county started seeing upticks in early April [2021]. In May [2021], the county had fewer than 20 identified Delta cases a week, but by June [2021], there were 60 -- 80.

For the week that ended 19 Jun, Delta made up nearly 50% of all cases analyzed in L.A. County; 4 weeks earlier, it accounted for less than 5%.

Delta has been identified in 245 coronavirus cases so far in L.A. County, with early clusters identified in Palmdale and Lancaster. A total of 14 cases of Delta occurred among residents of a single household.

The increase in the proportion of identified Delta cases comes as COVID-19 hospitalizations have started to rise again in L.A. County and across the state. The number of Californians hospitalized for COVID-19 fell to 915 on [12 Jun 2021] -- the lowest it has been since the state began tracking cases. By [Sat 3 Jul 2021], there were 1097 COVID-19 patients in hospitals statewide, a 20% increase.

COVID-19 hospitalizations in L.A. County hit a record low of 212 on [12 Jun 2021]. But on [Sat 3 Jul 2021], there were 284 hospitalized patients -- a 34% increase, though far below the peak of 8098 during the worst days of the pandemic.

State officials say they don't expect California's hospitals to once again be overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients -- there are simply too many vaccinated people around to imagine such a scenario.

But officials noted that it remains crucial that more Californians get vaccinated.

"We know our hospitalizations are creeping up -- and most of the patients are unvaccinated. We also know the science is clear -- getting vaccinated protects you AND those around you. Get vaccinated," Gov. Gavin Newsom tweeted.

His comments echoed those by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-diseases expert. He pointed to recent studies showing that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant and 96% effective against hospitalization after 2 doses were administered. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not approved for use in the U.S. but uses similar technology to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, was found to be 92% effective against hospitalization.

"The best way to protect yourself against the virus and its variants is to be fully vaccinated. It works," Fauci said.

Some officials, however, have said the science isn't settled on whether some vaccinated people could be at higher risk of contracting the Delta variant and passing it to other people, while not getting severely sick themselves.

That was the reasoning behind the L.A. County Department of Public Health's latest recommendation that even fully vaccinated people return to wearing masks in indoor public settings until more definitive information emerges about Delta.

L.A. County officials expressed worry over a recent doubling of new coronavirus cases of all variants. From [25 Jun to 1 Jul 2021], the county reported about 2600 new cases; the previous week's sum was about 1100.

"Whenever you see a doubling of cases over a very short time, we all need to pay attention to that, and we all need to think about what else we could be doing that may help us get back to reducing the spread," said L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer.

She too noted that fully vaccinated people are highly protected against serious illness and death from COVID-19, including from the Delta variant. But, she added, "the big unknown is: Can you become infected -- have mild illness -- and go ahead and spread that infection to others?"

Until more information comes out about that, Ferrer requested that L.A. County residents mask up in indoor settings where vaccination statuses may be unknown. "If mask wearing indoors provides that extra layer of protection, I think it's worth it, while we get more questions answered about the variant, and we get more people vaccinated."

Others who have suggested that even vaccinated people wear masks include Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the government of Israel, the World Health Organization and health officials in the St. Louis area.

["Coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations are worsening for Los Angeles County's Black residents, a troubling sign less than a month after California fully reopened its economy.

"The coronavirus case rate over a 2 week period for Black residents rose 18% between mid-May (2021) and mid-June (2021) but declined 4% for Latino residents, 6% for white residents and 25% for Asian Americans.

"And the hospitalization rate for Black residents -- who are less likely than other racial and ethnic groups to be vaccinated -- grew by 11% while declining for Asian American residents by 12%, Latino residents by 29% and white residents by 37%.

"According to the most recent data, Black residents in L.A. County are roughly 3 times as likely as white residents to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, to be newly hospitalized with COVID-19 or to die."

While the L.A. Times article does not analyze the increase in cases by race, according to KTLA, this single factor is apparently closely tied in to the surge being observed. COVID is bringing out the disparity between black and white residents of LA. - Mod.LK]

[3] India: mortality rate
Date: Mon 5 Jul 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stor Mon 05 Jul 2021ies/QVR9J9DWRGG0


Mortality "significantly" increased in the 2nd COVID-19 wave in India, according to a new study, pointing to the possibility that the delta variant which triggered an explosive growth in local infections may also be more deadly.

The higher incidence of deaths was seen in all age groups except those below 20 years of age, said a study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research by researchers led by Gunjan Kumar. "The circulating variants in the 2nd wave of COVID-19, B.1.1.7 and B.1.617, have been debated to be more transmissible as well as more virulent," it said, referring to the alpha and delta variants that were first detected in the U.K. and India, respectively.

The delta variant is known to be highly contagious. If it's also proven to be more fatal, it would force pandemic-weary governments to double down on public health measures. The mutated strain was the main driver behind India's devastating 2nd wave that led to daily infections of more than 400 000 in early May [2021], swamping its hospitals and crematoriums, and is now in almost 100 countries. It has already complicated the U.K.'s reopening plans, forced Australian states into lockdowns and is on course to become the dominant strain in the U.S.

The "explosive" nature of India's recent virus wave led to a large number of people being affected in a short span of time, the study said. "This has put the health infrastructure under pressure, making hospitalization possible for only more severe patients, which could also explain the higher mortality among the hospitalized patients," it said.

The study analyzed data collected under the National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 and studied clinical features of patients during these 2 successive waves. Fever was the common symptom between both waves.

A significantly higher proportion of patients complained of shortness of breath, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, required supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilation in the 2nd wave, according to the findings.

Entire families were wiped out in the latest wave, which gripped India sometime in March [2021] and peaked in early May [2021]. While India is racing to get its population vaccinated to curb a possible 3rd wave -- which some scientists believe could arrive within months -- it has so far managed to fully inoculate only 4.7% of its vast population, according to Bloomberg's vaccine tracker.

[4] Israel: Pfizer vaccination prevents severe illness
Date: Mon 5 Jul 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QVS63FT1UM0Z


Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine was less effective at keeping people from getting the coronavirus in Israel in recent weeks, but it continues to provide a strong shield against severe COVID-19, according to government data.

The vaccine protected 64% of people against the illness between [6 Jun 2021] and early July [2021], down from a previous 94%. The drop was observed as the delta variant was spreading in Israel, the Health Ministry said. It also coincided with the lifting of virus restrictions at the start of June [2021].

Despite the indications of increased infections, the data also showed the shot is protecting people from severe illness. Its effectiveness at preventing hospitalization fell to 93%, according to the Health Ministry, compared with at least 97% in an earlier government study.

Delta, which first emerged in India, is spreading around the globe as governments race to inoculate people. The mutation has forced some countries to delay or rethink plans to loosen curbs on businesses, activity and travel.

Pfizer spokeswoman Dervila Keane declined to comment on the data from Israel. She pointed to research showing the vaccine's continued protection against new mutations -- just slightly reduced in some cases. The evidence so far suggests that the vaccine "will continue to protect against these variants," she said.

Israel had one of the world's most effective coronavirus inoculation drives. About 57% of the population is now fully vaccinated. Many new COVID-19 cases are among vaccinated people, according to Ynet news service. Last [Fri 2 Jul 2021], 55% of the newly infected had been vaccinated, the website said. As of [Sun 4 Jul 2021], there were 35 serious cases of coronavirus out of a population of 9.3 million, compared with 21 on [19 Jun 2021].

The government plans to study vaccinated individuals who contracted the coronavirus, including factors such as age, pre-existing conditions and inoculation dates, in order to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine and the rate at which it wears off, the prime minister's office said.

The government is considering reinstating additional restrictions after restoring a mandate to wear masks indoors in public spaces. No decision has been made on recommending a 3rd dose of vaccine, the health ministry said.

Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has said people will likely need a 3rd dose within 12 months of getting fully protected.

[This ProMED post contains a series of reports addressing the resurgence of cases in many countries due to Delta variant. But it is reassuring that vaccinated individuals are generally protected against severe illness following infection. Those who remain unvaccinated are vulnerable to severe symptoms, and also present a risk to others who may not have been able to get vaccinated. Further the more the virus circulates, the greater the risk of new more virulent strains.

Vaccine effectiveness over time against the Delta variant will become clearer once the "study of vaccinated individuals who contracted the coronavirus, including age, pre-existing conditions and and inoculation dates" is available. - Mod.LK]
