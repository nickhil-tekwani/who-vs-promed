The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has published its report on the detection of serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus in the Balearic Islands.

The MAPA points out that the preliminary molecular studies carried out in the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LCV) of Algete on the virus indicate that the strain causing these outbreaks is similar to the one that affected the region in recent years, from the Balkans and Italy.

The report remarks that it is "therefore different from the virus present in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. In addition, in all cases, the affected animals are native to the Balearic Islands, and there have been no recent entries of animals in the farms affected," he adds.

In this way, they consider that the most likely hypothesis is the introduction of the virus by means of _Culicoides_ midges infected with the virus from other areas of the Mediterranean, as already happened in the previous outbreaks detected during the 1st decade of this century.

Likewise, the MAPA analyzes in the report the information regarding the detection of the bluetongue virus in the Balearic Islands. "The official veterinary services of the Government of the Balearic Islands have detected the circulation of serotype 4 of the Bluetongue virus in a sentinel bovine in a farm located in the municipality of Pollenca (Mallorca)," explains the ministry.

In this way, it points out that the sentinel farm, with a census of 4 bovines and 19 sheep, participates in the National Bluetongue Surveillance Program implemented in Spain.

The Balearic archipelago is located in an area so far free of the disease but considered a risk area within the framework of said program, so that it is undergoing reinforced surveillance against the disease.

Additionally, 9 clinical suspicions have been reported in sheep in farms located in the same municipality of Pollenca, and in those of Campanet and Inca, whose animals have also been positive for the bluetongue virus by serology, as well as by PCR, the latter having been also confirmed by the LCV of Algete, the national reference laboratory for the disease in Spain.

The last bluetongue outbreak in the Balearic Islands was reported in November 2003, on the island of Menorca. The Balearic Islands obtained the recognition of free against the disease after 2 years without outbreaks following the last declaration.

Given the verification of the circulation of the virus, the veterinary authorities have proceeded to establish a restriction zone around the outbreak that includes all the islands of the Balearic archipelago (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera), where prevention measures are being reinforced [by] surveillance and control in the area.

In addition, mandatory vaccination against bluetongue virus serotype 4 will be instituted for all sheep and bovine animals older than 3 months of age, and restrictions have been established on the movement of animals of species sensitive to the disease; passive surveillance has been reinforced, recalling the obligation to report any suspicion, as well as the disinsection of farms.

This new restriction zone around the outbreaks will be published in the coming days by means of a resolution.

"It is recalled that blue tongue is a viral disease that is transmitted by [midges] of the genus _Culicoides_, and that affects ruminants of different species, but in no case affects man," they conclude from the MAPA.

At the end of June [2021], the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the Balearic Islands reported a positive case of bluetongue on the island of Mallorca, in the municipality of Pollenca. Following the protocols of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department collected the samples from various farms during the weekend and sent them to the Central Veterinary Laboratory of Algete.

Now, this Thursday, 1 Jul [2021], the Minister of Agriculture, Mae de la Concha, has officially confirmed the presence of serotype 4 of bluetongue on the island of Mallorca and also the emergency for the rest of the islands of the archipelago.

In this sense, she has assured that an episode of bluetongue already took place in the Balearic Islands in 2000, which ended in 2005, for which she has affirmed that there is already previous experience that will help in the management of the outbreak.

The ministry explains that the bluetongue detected in the Balearic Islands in 2000 was serotype 2 of the virus, which was not controlled until 2003, when another serotype appeared, 4, which could not be controlled until 2005.

The councilor has added that at the moment there are 20 positives, 19 sheep and a cow, although she has pointed out that, as it is a disease transmitted by [midges], "the normal thing is that there are more cases." For this reason, she has urged to control the outbreak "as soon as possible."

To achieve this, the councilor has explained that a campaign to disinfect the locations where the vector can be found, as well as a mass vaccination campaign, will be launched.

"The good news is that after many efforts, we have vaccines for the entire [livestock] herd. In the case of sheep, they need one dose, and in the case of cows, they need 2. We have all these vaccines that we hope will be here next week," she indicated.

On the other hand, it has been reported that "50% of the animals that need these vaccines belong to the health defense associations; therefore, they can be vaccinated by the veterinarians of these associations, while the rest of the animals will be vaccinated by veterinary teams that are already being organized from the ministry."

"It is about vaccinating as soon as possible," said de la Concha, ensuring that there will be no mass animal cullings and that the Balearic government hopes that this outbreak will be resolved as soon as possible.

For his part, the general director of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development, Fernando Fernandez, highlighted the "professionalism" with which the administration is addressing the outbreak of bluetongue.

Fernandez has also pointed out that, although the virus has been detected in Mallorca, "the most prudent thing to do in order to act properly," in the opinion of the ministry, has been to declare an emergency in all the Balearic Islands.

And this emergency situation, as explained by the director general, allows starting vaccination on all islands and enables the movement of animals between islands, as well as carrying out a more effective prevention campaign.

In addition, due to "regional responsibility," Fernandez explained that the measure will help to stop the spread of the virus so that it does not reach the [Iberian] peninsula. Also, the general director has explained a series of measures that will be applied from the department to minimize the effects of the outbreak in the Balearic livestock sector.

Thus, during the press conference, the aspects related to the resolution that has been signed to declare the Balearic Islands as a bluetongue restriction zone were explained, which also establishes the sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the territory of the islands. The resolution, on the one hand, prohibits, in a precautionary manner, the movement and transport of live animals and reproductive products of the bovine, ovine, and goat species outside the Islands.

However, it is allowed, on the other hand, always with disinfected vehicles before loading, the transfer of animals of the aforementioned species to slaughterhouses, as well as the rest of movements, for example, to areas of pasture free of the presence of bluetongue. The initial duration of these measures will be one year.

The resolution, which will enter into force on the same day of publication in the official gazette of the Balearic Islands (BOIB), establishes a mandatory vaccination program for cattle and sheep against serotype 4 of the virus to prevent diffusion and spread. The resolution also implies declaring the actions and contracts to eradicate this disease of emergency.

Currently in the Balearic Islands, and according to the 2020 livestock census, there are 22 199 cows in 741 farms and 274 990 sheep in 4093 farms.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his above submissions.

Bluetongue virus serotype 4 (BTV4), which has been circulating intermittently throughout the Mediterranean basin for decades, is known to be highly pathogenic to susceptible sheep breeds. Cattle, though readily infected by the _Culicoides_ midge vector, undergo -- in most cases of BTV4 infections -- a subclinical course. On the other hand, sheep breeds of the Mediterranean islands, such as the White sheep breed of Mallorca and the Sardinian sheep, are known to be very susceptible with potentially high mortality rates. It is therefore of particular importance to vaccinate the sheep population of the Balearic Islands at the earliest, before the peak of the vector season. - Mod.AS
