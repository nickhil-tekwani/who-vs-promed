Ahmed Maher reports on the latest weapon in Islamic State's arsenal Iraqi officials have shown the BBC footage, which they say proves Islamic State (IS) militants are using chlorine gas in roadside bomb attacks.

The videos [available at the source URL above] show bomb disposal teams carrying out controlled explosions, which send plumes of orange smoke into the air. [Chlorine gas is typically a yellow-green color. The orange color in the video may be a sun reflection or desert haze or even a dye added to intentionally mislead people? - Mod.TG]

The bombs contain small concentrations of a chemical agent and in open ground are unlikely to be lethal.

Experts say they are designed to create fear rather than harm.

There have been multiple reports that IS has been deploying chlorine gas since late last year [2014], but Iraqi officials say their footage confirms its use.

Haider Taher, from the Iraq Bomb Disposal Team, said troops have defused dozens of devices containing chlorine as part of the offensive against the militants.

"They have resorted to this new method," he told the BBC. "They're putting chlorine inside these homemade roadside bombs, which is toxic for those that inhale it."

His team inadvertently exploded one of the weapons outside the embattled city of Tikrit in the north of Iraq 6 weeks ago. "Our throats were blocked, we couldn't breath. My ears felt enormous pressure... we were lucky a military ambulance was there to treat us," Mr Taher said.

Chlorine gas is classified as a "choking agent", burning the lungs when inhaled in large quantities. But it is nowhere near as dangerous as nerve gases.

It is instead designed to create fear and panic, according to chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton Gordon.

"It is a psychological thing, to not only get civilians in Tikrit worried, but also the Iraqi soldiers who are doing the bomb disposal here," he said.

Roadside bombs are cheap and easy to make in Iraq and are widely used by militants.

Although bomb disposal teams say they have encountered the small-scale use of chlorine, there is no evidence to suggest IS has accumulated a significant chemical weapons cache.

[Breathing small amounts of chlorine for short periods of time adversely affects the human respiratory system. Effects differ from coughing and chest pain, to water retention in the lungs. Chlorine irritates the skin, the eyes, and the respiratory system. These effects are not likely to occur at levels of chlorine that are normally found in the environment.

Human health effects associated with breathing or otherwise consuming small amounts of chlorine over long periods of time are not known. Some studies show that workers develop adverse effects from repeat inhalation exposure to chlorine, but others will not.

Chlorine was used during World War I as a choking (pulmonary) agent. During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
- Blurred vision
- Burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas.
- Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine
- Burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes
- Coughing
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled.
- Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours
- Nausea and vomiting
- Watery eyes
- Wheezing
Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to chlorine.

Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.

No antidote exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment consists of removing the chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care such as inhaled breathing treatments for wheezing in a hospital setting.

Although this BBC report indicates it is a chocking agent, it can nevertheless be dangerous and cause edema in the lungs and other serious health problems.
