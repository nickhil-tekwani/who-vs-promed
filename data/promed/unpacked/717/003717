An outbreak of a dangerous disease has been observed among animals in
the Kaluga region. The regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Surveillance of Consumer Rights and Human Welfare - Mod.NP] reported
that a focus of brucellosis among sheep has been registered in the
Tarusskiy district . The diagnosis has been established in 150
animals out of 300. Infected animals have been culled.
6 persons are undergoing medical examination. Distribution of milk
from the affected farm has been banned by veterinarians.

[Important details concerning the described outbreak are missing,
including the diagnostic procedure by which the focus was discovered.
Russia has not provided the periodic animal health reports required
according to OIE's international animal health code (6-month and
annual reports) for the years 2005 and 2006. In 2004, the status of
"Caprine and ovine brucellosis (excluding _B. ovis_)," which is OIE's
terminology for _B. melitensis_ in sheep and goats, was "Reported
present or known to be present;" 14 outbreaks were reported, and 1.1
million animals were vaccinated.
Traditionally, the disease is known to be endemic in southern parts
of Russia. Kaluga, however, is situated west of Moscow; see map at
<http://russiatrek.org/r_kaluga.shtml>.
Official information on the situation in Kaluga will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
