A 6th person, this time from Texas, has been sickened with the strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ linked to Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese, LLC.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Thursday [22 Aug 2013] that a 6th person has been infected in the outbreak. The number of ill persons identified includes 2 from Minnesota, and one each from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and now one from Texas. One of the 2 Minnesota victims died, and another person sickened was a pregnant woman, whose illness resulted in a miscarriage. All 6 ill persons were hospitalized.

On 3 Jul 2013, the Waterloo-based company recalled 3 varieties of soft cheese, including its Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles, made on 1 Jul 2013 or earlier due to possible _L. monocytogenes_ contamination. The products were distributed nationwide.

According to the CDC, a collaborative investigation is being conducted by local and state public health and regulatory agencies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration indicates that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses are the likely source of the outbreak.

Information about specific cheeses consumed is available for 5 of the 6 ill persons. Of those, all 5 either definitely or probably ate Les Freres cheese made by Crave Brothers before getting sick, according to the CDC.

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses were diagnosed range from 20 May to 7 Jul 2013. Ill persons range in age from 30 to 67 years, with a median age of 55 years, and 83 percent are female, according to the CDC. Clinical specimens that were collected after 10 Aug 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. It takes an average of 2-3 weeks.

Public health investigators used DNA "fingerprints" of _Listeria_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulse-field gel electrophoresis to identify cases of illness that may be part of the outbreak. The DNA fingerprint of the outbreak strain is typically associated with about 14 cases per year, even in the absence of a recognized outbreak, according to the CDC website.

Between 2-10 Jul 2013, the FDA conducted an inspection at the firm's processing facility in cooperation with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. During that inspection, the FDA collected a sample of Petit Frere with Truffles that was found to contain _Listeria monocytogenes_ with the same DNA fingerprint as the outbreak strain, the CDC reported.

Crave Brothers cheese stopped production, and the FDA and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture are monitoring corrective action being made by the firm.

About 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis are reported each year in the United States, and typically 3 or 4 outbreaks are identified and reported to the CDC annually. The organism can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese did not provide a comment on the one new outbreak.

[The report above adds one more case to the 5 cases of listeriosis previously posted (Listeriosis - USA: fatal, cheese, recall 20130710.1816187) in now 5 states with still one death (in Minnesota) and one miscarriage. The prior post indicated that the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified on the basis of genotyping in cheeses made by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin. Les Frere and the smaller version Petit Frere sold in wooden boxes are washed rind, semi-soft, soft ripened cheeses; for a picture of them, see http://www.cravecheese.com/cheese-detail.php?Petit-Fr-re-5.

The cheeses are described as being "hand-ladeled" [sic, probably ladled by hand], washed regularly with brine, and matured for a minimum of 3 weeks on site," (http://culturecheesemag.com/node/1227).

On 3 Jul 2013, Crave Brothers recalled the 3 implicated cheeses with make dates of 1 Jul 2013 or earlier. The recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets and mail order. More cases can be anticipated because of the long incubation period for listeriosis, with symptoms sometimes not showing up until 2 months after people have consumed the tainted food, and delays in reporting.

Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

Listeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

The average annual incidence of invasive listeriosis in the United States was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population for 2009-2011, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).
