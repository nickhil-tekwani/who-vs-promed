FOODBORNE OUTBREAK - ITALY (TURIN) (03)

Assuming this is a foodborne illness with a fairly short incubation period,
it will probably turn out to be one of the common pathogens.
However, the reported sign "vertigins" is unsettling to me--our knowledge
bases only list three foodborne illnesses which manifest this sign: botulism,
trichinosis and cysticercosis. Assuming the incubation period is short, then
mild botulism would possibly be something to consider.
If in fact the clinical sign is really just dizziness (not full blown
vertigo), then this could be seen with salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis,
staphylococcal food poisoning and some of the other common foodborne
pathogens.
Other foodborne pathogens to think about which can have fairly short IP's:
Clostridial food poisoning, Colibacillosis, Shigellosis, Cholera, Bacillus
cereus food poisoning, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus
