Water-borne diseases reported in Ferozepur
------------------------------------------
Several cases of water-borne diseases have been reported in the city. While
private clinics are receiving a good number of cases of diarrhea, jaundice,
gastroenteritis and typhoid, very few cases have been reported at the local
civil hospital.
Dr Madan Chawla, a private practitioner in the Bharat Nagar area, said that
he had received more diarrhea, gastroenteritis and typhoid cases in the
last few days. Children had been more affected than the adults, he added.
Dr Daljit Singh, another private practitioner said that while half the
cases were of diarrhea, some cases of jaundice and gastroenteritis were
also reported. This is a breeding time for mosquitoes, flies and other
insects, which are carriers of various diseases-causing microbes.

At least 60 children in Uttar Pradesh, India have died, and over 500 are
seriously affected by diarrhea and cholera triggered by intense heat wave
sweeping the region.
Scorching heat coupled with unhygienic living conditions, particularly the
use of contaminated water from dwindling water sources, has led to the
increased cases of these diseases.
In the last 1 1/2 months, about 600-700 patients have come to us with
water-borne diseases and over 50-60 of them have died.

There are reports of a cholera outbreak in several parts of India, with
nearly 13 deaths reported from Delhi and 300 believed to have died in
Chennai. With 13 cholera deaths reported in Delhi in the past few days and
600 cases in the city this year, the outbreak is the worst it has been in
the last 15 years. In Chennai too, cholera cases are significantly higher
than previous years, with 300 people falling ill in the past few days.
Reports of deaths from water-borne diseases are beginning to stream in from
different parts of India. Over 90 people have died in Gorakhpur this week
of suspected cholera, and in Agra at least 150 children in just one colony
are also critically ill. As the heat rises, the absence of adequate and
safe drinking water could claim more lives in the weeks to come.

Over 300 people have been taken ill after a diarrhea outbreak on Thu, 20
May 2004 in Chennai. Contaminated drinking water is believed to be the
cause of the disease, which is common in rural India during the summers.
Most of the patients, including children, were admitted to the city's
government-run hospital.

The diarrhea cases at Erode Government Hospital have gone up to 42 with the
arrival of 10 more patients on Thu, 20 May 2004.
A majority of them are from Veppadai, Pallipalayam and Kumarapalayam areas
in the neighbouring Namakkal district. The rest are from Vairapalayam,
Thindal and Modakurichi.
As most of the inpatients are below 5 years of age, the doctors took much
care in arranging medical facilities for them. When contacted, Joint
Director (Health) Captain G Venkatachalam said the disease was caused due
to climatic conditions and, however, asserted that it was not cholera. "It
is only enteritis," he said and appealed to the people to drink only boiled
water and well-protected foods.
Erode GH Residential Medical Officer K K M Hussain Ali said the diarrhea
was due to virus. However, all PHCs and taluk hospitals have been alerted
to keep necessary medicines and IV fluids to treat those affected.
Erode Municipal chairman M Subramaniam said municipal water was properly
chlorinated and none within the town limit was affected so far.

Over 100 people have been taken ill after a diarrhea outbreak in Dehradun.
Contaminated drinking water is believed to be the cause of the disease,
which is common in rural India during the summers.
"The cases of vomiting and loose motion which are being reported, we
believe, are due to unsafe drinking water. Had it been (due to
contaminated) food it would have been the entire area. This is because, in
many areas, the sewage line follows the main drinking water line,' said Dhyani.

Over 100 people died and several hundred fell ill due to diarrhea and other
gastroenteric diseases in various parts of Tripura during the past month.
Official sources said here today that people were mainly affected in
Dhalai, North and parts of South Tripura districts.
Mostly tribals were affected in the Longtharai and Atharamura Hill ranges,
where acute drinking water crisis prevails during the summer every
year. People living in the area consumed unhygienic water from small
rivulets, which caused these water-borne diseases.

A cholera outbreak reported in Kanyemba communal lands in Guruve North last
week claimed the life of a child, with 24 other people falling ill.The
outbreak becomes the 2nd in 2004 after the water-borne disease resurfaced
in Chunga, Binga, and affected 7 people.
The 1st cholera outbreak in Binga had claimed the lives of 17 people and
affected 101 others in November 2003. In an interview, the deputy director
for disease prevention and control in the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare, Dr Stanley Midzi, said the cholera attack originated from an
outbreak in Luangwa, Zambia, last month.
Despite a large number of people suffering from the disease, Dr Midzi noted
that the cholera outbreak was now under control. "The Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare head office here in Harare sent a team of health workers,
including 2 trained nurses and 2 environmental health officers, to contain
and prevent further cholera cases in the area," Dr Midzi said.

According to data from the health center of the parish of El Chical,
northwest of Tulcan, on the border with Colombia, during the past 2 weeks,
70 persons have been infected by an unknown agent that causes diarrhea and
vomiting, particularly in infants. A 4-month-old baby died as a result of
the disease.
Since Tue, 11 May 2004, a group of epidemiologists from the health
department of Carchi is carrying out an investigation to determine the
source of the infection. According to Marcelo Lopez, director of health
area No. 1, salmonellosis is being considered but has not been confirmed.
The health authorities suspect that the infection originated in
contaminated fish sold by a Colombian woman at the open-air market. In an
effort to control the spread of the infection, health authorities have
banned the introduction of fish in the parishes of Maldonado and El Chical.
There is concern among residents that the disease is spreading; so far
there are 20 ill people in the neighboring Colombian community of Tallambi
and around 70 in El Chical.

Active surveillance is ongoing in the Municipality of Sao Bento do Una in
Pernambuco after the identification of 5 new cases of cholera in the city
during the month of May. This brings the total number of reported cases to
8, all laboratory confirmed as toxigenic _V. cholerae_ .
The 1st case had onset of symptoms on 27 Mar 2004 and the most recent case
with onset on 15 may 2004, indicating the persistence of a source of
infection in the municipality. Age distribution of the cases: 2 cases less
than 5 years old, 5 cases between 20-45 years old and one case 77 years
old. All cases have recovered. The cases were not concentrated in one
locality, and had access to different sources of water (cisterns).
_V. cholerae_ has been detected in cisterns in the municipio. The
epidemiologic investigation has not identified introduction of the agent
(_V. cholerae) from other known affected areas, therefore suggesting that
the bacteria has persisted in the environment since the last outbreak
occurred in 1991. Epidemiologic and environmental studies are underway to
investigate this further.
