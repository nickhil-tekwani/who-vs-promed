As of 31 Jan 2007, the Government of Nigeria has announced the death from
suspected avian influenza infection in a 22-year-old female from Lagos. She
died on 16 Jan 2007. The mother of the 22-year-old died on 4 Jan with
similar symptoms.

Preliminary tests on the samples from the 22-year-old were positive for
influenza A/H5. Samples have now been sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre
for Reference and Research on Influenza for confirmation. Results are
expected shortly. No samples were taken from the mother.

Contacts have been followed up and have shown no symptoms at twice the
incubation period for avian influenza infection. Samples have been tested
from these contacts as well as from 3 other suspected cases, including one
fatal case and have all been negative in preliminary tests. These samples
have also been sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and
Research on Influenza.

It is important to reiterate that properly cooked poultry meat is safe to
consume when cooked at temperatures at or above 70 deg C in all parts,
until none of the meat is red. There is no epidemiological evidence to
indicate that people have been infected with H5N1 virus following
consumption of properly cooked poultry or eggs. The greatest risk of
exposure to the virus is through the slaughter and handling of live or
already dead infected poultry. More detailed recommendations can be found here.

WHO is working with the government of Nigeria to monitor the situation.

[The death of the 22-year-old Nigerian woman in Lagos (the 1st suspected
case in Nigeria) is still ranked as "suspected" by WHO. A final verdict
must await the outcome of diagnostic tests presently underway in a WHO
Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. - Mod.CP]
