The North Carolina Division of Public Health is investigating an _E.
coli_ outbreak in Wake County, affecting at least 6 children and one
adult, state health department spokeswoman Renee McCoy said Tue 25 Oct
2011.

Four people were hospitalized; 2 had been discharged, and 2 children
were in intensive care Tue 25 Oct 2011, McCoy said. The state is
working with the Wake County Health Department to determine whether
the cases are related. They were still interviewing patients and
awaiting the results of lab tests, which should be completed next
week, McCoy said.

[There is little information in this posting to characterize the
pathotype of _E. coli_, but given the illnesses, it is likely to be an
enterohemorrhagic one, the prototypic strain in this group being
O157:H7. ProMED awaits more information regarding the organism, the
clinical illnesses and presumed reservoir, whether food, water or
animal exposure.

It should be noted that Wake County's county seat is Raleigh, which is
also the state capital and the home of the NC State Fair, which ran
from 13-23 Oct 2011. The web site for the State Fair does not
specifically state whether a petting zoo was part of the Fair, but in
2004, a substantial cluster of _E. coli_ O157 occurred which was
linked to a petting zoo at the NC State Fair. - Mod.LL]
