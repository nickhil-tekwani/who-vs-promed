Measles epidemic already exceeds 2010 case number ten-fold
----------------------------------------------------------
Belgium is experiencing an epidemic of measles. About 400 people have
contracted measles already this year, compared with about 40 in the
whole of 2010 according to a press report of Tue 20 Jun 2011. During
the past 2 months 5 people on average have become infected each day in
Belgium. By 5 Jun 2011 the number of measles cases in Belgium had
reached 382. By contrast in the year 2010 no more than 40 people
contracted measles.

Cases are continuing to occur according to Dr Martine Sabbe, of the
Institut Scientifique de la Sante Publique. In Flanders about 70 per
cent of cases are children under the age of 10. In Wallonia and
Brussels they represent about half the cases. About a quarter of those
affected require hospital treatment for between 4 and 5 days on
average. One child in Liege has suffered cerebral complications. This
situation exists despite the availability of an effective vaccine.

The measles epidemic in Germany and France is even more serious. Dr
Sabbe advises all those not vaccinated to ensure they have been
vaccinated before traveling to France on vacation.

Measles outbreak in decline -- only 18 new cases so far in June
---------------------------------------------------------------
The epidemic of measles in Switzerland which broke out at the
beginning of the year is now in decline. Only 18 new cases have been
recorded during the first part of June in contrast to the 113 cases
recorded during the whole of the month of May. "The peak of the
outbreak is now behind us" the Federal Public Health Service announced
on Monday [20 Jun 2011]. In all there have been 581 cases of measles
since the beginning of the outbreak last December [2010]. The outbreak
peaked in April with 206 confirmed cases. The cantons of Vaud (115
cases), Geneva (194 cases), and Bale (65 cases) have been the worst
affected. Overall, adults aged 20 years and older accounted for 39 per
cent of the cases.

Measles outbreak at Sands School in Ashburton
---------------------------------------------
Nearly a third of pupils at an independent school in Devon have been
hit by a suspected outbreak of measles. About 20 of the 70 pupils at
Sands School in Ashburton are thought to be affected. The Health
Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed one case of measles and the rest
of the children have measles-like symptoms. No one was available for
comment from the school, which caters for 11 to 16 year olds.

The suspected outbreak came amid an increase in measles around the UK
and in Europe. HPA figures show that between January and April, 275
laboratory-confirmed cases of measles were reported, compared with 33
cases for the same period the previous year.

The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Experts
say it is perfectly safe, but vaccination rates dipped following
controversy about its safety. A study which raised the possibility
that MMR was linked to autism has since been dismissed by the vast
majority of research, but public confidence in the jab has still not
fully recovered.

Jackie Morse, head of health protection at NHS [National Health
Service] Devon, said: "I think Ashburton and areas around Devon have
problems with immunisation, but immunisation rates are patchy across
England." The HPA has written to parents of all pupils at Sands
School, urging them to get their children vaccinated.

[It is would be highly unusual for 29 per cent [20/70] of 11-16 year

randomly selected group of children in England. It would be
interesting to know whether there are criteria in the selection of
pupils for this school that would explain this discrepancy. - Mod.CP]

Bridport: measles alert following outbreak
------------------------------------------
Parents are on measles alert in Bridportafter an outbreak of the
potentially fatal disease. NHS [National Health Service] Dorset and
Dorset County Council have sent letters to parents warning them they
need to vaccinate their children.

It tells parents of a major outbreak in France but also pinpoints
cases in Bridport, Glastonbury, and Seaton recently. The alert --
which came out through schools -- comes after 4 people from the same
family contracted measles in Bridport.

NHS Dorset health protection practitioner Nicola Thompson said:
technically it is an outbreak because there are more than 2 cases but
it was all in one family. One of the sons lives away and caught it
elsewhere and brought it back and gave it to his 3
siblings."Obviously if you are not immunised it is highly
infectious. These were all primary school age children, all
unvaccinated. To have a significant amount of young children all
unwell at the same time is a lot of work.

Dorset has a 90 per cent uptake of the triple measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccine. The target is at least 95 per cent. NHS Dorset
health programme advisor Denise Winter said since the letter went to
parents there has been a significant increase in enquires from worried
parents. All the schools have had a letter and we are getting quite
significant numbers of enquiries from parents themselves who don't
understand about MMR.

Ms Thompson added: There are lots of queries from parents in
respect of their children going abroad. Because there is more
measles about people are taking the message quite seriously and
wanting to know where they can get their children vaccinated and how
they go about doing it." Although the disease is quite nasty in
itself, it is the side effects it can cause that are the main worry.

It is a different rash from meningitis but obviously quite a lot of
GPs up until recently won't have much experience of measles because we
haven't had any. With the holiday season approaching the message from
health bosses is to make sure children are protected well before
travelling abroad.

Bridport Medical Centre deputy practice manager Amanda Murphy said
that demand for vaccination had not outstripped supply.

Measles cases pass total for 2010
---------------------------------
Cases of measles in the first five months of this year have surpassed
the number for the whole of 2010, according to new data. The HPA
reported 496 cases of measles in England and Wales up to the end of
May this year, compared with 374 for the whole of 2010.

Most cases were in London and the south east, and children and
teenagers were most commonly affected. Small outbreaks have occurred
in universities, schools, and families, and there have been links with
travel abroad after a surge in cases across Europe.

HPA data also show a rise in the proportion of children having the
combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first MMR
vaccination is given when youngsters are around 13 months of age, with
a booster jab before they start school (usually between the ages of 3
and 5). Among youngsters aged 2, quarterly figures for January to
March show 90 per cent had received their first jab -- the highest
level for 13 years and a 0.6 per cent rise on the previous quarter.
The figures showed that by the age of 5, 92.8 per cent of children had
received their first dose. However, not all parents take their child
back for the second dose. Among children aged 5 at the start of the
year, only 85.1 per cent had received both doses.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of the immunisation department at the HPA, said:
"We're very encouraged to see that UK MMR uptake has reached 90 per
cent in children aged 2, indicating increasing levels of trust by
parents in the immunisation programme. "We're on the way to reaching
our goal of 95 per cent uptake. But anyone who missed out on MMR as a
child will continue to be at risk of measles, which explains why we
are seeing these new cases in a broad age range.

"It's that time of year when children are travelling on school trips
and family holidays and we are reminding parents and young adults of
the importance of immunisation before they travel. "We cannot stress
enough that measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal."

engendered by the current measles outbreak the trend in decreased
uptake of MMR vaccine is beginning to be reversed.

Measles outbreak causes 40 deaths in Maniema
--------------------------------------------
Kinshasa: The outbreak of measles which has broke out in Maniema
province [of the Democratic Republic of Congo] has been responsible,
in less than a month, for some 40 deaths. According to a medical
soutce in Kindu, the capital of the province, most of the fatalities
have been children, but there have been also adult fatalities in the
14 health areas of the province.

Dr Jean Baptiste Shuli Tchombe, physician-coordinator of the National
Programme on Immunization (EPI) said that the situation is under
control in 5 of the 14 health zones. The 5 are Kindu, the capital of
the province, Alunguli in the center of Maniema, and Samba, Kasongo,
and Kibombo in southern Maniema. Control efforts are now directed
towards the situation in the health zones in the north of the
province, close to Ubundu in the Eastern Province, where the epidemic
began.

Dr Shuli Tchombe stated that the situation is worrisome in the health
zone of Kindu. "Sporadic cases are still being reported there and a
coordinated management sytem is being implemented using health centers
and public hospitals]". He further stated that a vaccination campaign
will be required in the health zones in the north of the province,
notably Lubutu Ferekeni, Obokote, and Punia, because they lie adjacent
to Lowa health in the Eastern Province where the epidemic has not yet
been controlled.

Alarm as 18 die of measles
--------------------------
Dar es Salaam: The government yesterday [24 Jun 2011] announced a
fresh outbreak of deadly measles that has so far killed 18 people
since it was reported earlier this year.

No fewer than 1573 cases have been reported in about 6 regions of
Mainland Tanzania as authorities struggle to control further spread of
the disease which affects the skin and the respiratory system.

Confirming the report to journalists yesterday, the permanent
secretary [PS] in the ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Ms
Blandina Nyoni, said the government has decided it would vaccinate all
children between the ages of 9 months and 15 years starting in October
this year, as part of measures to control the disease.

The PS said Arusha's Ngorongoro and Karatu districts, Dar es Salaam,
Iringa municipality, Coast Region's Kisarawe District, Morogoro
Municipality, Kilosa District and Tanga have reported a high number of
cases.

Accompanied by the director of prevention services, Dr Donan Mmbando,
Ms Nyoni said out of 1573 cases reported since January, children under
the age of 5 who are at the highest risk of being affected by the
highly-infectious disease accounted for 68 per cent of the total
cases. Some 1062 cases were reported among children under 5, she
said.

According to the PS, Arusha leads with 10 deaths and 642 patients,
followed by Dar es Salam where 7 have already died out of 349 cases
reported.

The disease mostly affects those who have not been immunised against
it,Ms Nyoni said. Public health experts say the emergence of measles
in Tanzania could be part of a global outbreak of the disease which
continues to spread across the world, with more cases being reported
in Europe. The outbreak is a serious setback to global health experts
who believed they were close to eradicating the disease worldwide, but
the World Health Organization (WHO) has pushed the target date for
eliminating it to 2015. However, many experts say the time is still
not enough to vanquish the scourge. In Europe, 6500 people in 30
countries have been infected with measles -- largely in France, which
has declared it an official epidemic. More than 5000 cases were
reported between January and March 2011, nearly as many cases reported
during the whole of 2010. Over 98 cases of the disease have been
reported in 23 American states, according to the US Centre for Disease
Control and Prevention. The disease is also spreading through India
and the Philippines.Yesterday, the PS said about 85 per cent of the
reported patients had not been vaccinated.

Dr Mmbando said the outbreak usually occurs between September and
December every year, noting however that such a trend was not noticed
last year. He speculated that the current outbreak could be part of
what was supposed to happen last year.

In Tanzania, the measles vaccination rate stands at 85 per cent and
Dr Mmbando fears that the 15 per cent of those who have not been
vaccinated could be responsible for the current eruption. He announced
that the government has introduced ring vaccination to affected areas
to control further spread of the disease, warning that there was no
specific treatment for the disease yet.

Measles cases in Capiz on the rise
----------------------------------
Roxas City: Records from the Provincial Health Office of Capiz
showed that out of 49 suspected measles cases in Capiz from Jan to 17
Jun this year, 18 individuals were found positive for the disease
based on laboratory results from the Department of Health, according
to Capiz DOH representative Dr Elmer Bucayan. He explained that blood
samples were taken in 46 cases. These were sent to DOH in Manila for
analysis.

The 3 other cases are considered epidemiologically linked cases,
hence, no blood samples were taken. Bucayan said that they are still
waiting for the results of the 28 patients suspected of having measles
and whose blood samples were earlier submitted to their higher office
for laboratory examination. Of the total confirmed cases, 10 are from
Roxas City, two from Dao, and one case each from Dumalag, Jamindan,
Mambusao, Panay, Pilar, and Sigma. The oldest to have been confirmed
with measles is a 52 year old person with no history of immunization.

Recently, the government has stepped up its anti-measles immunization
campaign throughout the entire nation using a door-to-door strategy to
reach all the eligible children in the population and to eradicate
measles in the Philippines by 2012.

High number of reported measles cases in the US in 2011 -- linked to
outbreaks abroad
-----------------------------------------------
Summary and background
----------------------
The United States is experiencing a high number of reported measles
cases in 2011, many of which were acquired during international
travel. From 1 Jan 2011 to 17 Jun 2011, 156 confirmed cases of measles
were reported to CDC [Centers for Disease Prevention and Control].

This is the highest reported number since 1996. Most cases (136) were
associated with importations from measles-endemic countries or
countries where large outbreaks are occurring. The imported cases
involved unvaccinated US residents who recently had traveled abroad,
unvaccinated visitors to the United States, and people linked to these
imported cases. To date, 12 outbreaks (3 or more linked cases) have
occurred, accounting for 47 per cent of the 156 cases. Of the total
case-patients, 133 (85 per cent) were unvaccinated or had undocumented
vaccination status. Of the 139 case-patients who were US residents, 86
(62 per cent) were unvaccinated, 30 (22 per cent) had undocumented
vaccination status, 11 (8 per cent) had received one dose of
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, 11 (8 per cent) had received 2
doses, and 1 (1 per cent) had received 3 (documented) doses.

Measles had been declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 due
to our high 2-dose measles vaccine coverage, but it is still endemic
or large outbreaks are occurring in countries in Europe (including
France, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Switzerland), Africa, and Asia
(including India). The increase in measles cases and outbreaks in the
US this year underscores the ongoing risk of importations, the need
for high measles vaccine coverage, and the importance of prompt and
appropriate public health response to measles cases and outbreaks.

Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that is
transmitted by contact with an infected person through coughing and
sneezing. After an infected person leaves a location, the virus
remains contagious for up to 2 hours on surfaces and in the air.

Measles can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia,
encephalitis, and death.

Recommendations for health care providers
-----------------------------------------
Ensure all patients are up to date on MMR vaccine* and other
vaccines. For those who travel abroad, CDC recommends that all US
residents older than 6 months be protected from measles and receive
MMR vaccine, if needed, prior to departure.

Infants 6 through 11 months old should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine
before departure. (Infants who receive a dose of MMR vaccine before
their first birthday should receive 2 more doses of MMR vaccine, the
first of which should be administered when the child is 12 through 15
months of age and the second at least 28 days later.)

Children 12 months of age or older should have documentation of 2
doses of MMR vaccine (separated by at least 28 days).

Teenagers and adults without evidence of measles immunity** should
have documentation of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine.

[One of the following is considered evidence of measles immunity for
international travelers: 1) birth before 1957, 2) documented
administration of 2 doses of live measles virus vaccine (MMR, MMRV, or
measles vaccines), 3) laboratory (serologic) proof of immunity, or 4)
documentation of physician-diagnosed measles.]

Consider measles as a diagnosis in anyone with a febrile rash illness
lasting 3 days or more, a temperature of 101ºF (38.3ºC) or higher,
and clinically compatible symptoms (cough, coryza, and/or
conjunctivitis) who has recently traveled abroad or who has had
contact with someone with a febrile rash illness. Immunocompromised
patients may not exhibit rash or may exhibit an atypical rash. The
incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about
10 days (range, 7 to 12 days) and from exposure to rash onset is
usually 14 days (range, 7 to 21 days).

Isolate suspect measles case-patients and immediately report cases to
local health departments to ensure a prompt public health response.

Obtain specimens for testing, including viral specimens for
confirmation and genotyping.

* Children 1 through 12 years of age may receive MMRV vaccine for
protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; however,
MMRV vaccine is currently unavailable.

State health officials investigate rare measles outbreak in north
east Indiana
--------------------------------------------------------
Indianapolis: State health officials are investigating a measles
outbreak in north east Indiana. The Indiana Department of Health has
confirmed 5 cases of the highly contagious respiratory disease in
Noble County. Surrounding counties of Allen, DeKalb, Elkhart,
Kosciusko, LaGrange, Steuben, and Whitley may also be affected.

Measles is a rare disease in the United States because of the
widespread availability of a measles vaccine. But officials say
visitors from other countries or citizens traveling abroad can spread
the disease, which often includes a high fever and rash.

State health commissioner Gregory Larkin said the state is working
with local health departments to contain the outbreak. Larkin said the
disease is so rare that even one case is considered an outbreak, and
urged people to make sure they're up to date on vaccines.

Officials confirm 5 measles cases in northern Utah
--------------------------------------------------
Salt Lake City: Health officials in northern Utah say they've
confirmed 5 measles cases in Cache County. The Bear River Heath
Department confirmed its first case in early June in a child believed
to have been exposed in mid-May.

Department spokeswoman Jill Parker says the 4 new patients came in
contact with the child. Parker says epidemiologists don't know how the
child contracted the highly contagious disease. She says persons born
after 1957 who haven't received 2 doses of MMR vaccine should get
immunized.

Health officials say anyone who becomes sick should isolate
themselves from others and seek medical attention. Measles symptoms
can include fever, runny nose, cough, eye inflammation and rash all
over the body. A small fraction of people can develop pneumonia or
encephalitis.

Second possible measles case in Vermont
---------------------------------------
If you ate at the McDonald's on the Barre Montpelier road in Barre,
Vermont, on Thu 16 Jun 2011 or attended the East Barre Fire Department
barbeque on Sun 19 Jun 2011, you may have been exposed to measles. The
Vermont State Health Department believes a young child from Washington
County has the illness, which health officials say is highly
contagious. "You can get it if you are in the same room as someone who

had measles 2 hours after they already left the room. It stays around
in the air for up to a couple hours and its pretty easily spread that
way," Vermont Health Department state epidemiologist, Patsy Kelso
said.

In Vermont, parents can get exemptions, which allows their child to
attend public school without receiving a vaccination. Health officials
say about 92 per cent of children are vaccinated against measles. But
they say that number is still too low. "Since measles is spread so
easily from one person to another through the air, it's really
important to have even higher vaccination coverage," Kelso said.

If you think you were exposed to measles at either the McDonalds in
Barre, or the East Barre Fire Department barbeque, contact the Vermont
Health Department at (802) 863-7240.

largest outbreak of the year. There are now 26 people with the
highly-infectious disease, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service
(ARPHS) confirmed today.

The service says almost all of them can be traced back to an
unimmunised pupil at Oratia Primary School who returned from England
via Singapore and contracted measles. However, 3 cases are not linked
to any of the others, which the ARPHS says shows how contagious
measles [cases] are. 24 of the people who are infected have not been
immunised, while 2 of the people were possibly immunised overseas.

ARPHS medical officer of health Dr Richard Hoskins says the service
is continuing to take appropriate steps to trace and contact people
who may have been exposed through interaction with the cases while
they were infectious. "Most of the cases have now developed while
people were in quarantine," says Dr Hoskins. "This means these people
are only likely to pass the infection on further to other household
members who are not immunised." Over 300 people have been traced as
contacts, and those who have not been immunised have been requested to
quarantine themselves at home to limit those they might infect if they
catch the disease.

Dr Hoskins says ARPHS has also advised quarantine for susceptible
people at some Auckland schools (including Epsom Girls Grammar School
and AGC Parnell College) and early childhood centres, and within some
sports teams, where there is a high risk of measles spreading to
people who are unimmunised.

"Measles is a serious illness and must be taken seriously," says Dr
Hoskins. "It can have severe complications, especially in vulnerable
groups in the community. We urge people to be vigilant if they suspect
they could have measles, or have been exposed to someone who could
have measles." Dr Hoskins says immunisation is the only way to avoid
getting measles, and recommends anyone concerned about the outbreak
update their own immunisations and those of their children.
