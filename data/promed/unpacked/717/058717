Current situation
-----------------
In the Americas, outbreaks of the Oropouche fever virus have been
described in rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama,
Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the majority of these outbreaks,
people of both genders and of all ages were affected. In populations
with prior contact with the virus, the most affected age groups were
children and adolescents.

The Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and
urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates,
sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the flies
acting as vectors. In the urban epidemic cycle, the infection cycle
remains vector-man-vector, with the human being acting as the
principal host.

Outbreaks that were registered in the last 10 years as due to the
Oropouche virus have occurred mainly in the Amazon region.

In May of this year [2010], the national authorities of Peru detected
a febrile disease outbreak caused by the Oropouche virus in the
locality of Bagazan, district of Pachiza, department of San Martin. As
of epidemiological week (EW) 23 [6-12 Jun 2010], a total of 282 cases
of Oropouche fever had been recorded, with 241 probable and 41
confirmed cases. The presence of the fly _Culicoides paraensis_ was
identified in the locality where this outbreak was occurring.

What is Oropouche fever?
-----------------------
Oropouche fever (ICD-10 A93.0) is a zoonosis produced by the Oropouche
virus, a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. It is transmitted to humans
primarily through the bite of the _Culicoides paraensis_ fly.

The disease produces symptoms similar to dengue. It has an incubation
period of 4-8 days, with a range of between 3-12 days. The onset of
symptoms is sudden, usually with a fever, headache, arthralgia,
myalgia, chills, sometimes nausea, and persistent vomiting up to 5-7
days. Meningoencephalitis has been known to occur occasionally.
Symptoms last from 5-7 days; however, full recovery can take up to
several weeks in some patients.

In Peru, the Oropouche virus was isolated for the 1st time in 1992 in
the area of Iquitos; and this is the 1st occasion in which the
Oropouche virus has been identified in that locality [San Martin].

In light of this outbreak, the authorities have alerted the facilities
in the local health network as to case identification and have
strengthened the organization of their healthcare services.

Factors that influence incidence and can lead to an increase in cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- High density presence of the hematophagous vector _Culicoides paraensis_
- Migration of susceptible persons from non-endemic regions to endemic
regions.

General recommendations
-----------------------
1. Investigation of existing outbreaks in order to adequately define
prevention and control measures.
2. Intensification of surveillance activities to detect cases.
3. Strengthening of laboratory services to confirm diagnoses.
4. Capacity-building among health workers on case detection and management.
5. Strengthening of entomological surveillance to determine the
vectors and possible reservoirs involved in transmission.
6. Application of measures to reduce the vector density in areas where
outbreaks are occurring.
7. Dissemination of information to the sick on the importance of using
personal protection to prevent fly bites and interrupt the urban cycle
of transmission of the infection.
8. Dissemination of information and recommendations to alert the
population at risk as to prevention and control measures.
