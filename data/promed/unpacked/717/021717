RABIES VACCINE, ATTENUATED - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Rabies Vaccination Inquiry
--------------------------
I would like to raise a question of importance in those countries where
attenuated rabies vaccine is used to control rabies in foxes. Every year we
have some inquiries concerning human contact with the bait through which
the live rabies vaccine is distributed. This vaccine is attenuated for
foxes, but there is, of course, no experience with humans.
Therefore, we decided to recommend post-exposure treatment in cases
involving intensive contact.
A related problem concerns the contact of vaccinated dogs with the same
bait. In these cases we have not recommended vaccination. [I believe Dr.
Slenczka is referring to post-exposure vaccination of the person having
been bitten by such a vaccinated dog. I do not believe he is referring to
the dog in this case. - Mod.TG] I would like to have other opinions on this
problem and would be happy to receive answers from some experts in the field.
