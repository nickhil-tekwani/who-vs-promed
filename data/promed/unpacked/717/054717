[The 2 classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks reported from the Amur region in October/November 2013, involved domestic swine. They were followed by surveillance in wild boar, resulting in the currently reported positive 3 "outbreaks". No CSF outbreaks, in domestic swine or wild boar, have been reported to the OIE from Amur in previous years (at least, since WAHID's inauguration in 2005).
