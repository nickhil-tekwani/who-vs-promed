Severe respiratory disease associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- 10th update, 31 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Main conclusions and options for action
------------------------------------------
Currently, the risk of human infections and sustainable human-to-human transmission in Europe remains low. However, the number of human MERS cases reported from the Arabian Peninsula has increased rapidly in the past few months. Specifically, several healthcare associated clusters in Saudi Arabia and UAE have been reported which have been responsible for large numbers of cases. Given the current increase in nosocomial infections and travel-associated cases of MERS in the Arabian Peninsula, and the large number of people travelling between the Arabian peninsula and Europe, it is likely that more cases will be imported and detected in the EU/EEA. Continued vigilance in assessing patients with travel history to the affected region is warranted.

Since the previous (9th) ECDC rapid risk assessment on MERS-CoV was published [25 Apr 2014], it has become clear that false negative results cannot explain the increase in cases and it is unlikely that mutations have led to increased human-to-human transmission. 3 other scenarios likely to play a part in the current epidemiology are:
- increased zoonotic transmission leading to increased introductions to community and healthcare facilities;
- suboptimal infection control in hospitals;
- a more sensitive case detection algorithm used in some areas that has led to the current increase in number of cases.

In addition, there is an increasing body of evidence that dromedary camels are the direct or indirect source of infection for many of the human cases. This updated rapid risk assessment contains options for action in the following areas:

- Travel advice: there are no travel restrictions in place, however those travelling to the region should consult a doctor if suffering from a severe medical condition; avoid travelling if ill with an infectious disease; ensure good hygiene practices; avoid contact with animals, especially camels, and not consume unpasteurised milk or undercooked meat.

- The international public health community could consider providing further outbreak assessment support to better understand modes and sources of transmission, determine optimal management of patients, and encourage serological surveys.

- EU/EEA Member States could review their preparedness in the event of a large MERS cluster; sensitize public health professionals and healthcare workers to the possibility of MERS presenting in returning travellers and increase awareness of the available testing, infection control, surveillance, and reporting guidance.

2. Zoonotic transmission
------------------------
There is growing evidence that the dromedary camel is a host species for the MERS-CoV and that camels play an important role in the transmission to humans. The 1st evidence of the implication of dromedary camels in transmission was the detection of high rates of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels on the Arabian Peninsula. Evidence of infection in camels precedes the 1st evidence of human infection. Recently, viral RNA has been detected in different specimens from camels and the virus has been isolated from nasal and faecal samples.

The detection of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia for slaughter in Egypt, as well as serological evidence of previous MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the Canary Islands (Spain; some originating from Morocco) suggests that the virus could be geographically widespread in the dromedary camel populations on the African continent and that previously undetected transmission to humans may occur outside of the Arabian Peninsula.

However, in 2 studies, the absence of MERS-CoV antibodies was reported respectively in 226 and 179 abattoir workers in Saudi Arabia (from Jeddah and Makkah sampled in October 2012) and in Egypt (June-December 2013), suggesting [that] the virus is not easily transmitted from camels to humans. Among the primary cases reported from Saudi Arabia, only a minority have documented camel contact.

A recent study showed that the MERS-CoV remains infectious beyond 72 hours after introduction in unpasteurised camel milk. The consumption of raw camel milk is traditional in the Arabic culture. So far, to our knowledge, no study has looked at the excretion rate of MERS-CoV in camel milk and urine. Raw camel milk may therefore play a role in transmission.

In a prospective study of 2 camel herds in Saudi Arabia from November 2013 to February 2014, nasal, oral, or rectal swabs and blood samples were collected up to 5 times. The study showed that acute MERS-CoV infections diagnosed with PCR resulted in increased anti MERS-CoV titers. The infection of very young animals (less than one month) indicates that maternal antibodies may not fully protect very young animals from infection. There was no evidence of prolonged virus shedding or viraemia among the tested animals.

3. Increased zoonotic transmission
----------------------------------
Dromedary camels are a host species for MERS-CoV. Juvenile animals have a higher virus load, indicating a higher likelihood of transmission. Transmission could potentially occur via respiratory or faecal shedding, or other types of contact. Reinfection of animals appears to be possible and pre-existing antibodies are not fully protective. Therefore, a higher circulation could be assumed after the calving period in the winter months, when a larger number of animals is susceptible.

Camel farming has progressively changed in Saudi Arabia over the last 10 years with an increased number of farms near cities. Intensive camel farming could be at the origin of an increased zoonotic risk. A good understanding of the epidemiology of camels (such as seasonal calving periods and diarrheal outbreaks) is needed to fully assess the zoonotic risk. Many gaps remain in our knowledge of the epidemiology of coronavirus infections in dromedary camels, including exact contact patterns with humans, both in the population generally and in MERS cases. Though we know that MERS-CoV is circulating widely among the camel herds in the Arabian Peninsula, we do not know what has triggered the apparent outbreak in humans and why such outbreaks have not occurred in other geographical regions where serological evidence exists for infection of dromedary camels.

Importation of live dromedary camels, raw camel meat, and unsterilized camel milk from the Arabian peninsula to the EU is prohibited.

[The ECDC risk assessment addresses the MERS-CoV issue from a European viewpoint. For a recent report addressing the issue from the viewpoint of the autochthonously affected territory, namely the Arabian Peninsula, subscribers are referred to the following article (uncorrected proof, in press):

Memish ZA, et al: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, MERS-CoV. Conclusions from the 2nd Scientific Advisory Board Meeting of the WHO Collaborating Center for Mass Gathering Medicine, Riyadh. Int J Infect Dis. 2014. pii: S1201-9712(14)01491-X; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.05.001.

The meeting took place during 28-29 Apr 2014. In view of complementary research and continuous surveillance, it will be interesting to note if/which control measures will eventually be considered necessary in Saudi Arabia to prevent exposure of humans to infectious camels during the 2014 mass gatherings. Young camels in particular are suspected to be a possible source of human infection. Parturitions of camels take place during the winter months, the main potential exposure of humans to camel-derived MERS-CoV is thus expected during the 1st half of each year. The Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is expected to fall this year between 2-7 Oct 2014.

Subscribers are reminded of OIE's updated view on MERS-CoV:
"Though some camel infections with MERS-CoV have been associated with mild respiratory symptoms in the animals, current evidence does not indicate that MERS-CoV causes significant illness in camels. Evidence from the limited number of infections that have been identified also suggests that infection in these camels has been self-limiting. To develop a more complete understanding of the potential role of camels (and other animals) in the epidemiology of MERS, several types of investigation are needed:

1. Epidemiological studies which aim to determine the risk factors and potential exposure sources for camel infection and how camel infections relate to human cases of MERS; this includes genetic analyses of MERS-CoV.
2. Animal infection studies (including experimental challenges) to determine the behavior of MERS-CoV in camels (and other animals) and how the virus may be shed from infected camels.
3. In parallel diagnostic tests used for MERS-CoV surveillance in camels (and other animals) should be assessed for the reliability of their results in these species." - Mod.AS]

[As Mod.AS has correctly highlighted, there is the strong need for additional studies aimed at determining the routes of transmission of the MERS-CoV from animal hosts to human hosts. At present there are many observational studies aimed at demonstrating the presence of the MERS-CoV in camels. The low observed infectivity rate amongst camel herders and the apparent lack of MERS-CoV transmission in northern African countries, where MERS-CoV infection rates of local dromedary camels has been documented as relatively high, remains perplexing. The fact that the virus most closely resembled a coronavirus identified in bats also suggests the need for further studies on possible routes of transmission between bats, camels, and humans.

Information on possible exposure risk factors of human cases has to date been limited. There is clear evidence of nosocomial enhancement of transmission of the MERS-CoV, but evidence of possible risk exposures and routes of transmission for the "sporadic cases" -- those without a history of contact with previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals, and those without a history of known contact with animals or raw animal products including camels, livestock, and bats -- is still absent. Hopefully many of the necessary studies are underway and there will be some answers forthcoming in the near future. - Mod.MPP]
