Prevalence of _Trypanosoma evansi_ in horses in Israel evaluated by serology and reverse dot blot

Abstract
--------
_Trypanosoma evansi_ is the cause of surra in horses, camels and other domestic animals. Following the 1st outbreak of surra in horses and camels in Israel in 2006, a survey of the prevalence of the parasite in the Israeli horse population was conducted using serology, PCR followed by the reverse dot blot (RDB) technique and blood smear microscopy. In total, 614 horses from 7 regions were sampled. The CATT/_T. evansi_ kit was used for serology for all the horses. Horses from the Arava and Dead Sea region, where the 1st outbreak occurred, were sampled again one year later, and both samples were subjected to serology and the RDB technique. The country-wide seroprevalence was 4.6 percent (28/614). The seroprevalence in the Arava and Dead Sea region was 6.5 percent (9/139) in the 1st sampling compared with 4.1 percent (5/122) in the 2nd, whereas the prevalence of RDB-positivity was 18.7 percent (26/139) in the 1st sampling and only 0.8 percent (1/122) in the 2nd. All horses were asymptomatic except for one horse from the Arava and Dead Sea region that demonstrated clinical signs of surra combined with positive serology and RDB. The results of this study indicated that surra is prevalent in most regions of the country and thus should be considered an important differential diagnosis in horses and other domestic animals in Israel with chronic weight loss, edema or neurological signs.

[From a subscriber in Jordan, we are informed that cases of surra are being observed there as well. Though no species was mentioned, it may be assumed that this refers to horses and camels, typically surra-susceptible species. The Arava and Dead Sea regions in Israel share a common border with Jordan.

Surra is included in OIE list of reportable diseases. The following information is derived from the introduction to the above paper (references omitted):

_Trypanosoma_ evansi is an animal pathogen with a worldwide distribution. It is a haemoflagellate of the subgenus _Trypanozoon_ that is mechanically transmitted by flying insects mainly of the genera _Tabanus_ and _Stomoxys_. It has been diagnosed and described in South America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and has been described to spread from the Canary Islands into France and Spain in Europe.

_T. evansi_ infects a wide range of animal hosts; however, the most severely affected animals are equids, camels and buffalos. The disease is known as surra and is mainly characterized by chronic weight loss, limb and ventral edema, urticaria, anemia, icterus, occasional abortions and neurological signs followed by death in the final stages.

Diagnosis of _T. evansi_ infection can be challenging due to its chronic nature, the fluctuating parasitemia and the sequestration of the parasite into less accessible tissues such as the nervous system. The diagnostic methods commonly used are parasitological techniques such as blood smear evaluation, the micro-haematocrit centrifuge technique, mouse inoculation, serological methods such as ELISA, and molecular techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The reverse dot blot (RDB) is a method that enhances the specific detection of the PCR DNA product. It is used to simultaneously detect several pathogens in the same sample and distinguish between related pathogens, in addition to enhancing the sensitivity of DNA detection from pathogens in the blood or tissues.

_T. evansi_ infection was 1st diagnosed in Israel in 2006 in a camel and a horse from a secluded desert farm in the southern Dead Sea region, which is in close proximity to the eastern border with Jordan, where the pathogen has previously been described. The initial identification and characterization of _T. evansi_ in Israel was reported in a horse with central nervous system signs and in a longitudinal investigation of 2 surra outbreaks in the affected farm. Although the disease outbreaks seemed to be restricted to this farm, with no reports of outbreaks of similar clinical signs in other parts of the country, the discovery of a parasite that was not previously identified in the country warranted further studies in order to investigate its possible country-wide distribution.

The goals of this study were to investigate the seroprevalence of _T. evansi_ and the prevalence of parasitemia by RDB and blood smear evaluation in a large scale sampling of the horse population in Israel. - Mod.AS
