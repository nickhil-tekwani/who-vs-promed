_Xylella fastidiosa_ is threatening Corsica. Faced with the inertia of the government, [local politicians have] called out to create a collective. More than 8000 ha of olive trees have been destroyed, and nearly 21 000 ha are in quarantine in the Puglia region of Italy [which] amounts to 53 million Euros [USD 70 million] damage.

_Xylella fastidiosa_ is difficult to detect, and the only treatment is to burn the trees. These bacteria, if not eradicated, will wreak havoc and cause an agricultural, economic and unprecedented environmental disaster. Most cultivated plants on the island are imported from Sardinia and mainland Italy and, therefore, are potential carriers of the infection.

Many growers, gardeners, owners of plant nurseries, rural communes, members of agricultural chambers and the national Office of Forests expressed their concern. In October 2013, the Union of Corsican Olive Oil had already alerted the region's prefect and the Territorial Assembly but did not get any response.

It is unclear whether Corsica is already infected. Samples were taken, but not everywhere. Locals are waiting for the results and feel the situation is not under control.

European plant protection directives allow Member States to define protected areas. But tightening of plant quarantine to prevent unauthorised imports would be hampered by lack of suitable staff. The safest answer would be to ban all plant importations from Italy. This would prevent all local olive planting programs, and growers would not be able to plant a single tree for 5 years. This would pose an economic problem.

The collective decided to call on the state, which has sole jurisdiction for controls, to take responsibility. A regional olive group should be created in the Chamber of Agriculture. But all believe that only broad public mobilisation can prevent disaster.

[2] Italy: update

A bacterium, seen in Europe for the 1st time, is destroying centuries-old olive trees in Italy [ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095 & 20140424.2425497] and threatening supplies of olive oil. It has now infected 800 000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy.

Puglia produces about 11 million tonnes of olives a year, more than 1/3rd of the national crop and some of the country's best oils.

"The disease is continuing to spread thanks to the summer temperatures, and we have to take the right measures. There will be a genuine cordon sanitaire [phytosanitary exclusion zone] of 8000 hectares, where it will be obligatory to destroy the trees," the regional president of Coldiretti [national union of primary producers] said. Action has been slow because of the Italian tradition of going on holiday for the whole of August. Unfortunately, "_Xylella_ does not go on holiday," he said.

The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation has warned that the disease, which can also infect almond and stone fruit trees, is a "very serious threat" to agriculture.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of citrus, lucerne dwarf, as well as leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander, and other woody ornamentals. In olive and almond, it causes branch dieback and leaf scorch. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these can serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. The pathotype affecting oleander and almond, but not grapevine, has been reported to also affect olives. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed-borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vector insects and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). It has also been suspected in other locations in Asia and its occurrence in Oceania is currently unknown. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern in Europe, Africa and Australasia.

In Italy, final confirmation of Xf apparently still awaits results of ongoing infectivity tests, but it seems likely that the outbreak in Italy represents the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unknown, suggestions that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material appear likely. The pathogen has been added to the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO), and a special alert has been issued for the region (links below).
