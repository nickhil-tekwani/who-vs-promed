[1] Case update

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 3 Sep 2018:
- A total of 124 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 93 were confirmed and 31 were probable.
- 16 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new cases confirmed in Beni.
- 1 probable case in Beni: Burial not secured by the family before samples could be taken.
- 3 confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako.

News of the response
Community resistance
--------------------
- The district of Ndindi in Beni city has become the main focus of the epidemic at present concentrating 70 percent of the last 20 confirmed cases reported. This situation is linked to the resistance of the community in this district to collaborate with the health authorities. Some families have long hidden sick people, refused to allow health care providers to take patients to the Ebola treatment center (ETC), and refused to be vaccinated. Several violent incidents against medical staff and care facilities had also been reported. To ease tensions, a community dialogue was launched between coordinating the response and Ndindi community leaders. In addition, a local coordination committee composed of neighborhood leaders was set up and a community action plan was developed.

Support
-------
- To date, 22 patients have been treated with mAb 114, remdesivir, or Zmapp. Of these 22 patients, 11 are cured, 4 have died and 7 are still hospitalized but have seen their condition improve.

Surveillance
------------
- To date, 2 068 733 travelers have been checked at the 37 entry points activated.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 6134 people have been vaccinated, including 3120 in Mabalako, 1747 in Beni, 1067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 60 in Katwa (Butembo), and 19 in Kinshasa.

[Since our last update 4 days ago (1 Sep 2018, Ebola update (81) 20180901.6002182), case numbers have budged only slightly, from a total of 120 to 124, an encouraging trend. However, the DRC MOH reports several disturbing forms of community resistance in Beni:
- Some families are concealing potential or probable Ebola cases among them. This may relate to the aforementioned "unsecured burial" of a probable case before patient samples could be taken.
- Even after some probable cases have been identified at home, their families are refusing to allow the affected family member to be quarantined and cared for in the Beni ETC.
- Others (presumably family or other case contacts) are refusing vaccination.

All of these forms of community resistance jeopardize the effectiveness of case finding, prevention, and treatment. The number of new cases derived from known contacts has not been provided, but this would provide a good indicator of unknown disease transmission chains that could result from such dangerous behavior.

As if community resistance weren't enough of a problem in Beni, lethal attacks by armed rebels continue in Beni territory, including 6 Congolese killed on 10-11 Aug 2018, following a clash between the Congolese army and the Ugandan Islamist rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), and 2 Sudanese UN peacekeepers on 3 Sep 2018 in an attack attributed also to ADF. See https://taarifa.rw/2018/08/12/adf-rebels-clash-with-congolese-army-6-killed/ and
https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-ebola-congo/rebels-ambush-south-african-peacekeepers-in-congo-ebola-zone-idUKKCN1LK1IH?rpc=401&

It is unfortunate that some likely infected individuals in Beni have refused to be cared for in the Beni ETC. By extrapolation from other reports, this ETC is co-managed with ALIMA (Alliance for International Medical Action), which has introduced the 1st individual patient "treatment cubes" made of see-through plastic that should enhance not only the medical care but also patient visibility and interactions with family members while under care. (For more, see item [2] below).

Hopefully, community leaders and peer-to-peer dialogue and education will help to overcome ignorance and fear in order to enhance Ebola prevention, control, and treatment efforts in this already traumatized population in North Kivu.

On a separate note, the DRC MOH reports that only 4 of the 22 patients who have been treated with the experimental drugs mAb 114, remdesivir, or Zmapp have died (so far), which is well below the typical ETC mortality rate of about 50 percent. But of course it is far too early, with too few treated patients, to begin to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of one or more of these therapeutic candidates. - Mod.LXL]

[2] Treatment cubes

Alima, the Alliance for International Medical Action, deployed its new biosecure emergency care units, which it calls "cubes," in its treatment center in Beni.

The rooms, made of clear, flexible plastic with sleeves, gloves, and bodysuits built into the walls, allow nurses to safely perform about 80 percent of the care an Ebola patient needs without having to put on hot, cumbersome gowns, hoods, rubber aprons, boots, and goggles.

Wearing full gear, caregivers can look terrifying, especially to children. "Now they can see us as human beings," said Claude Mahoudeau, Alima's emergency response coordinator.

Nurses can check vital signs, feed patients, and change intravenous drip rates, said Augustin Augier, Alima's secretary general, and may eventually start inserting intravenous needles from outside. Workers must still enter the cube to clean up diarrhea and vomit, unless patients are strong enough to do it themselves and then seal the soiled linens in bags and pass them out through a portal.

The chambers are air-conditioned for comfort. Also, patients' relatives can safely sit outside and talk to them...[more]
