A 10-year-old, unvaccinated paint horse mare in Elbert County, Georgia, is positive for West Nile virus (WNV). She began presenting signs on [30 Nov 2022] including front-end ataxia and muscle fasciculations of the head and neck.

She tested positive for WNV on [6 Dec 2022]. The mare is currently affected and alive.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:

- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (involuntary twitching);
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mental activity), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure. However, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually--one in the spring and another in the fall--in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:

- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during insect feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

A Livingston County horse was euthanized after being infected with the WNV, state officials said. According to a release from a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services entomologist, the horse most likely acquired the disease while at its most recent home, an animal rescue.

The horse was an unvaccinated, 22-year-old Quarter Horse gelding. The horse became ataxic and began to exhibit a fever on [28 Nov 2022]. Then, as his signs got worse, he was euthanized [29 Nov 2022]. The horse also had neuroendocrine carcinoma, which likely contributed to his illness.

The horse had been at the rescue for 3 weeks and had been with its previous owner for more than 10 years. The horse had no history of being vaccinated against arboviruses.

State officials did not disclose the name of the animal rescue.

WNV is a mosquito-borne virus. It primarily causes disease in birds, humans, and horses. Since 1999, more than 27 600 horses in the U.S. have been confirmed with WNV, with an estimated fatality rate of 30-40%, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center. There is currently no cure for WNV.

[A vaccine is available for horses. The WNV vaccine is often combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. One vaccine to help prevent potentially deadly consequences for your horses is something every horse owner should use. Please consult your veterinarian regarding getting your horse vaccinated. Also remember to use mosquito/fly spray approved for use on horses. Some components of sprays not specifically approved for horses can cause serious problems.

In addition, please pay attention when a health department has a news release regarding mosquito trapping or birds with WNV or EEE. These are early warning signs to vaccinate your horses.

Finally, remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations that can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
