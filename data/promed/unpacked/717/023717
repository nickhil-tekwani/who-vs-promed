Cassava farmers in Nwoya District have failed to find suitable cuttings for planting following the outbreak of cassava brown streak. The disease ravaged their cassava gardens between 2017 and 2019. Following the outbreak of brown streak, the district agricultural and production department asked farmers to halt planting cassava in order to contain the spread of the disease that had been reported in four sub-counties. [They] also advised farmers to fallow their gardens in preparation for the next planting season.

Nwoya Cassava and Rice Growers' Cooperative Society [NCRG], whose 20 acres [about 8 ha] of cassava was wiped out by the virus in mid-2018, said they had planted NAROCASS 1 cassava. The variety has been recently introduced by the government and is reported to be weather and disease resistant. NCRG said they want to plant 35 acres [about 14 ha] of the same variety but are constrained by a lack of cuttings.

[A] district agricultural officer said that cassava cuttings [are shipped] and distributed at night to avoid inspection by authorities. To transport cassava cuttings from one district to another, [it] is required to possess a certificate of no objection and movement permit. But some were bringing [in] cuttings without asking the authorities to inspect them. Those who are still experiencing the outbreak should destroy the old varieties [and] embrace the new disease-resistant cassavas to minimise loss by viral infection.

[Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD; also called root rot) can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ (UCBSV; both genus _Ipomovirus_). Coinfections of both viruses in the same plant also exist (ProMED post 20190214.6315604), but possible synergism or other interactions in the host still need to be clarified. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20 to 80% have been reported; losses in individual root weight of up to 70% have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The viruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and are spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, as well as vector control. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements. Identification of alternative hosts from unrelated plant families for CBSV and UCBSV (ProMED post 20181223.6221346 and see link below) indicate that reservoir hosts may have an impact on the epidemiology of CBSD.

CBSD is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa where cassava is a major food crop. Recent outbreaks appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED post 20130508.1698543). CBSD poses a particular risk to new crop varieties developed with resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_; transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED post 20110829.2643).

In Uganda, the NAROCASS 1 variety mentioned above (developed by the National Agricultural Research Organization) has shown a level of tolerance to both CBSD and CMD in the field, but molecular genetic assessment appears to be still needed (see link below).
