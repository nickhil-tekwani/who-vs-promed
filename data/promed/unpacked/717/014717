The death toll from an encephalitis epidemic in northern India is nearing 400
with about a dozen people, mostly children, dying daily, a senior health
official said on Thursday.
"Around 10-15 people have been dying almost daily for the past 3 weeks. The
toll should now be touching 400," O.P. Singh, director-general of health
services in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters.
He said 11 patients died in the past 24 hours in the worst-affected Gorakhpur
district.
Around 1100 people, mostly children aged 5-13 years, have been hit by the
brain fever in the district since the outbreak was first reported there on 27
Jul 2005, he said.
Encephalitis proliferates in water-logged parts of India during the monsoon
season [because of massive mosquito breeding. - Mod.JW]. According to official
estimates, about 1500 people had died of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh in the
past 27 years.
The disease leads to an acute form of brain fever caused by a virus [Japanese
encephalitis virus, see also ref: 20050825.2514] spread by mosquitoes.

As an encephalitis outbreak rages in northern India and neighboring Nepal, a
vaccine in China could have been used to keep more than 360 children from
dying and hundreds more from likely suffering a lifetime of mental and
physical disabilities.
But borders and politics complicate the issue, making access impossible
without money and a strong political will, researchers say.
The children are dying from Japanese encephalitis [JE], found only in Asia.
Though closely related to West Nile virus, this illness isn't as widely known
as other mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria or dengue fever. But it is
the leading cause of viral encephalitis and neurological infection in Asia,
typically attacking the poor and the young -- children aged one to 15 years
who live near rice paddies in rural areas.
The outbreak in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, began last month
[August 2005] and has left more than 1000 hospitalized, while more children
die each day. In Nepal, the disease has been spreading since April [2005] in
the country's south, across the border from Uttar Pradesh.
Blinding headaches, seizures, nausea and high fever usually precede death,
with the situation becoming so dire in India that doctors are using makeshift
oxygen masks fashioned from cardboard cones and tubing on child victims after
hospitals ran out of the real thing.
While drastically underreported, about 50 000 cases of Japanese encephalitis
are recorded each year, including 15 000 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Of the survivors, up to 75 percent suffer disabilities,
including paralysis and mental retardation. The disease has no cure or
effective treatment.
The Chinese vaccine, made from a weakened form of the virus, has been used
widely within that country since 1988. Last year [2004], about 200 deaths were
reported nationwide, according to the Chinese Ministry of Health.
American Dr Scott Halstead, research director at the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine
Initiative, has seen firsthand how well it works. He conducted a study in
Nepal in 1999 that showed one injection of the Chinese vaccine was effective
almost immediately with no side effects.
So far only South Korea, Nepal & Sri Lanka have licensed the Chinese vaccine.
The WHO in May [2005] adopted a 10-year global strategy to increase
immunizations for different diseases worldwide, including Japanese
encephalitis. But the Chinese vaccine has not yet been added to its list of
prequalified vaccines, which could be a deterrent for some countries waiting
for the UN health agency's nod of approval. It also keeps UN agencies in Asian
countries from procuring the vaccine.
WHO's Joachim Hombach in Geneva said he expects to see the Chinese vaccine or
others now under development added to WHO's list in 2-3 years. He said the
Chinese manufacturer has not yet asked WHO to prequalify the vaccine, but it
has recently been reviewed and the WHO has published recommendations on it.
"If the product is not prequalified, it doesn't mean you cannot use it. It
doesn't mean the product is bad," he said. "It just means we have not seen
it." He added that no encephalitis vaccines have been prequalified by the
WHO, including the [JE] mouse brain vaccine used widely in the US and Europe.
Halstead urged affected countries not to wait for the WHO's endorsement but to
instead license the vaccine now and begin immunizing children in high-risk
areas. He said, "Here with JE you've got a vaccine that really works. There's
no need to ... procrastinate."

[The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis is still spreading without a sign of
slowing down. The immediate solution should be control of the mosquito
population, such as elimination of mosquito breeding grounds, larviciding, and
mobilization of public efforts as well as political leadership. - Mod.RY]
