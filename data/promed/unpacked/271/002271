From: Clifford James Jolly <cjj1@is.nyu.edu>

I just got back from vacation, and read your message and Robin Dunbar's
response. My colleague Jane Phillips-Conroy and I have worked on baboons
and other primates in Ethiopia for many years, and have never experienced
or heard of anything like the "epidemic" described. Robin's comment said
most of what's important; the most likely species involved is the olive
baboon. If the size of the groups' is not exaggerated, however, another
possibility is hamadryas baboons (_Papio hamadryas_) which don't live on
Bale mountain itself, but are not far away.
I have not been able to locate the places mentioned exactly. In
Amharic-English dictionaries, "jinjero" (= baboon), "tota" (= vervet
monkey) and/or "guereza" (= colobus) are often translated as "ape or
monkey", hence the confusion about apes, I suspect. The "wild pigs" might
be warthogs (_Phacochoerus_) or bushpigs (_Potamochoerus_), according to
habitat.
I have no informed ideas about the cause of the deaths. It may well be an
infectious disease, but I'd also suspect poisoning. There are very few
places in highland Ethiopia that are not farmed, and pesticides have become
more available in recent years. The wild pigs might well have been infected
with a virus by eating the baboon carcasses, but they also eat very much
the same kinds of things that the baboons eat, and so could have picked up
the same contaminant. Perhaps the symptoms might ring a bell with a
toxicologist. I would be very interested to hear what you learn about the
case - my interest is not entirely academic!
