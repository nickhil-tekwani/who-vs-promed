Thai province of Prachuap Khiri Khan declared animal epidemic areas
-----------------------
All districts except 2 in the Thai province of Prachuap Khiri Khan have
been declared as animal epidemic areas, as a large number of cattle in the
areas are suffering from foot and mouth disease (FMD), according to a
senior livestock official.
Pongsak Chaisit, acting provincial livestock officer, was quoted by Thai
News Agency as saying on Saturday that a large number of cattle in all
districts in the western Thai province, except Bang Saphan and Bang Saphan
Noi, were found [infected] with FMD.
"The districts are therefore now declared animal epidemic areas, as
Prachuap Khiri Khan is a major transit point of cattle transport down to
other provinces in the South, and even to neighboring countries," he said.
To prevent the infectious disease, animals were being vaccinated, he stated.
Local consumers were also advised to wash and fully boil all pieces of meat
before they were served, he suggested.
"This is for the sake of their own safety until the temporary declaration
of the disease-stricken areas is lifted," the officer added.

Livestock officials would vaccinate farm animals in all areas to stop the
