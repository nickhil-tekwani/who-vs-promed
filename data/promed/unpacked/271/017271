On [18 Jan 2020], 0 cases were cured, 5 cases were discharged, 59 cases were newly added, and 1 died. On [19 Jan 2020], 0-22 hours, 1 case was discharged, and 77 cases were newly added.

On the basis of continuously regulating the operation of pre-screening and triage of all types of medical institutions at all levels, our city has further increased the screening of suspected cases of pneumonia due to new coronavirus in accordance with the newly revised pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection. At the same time, we will further improve the detection scheme, optimize the detection process, and speed up detection. The national, provincial and municipal expert groups conducted comprehensive investigations based on clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, and pathogenic test results. On [18 Jan 2020], 59 newly confirmed cases of pneumonia with new coronavirus infections were newly identified, and on [19 Jan 2020], new coronavirus infections were newly identified. There were 77 confirmed cases of pneumonia, and 136 newly confirmed cases in 2 days.

Of the 136 patients, 66 were male and 70 were female; the youngest was 25 years old and the oldest was 89 years old; the onset dates were before [18 Jan 2020]; the 1st symptoms were mostly fever, cough or chest tightness, and dyspnea. According to the newly revised diagnosis and treatment plan, patients were classified according to their severity and criticality, including 100 mild cases, 33 severe cases, and 3 critical cases (including 1 death). Epidemiological investigations of new cases are underway, and close contacts are being tracked.

As of 22:00 on [19 Jan 2020], 198 cases of pneumonia of new coronavirus infections have been reported in our city; 25 cases have been cured, and 3 cases have been discharged. Currently, 170 cases are still being treated in the hospital, of which 126 cases are mild, 35 cases are severe, and 9 cases are critically ill. They are all under isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. A total of 817 close contacts have been tracked, 727 medical observations have been lifted, and 90 medical observations are still underway. No related cases were found among the close contacts. We will continue to conduct timely sampling and detection of newly discovered suspected cases.

Winter and spring are the seasons with high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the period with high incidence of viral pneumonia. Experts advise that citizens should pay attention to cold protection, indoor ventilation, and personal hygiene, strengthen physical exercise, maintain a light diet, and avoid activities in crowded places. Wear a face mask or cover your mouth and nose with tissues or clothing when you have a cough or sneeze to reduce the spread of germs. Pay close attention to symptoms such as fever and cough. Seek immediate medical attention when such symptoms occur.

He returned to Shenzhen on [4 Jan 2020], and went to Shenzhen [Hospital?] on [11 Jan 2020]. In hospital isolation treatment and confirmed by the provincial and municipal disease control centers using optimized test kits, he was positive for new coronavirus nucleic acids. On [18 Jan 2020], the specimens were sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for viral nucleic acid review testing, and the results were positive. On [19 Jan 2020], the case was evaluated and confirmed by the experts of the diagnosis team under the Epidemic Leadership Group of the National Health and Health Commission and the content of the "New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Implementation)," and the expert group agreed that this case was a confirmed case of pneumonitis infected by a novel coronavirus. The patient is now in stable condition. Guangdong Province has followed up close contacts.

At present, Guangdong Province is doing its best to treat patients, conducting in-depth epidemiological investigations, strengthening close contact follow-up management, strengthening pre-test and triage of fever clinics, standardizing the monitoring, screening, diagnosis and treatment of suspicious cases, and in-depth development.

Experts judged that the current epidemic situation is still preventable and controllable. Experts remind the public that it is currently in the season of high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, in winter and spring. It is recommended to take good personal hygiene protection, pay attention to maintaining indoor environmental hygiene and air circulation, and minimize activities in public places with no air circulation or dense crowds. With symptoms of infection, please go to a medical institution quickly.

Shenzhen is located near the border of Guangdong with Hong Kong. To date, there have been 99 suspected cases of infection with the novel CoV reported by Hong Kong, but none have been confirmed as infected by laboratory testing.
