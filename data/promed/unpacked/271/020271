Bluetongue disease is spreading rapidly. According to the information given by Hussein Ataben, Director of the Veterinary Department [Northern Cyprus, TRNC], 5 flocks have been found affected on [Mon 3 Oct 2016] in 3 villages: Beyarmudu (2 flocks), Akincilar (2 flocks), and Yigitler (1 flock). Samples were found positive for the bluetongue virus by the national laboratory, and submitted further to the Turkish reference centre in Ankara for serotyping.

Cooperation with the Veterinary Services of the Republic of Cyprus has been initiated, and precautionary measures undertaken to prevent the further spread of the virus which potentially may cause severe losses in sheep. Bluetongue is not zoonotic.

[In the previous posting (20161006.4542090) we inquired about the locations of the 5 reported outbreaks in North Cyprus. These have now been found in the local press in Turkish. The villages Beyarmudu and Akincilar are located very close to the demarcation line between Larnaca district (in which 20 outbreaks have been reported so far) and the southern part of Northern Cyprus. Their locations on the map are to be seen, respectively, at http://tinyurl.com/zd3e3pf and http://tinyurl.com/gswlwl5. Yigitler is several kilometers further northwest (map at http://tinyurl.com/j5fhz4d). All are thus close to the affected area in the Republic of Cyprus.

In Cyprus' follow-up report no 1, the location of outbreak no 2 (out of 4 outbreaks) was given as "Pirga, Lefkosia, Lefkosia" (20160923.4510982). Lefkosia is the Turkish name of Nicosia. The corresponding OIE map did not show an outbreak in the Nicosia area. The information of a BT outbreak in this (northern) part of Cyprus is in need of verification.

Bluetongue of certain serotypes causes a serious disease in susceptible sheep breeds Several severe epizootics have been registered in Cyprus since 1924. On top of its immediate impact, the BTV is known to cause debilitating effect followed by a long convalescence period and may cause reduced milk production in dairy sheep of susceptible breeds.

One of Cyprus' main export products is the renown halloumi cheese, produced from (at least 51 percent) sheep and goat's milk. Halloumi exports have been increasing year after year to the tune of 15 to 20 percent, bringing in a revenue of 103 million Euro (about USD 115 million) in 2015. In case uncontrolled, BTV has the potential to severely affect this industry in the Republic of Cyprus and in Northern Cyprus. - Mod.AS
