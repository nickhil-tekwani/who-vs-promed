The Center For Disease Control [CDC] said a new and deadly superbug is sweeping the nation's hospitals. It has hit more than 200 hospitals in the U.S. in only 6 months and last month [March 2013] appeared for the 1st time in Bakersfield at several hospitals.

Those hospitals discovered carbapenem resistant enterobacteria known as CRE. It's a drug-resistant bacterium that could kill someone and he or she wouldn't even know it. Kern Medical Center, San Joaquin Community Hospital and Mercy Hospital Downtown each discovered a case of CRE last month.

The [CDC] said CRE is bacteria from the human colon that poses a triple threat: It is resistant to almost all antibiotics, spreads its resistance to other bacteria and can kill 50 percent of infected patients. It's usually found in nursing homes and hospitals.

People at risk are those with compromised immune systems and patients undergoing treatment in hospitals, especially those using temporary medical devices like catheters or ventilators, which is prime breeding ground for CRE.

"They can appear almost anywhere and with lots of different symptoms," said KMC'S Chief of Infectious Diseases Doctor Royce Johnson. Johnson said CRE is typically stumbled upon during medical tests. "There is no possibility you will know you have a CRE until the organism is cultured and (doctors) tell you," said Johnson. "They are very difficult to treat and [treatment] is done with high levels of antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics and removing temporary medical devices as soon as possible," said County Public Health Department Lab Director Dr. Michael Lancaster.

Hospitals handle CRE cases by isolating patients, washing hands frequently, having people wear gowns and masks and thoroughly cleaning everything. Doctors are reminding people not to take antibiotics unless they are prescribed, otherwise you could be putting yourself at risk for CRE.

[The Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that includes _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Yersinia pestis_, _Klebsiella_, _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_, and _Citrobacter_, some of which live in the intestines of humans and other animals.

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Enterobacteriaceae, drug resistant - USA 20130306.1572873:

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems develops commonly because organisms acquire the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs; NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the U.S., but have also been reported worldwide.

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) were first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name) and were subsequently found in _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic and otherwise suboptimal antibiotics.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of health care personnel, and environmental surfaces (for example bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within health care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

CRE are easy to transfer from patient to patient. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of these organisms and any other multidrug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and CRE patients (i.e., segregating CRE-colonized or CRE-infected patients and the health-care personnel who care for them from those without CRE and the health-care personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w).

Bakersfield is a city near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley in Kern County, California and is about 110 miles (180 km) to the north of the city of Los Angeles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California). The city's population was 347,483 in the 2010 census.
