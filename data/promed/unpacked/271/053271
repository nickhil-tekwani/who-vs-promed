Aichi 5th to get hit in bird flu crisis
---------------------------------------
Chickens at a poultry farm in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, have tested
positive for avian influenza, the prefectural government said Thursday
[27 Jan 2011], confirming the 5th outbreak this winter. Authorities
started slaughtering all 150 000 chickens at the farm and banned
transport of the estimated 2.6 million chickens and eggs at the 44
poultry farms within 10 km [6.2 miles] of it, including part of
neighboring Kosai, Shizuoka Prefecture. Officials are now seeking land
to bury the carcasses.

The Aichi Prefectural Government said earlier in the day that the
chickens had tested negative for bird flu but revised that finding
after data from the National Institute of Animal Health showed they
were infected with a highly virulent H5 strain, according to
prefectural officials.

About 800 birds died between Sunday [23 Jan 2011] and Wednesday [26
Jan 2011] at the chicken farm, and 4 out of a sample of 5 birds tested
positive, the prefectural government said. The poultry house where the
dead birds were found had no windows, denying easy access to wild
birds. The outbreak raised serious concerns among local poultry farmers.

"If the outbreak continues, it will lead some farmers to pull out of
the business due to fears for their future," said a senior official in
Toyohashi's chicken farm cooperative. "We want the central government
to consider lifting the ban on use of vaccines currently prohibited in
Japan," the 75-year-old official said.

Aichi is a major grower of egg-producing hens. As of February 2009,
the prefecture had roughly 7.45 million chickens, the 3rd most in the
country. Prior to the Aichi case, bird flu was confirmed at poultry
farms in Shimane, Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, while the virus
has been detected in wild birds at several sites.

At a farm in Shintomi, Miyazaki Prefecture, local authorities finished
killing 410 000 chickens at 12 farm structures Thursday afternoon [27
Jan 2011], the prefecture said. The avian flu virus was confirmed
Monday [24 Jan 2011] at those farms. In the same afternoon, the
central government convened an emergency meeting to discuss how to
deal with the outbreaks.

"If it is highly likely that wild birds are spreading the flu virus,
we have to order poultry farms to implement thorough preventive
measures so their birds will not contract the flu from wild birds,"
Prime Minister Naoto Kan told his ministers. The agriculture ministry
also dispatched officials to Aichi Prefecture to start investigating
the cause.

In Toyohashi, the avian flu virus was detected at quail farms in 2009,
prompting the prefectural government to slaughter 1.6 million quails.

The highly infectious H5N1 avian flu strain has been spreading this
winter at an unprecedented pace throughout the nation, with Aichi
Prefecture the latest prefecture affected.

Not one single case of bird flu was detected among livestock from
around the end of 2009 to the beginning of last year [2010], but this
winter, the virus has been detected in wild duck droppings in Hokkaido
and a flu outbreak was confirmed at a poultry farm in Shimane
Prefecture in late November [2010]. Cranes and other wild birds in
Kagoshima Prefecture were then found to be infected with bird flu,
which spread to livestock in Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures toward
the end of January.

Avian flu was confirmed in Aichi Prefecture on Thursday [27 Jan 2011]
[in a chicken farm; see item 1]. The route of infection has not been
established in all cases, but it is highly likely that migratory birds
from the north were carriers of the infectious disease. An infected
poultry farm in Izumi, Kagoshima Prefecture, is located close to the
wintering ground for cranes flying from Siberia and other northern
areas.

In the case of Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture, the poultry farm affected
was close to a brackish lake, Nakaumi, known as a wintering ground for
migratory birds. The lake extends over Shimane and Tottori
prefectures. It is possible that migratory birds left droppings
containing the virus in the lake, and sparrows and other small birds
infected through the water transported the virus to the poultry farm.

However, it is not easy to determine the route of infection. When bird
flu was found in February and March in 2009 at quail farms in Aichi
Prefecture, the infection routes were not identified.

"I don't know why, but there's no doubt the number of birds carrying
the virus from the Asian continent is larger than usual this season,"
a senior official of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry
said. "We must be on full alert for possible outbreaks of bird flu
until around March, when bird migrations end," he said.

[We are indebted to Mike Nunn, who has submitted earlier information
on the evolvement of H5N1 in Japan.

Japan's reporting to the OIE on H5N1 is done separately on domestic
poultry and wild birds. A summary, with map, on the disease in
domestic poultry is available at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9999>; so
far, 6 reports have been submitted, pertaining to 4 outbreaks. The
last report (follow-up report No 5) was submitted on 25 Jan 2011.

A total of 4 reports on H5N1 in wild birds, pertaining to 5 outbreaks,
have been submitted since 20 Dec 2010. Their summary is available,
with a map, at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10072>. The
last report (follow-up report Number 3) was submitted on 25 Jan 2011.

[Sparrows and other small birds do not drink lake water, but sip from
shallow puddles and livestock water troughs, so would not have been
contaminated from the lake. - Mod.JW]
