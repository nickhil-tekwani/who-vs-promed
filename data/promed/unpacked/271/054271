The Ho Chi Minh City Department of Health announced a suspected case
of bird flu virus on 16 March [2010]. The patient, a 3-year-old child
from Thuan An district, Binh Duong province, was hospitalised with
symptoms of petechial fever, but she then tested positive for the
A/H5N1 virus and is now under quarantine for treatment at Nhi Dong
hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.

"There are many poultry breeders around the patient's house," said her family.

The Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Pasteur Institute have sent
medical experts to Nhi Dong hospital for consultation and samples
have been taken for medical tests. The final result will be announced
on 17 Mar [2010].

The Pasteur Institute will send officials to the patient's living
quarters for inspection and put those who have contact with her in quarantine.
