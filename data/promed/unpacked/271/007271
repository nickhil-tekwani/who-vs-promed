Initial reports confirm bird flu in Bengal
------------------------------------------
The initial reports of bird flu among the poultry population in this
part of West Bengal's Birbhum district galvanised the top district
administration into holding a series of meetings through Monday [14
Jan 2008], even as villagers remained unaware of the causes and
feasted on chicken curry to make the best of a huge loss.

Abhijit Roychoudhury, block medical officer of health (BMOH) of the
affected Rampurhat Block II, said: "We have been informed that, after
primary screening, H5N1 virus has been identified. We are taking a
number of measures. A medical team is being prepared. Already Tamiflu
drugs are here. Now it is up to union government to notify the area
as affected by H5N1. We will take action after the notification,"
Roychoudhury said after a marathon meeting with district officials
and doctors. Tamiflu is the standard antiviral drug used for H5N1
infections in humans.

The Union government has sent 2 experts from the Institute of
Communicable Diseases to the area. The experts met with medical
officers who were brought to Margram from several parts of the
district. Although the state government's alert reached the district
magistrate on Sunday evening [13 Jan 2008], ground staff of the
animal husbandry and resources development department were yet to be
sent into action and villagers were alerted to the seriousness of the
situation only by the appearance of media.

Officials of the animal resources development department had
collected samples from Margram I and Margram II gram panchayat areas
under Rampurhat Block II on 8 Jan 2008 and sent them for testing to
the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal. On Sunday [13
Jan 2008] evening, the Bhopal lab sent a message to the state
government confirming the presence of the bird flue virus.

The district's chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Sunil Kumar
Bhowmick, said: "Preliminary tests have confirmed that this is bird
flu. It has already been reported to the district administration. An
isolation ward has been opened in Rampurhat hospital."

With around 15 000 birds estimated to have died since 29 Dec 2007,
when the 1st reports of unusual deaths surfaced here, dead birds lie
all over the landscape and no steps were visible to contain the
spread of the virus -- which shows itself 1st by causing drowsiness
in the hens in the morning and completes its job by evening.

The block livestock development officer (BLDO) of Margram II, Debrup
Roy, said: "I came to know only today."

In fact, till Sunday evening, a shop opposite the block office was
selling chicken meat.

The organised poultry sector has not been affected so far, since
there are no major hatcheries here. The H5NI avian influenza virus,
which can be lethal for humans as well, has hit the population of
free-range birds reared in almost every household in the area of
Birbhum district bordering Murshidabad. Villagers, most of them
farmers, rear livestock as well as the free-range 'desi' murgi, with
their distinctive bright feathers, for sale in the local haat or for
their eggs.

The bird flu attack has hit the villagers economically, but, used to
attacks of less dangerous Ranikhet disease, they have been killing
the ailing birds and cooking them. Kazem Sheik of Begumpara in
Margram, has lost all his 40-odd birds over the last 12 days.

"Initially, we had a lot of chicken curry," said Sheikh. "Now we have
only one hen left."

Gaffar Sheikh, one such villager, said his wife made some chicken
curry on Sunday, which their children had for lunch. The couple had
planned to have the curry for dinner, but the children fell ill at
night with bouts of diarrhoea. Their illness is not linked to bird
flu, but the medical officer said those handling blood or droppings
of the affected birds are in danger of contracting the virus.

Meershad Sheikh, another villager in Margram II, lost around 15 birds
and has only hen left with its chicks.

Government confirms bird flu in West Bengal
----------------------------------------------------
The Centre on Tuesday [15 Jan 2008] confirmed an outbreak of bird flu
in 2 districts of West Bengal, a day after the state government
declared an alert in the area.

"Samples have been tested positive," a government official said. The
samples of the dead birds had been sent to High Security Animal
Disease Laboratory (HSADL) in Bhopal to find out whether the death of
poultry was due to Avian Influenza, commonly known as Bird Flu.

"It is a localised occurrence of bird flu in the 2 districts of West
Bengal namely Birbhum and South Dinajpur," the official said. The
Centre as a precautionary measure had restricted trade and movement
of poultry birds in these 2 districts.

The Health Ministry had on Monday dispatched a team from the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases to West Bengal. The parallel
samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.
Meanwhile in West Bengal, the Birbhum district administration has
dispatched 50 special teams to help people dispose of dead chickens
in Rampurhat sub-division where a bird alert has been sounded.

An emergency meeting of all the Block Development Officers (BDO) of
Rampurhat Sub-division has also been called on Tuesday to discuss the
issue, official sources said. Unofficial reports said at least 20 000
chickens have died so far. The state Health Department has also
formed 12 teams, each comprising a doctor and other health workers,
to start rapid culling of the birds in the case an outbreak is
confirmed, District Magistrate Tapan Shome said.

The assistant director of the Animal Husbandry department at the
Centre, AB Negi, on Tuesday visited Rampurhat sub-division of the
district. An isolation ward had been opened in the Rampurhat district
hospital to treat any possible cases of human bird flu.
