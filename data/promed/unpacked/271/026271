I would appreciate comments from anyone with experience involving
unusual complications from _Bordetella pertussis_ infection. I am
particularly interested in information regarding neurological
complications. We have a patient who is currently on a respirator
with encephalitis that thus far has tested negative for all of the
usual culprits, i.e. Herpes, arboviruses, rabies, etc. The patient
had a week or 2 of a "sinus infection" which then turned into
vomiting for an additional week, and then evolved into "mental status
changes."
She is a 32-year-old kindergarten teacher with no additional history
that is remarkable. The only laboratory result that has been of
interest is an extremely high titer (serum) of IgM antibody to _B.
pertussis_ from a commercial laboratory. The original whole-cell _B.
pertussis_ vaccine was notorious for causing neurological
consequences, and I have had a difficult time finding information
regarding the mechanism for this neurological association!
Apparently the organism itself has, on rare occasions, been
associated with encephalitis as a consequence of some of the toxins
that are produced. We have had other cases of encephalitis in which
the etiology has remained elusive. Historically, we have not
routinely tested these encephalitis cases for _Bordetella pertussis_.
Additional information which may be of interest, is that the patient
has tested negative for _B. pertussis_ by nasal aspirate PCR and has
been negative on various cultures. The organism, from my
understanding, remains within the confines of the respiratory tract,
and patients generally do not become bacteremic. Failure to culture,
or identify with PCR does not exclusively rule out infection,
especially when the testing is done well into the course of illness.
Any and all comments regarding the association of _B. pertussis_ with
neurological disease, and with the mechanism for neurological
complications from vaccination, would be much appreciated.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate reader comments on the neurological
complications of pertussis, especially in adults. Although most of
the recent literature in this area deals with potential neurological
events associated with pertussis vaccination, it is clear that CNS
abnormalities are not rare in younger children infected with
pertussis. In one report in children under 12 months of age in the
1980s who were hospitalized with pertussis, 3 percent had seizures
and 0.9 percent had an encephalopathy (ref 1). The mechanism of CNS
disease in pertussis is undefined, but among possibilities (ref. 2)
include CNS hemorrhage from increased intracranial pressure during
cough paroxysms, hypoxia during paroxysms, vascular occlusion due to
leukocyte or platelet 'activation', a direct effect of a pertussis on
the CNS, and inflammation of the CNS enhanced by the adjuvant effect
of a pertussis toxin.
Encephalopathy from pertussis has been described in an adult who had
cough paroxysms (see Ref. 3). His symptoms were seizures, brief loss
of consciousness, and confusion. Of interest, this patient's
diagnosis was confirmed by serological tests, as in the Ms. Oliver
presents. Usually, the antibody testing is used for serosurveys, not
individual diagnoses. The case outlined in the current posting also
did not seem to have the cough paroxysms seen in most of the CNS
complications of pertussis, ruling out the first 2 causes suggested
above.
