Cassava-based sweet downs 22 at church youth camp
---------------------------------------------------
22 participants in a church-sponsored youth camp in the southern
Negros Occidental town of Cauayan were rushed to a hospital because
of food poisoning after eating a cassava-based sweet Wed morning, 4
May 2005.
A 17-year-old student from the barangay Carol-an, Kabankalan City,
said she and the other victims felt itching in their throat. They
later felt light-headed and nauseous. The symptoms started a few
minutes after eating alupi, a native delicacy made from cassava,
which they bought from a still-unidentified vendor.
Interviewed by phone from the Cauayan District Hospital, where she
and the other victims were rushed for treatment, this student, one of
7 who needed to be confined, said she noticed nothing wrong with the
alupi, which was wrapped in banana leaves.
"It was sweet but soon after eating, I felt my throat starting to
itch," she said. "Then I felt dizzy and nauseous and I became very
weak and could not prevent my eyes from closing."
She said that she "cannot even recall how I was brought on board the
vehicle that brought us to the hospital. The next thing I remember is
I was vomiting inside the vehicle."
Pastor Dante Hervas, a camp director, said the youth camp is an
annual activity of Baptist churches in the hinterlands of Kabankalan
City and Candoni in Negros Occidental and the town of Mabinay, Negros
Oriental. Around 450 participants joined the camp in 2005.
Aside from the 7 youths, aged 17 to 21, confined at the hospital,
Herva said the 15 other victims were discharged after being given
emergency treatment. The 7, he said, had been declared out of
danger. This incident came almost 2 months after 27 schoolchildren in
the town of Mabini, Bohol, died and some 60 others were hospitalized
after eating maruya, another cassava-based delicacy [which was
contaminated with a pesticide - Mod.LL].

[The etiology of the poisoning here is not as yet elaborated.
Symptoms resulting from exposure to nonlethal concentrations of
cyanide include breathing difficulties, nervousness, vertigo,
headache, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, and electrocardiogram
(EKG) abnormalities.
Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_, Crantz) is a root crop widely consumed
in the Philippines as well as in Africa and South America. Although
it originated in Brazil (where it is called manioc), it was brought
to Africa by Portuguese colonists, and it is now an important crop
there and in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is the principal source
of nutrition for about 500 million people. Its leaves are edible, but
the prize is its starchy root, rich in protein, minerals, and
vitamins A, B and C.
Cassava is used in a vast variety of cakes, snacks, and desserts and
grows wild in many places, being tough and drought-resistant. In a
country where hunger is now a reality for many poor households,
cassava is among those food crops that can make the crucial
difference between starvation and survival. Cassava roots are
excellent sources of energy, while the leaves, which are also cooked
and eaten, contain vitamins A and C, calcium, protein, and iron. The
cassava plant is the world's 3rd most important crop. Cassava enters
the North American diet also -- as it is made into tapioca.
Surprising for an important edible plant, cassava is quite poisonous
without proper preparation. The toxin in cassava is called linamarin.
When eaten raw or inadequately prepared, the human digestive system
will convert this to cyanide. Even 2 cassava roots contain a fatal
dose of poison.
While the bitter variety (white cassava) of the plant has larger
concentrations of cyanide than the sweet variety (yellow cassava),
the sweet cassava is not without risk.
To prepare cassava, it is peeled and grated and soaked in warm water
for several days. This allows the cassava's own natural enzyme
(linamarase) to convert the cyanogen linamarin to sugar and cyanide
gas, and the volatile gas disperses usually harmlessly. However,
women -- who are usually charged with processing the plant -- can be
sickened by inhaling cyanide gas. What remains after processing can
be boiled and eaten, or more usually, dried and ground.
The shelf life of a cassava root is quite short once it is removed
from the stem, so there's an urgency to get the food to market. Roots
can turn to mush in less than a week. The rush to get cassava to the
market may keep some batches of cassava from being processed properly.
Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the
development of goiter and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a
nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and
uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines,
when there is obviously pressure to process the cassava more rapidly,
is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible
paralytic disorder called konzo and, in some cases, death. The
incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3
percent in some areas of Africa.
In an effort to avoid this toxicity, it has been reported by
Siritunga and Sayre (1) that transgenic cassava free of cyanogens can
be produced. The investigators generated transgenic plants in which
cytochrome oxidase enzymes that catalyze the 1st step in linamarin
synthesis are inhibited. The plants showed a 94-percent reduction in
leaf linamarin content and a 99-percent decrease in root linamarin
levels. Additionally, the same group (2) has reported that transgenic
cassava plants can be produced that overexpress the gene for
hydroxynitrile lyase, facilitating cyanogenesis during processing and
producing a final product with less risk. The tubers of cassava do
not have this enzyme, and processing relies on spontaneous
conversion. Combining these methods could further decrease the risk
of cyanide poisoning from cassava.
The mechanism of rapid deterioration relates to the inevitable
traumatic consequences of harvest. The trauma initiates a chain of
events leading to spoiling, which often precedes invasion by any
microorganism. The phenylpropanoid pathway seems integrally involved
in this. Genetic manipulation of the system may be useful in slowing
deterioration.
