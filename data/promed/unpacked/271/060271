2 outbreaks of bluetongue (BT) disease were recently detected in Saone-et-Loire and 2 others were found in the Nievre [Burgundy region].

The export port of Sete (Herault) is no longer included in the restriction areas where livestock movements are limited to contain the spread of bluetongue, which now stands at 143 confirmed outbreaks.

The port of Sete, hub of the export of live cattle to the Mediterranean was excluded from the areas called "regulated" by a decree published [Thu 31 Dec 2015] in the Official Gazette.

The destination of Turkey, which is the 3rd largest market for French cattle breeders, comes under the port of Sete. This follows the satisfactory results of a port monitoring plan, in which insect traps were installed to verify that the insect vectors of bluetongue were not there, the ministry of Agriculture said to AFP (Agence France-Press). The animals from disease-free areas can now be exported via Sete, after observing the health rules designated for crossing the infected areas.

Meanwhile, 8 new cases of bluetongue have been detected since 17 Dec 2015, bringing to 143 the number of outbreaks confirmed since the beginning of the epidemic in September 2015, the ministry said. These cases have been found in the departments of Correze [Limousin region], Isere [Rhone-Alpes region], Saone-et-Loire, and Yonne [Burgundy region], which were already in restricted areas.

Of the 14 departments affected, 2/3 are concentrated in infected farms in the Puy-de-Dome and Allier [Auvergne region].

Regulated areas cover 44 metropolitan departments, including all regions of Auvergne, Burgundy, Centre, and Limousin.

[The recent BTV-8 event in France started, reportedly, on 21 Aug 2015 in the central region, and was confirmed on 11 Sep 2015.

So far, France has submitted to the OIE a total of 17 reports on this continuing event, 16 of which are follow-up reports, addressing a total of 140 outbreaks in cattle and sheep. The most recent follow-up report, no. 16, was submitted on 24 Dec 2015 and distributed by the OIE on 28 Dec 2015. The accumulated/summarized statistics, as of 24 Dec 2015, were as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 24 258 / 211 / 0 / 0 / 0 /
Sheep / 2356 / 10 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep and goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

The summary above is derived from OIE's WAHID archive, where a map showing all 140 outbreaks is also available; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019412_20151228_152510.pdf.

The information on mortality in cattle and sheep, though relatively small, is indicative of the clinical effect of this epizootic, on top of the serologically detected cases, which are probably, the majority of the reported cases.

It is anticipated that the next follow-up report will include details of the new outbreaks disclosed in the media report above. - Mod.AS
