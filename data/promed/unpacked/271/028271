(1) Mushroom poisoning - Russia (overview)

More than 50 people have been diagnosed with mushroom poisoning in
Russia since the beginning of the year [January 2007].
A total of 51 cases of poisonings with poisonous or conditionally
edible mushrooms have been registered in 11 subjects of Russian
Federation in 2007. Of this number, 10 were children under the age of
14. This information comes from Rospotrebnadzor (an Agency for
protection of consumers' rights). A decrease of incidence was
observed during the last 2 years. In 2005, 1051 cases of mushroom
poisonings were registered, with 99 of them children, and 52 of these
died. In 2006 only 295 people suffered, including 31 children and 17
fatalities.
At the same time the geography of poisonings hasn't changed. The most
affected areas are the central black earth zones. According to the
survey data, most poisoning cases occur due to consumption of
poisonous mushrooms, which look like russules, or consumption of
conditionally edible or unknown mushrooms. In the case of
conditionally edible mushrooms, the step of preliminary soaking and
boiling was omitted. Additionally, the sufferers tend to seek medical
advice late.

A woman died in Kursk because of mushroom poisoning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the "silent hunt" in the Kursk region 2 cases
of mushroom poisonings have been registered. One of them was fatal. A
56-year-old woman gathered a basket of russules and possibly a
death-cap appeared there weighing as little as 10 - 40 grams [0.35 -
1.41 ounces] and caused a severe intoxication. Doctors' struggles to
save her life were not successful. In the other case a woman in the
village Besedino was luckier, after she ingested a death cap.
Possibly the dosage was smaller or the woman' ability to respond was
stronger.
The statistics of last year [2006] showed around 100 cases of
mushroom poisonings, including 7 children under 9, and 3 fatalities.

group of students prepared an alcohol infusion from mushrooms, which
led all of them to the hospital with serious poisoning.

Jukovsk, Maloyaroslavetsk, Meshchovskoe, Babibibskoe regions.

Brest region claims mushroom poisonings
----------------------------------------------------------
Mushroom poisonings involving 4 people have been registered during
the last month, according to the information provided by Alexander
Tikhomirov, a doctor-hygienist of the Center of Hygiene, Epidemiology
and Public Health of Brest region.
Particularly, a 68-year-old woman who had eaten russules on July 14,
which she gathered in the city park. The next day she felt sick but
did not seek medical care because of slight improvement. On 17 Jul
2007 she felt worse and was admitted to the hospital with death cap
poisoning and shock. She died in the ICU on the same evening.
Tikhomirov said that it is necessary to follow some rules, such as
gathering only known mushrooms and not tasting unknown mushrooms. It
is not worth gathering mushrooms within the borders of the cities,
near to roads, industry places, dump places and depots of chemicals.
It is important to keep the leg of mushroom to identify them later.
The mushrooms gathered by children need more attention. When buying
in the market, it is necessary to request the certificate of
expertise, to check if they are clean from soil and sorted by
species. He also emphasized the importance of prompt hospitalization
and recommended performing gastric and colon lavage before the
arrival of health care specialists.
During the last year [2006] 43 poisoning cases were registered,
involving 54 people and causing 4 fatalities.

Most of these mushrooms have an initial resemblance to each other.
However there are subtle but specific differences that most people do
not key in on. It may be as little as the difference in spore sizes.
