In the past couple of weeks, veterinarians in Washington County, Florida have seen 5 cases of eastern equine encephalitis. Usually, it's typical to see this number around July. But this year [2012], a human has contracted the disease, which is very rare.

Owning a horse in Washington County is very common. Having your horse die in 24 hours is not. But that's exactly what happened to 5 horses in the past couple of weeks.

"We've seen a number of cases of encephalitis this summer [2012]. July is usually our worst month, when we have plenty of mosquitoes." Panhandle Veterinarian Dr. George said.

Eastern equine encephalitis is the most deadly mosquito-borne illness. The insect contracts the virus from a bird, and then it bites a horse, leaving the horse in an extremely dazed state.

"Once these horses come down with encephalitis, they seize; they become incumbent. Once they go down, they can't stand, and usually within 24 to 48 hours they are dead or have to be humanely euthanized." George said.

Officials say it's usually around this time of year when horses will get this disease, but it's extremely rare for it to happen to a human. "It's more likely for horses to get it, but it can happen." Washington County Mosquito Control Director Amanda Baker said.

A healthy 38-year-old man who works for Dr. George contracted it. "He went home 2 days prior to being admitted to a hospital in Dothan complaining of nausea and headaches, and the bright lights bothered him. He was admitted to Dothan, where he became unconscious, and this is his 18th day of being unconscious." George said.

The disease is preventable in horses if they are vaccinated, but humans aren't so lucky. "There is no vaccine for humans because humans contract it so rarely or come down with the disease so rarely," George said. That's why area health departments are warning residents to practice "The 4 D's:"

*Avoid being outdoors during dusk or dawn.
*Dress with clothing that covers the skin
*Use DEET repellant to keep mosquitoes away
*And get rid of drainage around the home where mosquitoes can nest.

Health officials are urging residents to follow these instructions, because rain is a constant in the summer.

Dr. George says the horses that died from the disease were not vaccinated or had not been revaccinated for months.

[The summer months are indeed the season for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) transmission. There was one EEEV-confirmed positive horse (onset 25 Jun 2012) reported from the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (FDACS) for Glades County. This was the 11th horse in the state to be reported with EEEV infection with onset during 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120714.1202101). It is unfortunate that the horses were not routinely vaccinated against eastern equine encephalitis virus infection. It is false economy to skip vaccination and place the animal at risk of death. One hopes that horse owners in the area are now alerted to the risk and that people will follow the recommended precautions to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY]

[It should be emphasized that horses cannot and do not spread the disease to humans. Horses are dead-end hosts, which means the animal cannot transmit the disease to humans or to other animals. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. The man became ill following a mosquito bite.

EEV vaccine is usually combined with vaccine against other viral diseases, such as West Nile virus, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes. The vaccine should be given to horses every 4-6 months to keep them protected. Horse owners should be very conscious of keeping the vaccines for their animals up to date. The loss of the animal is emotionally painful, and the death is completely unnecessary.

[According to data available on the CDC website, during the period 1964 through 2010, there were an average of 6 cases of EEE in humans reported annually with a range of 0-21. At the same website, there is a good map of the distribution of EEE human cases by state during the period 1964 though 2010 (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/epi.html#casesbyyear). In 2011, there were 4 human cases of EEE reported in the USA. These 4 cases occurred in residents of Massachusetts, Missouri (infection acquired in Massachusetts), New York, and Wisconsin. Dates of onset of illness occurred from August to October. Three of the 4 cases died (see West Nile Virus Disease and Other Arboviral Diseases - United States, 2011. MMWR 13 Jul 2012. 61(27);510-514).

According to the most recent issue of the MMWR (23 Jul 2012), as of 7 Jul 2012 there were no cases of human EEE disease reported, making the above report of a human case in Florida the 1st confirmed human case in the USA this year (2012) (see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6127md.htm?s_cid=mm6127md_w#tab1). - Mod.MPP]
