[Cases continue to be reported in Saudi Arabia. There were 2 newly confirmed cases both from Ash Sharqīyah province (also referred to as Eastern Province. Of the 2 newly confirmed cases reported today [2 Aug 2016], one was in a healthcare worker with presumed contact with the case reported from Jubail on 29 Aug 2016. It awaits to be seen whether there will be other cases associated with nosocomial contact in Jubail. The other case was a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in Hufoof.

[2] Thailand ex Kuwait, 1st round of tests negative
Date: 31 Jul 2016

http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1049169/young-kuwaiti-man-cleared-of-mers


An 18-year-old Kuwaiti man suspected of contracting Middle East respiratory syndrome was cleared of the virus in the 1st round of the 2 mandatory laboratory tests, director of the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute said Sunday [31 Jul 2016].

The man still had to go through another round of tests to officially confirm he was negative for the deadly virus, according to WHO guidelines. Final results for clinical specimens obtained from the patient are expected to be released on Monday [1 Aug 2016], Dr Jariya Saengsajja said.

The unnamed man arrived in Thailand on Monday [25 Jul 2016] with his father and grandmother and fell ill on Tuesday [26 Jul 2016]. The Department of Disease Control's screening measures initially indicated MERS, a highly contagious form of coronavirus. He was sent to the state-owned Bamrasnaradura institute in Nonthaburi on Thursday [28 Jul 2016] and has been treated in an isolation room.

Dr Jariya said the patient mainly had fever. His father and grandmother who also had been placed in quarantine were also negative for MERS. However, they needed to be quarantined for 14 days to observe their symptoms before being released.

Two known cases of MERS have been confirmed in Thailand, with 2 Omani nationals tested positive for the virus in June last year [2015] and in January [2016].

MERS 1st emerged in humans in 2012 and has been spreading in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries since then. It is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). The virus, in which patients develop acute respiratory illness with fever, coughing and breathing problems, has spread to 27 countries and killed up to 40% of those infected.

[In the 1st media report that we published on 31 Jul 2016, the report stated that tests were positive for the MERS-CoV: "Amnuay explained that this teenager, despite detection of the virus in him, was categorised as a person "likely to fall ill" from MERS-CoV, apart from 2 other categories of "confirmed" patients and the "variable group." The tests of his bodily fluids at 4 labs (Medical Science Department, Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Ramathibodi Hospital) found the virus, but the results had some uncertainty pending confirmation from experts." (See prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (86): Thailand ex Kuwait, RFI 20160731.4382012). Unfortunately, there is no further information on the results of the 2nd round of testing to date or clarification of the suggested false positive test results obtained on this individual.

We await further information on this event in Thailand.
