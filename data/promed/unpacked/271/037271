Cases of Lyme disease are on the rise in the northwest, and health officials have warned people to look out for ticks. Ticks usually become active in April, and experts said this year [2013] is no exception. As the weather warms up, people head outside more, and they and their animals start getting bitten by the creatures, which carry Lyme disease.

In Washington State, as many as 23 cases are reported each year. In Oregon, the numbers are even higher and growing. The state had 20 reports of Lyme disease in 2006, and that number had grown to 48 cases by last year [2012].

Experts have said expanding tick populations are to blame in part. But they added that people can protect themselves by wearing long pants [and tucking the pant's cuffs under the socks] and long-sleeved shirts when hiking or camping and using repellent when necessary. Light-colored clothing can also help people more easily notice ticks.

Hiker John Christensen said it's a danger for which he's prepared. "I just check myself out very thoroughly when we get home," he said. "You can check yourself, your socks, your shoes, and whatever." Experts also said people should thoroughly check their pets for ticks.

[Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. Lyme disease is now concentrated in 11 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and 2 upper north-central states (Wisconsin and Minnesota); about 88 percent of the total number of confirmed cases reported to the US CDC in 2011 were reported from these 13 states, where the annual incidence ranged from 10.6 per 100 000 in Rhode Island to 84.6 per 100 000 in Delaware (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html).

In areas of the northeastern, mid-Atlantic and north-central United States where Lyme disease is endemic, the white-footed mouse is the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_, and _Ixodes scapularis_ is the tick vector.

Lyme disease is uncommon in the Pacific west coast of the United States, where the incidence of confirmed cases of Lyme disease in 2011 was 0.2 cases per 100 000 in each state (Washington State, Oregon and California). Numbers of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC in the years 2009, 2010, and 2011 from the state of Oregon were 12, 7, and 9, respectively, and from Washington State 15,12, and 17, respectively (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html). In fact, about 40 percent of cases of Lyme disease reported in Washington State are probably infected while outside of this state (http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/communicable/diseases/LymeDisease/facts.aspx). Similarly, over 40 percent of Lyme disease cases reported from the greater Portland (Oregon) metropolitan area from 1999 to 2004 likely acquired Lyme disease outside of Oregon (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/). Most locally acquired cases likely acquired Lyme disease during outdoor exposure in the western half of these states on the western slope of the Cascade mountain range or in the Cascade foothills, where _I. pacificus_ is prevalent. The Cascade Range extends from northern California to British Columbia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cascaderangemap.jpg).

The western black-legged tick (_Ixodes pacificus_) is the main vector on the west coast, where only 2-4 percent of _I. pacificus_ are reported to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_, whereas over 50 percent of _I. scapularis_ are infected in hyper-endemic areas in the northeastern states (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/).
