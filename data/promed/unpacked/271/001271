Situation update
----------------
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, ASF was detected in 83 villages/the smallest available admin units in 20 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. More than 570 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

Tianjin Municipality: ASF outbreak occurred in one farm with 361 pigs in Ninghe District [in Chinese, http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yqfb/201811/t20181130_6164121.htm].

Hubei Province: ASF outbreak occurred in one farm with 63 pigs in Yangxin County, Huangshi City [in Chinese, http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yqfb/201811/t20181126_6163606.htm].

Actions taken by China
-----------------------
The government set a 3-km [1.9-mile] epidemic zone and a 10-km [6.2-mile] buffer zone around the epidemic zone. Within a province, movement of live pigs from the county/city/province where ASF occurred is suspended; live pig markets in infected provinces and adjacent provinces are closed; movement of live pigs and pork products from provinces with more than 2 infected cities is prohibited; transport of live pigs from provinces adjacent to ASF-affected are suspended. Breeding pigs can be transported from provinces with epidemic zone with a laboratory ASF test certificate, but it is not allowed to pass through provinces with epidemic zone when transporting live pigs [1]. The government has been strengthening transport of pork meat rather than of live pigs [2]. Studies showed that 62% of the first 21 ASF events in China were related to swill feeding. A nationwide ban on swill feeding to pigs and record-keeping of livestock transportation vehicles have been implemented [3]. On 30 Oct 2018, MoARA launched a 3-month investigation campaign against illegal slaughter [4]. On 28 Nov 2018, MoARA released information on cases of illegal live pig movement or lack of timely reporting in Liaoning, Yunnan, Beijing, Shandong and Jilin provinces, which resulted in prosecution or fines (between CNY 1950 and 103 011 [between about USD 280 and 14 830]) [5].

After assessment, epidemic zones were lifted in Pulandian District, Dalian City on 25 Nov 2018 [6], Tai'an County, Anshan City on 27 Nov 2018 [7], Kaiyuan City, Tieling City on 29 Nov 2018 [8] in Liaoning Province, and Zuoyun County, Datong City, Shanxi Province on 28 Nov 2018 [9] because there was no further detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within an affected zone.
