A veterinary medical team from Tamenglong headquarters rushed to Tamei
recently and treated a large number of cattle in the area.

The cattle are suffering from foot and mouth disease, which is spreading
out from Langmei village, about 10 km southwest of Tamei headquarters.

A good number of cattle died last month [August 2005] due to the disease.
Their tongues and hooves were covered with sores. Due to the sores, the
animals could not eat or move around and, thus, succumbed.

[Unfortunately, there is no treatment for animals suffering from foot and
mouth disease. One can only give supportive care or begin vaccinating
animals that are believed to be unexposed.

Other regions within India are experiencing similar situations. It appears
likely that there is an FMD outbreak, but I have not seen any confirmatory
reports. - Mod.TG]
