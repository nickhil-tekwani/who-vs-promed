"West Nile fever is a disease caused by West Nile Virus (WNV), which is a flavivirus related to the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever. It causes disease in humans, horses, and several species of birds. Most infected individuals show few signs of illness, but some develop severe neurological illnesses which can be fatal. West Nile Virus has an extremely broad host range. It replicates in birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, mosquitoes, and ticks.

"The reservoir of the virus is in birds. Mosquitoes become infected when they bite an infected bird ingesting the virus in the blood. The mosquitoes act as carriers (vectors) spreading the virus from an infected bird to other birds and to other animals. Thus, there is a cycle of the virus circulating from bird to bird by way of mosquito bites, being amplified at each cycle. Some bird species are more susceptible to the virus than others, especially the crow family (Corvidae). Finding dead crows can therefore signal the presence of West Nile disease so surveillance programs often target dead crows.

"Infection of other animals (e.g., horses, and also humans) is incidental to the cycle in birds since most mammals do not develop enough virus in the bloodstream to spread the disease". Source: WOAH https://www.woah.org/en/disease/west-nile-fever/. - Mod.CRD
