Korea to cull 5000 pigs over foot-and-mouth scare
--------------------------------------------------
SEOUL: South Korea is bracing for a possible outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in pigs which could deal a blow to the
resumption of its valuable pork exports, the Ministry of Agriculture
said on Fri 03 Apr 2002.
The disease, which halted South Korea's 400 million dollar annual
pork export trade in 2000, is not dangerous to humans but is highly
infectious and can be deadly to pigs, cattle, deer, and other hooved
animals.
If the final test confirms foot-and-mouth on Saturday, it would be a
blow to Korea's livestock and feed production industries, both
stopping Korea's pork exports and depressing meat demand because of
public health concerns, analysts said.
Prime Minister Lee Han-dong has chaired a high-level government
meeting to address the incident, just 4 weeks before South Korea and
Japan co-host World Cup soccer finals.
"Collecting maximum forces including public service officials, police
and army, the government will isolate the affected area and
quarantine at airport and harbors will be strengthened," a statement
from the government meeting showed.
Agriculture ministry officials said 2 pigs were found dead at a farm
about 60 km south of Seoul and initial tests had shown possible
foot-and-mouth disease. There were plans to destroy 5000 pigs at the
farm, they added.
"The final test result will be available tomorrow morning," Suh
Kyu-yong, vice-minister, said at a news conference. "After it is
confirmed, the government will decide which policy to adopt between
vaccination and destruction for neighboring livestocks." The
agriculture ministry will complete destroying all 5000 pigs at the
farm by the end of Friday, Suh said.
The pigs showed symptoms of appetite loss and blisters on their
tongues and hooves from Tue 30 Apr 2002, and a local feed maker
official reported the suspected foot-and-mouth to the National
Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) late on Thu 2 May
2002, Suh said.
Since the NVRQS initial test showed possible foot-and-mouth,
transportation on within a radius of 20 km from the affected farm has
been prohibited and emergency disinfection has been carried out, and
since Tue 30 May 2002, no livestock had left the affected farm, he
added. The agriculture ministry will temporarily close six trading
markets for cattle and pigs near the affected farm on Friday.
Korea, which does not export beef, partially resumed pork exports on
Monday after a gap of more than 2 years. Its pork exports, nearly all
to Japan, come only from Cheju Island because of last month's swine
fever outbreak on the mainland. They will now have to discuss with
Japan the continuation of those pork exports from Cheju island, about
440 km south of Seoul, the agriculture ministry officials said.
Korea won a clean bill of health on foot-and-mouth disease in
September 2001, clearing the way to export pork.

Information received on 3 May 2002 from Dr Hee-Woo Lee, Director,
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF),
Seoul:
Suspected cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) were reported in a
pig fattening holding at Samjuk, Anseong, Kyonggi-do province.
Clinical and serological (antigen ELISA) examination were positive.
Virological diagnosis is on-going.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 02 May 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: 24 Apr 2002.
Total number of animals in the outbreak: 8700 pigs.
Number of cases: 500. Number of deaths: 280.
Number of animals destroyed: 8420.
Control measures:
-- stamping out;
-- control on movement of animals, vehicles and others as a
precaution. The controlled area comprises the at-risk zone (within a

[OIE's Commission for Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Epizootics
evaluated documentation concerning the eradication of FMD submitted
by the delegate of the Republic of Korea and, in accordance with
Resolution No. XVII ("Restoration of recognition of the foot and
mouth disease status of Member Countries") adopted by the OIE
International Committee during its 65th General Session (May 1997),
recognized on 19 Sep 2001 that this country regained its previously
recognised FMD-free status without vaccination. Obviously, this
regained status may be lost now. It will be important, in global
terms, to obtain information on the serotype and subtype of the
current FMD virus isolate and its possible origin. The previous
outbreak was caused by the Pan-Asian O FMDV type, which spread over
vast parts of Asia and to several European countries. Its evolution
during the years 2000-2001, as reported by FAO's European Commission
for FMD (EUFMD), can be seen at:
