Ontario: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed
----------------------------------------------------------------
An individual from Halton Region is the first Ontario resident confirmed to
have contracted West Nile Virus this season, announced Dr. Colin D'Cunha,
Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. The National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg confirmed the test results today. "It is important
to put the risk into perspective," said D'Cunha. "99 percent of people who
contract West Nile Virus either do not become ill or suffer only mild
symptoms. So far this year, one diagnosis has been confirmed in all of
Canada, and 4 more are undergoing confirmatory testing.
Health officials continue to monitor the presence of West Nile virus in
humans, birds, and mosquitoes. The Ontario government has invested CAD 9
million [USD 5.75 million] to help public health units monitor West Nile
Virus activity and to promote ways to avoid contact with mosquitoes, which
can transmit the virus to humans.
