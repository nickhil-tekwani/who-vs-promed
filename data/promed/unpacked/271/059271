Nepal: outbreak of "viral influenza" affects 700 people
-------------------------------------------------------
DADELDHURA: As of Sun 15 Jun 2003, more than 700 people have been affected
by viral influenza in 17 Village Development Committees (VDCs) and there is
an acute shortage of medicines to deal with the situation, according to
officials at the Dadeldhura District Public Health Office (DPHO).
DPHO chief Dr Lokraj Paneru said that the disease has affected people in
remote VDCs such as Bhageswor, Gankhet, Rupal, Kailpalmandu, and Asigram.
He added that around 300 people were found to have been infected with the
contagious disease in southern Ragun Valley alone. With the number of viral
influenza cases rising everyday, the DPHO is facing an acute shortage of
medicines and adequate number of health workers to deal with the situation.
"One or the other member from each of the families in Ragun Valley have
been found suffering from the disease," said Jagat Bahadur Mahato, a local
who arrived in the district headquarters to inform about the epidemic. Dr
Paneru said, on average, 40 to 50 people have been coming to each health
post ever since the disease broke out in the areas. He said that the
situation would turn worse if adequate medicines were not made available in
the affected areas.
