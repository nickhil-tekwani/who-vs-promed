I would like to add that Q fever is also [an occupational disease of
workers in abattoirs and dairies. Humans are infected by inhalation of
aerosols of infected material, usually amniotic fluid from ruminants or
dust containing dried excreta from infected ticks or grazing animals.
_Coxiella burnetii_ is sporadically transmitted through ticks or milk from
infected animals. Transmission of Q fever from pets (if it ever occurs) is
to be considered rare.

[ _Coxiella burnetii_ is highly resistant to physical and chemical agents
and can survive weeks to years in the environment. The organism can be
spread to other animals and people through aerosolization of infected
particles, by direct contact, or by ingestion of placentas, or other
reproductive discharges or milk. Based on epidemiologic evidence, ticks may
transmit the disease among domestic ruminants and occasionally to people.
The most important mode of transmission form domestic ruminants to people
is airborne via dust particles from desiccated reproductive fluids;
however, obstetrical procedures and raw milk are also involved.
High-temperature pasteurization effectively kills the organism. - Mod.TG
