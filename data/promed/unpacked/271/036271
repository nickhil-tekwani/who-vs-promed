A human patient has contracted Hantavirus in Klamath County, according to a news release from the county public health department.

Klamath County Public Health sent out a news release [Thu 26 Oct 2017] confirming that there was at least one human case identified in Klamath County. It's not yet clear where the infection occurred or how the person came down with the illness.

Known fully as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), the disease commonly spreads from contact with rodents. The disease can be life-threatening and contracted by coming into contact with droppings, urine or saliva from infected rodents, according to the release. The deer mouse [_Peromyuscus maniculatus_], which has a white underbelly and lives in rural areas, is the most common rodent carrier.

People should avoid direct contact with wild rodents and keep rodents away from buildings by keeping lawns mowed and debris cleared from yards. Food scraps and garbage should also be kept in rodent-proof metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. In addition, animal or pet food should not be out in the open to attract them.

According to the release, 587 cases of Hantavirus were reported in more than half the states in the U.S. since 1994. There have been 16 cases reported in Oregon, with 2 cases in Jefferson and Deschutes counties in 2011. The virus often pops up in the spring months after home and business owners finish deep-cleaning sessions.

[Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections occur annually across the western USA including occasionally in Oregon. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. As the above report notes, there is no information about the circumstances under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY
