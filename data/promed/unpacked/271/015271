The SARS-CoV-2 virus may contribute to the damage of small blood vessels in the heart as seen in severely ill COVID-19 patients, without infecting them, a study shows. The research, published in the journal Clinical Science, indicates blocking antibodies could represent a new treatment to alleviate cardiovascular complications.

A multidisciplinary research team led by the University of Bristol, UK, analysed how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with heart cells causing the myocardial damage seen in COVID-19 patients. Until now, it remained unclear whether heart cells are infected by the virus or damaged because of an excess cytotoxic defence response.

This response, also known as the "cytokine storm", comes from our immune cells, whereby cytotoxic cells attack and kill the infected cells by releasing proteins called cytokines. The study also investigated whether heart cells contribute to producing excess cytokines.

The team led by Professor Paolo Madeddu exposed human heart pericytes, which are cells that wrap small blood vessels in the heart, to SARS-CoV-2 alpha and delta variants, along with the original Wuhan virus. They found the heart pericytes were not infected.

In a 2nd test-tube experiment, the researchers challenged the cardiac pericytes with only the spike protein -- which the virus uses to enter and infect the cells -- without the virus. The spike protein made pericytes unable to interact with their companion endothelial cells and induced them to secrete inflammatory cytokines, suggesting the spike protein is harmful to human cardiac cells. The team found that antibodies blocking CD147 -- a receptor for the spike protein -- protected heart pericytes from damage.

The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can damage vascular cells without infecting them, according to the researchers. Cleaved spike protein particles could also amplify the damage induced by the engagement of the full virion with vascular cells, they added.

The researchers identified the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in blood samples obtained from COVID-19 patients. This opens the possibility that spike protein particles traveling through the circulation can reach a site distant from the respiratory system and cause systemic damage, they said.

"Pericytes are essential cells of the heart, although their role in maintaining the structural integrity of the coronary vascular tree has emerged only recently," said Elisa Avolio, the study's 1st author from the Bristol Medical School.

"Our ongoing research on human cardiac pericytes indicates these cells co-operate with coronary endothelial cells during healing from a heart attack," Avolio said. The study shows that the spike protein jeopardises this interaction and transforms pericytes into inflammatory cells.

The researchers noted that CD147 blocking antibodies could represent a new treatment to alleviate cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. "Microvascular complications are frequent and harmful in patients with COVID-19, with up to 11% of those hospitalised in intensive care units having myocardial damage or having suffered a heart attack," Professor Paolo Madeddu, from the Bristol Medical School, added. "Furthermore, people with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases are more likely to die of COVID-19," Madeddu added.

Abstract
--------
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a broad range of clinical responses, including prominent microvascular damage. The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect vascular cells is still debated. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein may act as a ligand to induce non-infective cellular stress. We tested this hypothesis in pericytes (PCs), which are reportedly reduced in the heart of patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here we newly show that the in vitro exposure of primary human cardiac PCs to the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain or the alpha and delta variants caused rare infection events. Exposure to the recombinant S protein alone elicited signalling and functional alterations, including: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support endothelial cell (EC) network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors causing EC death."

Discussion
----------
"Our study provides novel proof-of-concept evidence for S protein capacity to cause molecular and functional changes in human vascular PCs, either dependently or independently of the CD147 receptor (summarised in Figure 11 [available at study URL])." - Mod.LK]

[2] Canadian vaccine: plant-derived virus-like particles
Date: Thu 24 Feb 24 2022 11:28 EST
Source: CBC News [edited]
https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medicago-s-homegrown-plant-based-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-health-canada-1.6362745


Medicago's plant-based COVID-19 vaccine is now approved by Health Canada, which will soon give Canadians the option of getting a homegrown shot against SARS-CoV-2. Regulators announced the decision to allow its use for adults 18-64 years of age on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], making this the 6th vaccine approved in Canada, on the heels of Health Canada's approval of the Novavax shot last week.

In what the biopharmaceutical company calls a world first, the vaccine from Quebec City-based Medicago uses plant-derived, virus-like particles, which resemble the coronavirus behind COVID-19 but don't contain its genetic material. The shots also contain an adjuvant [AS03] from British-American vaccine giant GlaxoSmithKline to help boost the immune response. In December [2021], the companies reported high efficacy levels against infection as they geared up for regulatory approval.

Dubbed "Covifenz," the 2-dose shot's overall efficacy rate against all virus variants studied was 71%, with a higher efficacy rate of 75% against COVID-19 infections of any severity from the delta variant, then dominant, according to data shared at the time in a press release.

The results followed a global, Phase 3, placebo-controlled study of the 2-dose vaccine that was launched last March [2021]. This was before the highly contagious omicron family of subvariants, including BA.1 and BA.2, began circulating, though the company has said the vaccine can be adapted as needed. "While additional confirmatory data are needed, preliminary and exploratory data show that Covifenz produces neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant," noted Health Canada in a statement.

The department has also placed terms and conditions on the authorization. Medicago must continue to provide information to Health Canada on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, "including protection against current and emerging variants of concern as soon as it is available," the statement continued.

"We will, in the next several months, know how well our vaccine did against omicron," the company's medical officer, Dr. Brian Ward, told CBC News, citing ongoing company trials, which also include a study on a booster dose that's slated to start within weeks.

In October [2021], Canada signed a deal to buy 20 million doses of Medicago's vaccine, with an option for 56 million more. In a press release issued on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], the company stressed a commitment to providing its shots as soon as possible.

"The approval of our COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone for Canada in the fight against the pandemic. We appreciate Health Canada's timely review," said Takashi Nagao, the company's president and CEO, in the statement. "We're also grateful for the Government of Canada's support in the development of this new vaccine, and we are manufacturing doses to start fulfilling its order."

Given this huge influx of vaccines, Canada's deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said some of those expected Medicago supplies will be part of Canada's ongoing efforts to send doses abroad. "Canada is committed to the global effort to supply vaccines across the world," he said during a press conference. Recommendations on the vaccine's use from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization are also expected in the weeks ahead, Njoo said.

For now, the vaccine is only authorized for use in adults 18-64 years of age, based on the data that were reviewed by Health Canada. "There was limited enrolment of participants older than 65 years of age in the clinical trials because a large proportion of older individuals were already vaccinated," the department said in its statement. "Medicago is currently gathering data in older individuals to support regulatory authorization for this age-group."

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist based in Toronto, told CBC News the vaccine's approval is good news, even though it comes after the majority of Canadians are already vaccinated with 2 or more doses. "Is this going to have a major impact on us here in Canada? Probably not. But there might be some individuals who choose to get vaccinated with a non-mRNA product," he said, referring to the shots offered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

What's most hopeful, Bogoch added, is how plant-based technology could help future vaccine development. The process developed by Medicago uses the plant species _Nicotiana benthamiana_, a close relative of tobacco plants that is used for pharmaceutical development, largely because of the high number of viruses that can successfully infect it. "This might be a pretty unique way to produce and scale vaccination," Bogoch said.

"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are virus-derived structures made up of one or more different molecules with the ability to self-assemble, mimicking the form and size of a virus particle but lacking the genetic material so they are not capable of infecting the host cell. Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed. VLPs are gaining in popularity in the field of preventive medicine and to date, a wide range of VLP-based candidate vaccines have been developed for immunization against various infectious agents, the latest of which is the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2..." (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-021-00806-7).

Vaccines on the market that use VLPs include vaccines for HPV (human papilloma virus) and hepatitis B. The pros of the VLP vaccines include (1) may produce a stronger immune response than regular subunit vaccines, and (2) production may be much faster than for whole virus vaccines. Cons include (1) ensuring stability and purification can add to production time, and (2) can be hard to produce in large quantities.

[3] COVID mortality increase
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022 06:22 EST

Plummeting COVID-19 case counts across the United States are leading to lifted mask mandates and more conversations about steps toward normalcy -- but more people are dying of the coronavirus now than during most points of the pandemic.

More than 2000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the United States each day for the past month. Average daily deaths are falling, but from a very high point. They dipped just below that mark in recent days, to about 1900 on Monday [21 Feb 2022]; the federal holiday may have delayed reporting.

Before omicron became the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States, there were only about 100 other days when there were more than 2000 COVID-19 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The only other time that deaths have been this high for this long was during the 1st winter surge, before vaccines were available. The omicron wave has also been deadlier for longer than the delta surge: In September [2021], when delta was dominant, average daily deaths topped 2000 for half as long.

More than 120 000 people in the United States have died of COVID-19 since omicron became the dominant variant in December [2021], and COVID-19 has accounted for more than 1 in 5 deaths reported in 2022.

A common refrain early in the pandemic was that COVID-19 was most deadly for the elderly and people with certain health conditions. The people dying from COVID-19 now tend to be younger than before, and they're overwhelmingly unvaccinated, experts say.

"I've long since lost track of the number of people I've seen die of the disease, but the reality is that almost everybody who is critically ill, in the ICU or dying now remains unvaccinated. That has been true since the beginning. But in the beginning, people didn't have the opportunity to be vaccinated," said Dr. Stephen Threlkeld, medical director of the infectious diseases program at Baptist Memorial Health Care in Memphis. "None of us taking care of COVID patients need CDC statistics or anyone else to tell us that because we simply see that reality play out every day and have for quite some time."

But the data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are clear. In December [2021], the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for unvaccinated adults than it was for adults who were fully vaccinated with their initial series. The gap was even larger when looking at those who also got their booster shot: 51 times higher.

Throughout the pandemic, the majority of COVID-19 deaths have happened in hospitals. But that share is even larger now, as nursing homes have become less of a hotspot. In 2020, more than 1 in 5 COVID-19 deaths was in a nursing home. But in 2022, fewer than 1 in 10 deaths have been in nursing homes, according to provisional data from the CDC.

Vaccination rates are higher among older people in the US, leaving a larger share of younger, unvaccinated people at higher risk for severe outcomes. Nearly 90% of seniors 65 and older are fully vaccinated with their initial vaccine series, and about two-thirds of those eligible have gotten their booster shot. But less than two-thirds of adults under the age of 40 and less than one-third of children are fully vaccinated.

And the vaccines are working. Seniors accounted for 81% of COVID-19 deaths in 2020, a number that dropped to 69% in 2021 and has stayed at 76% so far in 2022, despite the increased risk for breakthrough infection amid exponential community spread. "The virus simply went to the fuel that it had remaining," Threlkeld said.

Racial disparities in COVID-19 deaths persist, but have decreased over time. Black, Hispanic and American Indian people are still about twice as likely to die of COVID-19 than White people, but that risk has fallen from about 3 times higher at the end of 2020.

And White people, who are less likely to be vaccinated than Hispanic people, have accounted for a growing share of deaths recently. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that early in the omicron surge, the death rate for Hispanic people remained lower than the rate for White people, but death rates among Black people rose.

And as the virus spread rapidly throughout the country, social determinants of health have started to play a larger role in who becomes seriously ill and dies from COVID-19. "Delta was much more deadly. But omicron is so widespread," said Dr. Faisal Masud, director of the critical care center at Houston Methodist.

Extremely high transmission rates mean the virus is reaching everyone, but it's hitting those from disadvantaged neighborhoods especially hard, he said. These are the people who are more likely to be uninsured and who may delay care, leaving chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension untreated. "Patients who start with poor health come at a disadvantage," he said.

Texas has reported more COVID-19 deaths than any other state in the past week and is on track to soon outpace California in terms of total COVID-19 deaths. It's important to note the significant differences in health insurance rates and vaccination rates in the 2 states, Masud said. More than 70% of Californians are fully vaccinated, compared with about 60% of Texans, according to CDC data.

Overall, the proportion of omicron cases that have resulted in deaths appears to be lower than the case-mortality ratio for delta. But it's a "denominator phenomenon," Threlkeld said, meaning a lower percentage of a much larger number is still going to be large.

"I think that's what people have forgotten: Just because something is a little less likely in a given person to cause severe disease, there are so many more people who've contracted this infection that you're going to have a lot of people who are ill," he said. "We've certainly seen a lot of unvaccinated people who've done very poorly."

[4] Mask guidelines to be eased
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022
Source: AP News [abridged, edited]
https://bit.ly/3peFlKT


The Biden administration will significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines to protect against COVID-19 transmission on Friday [25 Feb 2022], according to 2 people familiar with the matter, meaning most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday [25 Feb 2022] will announce a change to the metrics it uses to determine whether to recommend face coverings, shifting from looking at COVID-19 case counts to a more holistic view of risk from the coronavirus to a community. Under current guidelines, masks are recommended for people residing in communities of substantial or high transmission -- roughly 95% of US counties, according to the latest data.

The new metrics will still consider caseloads but also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, which have been markedly improved during the emergence of the omicron variant. That strain is highly transmissible, but indications are that it is less severe than earlier strains, particularly for people who are fully vaccinated and boosted. Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data.

https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/900-000-Sri-Lankans-refuse-COVID-19-vaccines/108-231750


Over 9 lakh [900 000] people in Sri Lanka have not got a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine raising concerns among the health authorities.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Epidemiology Unit Director Dr Samitha Ginige said that 17.6 million people above 12 years of age were eligible to get the vaccine; however, the total number administered with the 1st dose stood at 16.7 million as of yesterday [23 Feb 2022].

"95.5% has received the 1st dose while 79.8% has been offered with the 2nd dose," he said.

"As far as the booster rollout is concerned, 14.5 million people above 20 years of age are eligible to get the booster; however, only 6.6 million has received the booster shot, which is 44%," Dr Ginige added.

When questioned as to why people were hesitant to get the booster shot, he said people were taking the COVID-19 very lightly now.

Meanwhile, about 1.1 million persons above 60 years of age have not yet received the booster dose despite constant reminders that it is those people who mostly get complications and succumb to the COVID-19.

Dr Ginige said they were highly concerned over the hesitancy shown by the most vulnerable group which could eventually increase the COVID related deaths to unprecedented numbers.

"The estimated number of senior citizens stands at 2.7 million out of which the booster dose has been received by 1.6 million. Accordingly, 1.1 million has not yet got their booster dose, which is alarming," he said.

"Over 80% of 202 deaths occurred within the last 7 days, was of senior citizens out of which the majority of them were suffering from chronic diseases. In addition, over 60% is of those who have either not got 2 doses or a booster dose," he pointed out.

Thus, Dr Ginige urged people above 60 years of age to get themselves boosted as it helps them not get complications which probably result in deaths.

Over the last 7 days, 113 350, 13 081, 8635, 1655, and 8735 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 244 098, 32 035, 19 120, 3382, and 8506 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of sharp decline in cases in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal over the last 3 weeks, but almost a state of stability in Sri Lanka. The numbers of daily deaths along with the numbers of daily active cases are also substantially decreasing in these 4 most populous countries in South Asia -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The daily case positivity against the number of people tested is now around 5.5% in Bangladesh, and only 1.2% in India as indicated in items [A] and [B] above. The total laboratory-confirmed cases recorded in Pakistan have now crossed an epidemiological landmark of 1.5 million.

Due to sustained decline in new cases in India, on 15 Feb 2022, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in a letter to all states and union territories asked to end additional COVID-19 restrictions imposed to tackle the new surge (https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid-19-restrictions-health-ministry-decline-in-cases-1913860-2022-02-16). After seeing the sudden development of a new surge, Bangladesh also imposed 5-point fresh restriction measures on 21 Jan 2022, including closure of schools, colleges, and other educational institutions (https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-issues-five-point-fresh-restrictions-to-tackle-covid-19-surge-1642765858). As COVID-19 situation has improved significantly, the country has decided to reopen all secondary schools and colleges, effective from 22 Feb 2022 (https://www.thedailystar.net/youth/education/news/secondary-schools-colleges-reopen-february-22-2964571).

As extracted from item [B] above, as many as 8 037 745 COVID-19 cases were detected across India from 1 Jan-24 Feb 2022, and in this window of 55 days, 31 808 people died due to the disease, suggesting a case fatality rate of 0.40%, grossly meaning that if 1000 people were confirmed with the disease by laboratory testing, 4 of them died eventually. This rate of mortality is around 3 times lower compared with the overall death rate of 1.20% recorded in India due to the disease as of today (25 Feb 2022) (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), but 3.3 times lower compared with the death rate (1.32%) recorded on 21 May 2021, 2 weeks later from the highest number of total daily cases (414 433) recorded on 6 May 2021, during the peak of the previous surge in the country believed to be caused by the delta variant (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/).

An update on the omicron variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron. Additional information can be found at https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/what-we-know-about-omicron-variant.

As of 25 Feb 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 768 689 266 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 23 Feb 2022, 86.69% have received the 1st dose and 65.44% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 4.14% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 25 Feb 2022 at 06:53 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 209 438 557 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

As of 12 Feb 2022, Nepal has administered at least 35 546 280 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 37 563 797 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 86.1% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

[In the past 24 hours, 37 countries, including Germany (218 431), South Korea (165 889), Russia (132 998), Brazil (95 493), Turkey (79 708), USA (74 108), Viet Nam (69 128), France (66 732), Japan (65 657), Indonesia (57 426), Italy (47 493), Netherlands (41 177), UK (38 481), Spain (35 892), Australia (34 301), Chile (32 764), Malaysia (32 070), Austria (28 591), Ukraine (25 789), Thailand (24 932), Denmark (23 788), Singapore (18 593), Poland (18 266), Mexico (18 252), Switzerland (17 496), Greece (15 819), Norway (15 595), Slovakia (15 183), Iran (12 957), Israel (12 571), India (12 406), New Zealand (12 024), Portugal (11 636), Czech Republic (11 257), Latvia (11 088), Romania (10 749), and Argentina (10 298), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 10 945 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 22 Feb 2022 to late 23 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 76 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 36 of the 76 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 38.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 12.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.77 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 431.96 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.94 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally; however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA
