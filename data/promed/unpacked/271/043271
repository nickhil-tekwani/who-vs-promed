[1] Undiagnosed gastroenteritis - Australia (Tasmania)

Australia: Gastroenteritis Cases Hospitalized in Hobart (Tasmania)
--------------------------------------------------
A number of patients have been admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital with
gastroenteritis. 7 patients have been admitted to a 10-bed isolation area
within a medical ward of the hospital. A spokeswoman says the isolation
area is standard procedure for such outbreaks. She stated that the patients
are being treated according to infection control standards to minimise
further cases.
The spokeswoman says no other patients have been treated at the hospital at
this stage and the Director of Public Health is not aware of a wider public
outbreak of gastroenteritis. She says the extra patients have not had an
effect on elective surgery at the hospital.

[2] Norovirus, hospitals - New Zealand

New Zealand: Country-wide Norovirus Outbreaks Affect Hospitals and Rest Homes
-------------------------------------------------
Highly contagious gastroenteritis viruses, known as noroviruses, have
paralysed hospitals and caused havoc in rest homes throughout New Zealand
this winter, with more than double the usual number of cases. An
Environmental Science and Research report showed there were about 35
reported norovirus outbreaks in the quarter to 30 Jun 2004, resulting in
890 cases of illness. This was a huge jump from the 2003 figures, when 102
reported outbreaks caused 348 cases. The disease causes diarrhoea and
vomiting and usually lasts about 24 hours. It is not usually serious, but
can be dangerous for children and the elderly. It can be spread by infected
shellfish, poor food handling hygiene or person-to-person.
The virus closed wards at Wellington, Kenepuru, Horowhenua, Wairau
(Blenheim) and Princess Margaret (Christchurch) hospitals. In Wellington,
at least 424 people were infected, including 208 Wellington and Kenepuru
hospital patients and staff. In 2003, there were just 8 outbreaks
investigated in the greater Wellington area, which caused 214 cases.
Wellington Medical Officer of Health, Margot McLean, said norovirus
outbreaks had been more prevalent and had a much bigger impact this year.
The figures were just the tip of the iceberg. Though outbreaks in rest
homes and hospitals were usually reported, outbreaks in the community were
not. Most of the Wellington outbreaks happened in May and June, but cases
in rest homes continued into July, she said.
ESR communicable diseases scientist Gail Greening said norovirus rates were
high worldwide. 2004's outbreaks were caused by 2 main strains, one of
which appeared to be the same as the strain circulating on cruise ships in
America. Though there had been fewer outbreaks this year, the "attack rate"
had been high, with more people becoming infected, Dr Greening said. The
latest strains seemed to be more aggressive, causing a higher number of
cases. The outbreaks had had significant economic impact, especially for
hospitals, she said.

[3] Gastroenteritis, cruise ship - United Kingdom (Scotland)

United Kingdom: : Cruise Ship (ex Germany) Quarantined in Scottish Port
------------------------------------------------
A Cruise ship was quarantined after passengers were taken ill on Tue 31 Aug
2004. Dozens of holidaymakers on the German-owned Mona Lisa complained of
feeling unwell as the vessel was en route to Peterhead. No one was allowed
to board or leave the ship when she arrived in the Buchan port yesterday
morning. After an investigation by health chiefs and environmental officers
into the outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea, planned day trips ashore were
given the go-ahead.
The majority of the 700-plus passengers on the 660-ft ship were German. The
vessel had called at Rosyth before sailing for the north-east and was
heading for Orkney today before moving on to Dublin as part of a cruise
around Britain and Ireland. The Mona Lisa, which also had some 300 crew on
board, arrived in Peterhead about 7am.
By late morning, the captain was told that anyone who felt well enough to
go ashore was free to do so. An NHS Grampian spokeswoman said: "Our own
health-protection team and Aberdeenshire Council environmental-health
officers are investigating an outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting amongst
passengers and crew of the cruise ship. 67 people have reported symptoms,
and the illness appears to be short-lived. Measures have been put in place
to limit the spread of infection among the other passengers and crew. All
the passengers on board the ship have been advised of the situation."
The visit of the Mona Lisa -- which had been due to call at Peterhead
during the summer of 2003 until she ran aground in Norway -- marked the end
of the port's most successful cruise season since it launched itself as a
destination for cruise ships in 1997. The 38-year-old Mona Lisa was built
in the UK and spent most of her life working as the Victoria for P&O Cruises.

[Norovirus infection has been a frequent cause of illness on cruise ships
world-wide. The relaxed attitude of the local medical authorities suggests
that the outbreak has passed its peak and that symptomless passengers are
free of infection and not a hazard to the local community. - Mod.CP]

[4] Unresolved multiple cause outbreak, vacation resort - USA (Ohio)

USA: Outbreak of Gastroenteritis at Put-in-Bay Vacation Resort in Ohio
---------------------------------------------------
In ProMED-mail post "Viral gastroenteritis update 2004 (27) 20040818.2284"
it was reported that in recent weeks a mystery sickness has afflicted
Put-in-Bay residents, summer workers and visitors. Symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, fever, headache, abdominal cramps and diarrhea, typically lasting
up to 24 hours or so. The Ohio Department of Health classified the
incidents as an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness. Laboratory analysis
was being performed on stool and vomit samples from stricken victims. As of
21 Aug 2004, the source of the illness and methods of transmission had not
been identified, but results were expected later in the week.
The etiology of this outbreak is obscure, and further investigation of the
outbreak can be followed in the ProMED thread entitled "Gastroenteritis,
multiple causes - USA (OH)". As of 27 Aug 2004 [see: Gastroenteritis,
multiple causes - USA (OH)(06) 20040827.2396] stool samples from 19 people
were positive for the following diarrhea-causing agents: Campylobacter
(14), norovirus (3), Salmonella (1) and Giardia (1). Mod.LL commented that
the number of etiology-identified cases remains low, and most are still
Campylobacter; however, the short-lived nature of the illness speaks
against this as a major pathogen and may reflect cultures being done
because of more severe illness. As reported numbers of illnesses continue
to increase, it is still not clear whether the rise is due to more
illnesses occurring or more complete reporting.

[At the moment the identity of the etiologic agent is unresolved, and
viruses may not be the major source of infection. Further developments will
be posted in the "Gastroenteritis, multiple causes - USA (OH)" thread. -
