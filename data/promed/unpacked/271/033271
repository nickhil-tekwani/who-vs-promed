It is certain -- there are 2 confirmed cases of West Nile fever (WN)
in Sardinia, the virus that has already hit dozens of horses (53
surveyed are positive to the virus as of yesterday [6 Oct 2011]) and
is transmitted to humans by the bite of _Culex_ mosquitoes.

The patient who tested positive is a man of 34 years from San Vero
Milis (Orissa), who was hospitalized in Cagliari yesterday [6 Oct
2011] and is in an irreversible coma in intensive care. The
confirmation came with the urinalysis that is comparable to specific
tests with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), according to the Institute of
Health [see reference below].

[A health official reported that] "To date we have reported 6 cases, 2
or 3 positive [for West Nile (WN) virus infection]. It should be noted
that the West Nile virus is endemic; last year [2010] we had 6 cases
including one death. The strain [virus] has been present in Italy for
4 years."

Concerning the situation in Sardinia, the minister reiterated that
"the cases are limited and concentrated in Oristano on 20-30 Sep
[2011]." The regional councillor for health Simona De Francisci stated
that "the region was activated immediately after the 1st case."
According to data disclosed yesterday [6 Oct 2011] by the Istituto
Zooprofilattico of Teramo, the national reference center for West Nile
disease in the field of animal [health] and the only institute
designated to perform the analysis on the horses, there are 53 horses
positive for the virus in Oristano.

[Apparently, WNV has become endemic on Sardinia, given cases in
previous years. WN virus infections occurred earlier in Italy this
year, but not on Sardinia.

Abstract
--------
West Nile virus (WNV) RNA was demonstrated in 5 (20 percent) of 25
urine samples collected from convalescent patients 573-2452 days
(1.6-6.7 years) after WNV infection. 4 of the 5 amplicons sequenced
showed more than 99 percent homology to the WNV NY99 strain. These
findings show that individuals with chronic symptoms after WNV
infection may have persistent renal infection over several years.

One more WNV case has been registered in Volgograd oblast [region]
during the last week [week of 25 Sep 2011]. The regional surveillance
authority has announced that the overall numbers of WNV cases for 2011
is now 57. Volgograd city is leading in case numbers (43); other
districts have case numbers between 1 and 8. 17 cases are pensioners
above 60 years old. Currently 5 people are being treated in hospitals.
There were 14 mild cases, 41 moderate cases, and 2 severe cases with
CNS involvement. The epidemiological analysis shows that in the
majority of cases the transmission occurs outdoors.
