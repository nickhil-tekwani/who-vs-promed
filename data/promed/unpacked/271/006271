The Ministry of Agriculture declared a provisional quarantine in the
departments of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Lima
and the province of Jaen, in Cajamarca. The headquarter's
resolution 092-99-AG-Senasa, published yesterday in El Peruano,
responded to the presence of foci of foot -and-mouth disease
(FMD) Type A in Piura and Lima, according to the diagonosis done
by Senasa. In order to avoid the spread of this disease to the rest
of the country, they included the rest of the cited areas.
According to this regulation, during August, bovine livestock will be
vaccinated. The measure will continue until the situation becomes
favorable.
