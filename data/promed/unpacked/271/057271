Rosselhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] reported a new outbreak of ASF- [African swine fever] infected boars in Alexander's district of Vladimir region, which lies to the east of Moscow.

Six dead boars killed by ASF were found in a fenced enclosure in a hunting forest. The primary laboratory diagnosis was carried out in the Vladimir regional laboratory and confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory for ASF. The exact date of infection has not been established. However, the corpses suggest that infection occurred in late July and early August 2013.

On-site detection of corpses has been carried out to prevent the spread of the virus.
