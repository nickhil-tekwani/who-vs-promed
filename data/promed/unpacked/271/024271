An alert was issued in the department of Antioquia, Colombia due to the increase in cases of leptospirosis, a disease transmitted by rodents to humans and that, if not caught early, can be fatal. In the capital city of Medellín, some areas have seen large accumulations of waste [that] have become recurrent and in some cases are part of the urban landscape, a place conducive to rodents. To date, the municipalities of most concern are Medellín, with 70 confirmed cases, Apartadó (54 cases), Turbo (29 cases), and Puerto Berrío (18 cases).

The National Institute of Health published in its Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin that to date in 2021, 2269 cases of leptospirosis have been confirmed in 288 municipalities of the country. 14 deaths related to the disease have been reported.

Cali, Bogotá, and Medellín are the cities with the highest number of registered cases. The departments that have registered the most cases in 2021 are: Antioquia (398 cases), Tolima (166), Risaralda (158), Valle del Cauca (133), Cali (130), Barranquilla (96), Bogotá (96), Córdoba (86), Cartagena (85), and Cundinamarca (83).

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. People (and animals) can get infected when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospirosis bacteria [leptospira] can enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).

Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), red eyes, and skin rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following to prevent leptospirosis:
- avoid contact with freshwater or wet soil, as it could be contaminated with animal urine. Don't wade through, swim in, drink, or swallow water from lakes, rivers, ponds, or streams;
- do not walk outside barefoot;
- wear waterproof protective clothing, especially footwear, if you must have contact with water or wet soil;
- cover any cuts or scratches with waterproof bandages.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is commoner in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salt) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with leptospira. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospira-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be widely available at a local level.

Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Colombia is a country in north west South America with 32 departments and the Capital District of Bogotá (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). The cities with the highest number of registered leptospirosis cases in 2021 are the 3 most populous: Bogotá (population about 7.39 million residents) in central Colombia, Medellín (about 2.4 million) in north-central Colombia, and Cali (about 2.2 million) in south west Colombia. - Mod.ML
