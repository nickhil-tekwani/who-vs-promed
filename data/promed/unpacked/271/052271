With symptom onset between 17 Jul 2015 and 31 Aug 2015, 11 cases of Louse-borne-relapsing fever (LBRF) caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_ have been diagnosed in Germany -- all among asylum seekers/refugees from Horn-of-Africa countries (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia).

Case data are incomplete, but among cases with known travel route pre-arrival to Germany, all have traveled through Libya, crossing the Mediterranean to Italy. Some have mentioned extended waiting periods in Libya. Interviewed cases reported other acute febrile diseases among migrants and even deaths among migrants due to the disease. Passage through Italy appears to have been rather swift, and changes of clothing there were mentioned by some.

The cluster of LBRF-cases diagnosed in Germany -- n=11, thereof 5 published (1), Switzerland (2) and the Netherlands (n=2) (3) -- is likely the tip of the iceberg. Given the communal travel route via Libya, often with long waiting periods there, the maximal incubation period of LBRF of less than 20 days, and the fact that untreated LBRF causes severe illness and substantial lethality, it seems very likely that lice bearing _B. recurrentis_ are currently being transmitted among migrants in camps in Libya.

As untreated LBRF causes severe illness and substantial lethality, morbidity and mortality due to LBRF in these migrant camps in Libya might be considerable. Humanitarian-aid organizations operating in the Mediterranean and countries receiving migrants from Horn-of-Africa countries should currently be aware of LBRF.

[The following is extracted from a post by my colleague Mod.ML:

"Relapsing fever is a bacterial infection caused by certain species of the spirochete _Borrelia_. These organisms are able to periodically change their surface protein molecules to evade the host's immune response, thus causing a relapsing illness. Following an incubation period of about 7 days, the illness is characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, each episode lasting several days, followed by a several-day asymptomatic interval. There may be up to 3-4 recurrences. Complications may include involvement of the lungs (ARDS; acute respiratory distress syndrome), central nervous system, spinal cord, eyes, heart, and liver. The bacteremia is intense (more than 10 000 organisms per ml of blood) during febrile episodes, which allows detection of organisms on a Wright-Giemsa stained blood smear. Thick blood smears are more sensitive than thin smears.

LBRF is caused by a single species, _B. recurrentis_, transmitted through abraded skin when the body louse is crushed during scratching. LBRF is endemic in Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia. Outbreaks are found in developing regions affected by war and in refugee camps characterized by overcrowding and poor personal hygiene. While mammals and reptiles may serve as a reservoir for tick-borne _Borrelia_ species, humans are the only host of _B. recurrentis_.

Treatment of relapsing fever consists of either a tetracycline (such as doxycycline), a macrolide (such as erythromycin), penicillin, or other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone). LBRF can be treated effectively with a single dose of the antibiotic (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/137/5/573), whereas treatment of TBRF requires 7-10 days to prevent relapse. When initiating antibiotic therapy, all patients should be observed for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction, caused by massive release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and other cytokines, is manifest by a worsening of symptoms with rigors, tachycardia, sweating, hypotension, and high fever, occurs in over 50 percent of cases."

It is important to note that the body louse, the vector for this infection, should probably be called the clothing louse, as it does not live on the body itself but rather on the person's clothes.

The following is extracted from reference 1 below with the citations removed:

"Heavily fed-on areas of the body such as the groin and flanks can become increasingly pigmented, referred to as Vagabond's disease. The female body louse _Pediculus humanus humanus_, attaches her eggs to clothing, not to the body or hair, often on the inner belts of underwear, pants, or skirts. The clothes are also the source of most of the louse feces, easily aerosolized, that contain the organism, which can be transmitted by the airborne route even in the absence of the human with LBRF.

When removed from the body, even in the absence of insecticides, unwashed clothes will be absent of viable lice and eggs within 7 days. Raoult and Roux cite Maunder, who hypothesized that the religious Sabbath and Sunday ritual days of rest with a change of clothes could be attributed to a delousing cycle."
