Lack of Evidence for the Transmission of CCHF to Iran from Saudi
Arabia
-------------------------------------------------
Please permit me to comment on the ProMED-mail posting "Crimean-
Congo hemorrhagic fever - Iran 20020525.4320". I am very worried
that erroneous [perhaps due to translation] statements like the
following have gone unchallenged:

"Health officials have warned that a new outbreak was possible with
hot weather coinciding with the return of Muslim pilgrims from the
annual hajj [pilgrimage] to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Relatives of pilgrims
slaughter cattle and distribute meat among neighbors."

The Hajj season concluded over 3 months ago and there have been no
reports of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Saudi Arabia
or elsewhere associated with the Hajj or returning pilgrims. I have
exhausted all possible sources to unearth any such available
information. Due to the short incubation period of the virus, any active
infection due to meat/contact with sheep from here would have
manifested by now. And this would have been recorded (if it
happened) in several other places to which pilgrims had returned. We
should also note that the last Hajj (early February 2002) did not occur
in hot weather, and the return of Hajj pilgrims has long been concluded.

No such reports have been appeared on the web-sites of OIE, WHO, or
ProMED-mail itself. The recent outbreak of meningitis linked with the
Hajj in Saudi did show such a pattern, with reports in various places of
geographical disparities. And this was well reported by ProMED-mail
[see postings referenced below, and 20000503.0679; 20000423.0604;
20000418.0559; 20000413.0525; 20000410.0511; 20000421.0583].

In this supposed scenario, we have nothing of the sort. One would also
expect Hajj-linked CCHF transmission to leave a detectable trail of
infection, with contacts exposed to the supposedly infected [e.g.
transporters, cargo workers, etc.], thus leading to intrafamilial
secondary and nosocomial infections. Cohorts of US or other western
pilgrims would have been exposed to any supposed epidemic at the
same time as the Iranians; if so, they would have been detected by the
sensitive surveillance systems in these places (which worked for the
meningitis referred to above).

Moderator CP's statement that: "There is no evidence that there is any
clinical disease in animals other than humans, but infection in domestic
animals puts the human population at risk " is in accord with the
literature (1,2). This makes it difficult to determine the CCHF status of
animals, as overt clinical signs are absent. There is little in the literature
that informs us of the viability of the CCHF virus in meat under the
various environmental conditions associated with slaughter by
pilgrims: there is a considerable time lag between slaughter in Saudi
Arabia and return home with supposedly infected meat.

I would gladly welcome any [new] information on this aspect of CCHF
epidemiology.

At the 6th Conference of the Regional Commission of the Office
International des Epizooties (OIE) for the Middle East, it was agreed
that a regional network for the surveillance of tick-transmitted diseases
should be established and that regional cooperation in the field of
research on tick-transmitted diseases should be enhanced (3). Nothing
is known to have been done so far. The authorities here and elsewhere
are urged to create and maintain a defined surveillance program for the
prevailing arboviruses in the region. The data gathered would indeed
help dispel unfounded rumors that may arise.

Rift Valley fever monitoring still occurs, however, with sero-
surveillance and vector surveillance. In the 70's, US veterinary
diagnostics experts were active in the CENTO countries [Iran, Turkey,
and Pakistan] but there seems to have been little or no focus on CCHF
(4).

Other factors may affect CCHF transmission from the region. The
threat of the spread of CCHF increases with the numbers of potentially
naive [to the virus] foreign military personnel in these highly endemic
regions at this time. Homebound personnel may serve as vehicles for
importation of CCHF (5) and other infections: this has been well
demonstrated by the recent Norwalk-like virus (NLV) infection of
British troops in the area. In this case the virus was exported from and
re-imported to the UK, and it was transmitted to their contacts. CCHF
virus is known, like the Ebola and Lassa fever viruses, to have a
greater propensity for such transmission patterns (2).

In conclusion, the complete absence of local reports here or elsewhere
of CCHF linked to the last Hajj season makes this report baseless and
highly misleading. Any sound, clarifying information would be
appreciated.
