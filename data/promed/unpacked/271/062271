There are 4 children under age 5 who are new measles victims after the outbreak in Cusco.

Pablo Grajeda, head of the Bureau of Health Intelligence Directorate Cusco Regional Health (Diresa) said that the child has high fever and rashes on various parts of his body, so we proceeded to perform scrub with vaccination in the area.

So far this year [2018] at least 76 suspected measles cases were recorded throughout the Cusco region. Analyzes are sent to Lima for confirmation or to rule out a case; the results usually come up in 3 weeks, said the doctor.

Four weeks ago, DIRESA Cusco asked the Ministry of Health (MoH), to declare a health emergency for an outbreak of measles; however, the request has not been answered. At this time, there are only vaccines for children under 5 years.

The province confirmed on Mon 22 Oct 2018 that 2 cases of measles have been reported in Manitoba.

According to Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, both people affected live in the Interlake Eastern Regional Health Authority and are recovering at home.

The 1st case, a child under the age of one, is believed to have contracted the measles virus out of the country. The 2nd case is a close contact of the child.

Public health officials have identified everyone in contact with the subjects and are continuing to monitor the situation.

[3] Europe: record high number of cases

Measles is sparking new concern after years of decline.

In the U.S., the CDC has confirmed 137 cases in 24 states and the District of Columbia. In Europe, measles cases have reached a record high.

Top health officials at the European Commission tell NBC News the root of the problem is plummeting vaccination rates sparked by a different kind of contagion, the growing anti-vaccine movement.

"It's the main factor leading to the outbreaks. it's unacceptable to have in the 21st century diseases that should have been and could have been eradicated," said Anca Paduraru with the European Commission.

A similar trend is now playing out in the U.S., where the CDC warns that the number of children not getting vaccinated is growing.

[4] Europe: anti-vaccination trend

http://www.realclearlife.com/daily-brief/anti-vaccination-trend-may-sparked-european-measles-outbreak/


41 000 cases of measles and 40 subsequent deaths emerged over the past year.

More than 2000 people in Italy alone have been diagnosed with measles in the past year, a health epidemic that's symptomatic of an even larger problem.

Experts say the reason for this dangerous uptick across the continent is that many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. And because of the growth in influence of the anti-vaccination movement in the United States, the rising numbers could be a preview of what's in store on this side of the Atlantic.

"It's the main factor leading to the outbreaks," a European Commission in Brussels spokesperson said. "It's unacceptable to have in the 21st century diseases that should have been and could have been eradicated."

One of those infected Italian citizens of Rome told NBC News she wasn't vaccinated as a child because it wasn't required. She was diagnosed with the illness last year [2017] while 32-weeks pregnant with her 1st child.

Her son was not infected, but both he and the mother were quarantined for 5 days after she delivered. The new mother came down with pneumonia as a symptom of her measles as well as a fever, cough and "congestion so bad she could barely breathe," NBC reported.

"If you do the vaccination, you love yourself, you love your sons, and you love everybody," she told the news site. "You protect everybody. It's not just for myself or for my son."

England is another country with a rising measles rate, even after the nation was declared free of the disease by the World Health Organization just one year ago.

The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has expressed alarm over the sudden increase of measles cases in the region this year [edited].

Ruff Vincent Valdevieso, expanded immunization program coordinator of DOH-7, said that they have recorded at least 290 cases of measles from January to 13 Oct this year [2018]. One person was reportedly dead due to measles.

Valdevieso explained that it is 559% higher compared to the same period last year [2017]. In 2017, only 44 measles cases were recorded.

The sudden increase of cases this year [2018] was attributed to the low turnout of people in availing the free immunization services at local health centers.

Provincial Minister for Health and Population Welfare Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho on Mon [22 Oct 2018] said that a measles campaign in Sindh is underway and will continue until 27 Oct 2018. Project Director, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), Sindh Dr Zahoor Baloch was also present on this occasion.

Pechuho said the measles drive in Sindh had reached the one-week mark, and teams had done a great job in covering children across Sindh province. She said the total target for the last 7 days was 3.76 million children, out of which 97% (3.65 million children) had been covered across the province. She said the total target for the measles campaign was 7.1 million children, and they were on the way to achieve above 95% of the target, and the 1st week's results were heartening.

"The measles vaccine will help save lives. There have been 122 measles related deaths this year [2018] and this campaign will save children from this deadly disease," she added.

She said: "There are certain areas in Karachi where more attention needs to be paid to increase coverage, especially in Central and West Districts of the city. Deputy Commissioners and DHOs must lead vaccination efforts so that we can get maximum coverage this week."

The health minister said that the campaign would continue until 27 Oct 2018. Pechuho appealed to parents in posh neighborhoods to visit their health care providers and fixed sites and provide this additional dose of the measles vaccine to children so as to save them from this disease.

She said in interior Sindh, all districts had achieved above 95% coverage. Over all in the province, 735 Union Councils [UCs] have more than 95% coverage, and 134 have above 90% coverage. There are a total of 188 union councils with less than 90% coverage, and special attention needs to be paid to these areas.

"The UCs with less than 90% coverage were in North Karachi, North Nazimabad, Gulberg, Gadap, SITE Orangi, Korangi, Shah Faisal, Landhi and some others. I direct the staff to increase their focus on these Union Councils," she added.

She said 11 760 Social Mobilizers were being used to raise awareness about the campaign, and 1408 1st level supervisors, 356 2nd level supervisors, and 1123 AEFI focal persons are ensuring a smooth campaign. Pechuho said major private hospitals, Pakistan Paediatric Association, government departments, NGOs and partners were providing support to the campaign.

Public Health Services is urging Tasmanians to check whether they are up to date with their measles vaccinations, following Tasmania's 1st confirmed case since 2016.

An East Coast resident was diagnosed with measles on Sat [20 Oct 2018]. The infection was caught during travel in Southeast Asia.

Public Health director Dr Mark Veitch said Public Health Services had worked with local healthcare providers to give advice and immunisation to people in contact with the person.

"All people born during or after 1966, and aged 12 months or older, need to have had 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine to be sure they are immune," Dr Veitch said.

"Measles vaccine is free under the National Immunisation Program for children at age 12 months with a booster at 18 months. People aged 12 months or over travelling overseas should speak with their GP or travel clinic to ensure they've received 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine. This includes people born overseas who travel home to visit family and friends."

People working in healthcare, childcare, long-term care and correctional facilities are also advised to ensure their measles immunisations are up to date.

"People born before 1966 do not need to receive vaccine, as the virus was very common before this time, and most people will have developed immunity from infection in early childhood," Dr Veitch said.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness with symptoms that include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a rash.

Measles can cause severe complications including ear infections, pneumonia and brain damage.

[This report highlights the importance of checking vaccine status before travel. Even though measles may be eliminated from your home country, you are not protected when you travel unless you are immunized. You also are not protected when an infected individual enters your home country unless you have the full vaccination series.

All the cases reported in this post were preventable had the individuals been vaccinated with the safe and effective MMR vaccine. Perhaps after enough of the anti-vaxxer population experiences serious cases of measles in their children, the resistance will diminish. - Mod.LK]
