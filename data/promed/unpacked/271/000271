A Comment on Prevalence of Rabies in Bats in British Columbia
---------------------------------------------------
It is important to clarify the comments made by the moderator
regarding the proportion of bats in British Columbia that carry
rabies. To my knowledge, there has been no systematic survey of bat
populations for rabies prevalence in the province. The figure of 2-10
percent quoted represents the proportion of bats that are submitted
for rabies testing that in fact test positive. Bats typically are
tested in British Columbia only when there are concerns about
possible human exposure and/or the animal is demonstrating clinically
compatible behaviors. Therefore, this subpopulation is not
representative of the general bat population, and one can safely
assume over-estimates the overall population prevalence of rabies.
I feel a correction is required, as I would hate to see confusion
reinforced in the local public health community regarding the nature
of rabies risk in British Columbia. While prevalence estimates should
not affect the decision for post-exposure prophylaxis in any
individual case, it may affect recommendation on bat control. Given
this recent case, there will be a variety of proclamations about bats
as they emerge from their hibernation this summer. If folks modify
their risk estimates based on an erroneous prevalence estimate, it
could cause unnecessary clashes between public health and
conservation objectives in the province.

Updated Statistic for Insectivorous Bat-associated Rabies in North America
---------------------------------------------------
The moderator commented in part; "In the United States 24 (74
percent) of the 32 human rabies cases reported since 1990 have been
attributed to insectivorous bat-associated variants of rabies virus."
I am employed in regulatory veterinary medicine. My responsibilities
include rabies control. Since bat rabies is endemic in my district, I
try to keep abreast of current information. The statistics referred
to above actually relate to the period between 1990 and 2000. To date
since 2000, there have been an additional 4 cases of human rabies due
to bat strains in North America. The most recent case in British
Columbia is under investigation. The other 3 cases (Calif Mar/02,
Iowa Sep/02 and Tenn. Sep/02) had no history of a bat bite, although
there was documented contact in the Tennessee case.
In light of this, the correct statistic would be 36 cases of rabies
in humans in USA and Canada since 1990, 81 percent of which have been
attributed to insectivorous bat-associated variants of rabies virus,
with a history of bat bite being established in only 2 cases.

[I am indebted to Craig Stephen and Arthur King for these corrections
and updates. Regarding the prevalence of rabies in bats in British
Columbia, my comment as Moderator was extracted from the ProMED-mail
archive for 1998: see Rabies, bats - Canada (Victoria, British
Columbia) 19980731.1459. Dr. Stephen has further indicated that an
official government statement on the rates of positive bats being
tested can be obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
Lethbridge Laboratory (Animal Disease Research Institute), as they
are responsible for testing bats from western Canada. - Mod.CP]
