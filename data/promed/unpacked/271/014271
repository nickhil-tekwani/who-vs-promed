The Culling Fields
------------------
On 29 Apr 2009, amid growing international concern about Influenza A
(H1N1), better known as swine flu, [Egypt's] Minister of Health and
Population Hatem El-Gabali announced a cull of the nation's nearly
350 000 pigs. Local pig farmers and butchers were outraged at
El-Gabali's decision, calling it brutal and unfair, and insisting
their animals were clean. Soon after the 1st announcement, Ministry
of Health and Population officials changed the rationale for their
announcement: Now, they say, the cull is not a measure against swine
flu but is intended more generally to improve public health.

"We know that we don't have a real threat from the pigs now. The real
threat is going to be spread from human to human [contact]," admits
Ministry of Health and Population spokesman Dr. Abdel Rahman Shahin.
He claims that the government was responding to a ministry
committee's recommendation from 2006, which urged relocating the
farms due to concerns about the unhygienic conditions in which the
pigs and their farmers live. The decision, he explains, was to get
rid of the current population of pigs so that the industry can be
rebuilt with new farms away from the human population and their
homes. Yet, whether the government will follow through with its
promises of aid and compensation remains to be seen.

This isn't the 1st time the nation has dealt with a viral outbreak.
The deadly H5N1 avian flu virus -- which 1st appeared in Asia in 2003
-- eventually found its way to Egypt in 2006, with the 1st reported
bird infection in February of that year and its 1st human case just
one month later. Despite the government closing all live poultry
shops and culling the nation's poultry, avian flu is now endemic to
the country; to date, 27 people have died, mostly adults and older
children exposed to infected birds in rooftop and backyard coops [On
8 Jun 2009, Egypt reported its most recent, 80th human H5N1 case, a
4-year-old girl. - Mod.AS]

Taking a lesson from its experience with the avian flu, the
government is attempting to be proactive and prevent the new flu's
spread before any human cases are detected here.

According to the Association for the Protection of the Environment
(APE), there are 6 to 8 garbage cities throughout the country;
Cairo's Manshiet Nasser is the largest of them. Pigs are raised in
all the garbage cities, including Moqattam, Baragil near Imbaba, and
Fifteenth of May City in Helwan. Shahin estimates that there are 350
000 - 500 000 pigs in the country; at press time [end May 2009], some
104 000 of them had been slaughtered.

"When the decision 1st came, the government said that they will just
bury all the pigs, but when people got angry, they decided that they
would slaughter pigs, so that the owners would still use the meat,"
says Bekhit Rizk, who once had a pig farm and now works for APE.

Health officials told pig farmers that they are responsible for
bringing their pigs to Basateen, the large abattoir in Cairo, where
they can either slaughter the pigs themselves or hire someone to do
it for them, says Rizk. Additionally, the farmers say they requested
LE 1000 [USD 178.60] per pig in compensation, but they received only
LE 50 [USD 8.93] for piglets, LE 250 [USD 44.65] for pregnant sows
and LE 100 [USD 17.86] for males.

For most zabaleen ['garbage collectors' in Arabic], garbage
collecting and pig farming are the only trades they know, and are
their main sources of income. Killing the pigs will turn the farmers
into beggars, angry Manshiet Nasser residents told Egypt, threatening
to stop collecting garbage.

On 29 Apr 2009, panicked at the thought of losing their means of
income, the community took action. When health and security officials
entered Manshiet Nasser to inspect the pigs, outraged residents
hurled stones at the ministry and police vehicles, resulting in the
arrest of 16 people.

"The police and the government officials were cooperative," says
Father Sama'an Ibrahim, the pastor of St. Sama'an's Church and
Monastery and the godfather of Manshiet Nasser. "But the people were
afraid of losing all they have; they are poor and have nothing but
pigs and garbage."

Because consuming pork is taboo in Islam, pig farming is an
occupation carried out solely by Christians -- evidenced by the
crosses that adorn almost every home, coffee shop and work area in
the neighborhood. The cull has raised tension between the Coptic
minority and the Muslim majority.

"We feel we are discriminated against because all the people working
in this industry, either [in] farming, garbage collecting or selling
pork, are Copts," says Rizk. "[The government has] wanted to get rid
of the pigs in Egypt for a long time, and now it is their chance to
do it, to end this business of pig farming here in Egypt. They cannot
do this with our pigs and our resources."

If local pig farming disappears, so will the market for pork
products. According to Rizk, pig farmers in Manshiet Nasser do not
sell directly to restaurants; instead they sell pork products to
locals and middlemen who are responsible for delivering the meat to
hotels and restaurants.

Despite the fact that there have been no swine flu cases in Egypt [as
of the time this article went to press, end May 2009; Egypt's 1st
H1N1 case in humans was reported 2 Jun 2009, rising to 26 by 16 Jun
2009. - Mod.AS], the general public is in a panic over the virus. On
6 May 2009, the popular TV talk show El-Beit Beitak aired a video of
locals in the Abu Rawash district near Haram hurling stones at pigs
and trying to run them over with their vehicles. Reportedly, the
residents became alarmed after seeing some live and dead pigs on the
road, believed to have fallen off trucks while being transported, and
rumors quickly spread that the animals were infected with the virus.

Another video shot on 15 May 2009 by Maha El Bahnasawy, a reporter
for independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm, caused further outrage at the
brutal methods being used to slaughter the pigs. The video, aired on
the newspaper's website, showed pigs being transported by trucks to
the landfill in Abu Za'abal. The pigs are then beaten with iron bars
and scooped up alive by bulldozers; the people responsible for
slaughtering are seen pouring disinfectants on the pigs before
burying them alive.

At least 5 petitions were posted under the animal welfare page on
<http://www.care2.com>, a website that promotes
environmentally-minded activism and healthy living, soliciting
signatures from people to end the "senseless slaughter" of pigs in
Egypt. Nearly 1800 signatures appeared on one petition posted by the
Society for the Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt (SPARE). Health
Ministry officials were not available to respond to the videos and
conflict between the images and the government's official statements
that the pigs are being slaughtered for public consumption.

With the pigs destroyed, the zabaleen say that the garbage problem in
Egypt is likely to increase dramatically. Isaac Mikhail, director of
the Association of Garbage Collectors for Community Development
(AGCCD), says that the community gathers and segregates 8000 tons of
garbage every day. Ff this, 40 percent is solid waste, such as paper
and plastic, while 60 percent is organic waste. The pigs eat about
30-40 percent of the organic garbage.

The problem, says Tarek Tawfik, chairman of Chamber of Food
Industries, is that most of the pigs in Egypt are usually raised in
areas equivalent to small garbage dumps, making the hygiene standards
very low. "There have been several discussions that this industry
needs to be organized in a more hygienic way, by moving it outside
the periphery of city and having [the pigs] raised under more
hygienic standards in model farms as it's done all over the world.
The way they raise pigs over here is very primitive," says Tawfik.

Yet, with the pigs' garbage consumption rates in the thousands of
tons, one can imagine that a considerable amount of trash would begin
piling up without them.

Government officials claim that their goal is to improve, not
eliminate pig farming. Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation
Amin Abaza announced that model pig farms -- meaning, farms that
comply with international industry standards -- will be established
in Fifteenth of May City. The agriculture and health ministries,
along with the Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, will
cooperate on developing the farms, he says, with the government
providing infrastructure, water and electricity for farmers. The new
proposed location lies about 25 km [15.5 miles] away from Manshiet
Nasser, and farther for some of the other garbage cities.

"We met with the officials, and they said that they will only move
farmers and merchants who have facilities such as cars, and can
afford to go back and forth," says AGCCD's Mikhail. Yet still unclear
is what will happen to those zabaleen who do not own cars and would
have no form of transportation to take them from the new location to
the city for garbage collection. Despite government assurances that
it will support in the move, the zabaleen remain mistrustful.

[As apparent from the above detailed, comprehensive report (the full
text is available at the given URL), the rationale for the announced
pig culling by the Egyptian authorities was initially their "concerns
about Influenza A (H1N1)," later modified to become "a measure
intended more generally to improve public health." Strangely, they
did not use a scientifically more defendable excuse for their
exceptional and severely criticized measure, namely the prevention of
(at least, theoretically) possible reassortment of a potentially
lethal and highly infectious virus strain, in pigs dually infected
with both viruses. Such reassortment could, obviously, take place in
humans as well. Egypt has reported, so far, 80 human cases of HPAI
H5N1.

The above scenario is applicable to 3 additional countries where both
viruses already circulate, namely China, India and Viet Nam.
According to OIE's 2007 data, the pig populations and their density
(animals per sq/km; in brackets) in the said countries is the
following: China -- 1 004 977 300 (104.72); India -- 13 519 000
(4.11); Viet Nam -- 26 560 651 (80.59). China's pig population is
the world's largest and most dense; Viet Nam's pig population density
is not far behind.

Out of the 9 countries known to be infected by HPAI H5N1 during 2009,
6 have not (yet) reported the novel A(H1N1) virus; those are
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia and Nepal. - Mod.AS]
