The Environment Ministry has issued orders to local authorities around the country to act to reduce the mosquito population in their jurisdictions, after mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus were discovered at a number of locations in Israel. The infected mosquitoes were discovered in areas that included Pardes Chana, Caesarea, Binyamina, and the Menashe [Haifa district], Mateh Yehudah [Jerusalem district] and Gezer [Central district] regional councils.

The infected mosquitoes were discovered over the past 2 weeks in routine inspections by the ministry. However, officials said, because the infected mosquitoes were found in distinct geographic regions, it is likely that they are present in other areas. The ministry ordered that pesticides and other materials be sprayed in rural and suburban areas around the country to prevent further spread of the disease.

Dr Uri Shalom of the ministry said that residents should avoid collected water sources in backyards and on the sides of roads, as well as in parks and bomb shelters -- anywhere standing water could harbor mosquito nests. The use of anti mosquito creams and formulas is also encouraged, as is wearing long-sleeved clothing and avoiding shorts. The virus is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on birds and animals infected with West Nile virus, and it is then transmitted to humans when mosquitoes bite them.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in Israel, with 40-160 cases reported annually. One of the primary routes of WNV transmission is via migrating birds and Israel is located on a central migratory path between Africa and Eurasia (Leshem Y, Yom-Tov Y. Routes of migrating soaring birds in Israel. International J Avian Sci. 1998; 140: 41-52). Most West Nile fever (WNF) cases reported in recent years were among residents of the coastal plain (Bassal R, Shohat T, Kaufman Z, et al. The seroprevalence of West Nile Virus in Israel: A nationwide cross sectional study. PLoS One. 2017; 12(6): e0179774. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0179774; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179774)

Diverse WNV lineages clades and clusters has been isolated from mosquitoes in Israel during the past 15 years and the Mediterranean subtype of WNV lineage 1 has been found to permanently circulate in the region (Lustig Y, Hindiyeh M, Orshan L, et al. Mosquito surveillance for 15 years reveals high genetic diversity among West Nile Viruses in Israel. J Infect Dis. 2016; 213: 1107-14. pmid:26597260; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/213/7/1107/2912151).

A nationwide cross sectional study by Bassal et al, reported high (11.1 percent) seroprevalence of WNV in Israel in 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179774).

As no WNV vaccine is currently available for humans, the most effective way to avoid WNV infections is to raise the awareness of the population on reducing the risk of mosquito bites by using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and reducing mosquito breeding sites. At the national level, the mosquito surveillance program can help minimize the transmission of the virus all over Israel, but should focus especially at high risk areas. - Mod.UBA
