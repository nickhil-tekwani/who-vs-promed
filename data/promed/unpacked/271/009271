Health Data Monitored for Bioterror Warning
-----------------------
To secure early warning of a bioterror attack, the government is building a
computerized network that will collect and analyze health data of people in
8 major cities, administration officials say.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is to lead the
multimillion-dollar surveillance effort, which officials expect to become
the cornerstone of a national network to spot disease outbreaks by tracking
data like doctor reports, emergency room visits, and sales of flu medicine.
"Our goal is to have a model that any city could pick up and apply," a
senior administration official said of the plan.
Officials would not disclose the program's cost or which cities will be
involved. But experts say Washington, DC is likely to be one of the 8. {It
shouldn't be hard to guess most of the others: New York City, Los Angeles,
for starters? - Mod.JW]
Such surveillance is now possible because of an explosion in commercial
medical databases that health authorities, with permission and under strict
legal agreements, are starting to mine. In ambition and potential
usefulness, the health network goes far beyond the environmental
surveillance system, disclosed by the administration last week, that will
sniff the air for dangerous germs.
The emerging health monitoring network, officials and experts say, will
provide information that could save lives if terrorists strike with deadly
germs like smallpox or anthrax. In detecting attacks, a head start of even a
day or 2 can greatly lower death rates by letting doctors treat rapidly and
prevent an isolated outbreak from becoming an epidemic. A senior official
said President Bush was expected to refer to these new bioterrorism defenses
in his State of the Union address [on 28 Jan 2003].
Experts say the prospect of war with Iraq, and the chance that Baghdad might
retaliate with germ weapons, are accelerating the effort to expand and
integrate scores of rudimentary disease surveillance systems being developed
by cities, states, and the federal government. But public health experts
argue that even if the United States never suffers another bioterror attack
like the anthrax strikes of late 2001, the emerging network can still help
doctors better track, treat and prevent natural disease outbreaks. "We want
as much protection as we can afford," said Dr. Daniel M. Sosin, director of
public health surveillance at CDC, Atlanta. Dr. Sosin is helping to expand
the nation's health surveillance to incorporate the new systems.
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the health commissioner of New York City, which has
one of the nation's most highly developed rapid surveillance systems, said
the emerging network could help authorities gauge the dimensions of germ
attacks and reassure the public. He pointed to a case in November 2002 in
which a New Mexico man visiting New York was found to have bubonic plague, a
deadly contagious disease. "We were concerned this was bioterrorism," Dr.
Frieden said. "But we didn't see any signals. We didn't see any alarms. That
added to our confidence to rule out bioterrorism." [The patient contracted
plague in an endemic area of New Mexico -- see ref. below. - Mod.JW]
Experts say most of the new systems, military and civilian, are still
experimental. A critical challenge is finding needles in the haystacks of
data about common ailments like respiratory infections, which can rise and
fall with great suddenness in winter.
Dr. Marcelle Layton, New York City's assistant health commissioner for
communicable diseases, said another challenge was ensuring that there are
enough public health officials to respond to alarms that the new
environmental and medical surveillance systems might sound. "The best
system will be useless if it's only a fire alarm with no firefighters to put
out the flames," Dr. Layton said. Nonetheless, expectations run high. "We
think this will be important," said Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff, a physician at the
Sandia National Laboratories who helped develop a widely used surveillance
method, the Rapid Syndrome Validation Project, which is now used in
California, New Mexico, Texas, Singapore, and Australia. "We need to get
disease reporting from the 19th to the 21st century."
For decades, disease surveillance has valued accuracy over speed. Nurses,
doctors and public health officers gather raw data, often using paper forms
sent by mail. In the background, federal, state, and private laboratories
use advanced technologies to determine the causes of disease and confirm
diagnoses. But the process tends to take days or even weeks.
Moreover, the system is narrow, revealing little about the nation's overall
health. While the federal disease control agency [CDC] has more than 100
surveillance systems, most are designed to track a single organism or
condition, like heart disease or flu virus. In addition, most are
independent of one another. The system has serious gaps. While laboratories
usually comply with federal rules to report certain illnesses to health
authorities, physicians often do not.
Syndromic surveillance
--------------------
The military and the national weapons laboratories, increasingly worried
about germ attacks, tried a new approach in the late 1990's. To learn of
impending trouble quickly, they decided to scrutinize populations for clues
of diseases before they were officially diagnosed. Experts zeroed in on how
clusters of such symptoms as fever, cough, headache, vomiting, rash, and
diarrhea could suggest -- but not prove -- the presence of particular
diseases, some of them lethal. The method was called syndromic surveillance.
An early military system was the Electronic Surveillance System for Early
Notification of Community-Based Epidemics, or Essence. It drew medical data
from some 400 000 members of the military and their dependents who lived in
the Washington area -- a major potential terrorist target, but hard for
civilians to scan medically because of "the numerous city, county, and state
jurisdictions," according to a Defense Department statement.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency [DARPA] put $12 million into an experimental program,
Essence 2, which tracked millions of civilians in the Washington [DC] area
for signs of bioterrorism. Joe Lombardo, a civilian who runs Essence 2,
which is based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland,
said it gathers electronic records from drugstore chains, hospitals, and
physician groups. Mr. Lombardo said about a dozen people were developing the
technology and collecting and analyzing the data. He said. "Our objective
is to support public health. The information we receive has been sanitized
by the provider to ensure that it is impossible to identify individuals."
Privacy concerns
-------------
The emerging network has raised concerns that such surveillance may violate
individual medical privacy rights, and computer surveillance itself has
drawn criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, members of Congress
and others. But supporters of the emerging surveillance network insist it
raises few privacy issues, saying that the data are purged of names and
identifiers. People are not tracked as individuals, they say, but their
symptoms are, and often their age, sex, and ZIP code as well. The system is
needed, proponents say, because few cheap, reliable sensors exist for
detecting deadly germs in such likely target areas as subways and shopping
malls. Sensors are also prone to false positives, or incorrect germ
identifications.
A Pentagon planning document on the surveillance effort for fiscal 2002 and
2003 said the Defense Department was working to develop "enhanced automated
privacy protection methods" that will "assure the anonymity of records
accessed by the data monitoring software."
Experts say that privacy can, in theory, be violated when connections are
made between disparate databases -- for instance, between those of physician
payment and disease diagnosis, or health and law enforcement. They also say
the potential for personal identification increases as the surveillance
becomes a 2-way street in which not only are problems detected but
physicians are notified about potential problems involving individual
patients. Administration officials say the new 8-city disease control
network will deal with the privacy issue directly. "We have to satisfy the
legal constraints, and also people's concerns," a senior official said.
Other civilian surveillance systems are emerging quickly. In Boston, the
Harvard Medical School faculty and the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health are working closely with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a health
maintenance organization. For more than a year, the team has studied data
from 175 000 people in eastern Massachusetts, and it will soon cover as many
as 20 million people coast to coast. In October 2002, CDC awarded the
Harvard team $1.2 million to expand its pilot network nationally. The
expansion will not monitor cities, but will concentrate on patients calling
an after-hours medical advisory service. Health officials say civilian
emphasis in the developing surveillance field will help ensure privacy and
enhance routine disease monitoring.
"It's the practical stuff that's most promising," Dr. Sosin of CDC said.
"Whether this is going to detect terrorism is unclear. But as a safety net
and for tracking an event once it's going on, it's very promising."

[ProMED-mail has covered several of the initiatives falling under the
heading of "syndromic surveillance" in 2002 under the thread "Disease
surveillance, enhancement," and readers are referred to prior postings
listed below for additional information and links. The above newswire
article raises interesting points, not the least being the very astute
comment on the part of Dr. Layton from New York City about the need to have
adequate trained staffing/personnel to respond to the various alerts that
are produced by the increased surveillance information/data generated. One
hopes that a part of the funding that is being allocated for the
implementation of these additional complementary syndromic surveillance
systems will include increasing the disease investigation and control
capabilities of the geographic areas that will have this additional
information available. - Mod.MPP]
