Oahe White Bass Die-Off Caused By Bacteria, Warm Water Stress
------------------------------------------------
Game, Fish and Parks officials say bacteria are responsible for Lake Oahe's
white bass deaths.
Results from a diagnostic laboratory confirmed that the _Flavobacterium
columnare_ bacteria [also called _Flexibacter columnaris_], commonly
referred to as columnaris, are to blame for the recent white bass die-off
on Lake Oahe.
Game, Fish and Parks Fisheries Biologist Robert Hanten of Pierre said,
"Warm water temperatures that are common this time of year create stressful
conditions for white bass and make them more susceptible to this common
microorganism."
"White bass die-offs are unfortunate and unsightly, but not uncommon," he
said. "Other states have experienced similar fish die-offs that were due to
outbreaks of columnaris bacteria, which were also associated with warm
water temperatures."
Columnaris bacteria affect the gill filaments of fish, and a schooling
species of fish, like white bass, are especially susceptible. "The bacteria
attach to the gill surface, grow in spreading patches and eventually cover
the gill filaments," Hanten noted. "Skin lesions may also be noted on the
body and inside the fish's mouth. The end result of a heavy infection is
mortality."
Bacteria such as columnaris are found in all natural waters and do not
affect healthy fish. However, when fish become stressed, they are much more
susceptible to diseases. Fish can experience stress due to many things such
as warm water temperatures, injuries, limited food, and spawning.
"White bass die-offs of large magnitude do have an impact on the overall
white bass population, but white bass populations are very resilient and
they reproduce in high numbers," Hanten said. "The high reproductive
potential of white bass allows for them to recover quickly from die-offs
like the one that is occurring on Lake Oahe."
Anglers and other water enthusiasts have 2 main concerns with this
occurrence. Is there any danger to game fish populations and is there any
danger to humans?
"This fish die-off has been limited to just white bass, and no other game
fish have been affected," Hanten said. "At this time, we feel that the
columnaris bacteria pose no risk to humans. The die-off will run its course
and things will return to normal on the big lake."
Fish sent off to diagnostic laboratory were also tested for the anthrax
bacterium, and as expected, came back negative for the bacteria. Anthrax
is soil-based and only infects mammals, typically grazing herbivores such
as sheep, cattle and goats and does not infect amphibians, reptiles or fish.
