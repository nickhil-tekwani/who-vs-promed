[ProMED received the following EpiCore response from an anonymous contributer: "Many newspapers in Korea have started to report this swine fever outbreak at Hallim-eup in Jeju-do since 29 Jun 2016. The Korea Times said nearly 4700 hogs have been slaughtered on Jeju-do due to this swine fever outbreak (http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/06/116_208224.html).

The government created a containment zone of 3-km around the incident farm and continues surveillance within the containment and/or protection zone (CBS News, http://m.post.naver.com/viewer/postView.nhn?volumeNo=4556041&memberNo=31875496&vType=VERTICAL, Korean).

The pathogenic virus was allegedly imported from China. There were no secondary infected hogs or any suspected hogs in other regions in Jeju-do until 7 Jul 2016, though vigorous on-going surveillance (http://news1.kr/articles/?2712783, Korean)."

South Korea's swine industry counts (OIE's most recent available data, 2014) 10 090 376 animals in 5177 establishments (for comparison: the UK 2014 figures are 4 618 020 and 10 806, respectively). This may explain the severity of the applied control measures, including stamping out as well as other prevention and control measures, which are described in much detail in the report.

According to the report, the event involved 2 animals with "sub-clinical infection," leading to their -- and the entire holding's -- immediate destruction. Such a scenario may be indicative of an ongoing monitoring/surveillance scheme. Details thereof, or of a possible other policy explaining the detection of the infection, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
