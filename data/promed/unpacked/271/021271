----------------------------------------------------------------------
The posting above included the moderator's comment about the possible
origin of the African swine fever virus that has infected the
Caucasus, "probably introduced (from West Africa?) via importation, by
ship, of contaminated pork or pork waste".

This needs correction. The virus is a genotype II virus that has
otherwise been identified from outbreaks in southeastern Africa and
this information has been published (Rowlands et al: African swine
fever virus isolate, Georgia, 2007. Emerg Infect Dis. 14(12) December
2008; available from <http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/12/1870.htm>
(accessed 12 Apr 2008): The African swine fever virus isolate
introduced to Georgia 2007 is closely related to isolates from
genotype II circulating in Mozambique, Madagascar and Zambia).

All of the West African outbreaks have been caused by genotype I
viruses. This was described in 2003 (Bastos ADS et al. 2003:
Genotyping field strains of African swine fever virus by partial p72
gene characterisation. Archives of Virology 148: 693-706; abstract
available from
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/bm8ma63dcp6utmub/>) and the
situation has not changed since then.

[Prof. Penrith is gratefully acknowledged for the correction. In fact,
on 9 Jun 2007 ProMED-mail published the firsthand genotyping results,
from Pirbright, of the Georgian ASF isolate (archive no.
20070609.1886); for subscribers' convenience, it is hereby reproduced:

Information on the genomic characterization of African swine fever
virus isolate from Georgia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
African swine fever virus (ASFV) samples were received from Georgia on
2 Jun 2007 by the ASFV OIE Reference Laboratory at the Institute for
Animal Health Pirbright Laboratory UK and were confirmed positive on 3
Jun 2007 and reported to both the Georgians and OIE on 4 Jun 2007.

Sequence analysis of 2 genome fragments (3' end of the p72 gene and
central variable region of the B602L gene) has now been completed.
This analysis showed that the Georgia 2007 ASFV outbreak was caused by
the introduction of a virus belonging to a genotype (Genotype II,
Lubisi et al, 2005) previously identified to contain isolates obtained
from domestic pigs, isolated between 1993 and 2002, in Mozambique and
Zambia in the eastern part of southern Africa and isolates introduced
into Madagascar when ASFV spread to the island in 1998.

Since very few ASFV samples are submitted for genotyping it is
possible that viruses belonging to this genotype may be more
widespread. However, it seems likely that the source of infection is
from the eastern side of southern Africa rather than west or central
Africa or Sardinia.
