Public Health Dispatch: Coccidioidomycosis Among Persons Attending
the World Championship of Model Airplane Flying --- Kern County,
California, October 2001
---------------
On 4 Dec 2001, CDC was notified by the United Kingdom (UK) Public
Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) of a UK resident aged 72 years who
had culture-confirmed coccidioidomycosis (i.e., Valley fever)
diagnosed in early December. During 8 -12 Oct 2001, the patient had
attended the world championship of model airplane flying in Lost Hills,
California, located in Kern County in the Central Valley of California,
an area where coccidioidomycosis is highly endemic. The patient had
influenza-like symptoms on approximately 25 Oct 2001, 1 week after
returning from Lost Hills. CDC, in collaboration with UK PHLS and the
California Department of Health Services, is conducting an
investigation.
The championship was an international event with competing teams
from 30 countries in the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific. Each
participating team had up to 11 members. In addition, several
spectators may have traveled with each team.
Coccidioidomycosis is caused by inhalation of arthrospores of the
dimorphic fungus _Coccidioides immitis_. Outbreaks typically have
occurred following dust-generating events such as archaeologic digs
(1). Among newly infected persons, 40 percent acquire a self-limited
influenza-like syndrome with fever, chest pain, cough, malaise, chills,
night sweats, arthralgias, and rash. Disseminated disease may develop
involving the meninges, bones, joints, skin, and soft tissues. Infants,
pregnant women, persons of Filipino and African descent, and
immunosuppressed persons (e.g., those on chronic steroids or with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are at increased risk for
disseminated infection. Treatment with antifungal drugs usually is
required only for severe or disseminated disease (2).
Coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed by culture, histopathology, or
serology. Serologic criteria for diagnosis include detection of
coccidioidal IgM by immunodiffusion, enzyme immunoassay (EIA),
latex agglutination, or tube precipitation, or by detection of rising IgG
titers by immunodiffusion, EIA, or complement fixation.
Coccidioidomycosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis
for persons with a clinically compatible illness and with a history of
travel to this event. Persons who attended this event and who acquire
symptoms should seek appropriate medical care. Clinical evaluation
should include a serum specimen for IgG and IgM titers and
appropriate cultures if evidence of disseminated disease exists.
Health-care providers or championship participants and spectators
from California are encouraged to contact the California Department of
Health Services at 619-692-8664 or <knm6@cdc.gov> to discuss the
need for testing.
Other participants, spectators, or health-care providers in the United
States or abroad may contact CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch at:
404-639-1299 or <tnc4@cdc.gov>.

Cases of coccidioidomycosis in Europe due to exposure in
California,United States
-------------------
In the past month, 2 cases of coccidioidomycosis (valley fever, a rare
fungal infection) have been diagnosed in Europe. The first case was
diagnosed in a Finnish man in his mid-50s who developed chills and
fever in mid-October, followed by severe respiratory symptoms. He
was admitted to a hospital in Finland, and chest radiograph taken at the
time showed pneumonic infiltrate. The patient improved after
antibacterial treatment, but his x-ray films remained abnormal.
Serological analysis undertaken in Stockholm, Sweden, showed the
presence of _Coccidioides immitis_. The patient started treatment with
antifungals.
The second case was reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in London,
England, on 4 Dec 2001. The patient is a man in his 70s who was
admitted to his local hospital with a one-week history of profuse night
sweats, cough, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. He responded
to treatment initially and was discharged but relapsed after 2 weeks and
was readmitted. A diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was made by
isolating _C. immitis_ from broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid at PHL
mycology reference laboratory, Bristol, and rising serological titres
detected by the mycology reference centre, Leeds.
Both patients had attended the world championships of model
aeroplane flying in Lost Hills Valley, in Kern County, California,
United States, between 5 & 14 Oct 2001. After the championships, both
had travelled in California for several days before returning to their
home countries.
Kern County in California has a high incidence of coccidioidomycosis.
Surveys have found that approximately 30% of the population have
positive serology and are immune. All people who attended the
championship were given a short information leaflet, which included a
paragraph on valley fever; the risk of contracting the disease is
considered high in the dry, dusty weather of the autumn.
The championships were an international event with teams from 30
countries competing, 24 of which were from Europe (table). Each
country could send a maximum of 9 players and 2 managers. In
addition, each team was accompanied by several spectators and
supporters. From United Kingdom (UK), so far 38 people have been
identified who attended the championship.

To ensure that people at risk have not developed any symptoms, those
who attended the events should be contacted and, in case of symptoms,
investigated. CDSC is contacting all attendees from the UK to ascertain
that they are well. In addition, an investigation is being conducted to
determine who has serological markers of infection and identify
relevant risk factors. Because the disease is rare in Europe, clinicians
may not appreciate that they are dealing with fungal rather than
bacterial disease.
A general alert has therefore gone out to national surveillance centres.
The World Health Organization (WHO) in Copenhagen and Geneva has
been informed. It would be useful to get serological specimens from
people who have remained well or have had mild upper respiratory
tract symptoms to see if anyone had developed asymptomatic infection
with this fungus.
CDSC is coordinating this investigation in Europe and has the name of
the participants and contact details of the lead person in all of the
European countries with participants. This information is being
forwarded to the relevant surveillance centres. Simultaneously, the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is contacting and
providing support to participants from outside US.
Diagnosis and treatment
----------------------------
Coccidioidomycosis occurs in arid and semi-arid regions of the
western hemisphere, and the number of cases rose, especially in
California, in the 1990s. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of
the infective arthroconidia from soil. Infected humans or animals
cannot infect other humans. The incubation period is one to 4 weeks,
although it may disseminate insidiously years after the primary
infection.
The primary infection may be asymptomatic or resemble an acute
influenza-like illness with fever, chills, cough, and, rarely, pleuritic
pain. About 5% of all primary infections develop erythema nodosum
(most often seen in white female patients). Persons travelling to high-
incidence areas should be warned. Elderly and immunocompromised
people are at increased risk of contracting this infection. Risk of relapse
is also higher in these groups . Doctors whose patients present with a
travel history and atypical pneumonias or other possible symptoms
need to consider coccidioidomycosis.
Diagnosis is made microscopically or on culture of sputum, pus, urine,
cerebrospinal fluid, or biopsies of skin lesions. Immunoglobulin M
antibodies appear from 1-2 weeks to 3-4 months after onset of
symptoms while IgG antibodies appear 1-2 months after onset of
symptoms and last 6-8 months. Serial serological tests may be
necessary to confirm a recent infection, and such testing is only
available in specialist centres.
The treatment of choice for meningeal infection is fluconazole (400-800
mg/day orally or intravenously). Ketoconazole and itraconazole have
been useful in chronic non-meningeal infections. In cases of
disseminated disease, amphotericin-B is recommended (0.5-0.7
mg/kg/day intravenously).
