Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Excelsior, Manzini
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Dec 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 51 315 / 284 / 284 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Broiler breeders, 45 weeks old. Population is 93% breeder hens and a couple of male birds. The farm has 2 broiler breeder sites with 4 houses each. Each site has a shower in, shower out biosecurity control. The birds were vaccinated at 10 weeks of age.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Case fatality / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.55 / 0.55 / 100 / 0.55
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The disease was suspected due to the poor performance of chicks that were originating from the breeder flock in site 1. Testing of the breeder flock yielded positive results. The breeders were then put on medication for mycoplasma. Testing of all houses in site 1, as well as in site 2, is ongoing. Affected chickens in site 1 are near the end of the production cycle, and controlled culling will be done.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (medication with tiamulin hydrogen fumarate)
Measures to be applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; selective killing and disposal

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Deltamune Laboratory (foreign laboratory) / birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 14 Feb 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ is an economically significant pathogen that can cause significant losses in chickens, turkeys, and game birds from chronic respiratory disease, reduced feed efficiency, decreased growth, and lower egg production. In addition, the carcasses of birds sent to slaughter may be downgraded. Many countries with modern poultry operations have eradicated this organism from commercial chicken and turkey breeding flocks; however, it can still be an issue in other poultry operations, such as multi-age layer flocks, game bird raising facilities, and backyard birds.

Since 1994, conjunctivitis caused by one lineage of _M. gallisepticum_ has become a significant disease in wild birds in North America. Although other wild birds can be affected, the major impact has been on house finches (_Carpodacus mexicanus_), which have experienced major population declines in some areas.

_M. gallisepticum_ can be found worldwide in poultry.

There is no evidence that _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ is zoonotic.
