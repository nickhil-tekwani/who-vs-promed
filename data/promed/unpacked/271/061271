Slovakia is on alert due to the current outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in the Czech Republic, Zuzana Peiger Acjakova from the Slovak Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry confirmed on Wed [3 Jan 2018].

"Slovakia is on alert. Slovakia's State Veterinary and Food Administration is carrying out extraordinary measures in regions close to the Czech Republic and Ukraine," said the official, adding that African swine fever is a very serious problem.

"The public might not realise the importance of the intense struggle in which the Agriculture Ministry, pig breeders, and the hunting community are involved. However, the activities that our veterinary inspectors are carrying out in the field can be understood by anyone who has witnessed the slaughter of millions of animals affected by this disease at farms abroad," added Acjakova.

The State Veterinary Administration of the Czech Republic reported on Wed [3 Jan 2018] that it had recorded the 1st cases of a confirmed outbreak of African swine fever in an area beyond fences in the so-called red zone of the contaminated area in Zlin region.

[ASF was detected for the 1st time in the Czech Republic on 26 Jun 2017, when 2 wild boar were found dead in the southeastern Zlin region, bordering Slovakia. No ASF had been recorded in Slovakia earlier or to the present date; the Czech event took place 400 km from the nearest infected population at the time, in southwestern Ukraine (Slovakia is between Ukraine and the Czech Republic). A red zone was declared by the Czech authorities around the affected location; hunting groups and biologists set up electric fences and boar repellents to contain the animals within a 50-square-km area. In September 2017, the authorities decided to let trained hunters kill boar in that zone in a bid to eliminate the disease.

According to slide 31 in the Czech presentation during the 19 Sep 2017 meeting of SCoPAFF (section Animal Health and Welfare) in Brussels (Ref 1), the probable source of introduced infection was contaminated food brought by Ukraine workers of a local hospital laundry. The suspected food was raw bacon. For the said and rich additional information on the Czech ASF situation, applied control measures, and surveillance, including maps and graphics, see ref 1.

A useful recent update on the ASF situation in Europe is available in Ref 2.
