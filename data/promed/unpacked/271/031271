Disease Outbreak News: Yellow fever - East, West, and Central Africa (22 Dec 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event summary
-------------
This is an update on the yellow fever (YF) situation in the WHO African region published in the Event Information Site (EIS) announcement on 8 Dec 2021 and 26 Aug 2022.

In 2022, 12 countries in the WHO African region have reported outbreaks of yellow fever (Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Uganda). Eight of these countries are experiencing a continuation of transmission from 2021 (Cameroon, CAR, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC, Ghana, Nigeria, and Republic of the Congo) and 4 countries are newly reporting confirmed cases (Kenya, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda). One country, Gabon, reported cases in 2021, but no further cases were registered in 2022 indicating the end of the outbreak in Gabon.

From 1 Jan 2021 to 19 Dec 2022, a total of 203 confirmed and 252 probable cases with 40 deaths (CFR 9%) have been reported to WHO from 13 countries in the WHO African Region, with 49 additional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) positive samples currently pending classification.

Since 5 Aug 2022 (data included in the previous EIS), a total of 22 additional confirmed cases have been reported from 10 countries: Cameroon (1), CAR (3), Chad (6), Côte d'Ivoire (1), DRC (2), Ghana (1), Niger (4), Nigeria (2), Sierra Leone (1) and Uganda (1)). However, only 7 confirmed cases had symptom onset after 5 Aug 2022 and those were reported from 4 countries (CAR (2), Cameroon (1) Nigeria (2), and Niger (2)) including one death from Niger. The rest of the cases were retrospectively classified as confirmed (with symptom onset prior to 5 Aug 2022), based on confirmatory tests performed and details obtained from investigations.

Since 2021, 40 deaths (CFR 9%) have been reported in the total 455 confirmed and probable cases. Of those, 23 deaths have been reported among confirmed cases (CFR 11%) (Table 1). The high global CFR among confirmed cases in 2021 (17 deaths, 11%) continued into 2022 (6 deaths, 12%) with multiple countries reporting CFRs above 1%.

The M:F ratio amongst confirmed cases was similar in 2021 and 2022 (1.3 and 1.6 respectively). The most affected age group amongst confirmed cases in 2021 was 10 years and below; meanwhile, the most affected group in 2022 is 20 to 30 years. Overall, about 71% of confirmed cases are aged 30 years and below and children aged 10 years and below seem particularly affected.

The majority of confirmed cases in the 2-year period were reported in the last quarter of 2021, with most from Ghana (62 cases, 12 deaths), Cameroon (35 cases, 0 deaths), Chad (30 cases, 5 deaths), Nigeria (24 cases, 0 deaths), and CAR (23 cases, 3 deaths). The other countries that have reported confirmed cases in the 2-year period are Côte d'Ivoire (8 cases, 0 deaths), DRC (6 cases, 1 death), Congo (4 cases, 0 deaths), Niger (4 cases, 1 death), Kenya (3 cases, 0 deaths), Uganda (2 cases, 0 deaths), Gabon (1 case, 0 death), and more recently Sierra Leone (1 case, 0 death). Countries including Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Togo have reported probable cases that were subsequently discarded. One probable case from Benin is currently pending classification.

Approximately 48% of confirmed cases were in children and young adults < 20 years which is a greater than expected burden given that they were born after implementation of YF into routine immunization in many of the affected countries.

Several of the recent confirmations have been from urban areas and/or locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g. near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of YF vaccination as in Isiolo, Kenya). Hard-to-reach and underserved populations have been disproportionately impacted.

[This report illustrates just how geographically wide-spread yellow fever (YF) is across east, west and central Africa. Cases have occurred sporadically in 10 countries. The above report points out that, "recent confirmations have been from urban areas and/or locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g. near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of YF vaccination as in Isiolo, Kenya). Hard-to-reach and underserved populations have been disproportionately impacted." Reaching these remote and underserved populations will not be easy. Surveillance to detect YF cases promptly and rapid response when they are found requires a well-organized system that is institutionally and financially supported. Since YF virus and the mosquito vectors that transmit it know nothing about international borders, a regional approach to surveillance and timely response with effective international communication is essential.

As noted in the comments in a previous post (20221107.8706608), vaccination is the most practical and cost-effective measure to prevent yellow fever (YF). Inclusion of YF vaccine in routine childhood vaccination programs would be ideal but has not yet been universally achieved. - Mod.TY]
