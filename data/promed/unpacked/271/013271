The Minnesota Department of Health has issued a health advisory after 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease were contracted at Woodland Garden Apartments [a Duluth senior apartment building]. The cases, which were diagnosed in October [2022] and December [2022], are believed to have the same source of exposure, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. "Two cases of Legionella with a common apartment building is concerning as outbreaks in this setting are relatively rare," MDH said in its health advisory issued 21 Dec [2022].

Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria, _Legionella_, is found in soil and water and can multiply in water systems like large air conditioning system cooling towers, hot water heaters or tanks, fountains, pools, or hot tubs.

The disease is especially dangerous for people who are age 50 or older, have weakened immune systems, or have chronic lung conditions and/or smoke. Woodland Garden Apartments at 127 E. Calvary Road is a 60-unit affordable housing complex for seniors.

"The disease carries high morbidity or mortality, and this setting is a seniors-only apartment building, which increases the concern, as advanced age is a major risk factor for Legionnaires' disease," the health advisory from the Minnesota Department of Health read. "Given that Legionnaires' disease can mimic so many other respiratory illnesses, MDH encourages testing in patients that may be connected to this location."

Doug Schultz, an information officer for the Minnesota Department of Health, said the state is investigating the source of the exposure so the hazard can be eliminated to prevent additional illnesses. The building is working with a _Legionella_ consultant to test water and conduct an environmental assessment.

Residents at Woodland Garden Apartments have also been recommended ways to decrease their risk of inhaling water and to prevent the spread of airborne particles. Symptoms of the bacterial pneumonia have been shared with the facility so residents with symptoms can be tested with a _Legionella_ urinary antigen test.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacteria that are found in natural freshwater environments such as lakes and streams (_Legionella pneumophila_) and in soil (_Legionella longbeachae_ in potting soil and compost). _Legionella pneumophila_ is the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA. _Legionella_ embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of a building plumbing system's pipes and containers, often growing within ameba. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. _Legionella_ can also be found in potable water.

Humans usually acquire these organisms by inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ from contaminated water sources. Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafted on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, during the outbreak of pneumonia among Legionnaires meeting at a hotel in Philadelphia in 1976 that was subsequently thought to be due to inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella pneumophila_ within the hotel, some passersby on Broad Street in front of the hotel, who had never entered the hotel, developed what was called at the time "Broad Street pneumonia" (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm). Aerosols containing _Legionella_ can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, fountains, showers, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments.

The disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated or hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia A M, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes J P, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include age 50 years or older; smoking (current or historical); chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD); immune system disorders due to disease or medication; systemic malignancy; and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_, debilitated people who could be prone to aspirate should be prohibited from taking showers and consume only sterile water until the source is found and remediated.

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 2 patients in Duluth will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary _Legionella_ antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping. Genotyping of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Duluth (pop. over 85 000 in 2020) is located on the north shore of Lake Superior in the US state of Minnesota (St. Louis County) at the westernmost point of the Great Lakes; it is the largest and busiest port city on the Great Lakes for coal, iron ore, grain, limestone, cement, salt, wood pulp, steel coil, and wind turbine components (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota). - Mod.ML
