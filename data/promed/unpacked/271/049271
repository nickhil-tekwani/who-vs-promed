AERROSOL TRANSMISSION (8)
=========================
Subject: Re: PROMED: Aerosol transmission (7)
Phil is certainly correct about energy and aerosols. In nature there are
situations where such energy is rare or weak, even though the virus is
replicating in upper respiratory tissues. VEE comes immediately to mind.
Throat swabs are invariably positive early in human infection, yet care
givers have never been infected clinically--or never reported to be so.
This is in contrast to the laboratory setting where prior to advent of the
BSC and other really good containment at the source of all aerosols, it was
impossible to work with this agent for very long, without getting the
disease.
So the context of importance for quantitative lab studies is more often of
significance to the laboratorian than to the world at large, even the
infected human world. As to relative risk in the lab, the doses needed to
infect an animal (nice if the same species) provide some possible help in
assessing same. Primates are clearly the best models in most cases. Folks
in Frederick likely know even more about this subject than has ever been
published, although there are a few bench marks available in the lit.
The Aussie morbillivirus may be another case in point. Respiratory severe
disease with lots of virus in lungs--but not apparently readily contagious
in nature. Personally I would not grow and manipulate that beast without
rather maximum protection for myself in the lab. One could go further--and
there are a couple of instances where this has not been done, but might be.
The NIH-CDC Guidelines offer hepatitis B as a model for assessing
risk-benefit of lab containment, and of course come out at the ordinary
Level 2. But the argument is based entirely on the observed natural
history. To my knowledge, nobody has ever done an aerosol experiment, and
there are animals/viruses which could be used. Is that because we don't
want to deal with a possible answer??
