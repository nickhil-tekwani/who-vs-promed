On 8 Jan 2013, the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene notified the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH) of 2 patients with _E. coli_ O157:H7 clinical isolates that had indistinguishable, but commonly identified, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. The 2 patients were interviewed by local health departments within one day of the initial report. They revealed that they had eaten raw ground beef purchased from the same meat market and served as "tiger meat" or "cannibal sandwiches." In this dish, the raw ground beef typically is served on rye bread or crackers with onions and is a traditional winter holiday specialty in certain regions of the upper Midwest. Five agencies (the Watertown Department of Health; WDPH; Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection; US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service; and CDC) investigated to determine the magnitude of the outbreak, prevent additional infections, and better understand raw ground beef consumption.

The market provided a list of 62 persons who preordered raw ground beef for the 2012 winter holiday season. A case-finding and knowledge-attitudes-practices questionnaire was administered to 53 of 62 persons included on that list, plus 9 additional household members, and 2 persons with reported illness. A probable case was defined as diarrhea with onset occurring in a person who had been exposed in the previous 10 days to raw ground beef sold by the market from 22 Dec 2012 to 4 Jan 2013. A confirmed case was an illness meeting the probable case definition in a person from whose stool _E. coli_ O157:H7 with PFGE and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) patterns indistinguishable from those of the outbreak strain had been isolated.

Among 17 patients (4 with confirmed and 13 with probable cases), 13 were female, and median age was 46 years (range: 1-82 years); 8 (47 percent) had received outpatient medical care; no hospitalizations or deaths occurred. A total of 14 patients reported eating raw ground beef served as tiger meat or cannibal sandwiches during the holiday, and 3 had exposure to raw ground beef from cross-contamination. The market voluntarily recalled 2532 pounds (1148 kg) of raw ground beef on 15 Jan 2013. _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates from 4 patients and 2 raw ground beef samples (1 in original packaging) collected from 2 households had PFGE and MLVA patterns indistinguishable from the outbreak strain.

Among respondents to the questionnaire, 55 (98 percent) of 56 reported consuming raw ground beef only during special occasions or winter holidays. A total of 53 (91 percent) of 58 were aware that consuming raw ground beef could cause illness, but only 17 (41 percent) of 42 thought that illness could be severe; 6 of 15 (40 percent) patients and 28 (70 percent) of 40 non-ill persons said they intended to eat raw ground beef in the future.

In this same region of Wisconsin, raw ground beef served as tiger meat was associated with large (more than 50 cases) outbreaks of foodborne illness reported to WDPH during 1972, 1978, and 1994 (refs 1-3). Despite ongoing outreach efforts addressing the dangers associated with consuming undercooked or raw ground beef, this regional holiday tradition continues to be associated with outbreaks.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence implicated raw ground beef from the market as the source of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in this outbreak. The rapid public health response resulted in timely case detection and likely prevention of additional cases through product recall.

Discouraging this tradition requires regional targeted consumer and retailer education to ensure understanding of the potential for severe illness associated with raw ground beef consumption. Retailers in this region should be encouraged to directly discourage their customers from consuming raw ground beef. To prevent illness, ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), as measured with a food thermometer, before consumption.

[With the 2013 winter holiday approaching, it is important to realize that with this tradition of eating raw ground beef -- whether called tiger meat or cannibal sandwiches or raw ground beef, this vehicle can transmit a spate of potentially fatal pathogens, including EHEC. - Mod.LL
