Deli meat suspected source of killer bacteria: CDC
--------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK (Reuters Health): Forty people in the north eastern United States
have become sick, and 40 have died from infection with the foodborne
listeria bacteria, according to officials at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.
"Analysis of data collected to date indicate that the leading suspect food
in this outbreak is sliced turkey deli meat," say CDC experts. They say
health officials are working hard to track down the exact brand of meat
responsible for the outbreak.
So far, 7 states have been affected: Pennsylvania (14 cases), New York (11
cases in New York City, 3 elsewhere), New Jersey (4 cases), Delaware (4
cases), Maryland (2 cases), Connecticut (1 case), and Michigan (1 case).
Each year, about 2500 Americans come down with listeriosis after eating
foods -- most often meats, raw vegetables, and soft cheeses -- contaminated
with the bacterium.
