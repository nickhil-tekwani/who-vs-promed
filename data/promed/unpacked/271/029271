Andhra Pradesh Rabies Crisis Update
-----------------------------------
Last night, 26 May 2011, another person fell victim to rabies in
Kakinada. New incidents of suspected rabid dog bites have occurred in
Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Kakinada. Dog culls have been reported in
Rajahmundry, Vizianagram and surrounding areas.

ABC [Animal birth control] India teams continue our ARV [anti-rabies
vaccination] campaign in Rajahmundry under difficult conditions
(notably, extreme heat and occasional heavy rain). They are proceeding
ward-wise.

Anti-rabies vaccination has begun in Kakinada and we hope to
contribute teams there to expand their capacity. We expect to begin
anti-rabies vaccination in Visakhapatnam forthwith. Animal Welfare
Board of India (AWBI) is sending an anti-rabies vaccination team to
Vijayawada on 5 Jun [2011] (date to be confirmed). Anti-rabies
vaccination programs in each locale need to be expanded at the
earliest to ensure adequate coverage, and the drive needs to be taken
up in districts and villages in the areas surrounding Rajahmundry,
Vijayawada, Kakinada and Visakhapatnam. Vizianagram and Araku and
surrounding areas are also in need of anti-rabies vaccination
intervention.

We have prepared a short film about rabies prevention to show
throughout communities in Andhra Pradesh. It is currently being
translated into Telugu. We will provide it to all districts and local
television stations and it will be available on our website.
Additional teams, vaccines and material and financial support urgently
required to meet the enormous challenges, and to prevent further human
deaths and dog culls.
