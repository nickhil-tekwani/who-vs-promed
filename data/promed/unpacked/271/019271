Last Sunday (7 Sep 2008), a farmer in Paso del Cerro, Uruguay, was
attacked by a vampire bat. He was manipulating the animal presuming
it was dead after having hit it with a stick. The farmer was taken to
a specialized health center in Montevideo (Instituto de Higiene),
where he received antirabies serum. Next day, he was discharged
uneventfully. Now that he received timely prophylactic therapy
against rabies, there is a negligible risk that a case of human
rabies may occur in Uruguay after 42 years.

However, there is still a reason for concern. Laboratory tests
performed on the vampire bat that attacked the farmer were reported
as positive for rabies. Therefore, there may be a colony of vampire
bats infected with rabies in the dense Rivera forest.

A few months ago, another site (Rincon de Dinis) inhabited by
infected vampire bats was reported, and the area concerning this
attack is located near Rincon de Dinis, so it is presumed that some
vampire bat colonies may remain.

A specialized area within the Agriculture Ministry will initiate a
vampire bat extermination campaign next week. On the other hand, the
Ministry of Health advised the population to be alert.

Dr. Graciela Perez-Sartori, ID specialist, declared that "a highly
lethal disease may reenter the country." She pointed out that the
long incubation period of the disease and lack of experience from
physicians (the last case of human rabies in Uruguay was reported 42
years ago) "may pose difficulties for having a clinical diagnosis of
the disease."

of human rabies, it is still possible to have a human case of rabies,
if someone else is exposed to the colony of bats believed to have
rabies. - Mod.TG]
