As a UK vet who has worked overseas a fair bit I have a few comments on the
above subject from my experience. However, I also haven't seen the original
letter and it may of course be very different to what is reported
elsewhere, so these should be taken as comments on what was posted in
promed-ahead.
1) Canine babesiosis. I've seen and treated a lot of this. Survivors do not
"remain poorly for years afterwards" at least not after treatment with
standard drugs and if not treated they stand a very good chance of being
dead and are unlikely therefore not to be treated if they suffer a clinical
episode of this illness. Diagnosis is easy and treatment with some drugs
safe and effective (e.g. imidocarb). But some dogs do die despite
everything and you end up using a lot of insecticides which may have
general environmental effects and possible toxicity problems for owners
(but how different is this to fleas?).
2) Canine ehrlichiosis. This has been documented as occuring in the UK in
unusual circumstances. Modern homes in the UK are well heated and the tick
vector can survive and has been found established in a few cases in homes
in the UK into which dogs had been brought in (presumably though
quarantine). So this could be a real risk and this is a nasty disease and
difficult to reliably diagnose and treat, particularly in some breeds. The
reference to the strain affecting horses (Potomac fever?) is a slight
canard. Horses already enter the UK, albeit temporarily, without quarantine.
3) The absence of a vector doesn't mean that it couldn't become established
if introduced with only minor changes in the environment (which may be
coming from whatever cause). Malaria was endemic in the south east of
England and was eradicated not very long ago (this century I believe). This
is taken seriously enough that there is regular monitoring of mosquitoes
around Heathrow and Gatwick airports. What may happen with sandflies and
the possible vectors of heartworm (does this include gnats as stated??) As
a slightly unworthy thought, I bet there are drug companies who wouldn't
deeply regret heartworm getting into more wealthy markets (not to say some
vets?) because of the constant prophylaxis required in endemic areas.
4) _Echinococcus multilocularis_: wasn't there some debate about this
recently in these lists about the increased problem in Germany, possibly
related or not to increased fox numbers?? So this would seem a real worry.
We already have _E. granulosus_ in UK, or had until recently, mainly in
South Wales sheep dogs.
5) Is there any data on how often these diseases have been seen during
quarantine, and does the current quarantine system actually protect against
them?
In short I think this group (all known to and respected by me) have some
points in their favour and some possibly not. Having lived in rabies
endemic countries for many years and given the recent changes in vaccines
and identification systems, I think the rationale for 6 month quarantine is
much decreased. Perhaps a shorter period with preventive treatments for
possible disease threats might be mooted, which could quite possibly
receive public support as they might well want to avoid risks to them and
their pets from other diseases.

[One cannot successfully double-guess a government committee, but the
indications to date are that they may come up with a recommendation for
vaccination & blood testing program with limited, ?one month,
quarantine/observation. Secondly, government is not responsible for the
health of individual dogs, only that any novel program allows the
introduction of the minimal number of "new" diseases and certainly never
rabies. On that scenario, (1) Babesiosis may be caught in the quarantine
kennel by an alert private vet; (2) Erhlichiosis ... it would be logical to
bathe/treat all incoming dogs with the appropriate acaricide if one does
not wish to repeat the US experience when they successfully introduced a
number of African tick species to various wildlife parks in spite of
"quarantine"; (3) ditto with appropriate heartworm treatments - the current
drugs are excellent; (4) for _E. multilocularis_ and _E.granulosus_ see:
Echinococcus, fox - Europe (03) 971206115307
Echinococcus, fox - Europe (04) 971221002056;
(5) because of the existing high cost of quarantine I doubt if that data
will reveal much here, but it might. Whether with the reduced cost and
inconvenience a new system will not only bring in an increased number of
dogs but also dogs from wider socio-economic and working-dog spectra that
before may be expected but who knows. I doubt if it is the dog that goes to
Berlin or Paris, or vice-versa to London or Edinburgh, with its family that
will pose a risk. The dog that goes camping is something else. - Mod.MHJ
