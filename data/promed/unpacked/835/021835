A woman is being flown from Rockhampton to Brisbane after a high degree of exposure to a foal that died of Hendra virus.

Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said the woman would be assessed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital and a decision made about whether to give her an experimental antibody treatment. The treatment is designed to prevent Hendra from developing in people exposed to sick horses. But it has only ever been given to 3 people, the last 2 in 2010.

Earlier, The Courier-Mail reported that a new Hendra virus case [equine] had been found near Rockhampton after a positive test result was received last night [18 Jul 2012].

Queensland chief veterinary officer Rick Symons said a foal had died from Hendra virus and 2 other horses and 2 dogs remain on the property.

"Biosecurity Queensland has quarantined the property and will assess what contact the other horses and dogs had with the infected animal. The property will be quarantined for the next month," Dr Symons said.

"Movement restrictions will apply to moving horses and horse materials on and off the infected property. Tracing will be a priority to determine what contact the deceased horse had with other animals on the property."

Queensland Health staff will undertake contact tracing work to ensure all people potentially exposed to the bodily fluids of the dead horse have been identified.

Chief health officer Jeannette Young said transmission of the virus required close contact with body fluids of the sick horse.

This is the 5th Hendra virus incident in Queensland this year [2012]. Three properties near Mackay remain under quarantine after a confirmed case of Hendra virus last month [June 2012].

The other properties at Ingham and near Rockhampton have been cleared.

A woman will be flown urgently to a Brisbane hospital to undergo testing for the deadly Hendra virus after being highly exposed to an infected foal.

Tests on the foal that died on a property near Rockhampton in central Queensland yesterday [18 Jul 2012] have confirmed it had Hendra. Authorities revealed the outbreak -- the state's 5th this year [2012] -- today [19 Jul 2012].

The woman and 2 other people were exposed to the 7-month-old foal that died on Saturday [14 Jul 2012].

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says a vet and a male property owner received a low level of exposure to the virus. But the woman, who is also an owner of the property, was with the foal when it died. Dr Young says the woman will be transferred to Brisbane later this afternoon or this evening [19 Jul 2012] as soon as a plane becomes available.

"At this stage, we're organising to transfer the lady down here to Brisbane, to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which is of course where our centre of expertise on people with potential Hendra infections is," she told reporters in Brisbane today [19 Jul 2012]. "She'll be transferred down here later this afternoon or this evening, as soon as we can organise a plane to move her down."

Dr Young says that if the property owner is deemed to be at risk of having contracting the virus, she will be offered an experimental antibody. The monoclonal antibody prevents Hendra from developing and is very effective on animals. It hasn't been trialed on humans but has been given to 3 people with no adverse affects, Dr Young said.

A Rockhampton vet who died was already dying when he was given the antibody. Two people from Tewantin who were exposed to Hendra and took the antibody did not develop the virus. "It's risky only because it hasn't been tested," Dr Young said. "In theory it should be safe, but we can't say that until we actually test it. ... If she (the property owner) does get the infection, we do know it's, of course, very, very serious." The Hendra incubation period in humans ranges from 5 to 21 days.

There have been 7 cases of Hendra infection in humans worldwide, all in Queensland. Biosecurity Queensland chief vet Dr Rick Symons said the latest property affected was within 5 km of another property where a horse died recently of Hendra. However, no link was found between the 2 cases, he said.

Two horses and 2 dogs remain on the property, Dr Rick Symons said. Dr Symons says the horses and dogs will be assessed, and the property will be quarantined for at least a month.

Three properties near Mackay remain under quarantine after a confirmed Hendra virus case last month [June 2012].

We are saddened to learn that a serious exposure to this virus has occurred. Since the foal was 7 months old, it may have been more isolated from other horses, as it could have been in the process of being weaned from the dam.

Neither of these articles are very clear on when they knew the foal had Hendra virus. Perhaps the diagnosis was made following the death of the foal rather than previous to its death, in which case it may be more understandable that the woman was with the animal.

As the vet and the male on the property are not being transferred, one may presume their exposure risks are less, perhaps because of protective equipment.

All horse owners are undoubtedly being warned to keep their animals away from the trees where the flying foxes like to eat fruit. The eating habits of these bats are quite sloppy, with saliva and drool being present in abundance. Any left over fruit is likely an attraction to the horses as well.

We wish the best for the woman, the vet, the other male, and the other animals remaining in quarantine.

[According to the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, as of May 2012 there have been 6 human cases of Hendra virus infection, 4 of whom died (http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/4790_11112.htm).

In 1994 at Hendra (Brisibane), a trainer and an assistant, who had close contact with a terminally ill mare, became infected and suffered an acute febrile respiratory illness, with fatal consequences for the trainer. In October 1995, a 3rd (fatal) human infection with Hendra virus was identified retrospectively. The man came from a Mackay property where it was believed that 2 horses had died from avocado poisoning and snakebite in August 1994. The victim had assisted in their necropsy. At Redlands in June 2008, 2 people exposed to sick horses contracted Hendra virus infection, one of whom died. At Cawarral in 2009, there was a single fatal case. No human cases have been recorded subsequently, although there were 23 equine cases in 2011. All the human cases had exposure to sick horses.

It is believed that flying fox bats are the principal vectors of Hendra virus, but these bats are not thought to pass Hendra virus directly to people. All human cases have resulted from close contact with infected horses. Of 140 people with close contact with flying foxes (including bat carers, wildlife rangers, and research scientists), none showed any evidence of Hendra virus infection. Nonetheless, members of the general public should not handle flying foxes or any other bats. - Mod.CP]
