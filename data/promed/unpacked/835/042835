A 3rd British Columbia chicken farm has been infected with avian flu,
federal authorities confirmed Monday.
About 85 000 birds will be destroyed following the discovery at the Fraser
Valley farm, which is located within 5 km of the 2 farms where avian flu
had already been found.
Monday's finding brings the total number of chickens culled in the current
outbreak to 60 000. Tests found that the virus at the 3rd farm is the H7
type. They did not immediately show whether it was H7N3, a strain deadly to
chickens that was identified at the other 2 B.C. locations. Avian flu has
killed several people in Asia during the current outbreak. While the H7
strain is not considered dangerous to humans, the B.C. discoveries have
nonetheless led to international bans on Canadian poultry imports.

Latest Information - 23 Mar 2004
---------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has targeted for depopulation 2
additional farms within the high-risk region.
All birds from these farms will be destroyed and disposed of in accordance
with provincial environmental regulations and internationally accepted
disease control guidelines.
Following a precautionary approach, the CFIA decided to depopulate these
farms after a significant number birds deaths were observed. Avian
influenza has been confirmed on one of these farms. Test results, expected
later this week, will provide more information about the presence of avian
influenza on the other farm.
The finding of multiple sites of infection in close proximity to one
another is consistent with the highly contagious nature of the virus and is
why the CFIA acted swiftly to implement strict movement restrictions and
biosecurity measures in the high risk region.
To date, 5 farms, all within the high-risk region, have been targeted for
depopulation.
