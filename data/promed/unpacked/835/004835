Special Report Part 1: Vietnam's success against avian flu may offer
blueprint for others
--------------------------------------------------
Among countries affected by avian influenza H5N1, Viet Nam stands out
twice over. It was one of the first hit by the virus in the current
outbreak: It discovered its first human infections in December 2003
and its first widespread poultry outbreaks in January 2004. And it
was one of the hardest hit, with 66 million birds culled to prevent
spread of the virus, and more human infections [93] than any other
country to date. But it has also controlled the virus more
successfully than any other country where the disease became endemic,
with no new human cases since last November [2005] and only a handful
of infected birds this year -- 12 farm chickens and ducks, and a
small flock of tame storks in an amusement park.
The shift is so striking that international health authorities are
asking whether Viet Nam's success can be replicated elsewhere. But
reproducing its efforts faces an unusual hurdle: sorting out which of
its aggressive interventions actually made a difference. "The absence
of human cases is a direct reflection of the lack of cases on the
animal side," said Dr. Richard Brown, a World Health Organization
epidemiologist based in Hanoi. "But it is actually difficult to know
exactly what that is due to, because there were a number of different
interventions applied in the latter half of 2005 on the animal health side."
After responding to its 2004 outbreaks mainly by culling infected
flocks, Viet Nam in 2005 became the first country to institute
mandatory nationwide poultry vaccination. In addition -- and almost
simultaneously -- the national government banned poultry rearing and
live-market sales in urban areas; restricted commercial raising of
ducks and quail, which can harbor the virus asymptomatically; imposed
strict controls on poultry transport within Viet Nam and agreed to
examine illegal cross-border trade; and launched an aggressive public
education campaign that deployed radio and TV advertising,
neighborhood loudspeaker announcements, and outreach by powerful
internal groups such as the Women's Union and the Farmers' Union. The
country also compensated farmers for birds that had to be killed --
initially at 10 percent of the birds' market value, and now at 75 percent.
"Who knows what impact any of these interventions had? This is a
natural experiment" that lacks controls that could measure impact,
said Dr. David Dennis, the Hanoi-based Viet Nam influenza Coordinator
for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "How much [of
the reduction in cases] is due to the natural history of this
organism in birds? We don't know." Outside the country, experts
presume the engine of flu control to be the pervasive influence of
Vietnamese-style socialism, which extends from the national
government through provinces, districts, and communes to individual
"neighborhood committees."
Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations' senior coordinator for avian
influenza, implicitly endorsed that view in a 19 Sep 2006 Financial
Times story, when he contrasted Viet Nam's continued control of the
virus with Thailand's recent [upsurge] in human cases during a time
of political turmoil. "You don't maintain control over this disease
unless there is regular top-level direction from a senior committed
political figure that wants to be sure the necessary activities are
being undertaken," Nabarro told the Financial Times.
But within Viet Nam, workers in avian-flu control say the country's
success depends as much on the population's support as it does on
political coercion -- a factor that may bode well for the national
government's plans to change the country's entire culture of poultry
rearing, distribution, purchase, and sale. (See Part 2 for more
details.) "What makes the system work is not that it is top-down, but
that it achieves consensus at every level," said Don Douglas, chief
of party for Mekong Region avian flu efforts at Abt Associates, a US
consulting firm that in July was awarded a 3-year contract for avian
flu assistance in north Viet Nam. "Imagine the stigma associated with
being the farm that lets everyone down and causes all its neighbors'
chickens to be culled."
"Some farmers may not understand that they cannot eat duck blood,
because they see that the duck looks healthy," said Nguyen Van Mai, a
trainer with the humanitarian organization CARE International, an Abt
Associates partner. "Some think that [avian flu] has stopped already,
and do not believe that it is coming back." The farmers' confidence
is not shared by health authorities apprehensive over the approach of
winter -- Viet Nam's regular flu season, and also the time of year
when avian flu cases have [peaked]. "I think Vietnam . . . has to
prepare to deal with the [return] of this epidemic," said Dr. Le
Truong Giang, Vice-director of the Health Department in Ho Chi Minh
City, which is Viet Nam's largest municipality and has enacted the
strictest local flu controls. Asked whether the city could keep the
virus at bay indefinitely, Dr. Giang paused. "We try to do that," he
said. "But we are not sure."

When avian flu control meets cultural resistance
---------------------------------------------
Nguyen Van Tich's farm lies at the end of a narrow dirt road that
runs under the tall edges of rice paddies and snakes between old bomb
craters turned into fish ponds. The tucked-away property, one of the
largest in this 10 000-person district 20 miles from Hanoi, is
new-looking and prosperous. In the 7 years they have owned it,
44-year-old Tich and his wife have stocked their 1.75 acres with
citrus trees, coconut palms, pig pens, a duck pond, and a long brick
coop filled with fuzzy chicks that skitter away from a stranger's
shadow. The couple went into debt to build the farm, and their care
for their investment shows in the wire mesh that swathes the chicks'
shelter and the vaccinations recently administered to their 1000
ducks and hens -- measures prescribed by Viet Nam's central
government to contain the threat of H5N1 avian influenza.
The willingness of Tich and thousands of small farmers like him to
follow the government's orders does much to explain Viet Nam's
dramatic change of fortune on avian flu, from one of the countries
hardest hit by the virus to one of the most successful in controlling it.
The Vietnamese government is openly proud of those results, and
international animal and human health experts have applauded its
apparent success. Yet some of those experts caution, and interviews
with farmers and consumers confirm, that Viet Nam's continued success
is not guaranteed -- because it may depend on new and stricter
government prescriptions that the populace may find hard to accept.
"What is being talked about is trying to change really basic behavior
that people have been engaged in all their lives," said Dr. Richard
Brown, a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist based in
Hanoi. "It is going to be a slow process." As the H5N1 outbreak
expands, planners worldwide are acknowledging that scientific and
political efforts to control the virus will fail unless they are
accompanied by willing cultural change. Viet Nam's attempts to create
that change are being closely watched.
Viet Nam's success against avian flu has made the country an island
of viral suppression in a sea of transmission -- this year, according
to reports from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), H5N1
has recurred in neighboring Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, and
Thailand. And Viet Nam's successful measures are stringent and
strictly maintained. In Ho Chi Minh City, for instance, raising
chickens in the city has been banned, and chickens raised in the
countryside are inspected twice before they cross the city limits --
once by rural authorities and a 2nd time at one of 4 municipal checkpoints.
More than 2000 trucks pass through the checkpoints each day; if the
birds' paperwork is in order, the truck carrying them is allowed to
proceed along limited designated routes to one of 3 new
slaughterhouses. If the birds do not pass inspection, they are
confiscated on the spot. "We take them to the incinerator," Dr.
Truong Thi Kim Chau, vice-director of the city's sub-department of
animal health, said through an interpreter.
"The risk of bird flu still exists in Viet Nam," said Dr. Bui Quang
Anh, the Hanoi-based director general of the department of animal
health in the agriculture ministry, pointing to the likelihood that
the virus still circulates in ducks, geese, and quail within Viet
Nam, and the possibility of its being carried over the Chinese border
in smuggled live chickens. To counter that perceived threat, the
Ministry proposes strict additional prevention measures in its
Integrated National Operational Program for Avian and Human
Influenza, known because of its binding as the "Green Book."
The measures vary. One proposal is to permanently ban the raising of
ducks, an integral component of the rice-growing economy because they
are herded into harvested paddies to clean and fertilize them.
Another is to take poultry raising out of the hands of the backyard
growers, who make up 70 percent of producers, and concentrate the
industry in large, biosecure farms. Most controversially, for many
Vietnamese, the government proposes to alter the way that chicken, a
major food, changes hands. It is phasing out the markets where
consumers choose live birds and have them slaughtered, and
substituting birds killed in a modern slaughterhouse and sold
shrink-wrapped and chilled in supermarkets.
The change -- already instituted in Ho Chi Minh City and under way in
the north -- would alter much more than basic commerce. It challenges
deep-rooted food preferences, because already-dead chickens are
considered less tasty and nutritious. It could affect social
patterns, because markets are where neighbors meet each morning. It
touches even religious practice: Slaughtering and cooking chicken on
behalf of family ancestors is a crucial observance during Lunar New
Year. "This is the big challenge in Vietnam," said Dr. Le Truong
Giang, vice-director of Ho Chi Minh City's health department. "Not
all the population agree, but more and more people agree with us."
In Viet Nam's health agencies, and in the cities and villages, there
are scattered signs that acceptance of anti-bird flu measures may not
be complete. The 2-shot poultry vaccination campaign mandated [in
2005] by the agriculture ministry inoculated approximately 160
million birds -- 80 percent of the country's total -- in late 2005,
Dr. Anh said. But a repeat this year, meant to catch a new crop of
birds, vaccinated 140 million, about 65 percent. And a campaign to
halve the country's duck population, which stood at 60 million in
2003, has stalled at 40 million birds.
On a mid-September morning in Viet Doan commune -- where 1500 ducks
were culled in 2005 -- 400 local farmers followed along eagerly as a
team from CARE International staged games and contests with an
anti-flu theme. The gathering was part of a program that the
humanitarian agency has been testing in Viet Nam since 2004 that
coaches rural residents to evaluate their own understanding of avian
flu and teaches them preventive measures, from handwashing to keeping
poultry away from other animals.
"Some food shops in the commune have stopped selling poultry meat or
duck's blood," said Dr. Nguyen Thi Tuyet Mai, a trainer on the
program's staff. "Some farmers keep their poultry behind a fence. But
it is difficult to change behavior; it requires a long time."
Tich, the farmer, did not attend the gathering. At his farm down the
road, there was a modest fence, 2 strands of barbed wire slung
loosely between low posts. A chicken flapped over it, landing
clumsily in a mob of month-old ducklings [photo at URL above] --
ducklings that, under a strict interpretation of government
guidelines, should not exist.
Asked about the ducks, Tich looked nonplussed. News of the ban, he
said, had reached him only 10 days ago; he had bought the ducks 3
weeks before. "What I heard is, the local authority just encouraged
not to raise new ducks." he said through the interpreter. "It is not a policy."
Tich had complied with most of the policies in the government
campaign against avian flu. In addition to vaccinating his adult
birds and confining his chicks until they are a month old, he scours
his chicken coops with disinfectant every time a crop is sold, wears
gloves and a mask when he kills a bird for his own use, and buries
dead chickens in a hole with lime instead of eating them or feeding
them to fish. But he seemed skeptical of the effort and expense in
some of the further measures yet to come. "Avian influenza is a very
big concern for our family, because we have invested quite a lot of
capital in our poultry," he said. "But if the government banned
duck-raising, I might switch to raising other animals. I might not
grow poultry anymore."
