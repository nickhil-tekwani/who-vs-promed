Re-emergence of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Germany
-----------------------------
Concerning today's posting and request for information [20070612.1911]:
The first case of a new BTV-infection in 2007 was detected in a
sentinel cattle in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The animal was
tested negative in April 2007, and scored in May 2007 positive in
both cELISA and BTV-PCR in the regional laboratory, confirmed by the
National Reference Laboratory for BT (Institute of Diagnostic
Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut). The Ct-values using
EDTA-blood as sample material were between 27 and 29.
In addition, fresh EDTA-blood of the suspected animal was inoculated
at the high containment facilities of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut
into 2 naive cattle for confirmation of infectious virus, and both
animals became PCR-positive at day 4. BTV could be re-isolated from
blood samples of the inoculated animals by using cell culture.
Further tests are in progress concerning characterization and typing
of the virus isolate as well as epidemiological investigations.
Within the herd, all other cattle of the epidemiological unit (n =
80) were tested negative for BTV-genomes.

[We are grateful to Prof Mettenleiter and his colleagues for this
authoritative information. Obviously, the virus has overwintered in
North Rhine-Westphalia. This means that infected culicoides are
currently present there; their identity (species) and density may
become known if entomological surveillance is operational. Such data
will enable efforts to predict the epidemiological developments
during the summer and fall and to plan the applicable preventive
measures. - Mod.AS].
