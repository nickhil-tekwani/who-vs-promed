Owen Sound [Grey County] Police Services, Saugeen Shores [Bruce County] Police Service, and the Grey Bruce Health Unit are reminding people of the importance of keeping a safe distance from wildlife.

In a press release sent out Tuesday [18 Jun 2013] morning, it was stated that raccoons are a particular concern this year [2013].

An epidemic of distemper in the local raccoon population is causing infected animals to lose their fear of humans and sometimes behave in an aggressive or erratic manner.

People can't become infected with distemper. However, wildlife can be carriers of rabies and other communicable diseases that can cause serious illness or even death in humans.

To protect yourself and your family from these risks:
- Observe wild animals from a distance. Do not interact by feeding them, petting them, or attempting to adopt juvenile animals.
- Avoid any wild animal that is aggressive, is friendly towards humans, or behaves in an unusual way.
- Keep your pets under control at all times, do not let them chase or engage with wildlife, and be sure to vaccinate your cats and dogs against rabies.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb', and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization.

A sharp increase in the number of diseased raccoons might be related to raises in the density of this animal.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes (including shots against rabies and distemper) of all dogs in the area up to date.
