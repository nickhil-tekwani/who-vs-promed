The imported case of haemorrhagic fever in a German traveller to
Cote d'Ivoire has been confirmed as yellow fever. The patient died
this morning [6 Aug 1999 in the isolation facility of the Charite
Hospital in Berlin. Yellow fever virus has been isolated from a blood
specimen taken 3 days after typical symptom onset. The last
clinical manifestation was anuria [lack of urine and encephalitis.
We have inspected his vaccination certificate he had used for the
travel and since 1992 and there was no Yellow fever vaccination
registered.

[Cote d'Ivoire is in the endemic zone of Africa for yellow fever &
supposedly requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate from all
travellers over 1 year of age. Somehow this traveller got in without
one. That was a fatal mistake. In 1996 a Swiss & an American
tourist decided not to get vaccinated before taking their vacations
on the Amazon -- both died of yellow fever when they got home
(see refs above). All these deaths were totally unnecessary. The
yellow fever vaccine is the world's safest & most effective, with
almost complete lack of side effects. One shot lasts 10 years.
***All travellers to tropical Africa & South America please take note
of the above.***
NB: neither yellow fever nor any other hemorrhagic fever has ever
been transmitted from one person to another through the air -- not
even Ebola in Africa. Therefore passengers on the same aircraft
do not need to worry. - Mod.JW
