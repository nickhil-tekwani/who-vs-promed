Three members of a Calvert County family died in the past week following respiratory illnesses, 2 from complications from the flu, according to the chief medical officer at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where a 4th family member is being treated. The family was from the Lusby area, according to hospital and county officials, who on Tuesday [6 Mar 2012] issued a press release about the investigation into the deaths.

The 1st case involved an 81 year old woman who grew sick at home around 23 Feb 2012. Her son and 2 daughters took care of her there, and then developed similar upper respiratory symptoms 5 days later, on 28 Feb 2012, health officials said. The mother became sick with traditional flu symptoms and also had other underlying medical conditions, according to Janis Orlowski, chief medical officer at the hospital center, located in the District. The mother died at home 1 Mar 2012.

Her 58 year old son and a 56 year old daughter initially were hospitalized at Calvert Memorial Hospital. Both died Monday [5 Mar 2012] -- the daughter at Calvert and the son at the hospital center, where he had been transferred. The other daughter, 51, was transferred from Calvert to the hospital center Monday and is "doing better today," Orlowski said. That woman arrived with the same flu-like symptoms as her siblings, including fever, aches, cough, and shortness of breath, Orlowski said.

Tests confirmed the siblings who died had a strain of flu virus known as influenza A, and each also acquired a serious staph infection, according to Orlowski. She said it was unlikely the infection was acquired in the hospitals because the siblings arrived coughing blood. "It's likely they came to the hospital with the infection, which is what caused the cough and fever," Orlowski said. Tests are being conducted to determine whether the 2nd daughter has the same influenza virus and infection. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will determine what strain of the influenza A virus infected the family, Orlowski said.

This year's [2012] flu season has gotten off to a late start, but Orlowski said there has been an increase in the number of patients with flu-like symptoms in recent weeks. Hospital center officials are looking into at least one other recent death -- unrelated to the Calvert cluster -- to determine whether it was related to flu. The severity of illness and death due to flu varies widely from season to season. The very young, adults older than 65, and individuals with certain medical conditions are at higher risk for developing flu-related complications. The 2011-2012 flu vaccine will protect against the 3 viruses that research indicates will be most common during the season: 2 strains of the influenza A virus, H1N1 and H3N2, and an influenza B virus.

Health officials said the department is urging people who have not yet received a flu vaccine to get one. Local officials are also asking residents to take standard precautions to prevent the spread of illness, including hand washing and limiting contact with sick individuals. Anyone with flu-like symptoms should check with a health care provider.

Maryland's Office of Chief Medical Examiner also is conducting autopsies as part of the investigation. Medical examiner David Fowler said Calvert health officials contacted his office on Monday [5 Mar 2012] seeking assistance. One of the bodies was being transported to Baltimore on Tuesday [6 Mar 2012] for an autopsy. At least one of the bodies had already been embalmed and buried, local officials told him. The medical examiner's office will examine the respiratory organs in detail, Fowler said, and conduct blood cultures for bacteria and viruses.

Update on Calvert County respiratory illness investigation
----------------------------------------------------------
The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) is working in conjunction with the Calvert County Health Department to investigate a cluster of respiratory illnesses in Calvert County. As the Calvert County Health Department has reported, DHMH is aware of 4 cases in adults from a single family with severe respiratory illness; 3 have died. At this time, no other similar clusters have been reported from Calvert County or elsewhere in the state.

The cause for these illnesses is under investigation and testing is being conducted by the DHMH Laboratories Administration. Preliminary testing at the DHMH Laboratories Administration indicates that 2 of the fatal cases had influenza, and these cases may have been complicated by bacterial coinfections. Bacterial coinfection is a known complication of influenza infection. Additional testing is being conducted for all cases.

DHMH recommends all individuals continue to take the following precautions during influenza season: hand washing, staying home if sick, and staying up to date with influenza vaccinations. DHMH also reminds Maryland residents with influenza-like illness (fever and sore throat or cough) to consult their healthcare providers for evaluation. DHMH is not recommending any additional measures at this time. The Department will provide additional updates as more information becomes available.

There have been no new cases reported as of 10:00 p.m.

[The provisional verdict appears to be that influenza A virus infection, in conjunction with bacterial coinfection, was responsible for this cluster of fatalities affecting a single family in Calvert County. The outcome of a postmortem examination in Baltimore is awaited, as is identification of the specific influenza A virus responsible for this outbreak and its relationship to the seasonal influenza viruses circulating in this area.
