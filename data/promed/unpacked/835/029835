[Please note that there may be discrepancies between the various sources of
information due to different times of "closure" of daily figures reported.
Times of daily report closures where known are listed in the table of
contents below. Oftentimes a newswire will mention a confirmed case in a
location that has not been on the official reporting entity list as the
confirmation arrived after closure of the day's report. As the number of
reports has increased, we have changed the format of the tables to give the
cumulative cases reported by the weeks ending on Fridays (1 May 2009, 8 May
2009, 15 May 2009) and then daily for the current week of reporting. The
daily summaries for prior dates can be found in all "case count" postings
ending with Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (40): case counts 20090521.1906.

[To summarize the current situation as of 6:00 AM GMT on 29 May 2009, a
total of 15 510 cases and 99 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection have
been officially reported to WHO from 53 countries, up from 13 398 confirmed
cases and 95 deaths from 48 countries on 27 May 2009. According to a PAHO
update (from 18:00 GMT-4 on 30 May 2009), a total of 15 947 confirmed cases
and 115 deaths are attributable to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection in 21 countries in the Americas, up from 14 207 confirmed cases
and 99 deaths in 17 countries in the Americas region reported in the last
ProMED-mail update on 27 May 2009. New countries officially reporting cases
to WHO include the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Romania,
Slovakia, and Uruguay. Additional new countries officially reporting cases
to PAHO since the last WHO update include the Bahamas and Bolivia.
According to newswire reports, additional countries confirming cases of
influenza A (H1N1) infection not as yet on the WHO list include: Cyprus,
Estonia, Hungary, Jamaica, Lebanon and Viet Nam. In addition, according to
newswires, the total case count in Australia is 303 (almost double of the
last official report to WHO); cases have been confirmed in Alaska in the
USA and Nunavut in Canada, in Wales in the UK, and there is evidence of
probable domestic transmission in Scotland and in China.

It definitely appears as though there is significant transmission starting
(and continuing) in the Southern Hemisphere, with Chile and Australia the
most notable countries with increasing numbers of cases.

of 08:00 GMT 27 May 2009, see
