UK: Mumps outbreak after parents shun MMR vaccine
-------------------------------------------------
LONDON: A mumps outbreak is "spreading alarmingly" across the UK as parents
shun the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine (MMRV) for
children, the Independent on Sunday reports. The newspaper said that
according to the Public Health Laboratory Service, cases of mumps have
almost doubled following a drop of 12% in the number of children being
immunized with the MMRV. There is continuing public anxiety that the
combined vaccine might trigger autism or bowel disease. It said the
outbreak was particularly severe in Northern Ireland, where cases of mumps
had risen tenfold from 95 cases in 1999 to 1000 last year.
Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reports that a doctor who has been offering
single vaccines instead of the triple vaccine has been ordered to appear
before the General Medical Council (GMC) disciplinary body and could be
barred from medical practice. It said that Peter Mansfield, a former
general practitioner (GP) who has been seeing up to 70 families [at] a time
at twice-monthly private clinics in Worcestershire, was told last week that
the GMC intends to consider his conduct because "it may pose an immediate
risk to patient safety." The GMC's intervention follows a complaint by
Worcester Health Authority alleging that Mansfield has been putting
children "at risk" because his actions are "outside normal clinical
practice" and against Department of Health advice. Mansfield told the
newspaper he would vigorously defend his actions. "The people who have come
to us have denied their children MMR, in some cases as long as 3 years ago.
The single measles vaccine I am prescribing is the best available for
someone who is unwilling to have MMR. The Department of Health's view is a
denial of choice." The report notes that a GMC ruling against Mansfield
would make it difficult for any other doctor to continue to offer the 3
vaccines separately and would have far-reaching implications for the
freedom of doctors to prescribe the medicines of their choice.
The row over MMR began 3 years ago and continued earlier this year when Dr.
Andrew Wakefield, a researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said
he had seen 170 children with a new syndrome of digestive problems and
autistic behavior, the "majority" of whom had fallen ill after the triple
jab. He suggested that the safest option was for children to be given the
vaccines separately. The Department of Health dismissed the research as
"bad science" and launched a GBP 3 million [(US $4.25 million)] campaign in
January to reassure parents. Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer,
advised doctors that children should not be given separate measles, mumps
and rubella vaccines in place of MMRV because there was a "clear risk of harm."
