Research and analysis
---------------------
Group A streptococcal infections: 4th update on seasonal activity in England, 2022 to 2023

Notifications and GP consultations of scarlet fever in England are currently showing exceptional levels of activity during this early point in the season further to public and healthcare professional alerts issued on 2 Dec 2022. Notifications of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease also remain higher than expected for this time of year.

Relatively high rates of iGAS in children continue to be noted. This may reflect increases in respiratory viruses and high levels of group A streptococcus (GAS) circulating in children.

Medical practitioners have been alerted to this early increase in incidence and elevated iGAS infection in children. Given the potential for severe presentations, scarlet fever cases should be treated promptly with antibiotics to limit further spread and reduce risk of potential complications in cases and their close contacts. Clinicians should continue to be alert to the severe complications of GAS and maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion when assessing patients, particularly those with preceding viral infection (including chickenpox) or close contacts of scarlet fever.

Interim clinical guidance on management of GAS infection has been issued to optimise diagnosis and treatment during this current increase in infection. Updated public health guidance on the management of close contacts of iGAS cases in community settings has been published, with additional groups now recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis.

As per national guidance, prompt notification of scarlet fever cases and outbreaks to local UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) health protection teams, obtaining throat swabs (prior to commencing antibiotics) when there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, and exclusion of cases from school or work until 24 hours of antibiotic treatment has been received, remain essential tools to limit spread.

Data presented within this seasonal activity update are based on that available as of 28 Dec 2022 and goes up to 25 Dec 2022 (the end of week 51). An updated report will be published in a week's time, on 5 Jan 2023. Weekly notifiable disease reports are published each week throughout the year to provide a regular update of scarlet fever notifications. Key definitions are available at the end of the report.

Scarlet fever
------------
Following higher than expected scarlet fever activity during the early part of this summer in England, notifications during the early part of the current season (2022 to 2023; seasons are defined from week 37 (mid-September) to week 36 (mid-September) have increased to exceptional levels (Figure 1 - see source URL for figures, tables, and references).

A total of 33 836 notifications of scarlet fever were received from weeks 37 [11-17 Sep 2022] to 51 [18-24 Dec 2022] of this season (2022 to 2023) in England, with 6254 notifications received so far for week 51. This compares with an average of 2670 (range 443 to 4672) for this same period (weeks 37 to 51) in the previous 5 years (Figure 1). Increased health-seeking behaviour as a result of national alerts is likely to have contributed to the increased reports. The last peak season for scarlet fever notifications was 2017 to 2018 when 30 768 reports were received across the entire season (Figure 1).

Scarlet fever notifications to date this season showed considerable variation across England, ranging between 44.3 (West Midlands) and 91.3 (East Midlands) per 100 000 population (table 1); while this may represent differential disease transmission it may also relate to differential notification practices by clinicians.

Invasive group A streptococcal infection
----------------------------------------
Laboratory notifications of iGAS so far this season (weeks 37 to 51, 2022 to 2023) are higher than expected (Figure 2). A total of 1148 notifications of iGAS disease received through laboratory surveillance in England, with a weekly high of 132 notifications in week 49 (5 to 11 Dec 2022). Laboratory notifications of iGAS infection are higher than recorded over the last 5 seasons for the same weeks (average 421, range 240 to 634 notifications; Figure 2).

Weekly laboratory notifications are high for this point in the season and slightly higher than the weekly totals seen during the last peak season (2017 to 2018) when the peak weekly total was 113 in week 14 (2 Apr 2018 to 8 Apr 2018; Figure 2). A total of 1207 notifications were received during a 14-week period during the last high activity year (weeks 5 to 18 in 2018), above the levels seen in the past 14 weeks (n = 1106). However, high levels of activity at such an early point in the season remain a concern, with further increases possible in the coming weeks.

During the current season to date, the highest rates were reported in the Yorkshire and Humber region (2.9 per 100 000 population), followed by the South West region (2.6 per 100 000) and the South East region (2.3 per 100 000); see Table 1.

The highest rate was in the 1 to 4 years age group (5.7 per 100 000), followed by those aged 75 years and over (4.8 per 100 000) and the under-1 year age group (4.2 per 100 000); see Table 2.

The median age of patients with iGAS infection so far this season was 46 years (range 1 year and under, to 102 years), slightly lower than the range seen at this point in the preceding 5 seasons (age 52 to 58 years); 24% of iGAS infections reported so far this season are in children (aged 10 years and under), higher than the range seen for the past 5 seasons (4% to 13%).

So far this season 122 deaths have been recorded within 7 days of an iGAS infection diagnosis (from any cause), with 40% (49) of the recorded deaths being in those aged 75 years and over, and 16% (20) in children aged 10 years and under (Table 3). The case fatality rate (CFR) to date remains comparable this season with recent seasons. Elevations in rates of iGAS infection in children in this early part of this season have resulted in an increased number of deaths over a relatively short period, with 25 deaths in children aged under 15 in weeks 37 to 51. There have been 306 iGAS reports in children under 18 years in the season to date, with 25 deaths being recorded in this age group (CFR 8.2%).

Antimicrobial susceptibility results from routine laboratory surveillance so far this season indicate tetracycline resistance in 14% of GAS sterile site isolates; this is lower than at this point last season (45%). Susceptibility testing of iGAS isolates against erythromycin indicated 4% were found resistant (compared with 20% last season) and, for clindamycin, 4% were resistant at this point in the season (16% last season). Isolates remained universally susceptible to penicillin.

Analysis of iGAS isolate typing data continues to indicate a diverse range of emm gene sequence types identified this season. The results indicate emm 1 was the commonest (41% of referrals), followed by emm 12 (17%), emm 89 (5%), emm 108 and emm 77 (each 3%). In children (aged <15 years) emm 1 and emm 12 have dominated this season, accounting for 61% and 21%, respectively.

Discussion
----------
While a recent downturn in scarlet fever notifications has been reported, rates of scarlet fever notification and GP consultations remain elevated. Weekly numbers of scarlet fever notifications this season have been higher than any previously recorded (weeks 49 to 51; weekly records available since 1982), the previous highest being in 2018.

The rate of iGAS infection notifications is following a similar pattern, with weekly incidence trending above what would be expected during the first part of the season, particularly for recent weeks.

While the rate of iGAS infection is elevated in all age-groups, incidence in children aged under 10 years is particularly elevated compared with levels reported in the last peak season, and substantially higher than in the past 2 years.

Investigations are under way following reports of an increase in lower respiratory tract GAS infections, particularly empyema, in children over the past few weeks. The current emm types have been circulating for many years. Whilst a new strain of emm1 (M1UK) was documented as having emerged and expanded in the last decade, its role (if any) in driving the current high levels of iGAS in children remains uncertain. At present, the weekly rate of iGAS in individuals over 75 years is not exceeding pre-pandemic periods and the CFR is lower than previous years, with emm1 dominant in this age-group. Detailed genomic and biological investigations are underway to investigate any differences in the pathogen being seen this season.

The elevated iGAS levels in children compared with the period when pandemic control measures were in place is likely to be a consequence of the heightened scarlet fever activity given the crossover of strains associated in both presentations (1,2). Reduced exposure to GAS infections during the pandemic are likely to have resulted in increased levels of susceptibility to these infections in children, noting the very low levels during pandemic. Prompt treatment of scarlet fever with antibiotics is recommended to reduce risk of possible complications and limit onward transmission.

Public health messaging to encourage contact with NHS 111 or GP practices for clinical assessment of patients with specific symptoms suggestive of scarlet fever has been issued along with reminders to provide 'safety netting' advice for parents indicating signs and symptoms of deterioration, particularly for children with respiratory viral infection. GPs and other frontline clinical staff are also reminded of the increased risk of invasive disease among household contacts of scarlet fever cases (3,4).

Clinicians should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients as early recognition facilitates prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with iGAS infection.

[In the above UK government report, investigations have found an increase in group A streptococcal (GAS) lower respiratory tracts (RTIs), particularly empyema, in children over the past few weeks, which are thought to be possibly bacterial RTIs secondary to a preceding viral RTI infection. Bacterial RTIs are known complications of several viral infections, such as influenza.

A new strain of M cell wall protein emm1 named M1UK was documented to have emerged and expanded in the last decade. However, its role in driving the current outbreak is reported to remain uncertain at present. The current outbreak in invasive GAS is mainly in children; the elevated iGAS levels in children are thought likely to be a consequence of the heightened scarlet fever activity. Reduced exposure to GAS infections during the COVID-19 pandemic are said likely to have resulted in increased levels of susceptibility to these infections in children, noting the very low levels during pandemic. The weekly rate of iGAS in individuals over 75 years is not exceeding pre-pandemic periods and the case fatality rate (CFR) is lower than previous years, with emm1 dominant in this age-group. Detailed genomic and biological investigations are under way to investigate any differences in the GAS pathogen being seen this season. - Mod.ML
