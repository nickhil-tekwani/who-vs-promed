Encephalitis normally makes its presence felt during monsoons. However, this time, acute encephalitis has claimed 38 lives and affected 118 persons even before the onset of the disease season. This despite chief secretary Jawed Usmani issuing repeated directives to the state health department and officials posted in the districts to initiate preventive measures.

Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain caused by microbial agents such as bacteria and viruses. The cause of infection in [Indian] eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh [UP] and parts of Bihar, and Nepal is virus in 98 per cent of the patients. Encephalitis has killed children for [a] long [time], but the documentation work began in the mid 1970s. Earlier, the Arbo-B virus [flavivirus] was the cause of encephalitis and the disease was called Japanese encephalitis. After extensive vaccination campaigns, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis subsided. Still children continue to die. Researches have shown that the cause of encephalitis in about 45 per cent of the cases is not known.

Statistics gathered from the health department show that of the total cases, 103 patients belonged to UP of whom 34 died. Bihar accounted for the remaining 14 cases and 4 deaths. A patient from Nepal is also undergoing treatment at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College of Gorakhpur [Uttar Pradesh]. Kushinagar turned out to be the worst affected district so far, but Gorakhpur has seen the maximum deaths.

In Kushinagar, as many as 30 cases and 10 deaths have been reported while in Gorakhpur, 12 of the 23 patients suffering with acute encephalitis have died. What has pressed the panic button for the health department officials is that the case fatality rate for the 1st quarter of 2013 is significantly higher than that in 2012. Case fatality rate refers to the number of patients who die against those admitted. In the 1st quarter of 2012, as many as 26.9 per cent of the children suffering from AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] died, a growth of 33 per cent in 2013. Doctors at the communicable diseases unit of state health directorate believe that by the end of the year, the case fatality rate will subside.

The only silver lining is that the number of cases of Japanese encephalitis [has declined]. Experts at the Gorakhpur unit of National Institute of Virology give credit to the special vaccination drive against JE [Japanese encephalitis] for the low number of cases. Still as these children struggle for life, staff employed in the hospital attended them calmly. "The season is yet to begin. Come in August or September to know what the encephalitis epidemic looks like," a medical officer told TOI.

Senior faculty members at the BRD Medical College stated that the cause of encephalitis in about 45 per cent is not known. But in an equal proportion of children, strains of enterovirus are causing disease.

Enterovirus[es are in] a large family divided into 4, like: echo, coxsackie-B, polio, and human enterovirus (HEV). It [enteroviruses] is normally associated with polio [controlled in India. - Mod.TY], and is largely found in human excreta.

[The appearance of encephalitis, often termed acute encephalitis syndrome in India, this early in the year is of concern. One hopes that this is not a harbinger of an unusually large outbreak to come when the monsoon season arrives. Interestingly, cases of encephalitis have occurred this year (2013) in several locations in eastern India. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20130402.1615081) stated, "Encephalitis cases have already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year, totalling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as Japanese encephalitis [virus infections]." There have also been cases in neighboring Bangladesh this year (2013).

Without knowing the specific etiology of these encephalitis cases, targeted control measures will not be possible. Fortunately, the effective Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine provides an opportunity for prevention of some of these cases if applied before the main transmission season arrives. No mention is made in the report above if such vaccination campaign is planned.
