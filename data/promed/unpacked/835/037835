Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Chinese Taipei
--------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 26 Dec 2014 from Dr Ping-Cheng Yang, director, Animal Technology Institute Taiwan, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan, Chinese Taipei

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 17 Dec 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Dec 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 29 Jul 2014
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Jiaoxi Township, Yilan [Ilan] County
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Dec 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 2600 / 20 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: duck breeder

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.8 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: H7N9 subtype LPAI was confirmed on 16 Dec 2014 from a wild bird faecal sample in a wetland in Yilan [Ilan] County by an active surveillance program. The gene sequence of the H7N9 subtype LPAI is different from China's strain. This wild bird case will be reported in OIE's wildlife annual report, specifically. Subsequently, an RNA product of H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) was detected in a duck breeder farm within a 3 km radius of the aforementioned wetland by intensified active surveillance. The gene sequence analysis of the HA0 cleavage site of the H5 RNA demonstrated that the causal agent was of low pathogenicity. Movement restriction was implemented on the duck breeder farm. Clinical investigation on the affected farm showed that the ducks were in healthy condition without abnormal mortality and egg production. The clinical investigation and surveillance of surrounding poultry farms are ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / gene sequencing / 26 Dec 2014 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 26 Dec 2014 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / 26 Dec 2014 / Negative

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

In their annual report 2013 submitted to the OIE, Taiwan reported 11 outbreaks; serotypes H5N2 and H5N3 were identified. See http://tinyurl.com/p5vttwf (Note: go to Section 3 of the report named "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present" for information on these outbreaks).

In May 2014, a new LPAI event was reported: 1 outbreak was reported in Yulin County; serotype H5N2 was isolated. The event was resolved on 29 Jul 2014. See event summary report and map at http://tinyurl.com/op6eaqt. - Mod.CRD
