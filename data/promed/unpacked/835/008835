Yellow Fever (YF) in Peru
----------------------
In Epidemiological Week (EW) 30 [20-26 July 2003], a death was reported from
a probable case of yellow fever, in a 22-year-old man from the town of Pavo,
Province of Bella Vista, Department of San Martin.

Epidemiological investigation conducted by the General Office of Epidemiology
(Oficina General de Epidemiolog√≠a/OGE) identified 13 other probable cases, 3
of them resulting in death [an earlier report to WHO listed 4 deaths -- see
ref. update (02) below. - Mod.JW]. 7 cases were laboratory confirmed (IgM
Elisa); the others are waiting on the second sample [a convalescent sample is
required to see if it shows a significant increase in YF-specific antibodies
above the level in the acute sample, which would indicate current, rather
than past, infection with YF. - Mod.JW].

All cases come from the town of Pavo, Province of Bella Vista, and from the
towns of Aucarca & El Zancudo, both located in the Province of Mariscal
Caceres. 12 of the 14 cases are in males, 9 of whom fall into the age group
15-44 years old, who have been in the area of the outbreak from 13 days to 8
months. 3 of the cases reported a history of vaccination for yellow fever.
Those affected were from the departments of Cajamarca, Piura, and Amazonas in
the waves of migrant workers who arrive at harvest time, between June and
August, and road workers.

Actions being carried out include surveillance of icterohemorrhagic syndrome
in basins enzootic for YF, vaccination in affected areas and nearby ejector
areas [regions of emergence](starting with routine immunization for YF in
high-risk ejector areas); and evaluation of the vector distribution of _Aedes
aegypti_.

[This represents 7 new probable cases since EW 17 (reported in EW 24 (23 May
2003) -- see update (02) ref. below. The report of 3 vaccine failures is
troubling, and should be investigated in depth. - Mod.JW]
