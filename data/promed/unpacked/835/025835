The Kharkov [Kharkiv] Regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention (computer translated) has reported that 89 people, including 19 children, have been hospitalized for foodborne illness. Two patients, registered on 22 Jun [2021], are residents of Lugansk, who were on a business trip in the city of Kharkov and ate sushi in the Yakitoria restaurant.

It is noted that, according to the results of bacteriological examination of patients, in 42 people, including 2 employees of the institution, the culture of _Salmonella_ was found. Pathogenic _Staphylococcus_ was found in 6 workers, pathogenic _E. coli_ was isolated in one, and opportunistic pathogens were isolated in 6 more.

The likely cause of the outbreak was the consumption of low-quality sushi, which was manufactured and sold without complying with the requirements of sanitary legislation. The circumstances that contributed to the outbreak and the source of the infection are being established. Anti-epidemic measures and laboratory studies are ongoing.

The [illnesses] were associated with the consumption of sushi in the Yakitoria and Mafia restaurant chains. Director of the Department for Information and Public Relations of the Kharkiv City Council Yuriy Sidorenko noted that "there (in restaurants) is terrible unsanitary conditions everywhere." He noted that the State Food and Consumer Service "strongly recommend" both restaurants to close until the end of the epidemiological investigation.

[Most of the patients, as well as 2 workers, were confirmed to have salmonellosis. It is not stated whether the strains from different individuals were identical and whether the salmonellae were isolated (as a "smoking gun") from the fish as well. It is possible that the food workers were the source of the illnesses, but it is also possible that they were infected by the sushi and did not contaminate the fish. Fish are not usual carriers of salmonellae and likely became contaminated following harvesting. From the posting, other organisms were apparently identified from other food workers, but whether any of these caused illness in the patrons is not clear.

Kharkov (pronounced "Harkov"), or Kharkiv, is the 2nd-largest city in Ukraine. Located in the northeast of the country, it is the largest city of the historic Slobozhanshchyna region. The city can be found on a map of Ukraine at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv. - Mod.LL]
