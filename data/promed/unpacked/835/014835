Fungi in the soil cause a significant number of serious lung infections in 48 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, including many areas long thought to be free of deadly environmental fungi, according to a study by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Studies from the 1950s and 60s indicated that fungal lung infections were a problem only in certain parts of the country. The new study, available online in Clinical Infectious Diseases, shows that is no longer the case. Doctors who rely on outdated maps of disease-causing fungi may miss the signs of a fungal lung infection, resulting in delayed or incorrect diagnoses, the researchers said.

"Every few weeks I get a call from a doctor in the Boston area - a different doctor every time - about a case they can't solve," said senior author Andrej Spec, MD, an associate professor of medicine and a specialist in fungal infections. "They always start by saying, 'We don't have histo here, but it really kind of looks like histo.' I say, 'You guys call me all the time about this. You do have histo.'"

The 3 main species of fungi that cause lung infections in the U.S. -- _Histoplasma_ (red), _Blastomyces_ (blue), and _Coccidioides_ (green) -- have all expanded their ranges in recent decades. These maps were created based on data from 1955 (top row) and 2007-2016 (bottom row). Reliance on outdated maps may lead to delayed or missed diagnoses.

_Histoplasma_, or histo, is one of the 3 main species of soil fungi that cause lung infections in the U.S. Historically, _Histoplasma_ was found in the Midwest and parts of the East, _Coccidioides_ in the Southwest, and _Blastomyces_ in the Midwest and the South. But a growing number of case reports and anecdotes suggest that all 3 have expanded out of their traditional ranges in recent decades, most likely due to climate change.

People develop fungal lung infections after breathing in spores from fungi in the soil. The spores become airborne when the ground is disturbed by farming, landscaping, construction or even just by people walking around in fungi-rich environments such as caves. Most healthy adults and children can fight off a fungal infection handily, but infants, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems may develop fever, cough, fatigue, and other symptoms. Fungal lung infections easily can be mistaken for bacterial or viral lung infections such as COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and tuberculosis.

"People with fungal lung infection often spend weeks trying to get the right diagnosis and appropriate treatment, and the whole time they're feeling terrible," said lead author Patrick B. Mazi, MD, a clinical fellow in infectious diseases. "They usually have multiple healthcare visits with multiple opportunities for testing and diagnosis, but the doctor just doesn't consider a fungal infection until they've exhausted all other possibilities."

Spec, Mazi, and colleagues set out to determine where soil fungi are sickening people today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last revised its maps of disease-causing fungi in 1969.

The researchers calculated the number of fungal lung infections nationwide from 2007 to 2016 using Medicare fee-for-service claims from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using the patients' home addresses to identify counties of residence, they calculated the number of cases per 100 000 person-years for each county. (Person-years are a way to correct for the fact that counties can have wildly different population sizes; one person on Medicare for one year is one person-year). Counties with more than 100 cases caused by _Histoplasma_ or _Coccidioides_, or 50 cases caused by _Blastomyces_, per 100 000 person-years were defined as having a meaningful number of fungal lung infections.

Of the 3143 counties in the U.S., 1806 had meaningful numbers of lung infections caused by _Histoplasma_, 339 by _Coccidioides_ and 547 by _Blastomyces_. These counties were distributed across the majority of the U.S. Across the 50 states plus DC, 94% had at least one county with a problem with _Histoplasma_ lung infections, 69% with _Coccidioides_ and 78% with _Blastomyces_.

"Fungal infections are much more common than people realize, and they're spreading," Spec said. "The scientific community has underinvested in studying and developing treatments for fungal infections. I think that's beginning to change, but slowly. It's important for the medical community to realize these fungi are essentially everywhere these days and that we need to take them seriously and include them in considering diagnoses."

Abstract
--------
"Background. The dimorphic mycoses (DM) of the United States, _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_, and _Blastomyces_, commonly known as endemic mycoses of North America (in addition to _Paracoccidioides_), are increasingly being diagnosed outside their historical areas of endemicity. Despite this trend, the maps outlining their geographical distributions have not been updated in more than half a century using a large, nationwide database containing individual patient-level data.

"Methods. Retrospective analysis of >45 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 1 Jan 2007 through 31 Dec 2016. Diagnoses of histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis were defined by International Classification of Diseases 9th/10th edition codes. Primary outcome was the incidence of histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis for each US county. Clinically meaningful thresholds for incidence were defined as 100 cases per 100 000 person-years cases for histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis and 50 cases for blastomycosis.

"Results. There were 79 749 histoplasmosis, 37 726 coccidioidomycosis, and 6109 blastomycosis diagnoses in unique persons from 2007-2016 across 3143 US counties. Considering all US states plus Washington DC, 94% (48/51) had at least one county above the clinically relevant threshold for histoplasmosis, 69% (35/51) for coccidioidomycosis, and 78% (40/51) for blastomycosis.

"Conclusion. Persons with histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are diagnosed in significant numbers outside their historical geographic distributions established more than 50 years ago. Clinicians should consider DM diagnoses based on compatible clinical syndromes with less emphasis placed on patients' geographic exposure. Increased clinical suspicion leading to a subsequent increase in DM diagnostic testing would likely result in fewer missed diagnoses, fewer diagnostic delays, and improved patient outcomes."

The CDC histoplasmosis map is based in part on histoplasmin skin testing results by county of residence from the 1940s and 1950s; and places where histoplasmosis outbreaks and cases have been reported (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/pdf/more-information-about-fungal-maps-508.pdf).

According to the CDC, in the U.S., blastomycosis hotspots exist in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Blastomycosis also occurs in parts of Canada, especially western Ontario (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/pdf/more-information-about-fungal-maps-508.pdf).

Coccidioidomycosis is caused by both _Coccidioides immitis_ and _Coccidioides posadasiii_. According to the CDC, _C. immitis_ is found primarily in the southern San Joaquin Valley, as well as southeastern Washington State and adjacent areas of Idaho. _C. posadasii_ is found primarily in southern Arizona, including metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson, as well as New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and portions of southern California (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/pdf/more-information-about-fungal-maps-508.pdf). It also occurs in northern Mexico, along the U.S. border, as well as in parts of Central and South America.

It is important to know that in the study above and in CDC data, cases are classified according to the patient's county of residence, which might not be where they actually acquired their infection. The diagnosis of dimorphic mycoses can be challenging outside endemic areas. An accurate history of a patient's travel and the type of exposure during travel for work or for recreation can trigger clinical suspicion (for example, for histoplasmosis, exposure to caves, bats, and activities involving manipulation/inhalation of soil/dust). In addition, the widespread reporting of patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis since the advent of HIV/AIDS helped to identify previously unrecognized endemic areas where a great number of subclinical infections must have occurred but were not previously recognized (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-015-0044-0). - Mod.ML
