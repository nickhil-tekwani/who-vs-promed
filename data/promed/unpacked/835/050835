Fatal Degenerative Neurologic Illnesses in Men Who Participated in Wild
Game Feasts: Wisconsin, 2002
--------------------------------------------------
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal neurologic disorder in humans.
CJD is one of a group of conditions known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, that are believed to be caused
by abnormally configured, host-encoded prion proteins that accumulate in
the central nervous tissue (1). CJD has an annual incidence of
approximately 1 case per million population in the United States (1) and
occurs in 3 forms: sporadic, genetically determined, and acquired by
infection. In the latter form, the incubation period is measured typically
in years.
Recent evidence that prion infection can cross the species barrier between
humans and cattle has raised increasing public health concerns about the
possible transmission to humans of a TSE among deer and elk known as
chronic wasting disease (CWD) (2). During the period 1993 to 1999, 3 men
who participated in wild game feasts in northern Wisconsin died of
degenerative neurologic illnesses [see ProMED-mail posts referenced below.
- Mod.CP].
This report documents the investigation of these deaths, which was
initiated in August 2002 and which confirmed the death of only one person
from CJD. Although no association between CWD and CJD was found, continued
surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk
for CWD transmission to humans.
Case Reports:
CASE 1. In December 1992, a Wisconsin man aged 66 years with a history of
seizures since 1969 sought treatment for recurring seizures, increasing
forgetfulness, and worsening hand tremors. Electroencephalographic (EEG)
examination demonstrated focal epileptiform activity and nonspecific
diffuse abnormalities, but no specific diagnosis was made. In February
1993, he was hospitalized for increasing confusion, ataxia, and movement
tremors of his extremities. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) demonstrated
mild, nonspecific enhancement along the inferior parasagittal occipital
lobe. A repeat EEG showed bifrontal intermittent, short-interval, periodic
sharp waves, suggesting a progressive encephalopathy; a diagnosis of CJD
was suspected. The man died later that month; neuropathologic examination
of brain tissue during autopsy indicated subacute spongiform
encephalopathy, compatible with CJD.
The man was a lifelong hunter who ate venison frequently. He hunted
primarily in northern Wisconsin but also at least once in Montana. He
hosted wild game feasts at his cabin in northern Wisconsin from 1976 until
shortly before his death. Fixed brain tissue obtained during the autopsy
was sent for analysis to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance
Center (NPDPSC) and reexamined at the institution where the autopsy was
conducted. Histopathologic examination did not substantiate the diagnosis
of prion disease. In addition, 27 brain tissue sections were negative for
prions by immunostaining despite positive antibody reactions against other
proteins (controls), which indicated that other epitopes in the tissue
samples were preserved.
CASE 2. In May 1999, a Minnesota man aged 55 years with no previous history
of a neurologic disease sought evaluation and treatment following a 3-month
history of progressive difficulty in writing and unsteadiness of gait. A
computerized tomography (CT) scan and MRI examination of his head did not
indicate any abnormality. In June 1999, he was hospitalized following onset
of dementia, speech abnormalities, and myoclonic jerking. An EEG indicated
left-hemispheric periodic sharp waves and moderate generalized background
slowing; CJD was diagnosed clinically. In July 1999, following worsening
symptoms and development of right upper extremity dystonia, the patient
died. Neuropathologic evaluation of brain tissue during autopsy
demonstrated widespread subcortical spongiform lesions, consistent with CJD.
The man was not a hunter but had a history of eating venison. He made an
estimated 12 visits to the cabin where the wild game feasts were held, but
he participated in only one feast during the mid-1980s. Sections of fixed
and frozen brain tissue obtained during autopsy were analyzed at NPDPSC,
and prion disease was confirmed by immunohistochemical and western blot
testing. The western blot characteristics and prion disease phenotype in
this patient were consistent with the most common form of sporadic CJD,
classified as M/M (M/V) 1 (3). Subsequent genetic typing confirmed the
presence of methionine homozygosity (M/M) at codon 129 of the patient's
prion protein gene.
CASE 3. In June 1992, a Wisconsin man aged 65 years sought treatment for
progressive slowing of speech, worsening memory, and personality changes.
By January 1993, his speech was reduced to one-word utterances. Neurologic
examination showed a flat affect, decreased reflexes, and apraxia. A CT
head scan showed mild atrophy, and an EEG was normal. Pick's disease was
diagnosed. By May, he was unable to perform any daily living activities; he
died in August 1993. Neuropathologic evaluation of brain tissue during
autopsy showed symmetrical frontal lobe cerebral cortical atrophy and mild
temporal lobe atrophy. No Pick's bodies or spongiform lesions were observed.
The man had a history of eating venison and participated regularly in wild
game feasts held at the cabin owned by patient 1. He was a lifelong hunter
and hunted mostly in Wisconsin but also in Wyoming and British Columbia. No
game was brought to the wild game feasts from his hunting trips outside of
Wisconsin. Examination of fixed brain tissue sent to NPDPSC demonstrated no
lesions indicative of CJD, and immunohistochemical testing with antibody to
the prion protein did not demonstrate the granular deposits seen in prion
diseases.
Epidemiologic Investigation:
Wild game feasts consisting of elk, deer, antelope, and other game that
occurred at a cabin in northern Wisconsin owned by patient 1 began in 1976
and continued through 2002. These feasts typically involved 10 to 15
participants and usually occurred on weekends before or during hunting
seasons in the fall and occasionally in the spring. Wild game brought to
these feasts usually were harvested in Wisconsin, but 3 men who attended
these feasts reported hunting in the western United States and bringing
game back to Wisconsin. These activities took place in Colorado (near the
towns of Cortez, Trinidad, Collbran, Durango, and Meeker), Wyoming (near
the towns of Gilette and Cody), and Montana (near the town of Malta). CWD
was not known to be endemic in these areas at the time that these hunting
activities took place.
Information was obtained for 45 (85 percent) of 53 persons who were
identified as possibly participating in the wild game feasts; all were
male. Information was obtained by direct interview or from family members
of decedents. Of the 45 persons for whom information was obtained, 34 were
reported to have attended wild game feasts. 7 of the 34 feast attendees
were deceased, including the 3 patients. None of the 4 other decedents had
a cause of death attributed to or associated with a degenerative neurologic
disorder. None of the living participants had any signs or symptoms
consistent with a degenerative neurologic disorder.

MMWR Editorial Note:
CWD was first described in the United States in the 1960s and classified as
a TSE in 1978. Previously localized to a contiguous endemic area in
northeastern Colorado and southeast Wyoming, since 2000, CWD has been found
in free-ranging deer or elk in Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico, South
Dakota, Wisconsin, and outside the previously known endemic areas of
Colorado and Wyoming. CWD has been identified also in captive deer or elk
in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
and Wisconsin (4). Because a variant form of CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], with specific neuropathologic and molecular
characteristics that distinguish it from sporadic CJD, has been associated
with eating cattle products infected with a prion that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (5), concern has been raised about the
possibility that the prion associated with CWD might be transmitted to
humans in a similar way.
In this investigation, because only one of the 3 cases in Wisconsin had
neuropathologic confirmation of a prion disease, no association could be
made between case participation in the wild game feasts and the development
of CJD. Although patient 2 had confirmed CJD, he was unlikely to have eaten
CWD-infected venison at these feasts, because venison and other game from
outside Wisconsin that was served at these feasts did not originate from
known CWD-endemic areas, and the man participated in the feasts only once.
In addition, the prion disease in this case was consistent with the most
common form of sporadic CJD, without apparent unusual neuropathologic or
molecular characteristics that might occur if the prion related to CWD had
been responsible for the disease.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First,
not all members participating in wild game feasts could be identified, and
not all persons listed as participating could be contacted for interviews.
Second, interviews that were conducted required recall of events that
occurred up to 25 years ago, limiting detail and accuracy. However, the
similar responses obtained from different sources support the accuracy of
the investigation findings.
A previous investigation of unusually young CJD patients in whom the
transmission of CWD was suspected also did not provide convincing evidence
for a causal relationship between CWD and CJD (2). However, limited
epidemiologic investigations cannot rule out the possibility that CWD might
play a role in causing human illness. Ongoing surveillance of CJD,
particularly in states with CWD, is important to assess the risk, if any,
for CWD transmission to humans. Because the confirmation of CJD and the
detection of a new prion disease require neuropathologic study of brain
tissue, physicians are encouraged to contact NPDPSC to confirm diagnoses of
CJD and to distinguish its various subtypes:

Because of the known severity of TSEs in humans and the possibility that
the CWD prion can affect humans, animals with evidence of CWD should be
excluded from the human food or animal food chains. Hunters and wild
venison consumers should follow precautionary guidelines available from the
Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection to
prevent potential exposures to the CWD agent:

[This report concludes the incidents reported in ProMED-mail in July and
September 2002 (see below) and provides no support for the inference that
the consumption of meat from wild game potentially carrying the CWD prion
is a risk factor for CJD or other neurologic disorders. However, it has not
been established unequivocally that the variant form of CJD associated with
exposure to the BSE agent occurs as a result of consumption of contaminated
meat -- although an alternative hypothesis is difficult to sustain.
Consequently it remains possible that transmission of the CWD prion to
humans might occur by another route. - Mod.CP]
