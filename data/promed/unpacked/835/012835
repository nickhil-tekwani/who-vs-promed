[Previous reports of this outbreak indicated that both Japanese
encephalitis virus and other unnamed viruses (responsible for
so-called acute encephalitis syndrome) were the etiological agents
responsible for the encephalitis cases. This report mentions neither,
although it refers to "the virus," implying that only one is
involved. It would be of interest to know the results of laboratory
tests to determine the identity of the viruses involved in these cases.
