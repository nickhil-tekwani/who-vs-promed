An outbreak of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ [O157] that has made people sick in 3 provinces is being described as a "national outbreak" by health officials in Nova Scotia. To date, 5 people in Nova Scotia, 6 people in New Brunswick, and 4 people in Ontario have confirmed cases of the same strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 subtype. An additional 5 cases identified by Nova Scotia health officials are still awaiting confirmation from the national laboratory in Winnipeg to see if they are from the same strain.

Dr Frank Atherton, Nova Scotia's deputy chief medical officer of health, said the findings confirm health officials are on the right track.

"We know that there's a common source for this infection across the 3 provinces. That's important because it means, really, this is now a national outbreak," he told reporters on Wed 9 Jan 2013. "We still have a very large provincial role to play but we need to look at it in the context of what's happening in those other provinces."

According to a news release posted to the Public Health Agency of Canada's website, lab tests indicate all 15 cases are linked. Health officials believe the source is produce served at restaurants, but they haven't been able to pinpoint the source.

[Another province has been added to the 2 that have reported an outbreak strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. Time will tell the scope of this outbreak and hopefully epidemiological and microbiological evidence will come forward demonstrating the vehicle of this outbreak. ProMED-mail thanks Stephen Rankin for this submission.
