On 30 May 2011, a horse in Saskatchewan tested positive for the
neurological form of equine herpes virus (nEHV-1). This horse attended
the cutting horse show in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Canada, on 14
and 15 May 2011. Some of the horses present at this show may have had
a history of travel to the National Cutting Horse Association's
Western National Championships in Ogden, Utah, conducted 29 Apr - 8
May 2011.

Saskatchewan horse owners are encouraged to remain vigilant about
protecting their horse's health by maintaining good biosecurity
practices. In addition, any horse that has been in contact with high
risk horses should be monitored closely for signs of respiratory or
neurological disease. Any horse showing signs of neurological or
respiratory disease should be examined by a veterinarian.

To avoid spreading nEHV-1, direct and indirect contact with sick and
high risk horses should be avoided. Horses attending the Lloydminster
cutting horse show are considered to be at high risk for nEHV-1
infection. All horses present at this show should be isolated for a
period of 28 days after the show. Furthermore, all horses that have
been in contact with horses present at the Lloydminster show should
also be isolated for 28 days. Please remember that horses can be
infected with nEHV-1 and not show any clinical signs, but still shed
the virus and infect other horses.

EHV-1 outbreak: 9 new confirmed cases in a week
-----------------------------------------------
EHV Q&A
The number of confirmed cases of EHV-1 in western states has risen by
9 in the past week, latest figures released today reveal.

Death toll as of 3 Jun 2011
Arizona 1
California 2
Colorado 2
Idaho 2
New Mexico 2
Oregon 1
Utah 2


Latest state-by-state wrap
--------------------------
Latest information from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) of the US Department of Agriculture show that 84
horses are confirmed as infected with the deadly virus across 10
states.

The 10th state to join the list this week was Oklahoma, with 1
confirmed case of the neurological form of the disease. The other
states with confirmed cases are Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

The death toll has risen by 2 since the last APHIS release a week
ago, and now stands at 12. The 2 latest deaths were reported in
California. Of the 84 confirmed cases, 58 are horses that were at the
Ogden, Utah, cutting horse event which appears to be at the centre of
the outbreak. In the last week, just 2 additional premises with
suspected or confirmed cases have been reported.

Owners of horses known to have been exposed in this incident have
been contacted by State Animal Health Officials, APHIS said, and
suspect and confirmed cases are reported to be under voluntary or
state quarantine.

All known exposed horses are reported to be under either voluntary or
state quarantine.

[The outbreak of equine herpesvirus seems to be slowing somewhat. We
look forward to when this outbreak is declared over as all horse
owners are worrying, shows and events have been cancelled and equine
deaths from this cause can cease.

For more detailed information regarding the disease itself, readers
are encouraged to view the moderator comments on ProMED-mail posts 20110519.1516 and 20110524.1573. - Mod.TG]
