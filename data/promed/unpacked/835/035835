A 3 year old girl infected with the O157 strain of _Escherichia coli_ died
on Mon 6 Aug 2007, the city government of Osaka said. Four other children
between the ages of 10 months and 5 years who attended the same nursery
school were also infected: 2 are still receiving hospital treatment, while
the other 2 are recuperating at home.
The girl was hospitalized on 29 Jul 2007 with severe stomach pains and
diarrhea. The hospital reported to the city on 1 Aug 2007 that O157 had
been detected in a stool sample. Officials said the girl died of multiple
organ failure and brain damage.
Officials said they suspect all 5 were fed the same food at the school, but
they are also investigating whether the source of infection was from
outside the school. A total of 31 infants and pupils up to age 7 attend the
Popora Osaka Tenrokuen nursery center.
According to data from the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, 1376
cases of this infection were reported between January and mid-July 2007.
The figure is 2nd only to the 1641 cases for all of 2001.
In 2007, Tokyo had the highest number of cases with 266, followed by 88
cases in Osaka Prefecture, 75 in Fukuoka Prefecture, 73 in Saitama
Prefecture, 68 in Ishikawa Prefecture, and 65 in Chiba Prefecture.
The center issued a warning about secondary infection through human
contact. It advised staff at nursery schools and facilities for senior
citizens to be thorough when washing hands and using disinfectant after
changing diapers and before eating.

[As stated, the exact vehicle for transmission of the organism is not yet
clear. It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the
flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that
substantially larger amounts of this disease occurred in that time frame.
The following is from FAO/WHO Global Forum of Food Safety Regulators,
Marrakesh, Morocco, 28-30 Jan 2002, Investigation system for foodborne
outbreaks in Japan: (<http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/X6924E.HTM>).
"...in 1996, many outbreaks of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection,
involved 11 826 cases and 12 deaths, occurred in Japan. 16 outbreaks among
them affected more than 10 people and comprised 10 275 cases.
Epidemiological investigations revealed that the sources of infection in
these 16 outbreaks included school lunches served at elementary schools and
child care centers (9 outbreaks, 9845 patients), nursing home meals (3
outbreaks, 123 patients), a meal served at an industrial facility (1
outbreak, 47 patients), a commercially prepared box lunch (1 outbreak, 191
patients), and unknown sources (2 outbreaks, 58 patients)."
The city and prefecture of Osaka are located on Honshu, Japan's largest
island and can be found on a map at
