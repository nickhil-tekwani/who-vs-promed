Re: Host Range of Hepatitis A Virus
------------------------------------
Only primates are susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection, _Homo
sapiens_ being the most common host species. So unless there are other
primates in the area, food or water contaminated with human excrement are
the most logical sources of the virus to consider. Inter-human, fecal-oral
transmission is also possible.

[Dr. Whitham's comments are related to some of the content of the
Moderator's comment appended to the preceding post. Recent research
indicates that hepatitis A virus can be divided into 2 biotypes that are
phylogenetically distinct and have different preferred hosts; one biotype
is associated with all species of primates, humans, chimpanzees, owl
monkeys, and marmosets, and the other is associated with African green
monkeys and cynomologus monkeys. Neither biotype of hepatitis A virus is
known to infect other animals. However, in marine and fresh-water
environments, hepatitis A virus can become associated with certain
filter-feeding invertebrates where there is contamination with human
detritus. - Mod.CP]
