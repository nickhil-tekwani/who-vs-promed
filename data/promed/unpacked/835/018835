Mink infected with coronavirus have been found at a farm in the Eure-et-Loire region of western France, and 1000 mink at the farm will be culled, the French agriculture ministry said on Sunday [22 Nov 2020].

Cases in mink have also been reported elsewhere in Europe, notably in Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, [and Spain].

In Denmark, the virus was found to have mutated into a different strain, which experts feared could render a vaccine less effective if transmitted back to humans. Around 17 million mink are due to be culled there.

France started testing its 4 mink farms in mid-November [2020].

"At this stage, tests have shown the virus circulating in an Eure-et-Loire farm," the ministry said. "A 2nd farm is unscathed. Tests are still underway in the last 2 farms, with results expected during the week."

[France reported to the OIE, on 5 and 12 May 2020, infections with SARS-CoV-2 in 2 domestic cats, attributed to human-cat contact. The event was published in a scientific journal; see https://tinyurl.com/y32jefpa. The current case in minks is expected to be similarly notified to the OIE as an emerging disease.

France was included in a (probably incomplete) list of European countries which were exporters of raw mink skins in 2013; the others were Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Sweden (see table 6 in ref 1 below). Likely, and as can be seen in a recent global map presenting the 'World laws on killing animals for fur', some of the countries named are no longer counted among such countries. The map presents the following categories: 1. Killing animals for fur is illegal. 2. Killing animals for fur is legal, but strict anti-cruelty regulations make fur farms uneconomic. 3. Killing animals for fur is legal, but importing or selling fur is illegal. 4. Killing animals for fur is partially illegal (some animals are excluded). 5. Killing animals for fur is legal and active. 6.Unknown. The map can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_farming#/media/File:World_laws_on_killing_animals_for_fur.png.

The establishment, preferably by an international animal health institution, of an updated list of mink-farming countries, including information on their respective COVID-19 surveillance activities, is warranted.

Genotyping results, comparing the French mink virus strain with local human strains and Dutch/Danish mink virus strains, are anticipated with interest.
