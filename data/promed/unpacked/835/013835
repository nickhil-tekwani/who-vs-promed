[3] Minimal cutaneous involvement or systemic symptoms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report of a case
----------------
A healthy man in his 20s presented to outpatient dermatology with 2 painless genital and a single facial lesion of approximately 10 days' duration. At onset, he noted mild malaise and sore throat without fever, headache, chills, or adenopathy. He reported 1 new asymptomatic sexual male partner 10 days before initial symptoms. Pertinent medications included emtricitabine/tenofovir daily for pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis.

Before dermatology evaluation, he was treated for presumed facial impetigo with mupirocin, 2% ointment and condyloma with imiquimod, 5% cream. Examination demonstrated 2 umbilicated and ulcerated, skin-colored papules on the genitals, as well as a honey-colored crusted papule on the face (Figure).

Polymerase chain reaction swab results were negative for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus. Results from the HIV and syphilis blood tests were negative. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction testing of each ulceration confirmed West African monkeypox virus.

Discussion
----------
Monkeypox is emerging as a potentially important pathogen, with more than 15 000 cases as of August 2022 reported in the US.[3] In this current outbreak, community transmission has occurred mostly, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men.[1] Transmission happens via direct contact with open lesions, which may explain recent lesion localization to the anogenital region following sexual activity. However, there has been debate about whether monkeypox represents a new sexually transmitted infection. Less frequently, transmission may develop via fomites or prolonged face-to-face contact with respiratory droplets. Use of contact and airborne precautions by health care clinicians is recommended in suspected cases (including N95 masks, gowns, gloves, and eye protection).

Following monkeypox virus exposure, patients classically present with prodromal symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, and adenopathy within 5 to 21 days. Painful rash develops 1 to 3 days after fever in a centrifugal fashion, most often on the face (95%), followed by the hands/feet (75%), oral mucosa (70%), genitals (30%), and conjunctiva (20%).[2] Lesions progress sequentially (macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, scabs) at the same developmental stage throughout the body.

Clinicians should be aware that patients during this outbreak have presented in an atypical manner (Box). Few or single cutaneous lesions may precede instead of following mild systemic symptoms.[1,5] Lesions may be asymptomatic, painful, or minimally pruritic. While clinical features may help provide clues to the differential diagnosis of isolated anogenital lesions, concomitant sexually transmitted infections have been reported and should be excluded via serologic, urine, or lesion swab testing in any suspected monkeypox case.[5] Umbilicated lesions raise the possibility of molluscum contagiosum, but molluscum completely lacks systemic symptoms and has a longer incubation period (IP) of 14 to 56 days. Painless ulcerations may mimic primary syphilis (IP, 10-90 days), lymphogranuloma venereum (IP, 3-30 days), or granuloma inguinale (IP, 4-28 days). Painful ulcerations are seen with chancroid (IP, 4-7 days) or herpetic infections (IP, 2-7 days). Disseminated gonococcus (IP, 1-14 days) may present as an ulceronecrotic papule. In addition, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale, and chancroid often demonstrate tender inguinal adenopathy.[6] Patients with known exposure should be symptomatically monitored for 21 days, with notification of local health departments to help with contract tracing and outbreak prevention.

In patients with umbilicated or ulcerated lesions, particularly localized to the anogenital region, clinicians should perform a thorough social history and maintain a high index of suspicion for monkeypox, even in those with mild constitutional symptoms, who report a new sexual partner in the preceding 2 weeks. Increased public awareness of risk factors, the ability to recognize subtle skin findings, as well the increased availability/dissemination of vaccines will be important in containing and preventing further outbreaks.

Summary
-------
Background
The early epidemiology of the 2022 monkeypox epidemic in non-endemic countries differs substantially from the epidemiology previously reported from endemic countries. We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics among individuals with confirmed cases of monkeypox infection.

Methods
We descriptively analysed data for patients with confirmed monkeypox who were included in the GeoSentinel global clinical-care-based surveillance system between 1 May and 1 Jul 2022, across 71 clinical sites in 29 countries. Data collected included demographics, travel history including mass gathering attendance, smallpox vaccination history, social history, sexual history, monkeypox exposure history, medical history, clinical presentation, physical examination, testing results, treatment, and outcomes. We did descriptive analyses of epidemiology and subanalyses of patients with and without HIV, patients with CD4 counts of less than 500 cells per mm3 or 500 cells per mm3 and higher, patients with one sexual partner or 10 or more sexual partners, and patients with or without a previous smallpox vaccination.

Findings
226 cases were reported at 18 sites in 15 countries. Of 211 men for whom data were available, 208 (99%) were gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men (MSM) with a median age of 37 years (range 18-68; IQR 32-43). Of 209 patients for whom HIV status was known, 92 (44%) men had HIV infection with a median CD4 count of 713 cells per mm3 (range 36-1659; IQR 500-885). Of 219 patients for whom data were available, 216 (99%) reported sexual or close intimate contact in the 21 days before symptom onset; MSM reported a median of 3 partners (IQR 1-8). Of 195 patients for whom data were available, 78 (40%) reported close contact with someone who had confirmed monkeypox. Overall, 30 (13%) of 226 patients were admitted to hospital; 16 (53%) of whom had severe illness, defined as hospital admission for clinical care rather than infection control. No deaths were reported. Compared with patients without HIV, patients with HIV were more likely to have diarrhoea (p=0·002), perianal rash or lesions (p=0·03), and a higher rash burden (median rash burden score 9 [IQR 6-21] for patients with HIV vs median rash burden score 6 [IQR 3-14] for patients without HIV; p<0·0001), but no differences were identified in the proportion of men who had severe illness by HIV status.

Interpretation
Clinical manifestations of monkeypox infection differed by HIV status. Recommendations should be expanded to include pre-exposure monkeypox vaccination of groups at high risk of infection who plan to engage in sexual or close intimate contact.
