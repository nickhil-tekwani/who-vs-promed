As we have just learned, Hungary has the 1st case of bluetongue
[disease]. It is a farm in Forraytanya, near the village Gelej, in
the northeast of Hungary.

[Forraytanya, in Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen County, Northern Hungary, is
located about 130 km (81 mi) northeast of Budapest; see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=Forraytanya&countryCode=HU> (zoom out).

A confirmation or otherwise of the suspicion stated above, and -- in
case affirmed -- additional information, in particular concerning the
BTV serotype involved, are requested. If it is BTV-8, this will mean
a concerning but not surprising eastward spread of the virus.
Identification of a different BTV serotype in Hungary is less likely
in the absence of reports on recent cases in southeastern Europe. -

Three sheep have been found infected by bluetongue [virus] in
Switzerland, one case in each of the cantons of Freiburg, Basel-Land,
and Aargau. The new cases indicate that additional outbreaks may be
expected throughout Switzerland during the coming weeks. Unvaccinated
cows, sheep, and goats currently returning from summer pastures,
should be vaccinated immediately.

All 3 infected sheep showed pronounced disease symptoms such as
swellings, mucopurulent discharge, and lameness. The sheep in the
cantons of Freiburg and Basel-Land were not vaccinated. The sheep in
the canton of Aargau, on the other hand, had already been vaccinated
in mid-June [2008]. An investigation into the reason for disease in
this vaccinated sheep is in progress. There could be various
explanations. On one hand, any vaccine may leave a few animals not
fully protected; this may be the case also with bluetongue, in spite
of the fact that this vaccine is generally regarded as an effective
one. On the other, errors may happen during vaccination.

The new cases in Switzerland and outbreaks in neighbouring countries
show that the compulsory vaccination, undertaken since June [2008],
was indeed necessary. In France, for example, in some departments the
vaccination was voluntary, with the subsequent more than 5000
diseased animals, a few hundred of which were detected near the Swiss
border [see commentary].

According to the most recent French information bulletin, dated 4 Sep
2008, the number of BTV-8 cases resulting from the virus circulation
during 2008, has reached 10 800 (the number of BTV-1 cases was 255).
See the report (in French), with a map, at

The Swiss forecast of outbreaks expected during the coming weeks
corresponds with the epidemiological data collected in West Europe
during the 2 disease seasons since the introduction of BTV-8 in
summer 2006: the peak of cases appeared between September and October.

The EU map of BTV restriction zones was updated on 4 Sep 2008 and is
available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.
Sweden's declared BTV-8 zone is not yet included. - Mod.AS]
