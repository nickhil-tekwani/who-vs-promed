On 24 Jun 2010, the Spokane (WA) Regional Health District (SRHD) was
notified of 2 hospitalized patients under intensive care with severe
dehydration whose stool specimens yielded _Vibrio mimicus_. CDC was
asked to assist with the environmental and epidemiologic
investigation. Investigators learned that both persons had consumed
crayfish on 20 Jun 2010. The previous day, live crayfish obtained
from an online seafood company had been boiled and served warm at a
party. The chef reported that the boiled crayfish were served out of
a cooler that had contained live crayfish, and the cooler had not
been cleaned before being used to serve the cooked crayfish. After
the party, the remaining crayfish were refrigerated overnight in
different containers and served cold as leftovers the following
evening on 20 Jun 2010.

Questionnaires were administered to 21 (95 percent) of 22 persons who
had attended either the party on 19 Jun 2010 or the meal of leftovers
on 20 Jun 2010. A case was defined as an illness in any person who
had attended the party or the meal and experienced acute, watery
diarrhea during 19-25 Jun 2010. 4 cases were identified. Consuming
leftover crayfish was associated with illness. Of 8 persons who
consumed leftover crayfish, 4 (50 percent) became ill compared with 0
of the 13 persons who did not consume leftover crayfish (relative
risk = 14; Fisher's exact test p value = 0.007). No other food items
or environmental exposures were associated with illness.

_V. mimicus_ was isolated from cultures of stool specimens, and genes
encoding cholera toxin were identified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) in all 3 ill persons who submitted specimens. 2 persons were
hospitalized in an intensive-care unit with severe dehydration,
metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The 2 patients received
intravenous fluid rehydration, bicarbonate infusions, and
antibiotics; they recovered fully. The other 2 persons had mild,
self-limited diarrheal illness. Frozen leftover crayfish samples
submitted to the FDA on 21 Jul 2010 for testing did not yield _V.
mimicus_ by culture, nor were cholera toxin genes detected using PCR.

_V. mimicus_ has been recognized as a cause of gastroenteritis
transmitted by raw oysters, fish, turtle eggs, prawns, squid, and
crayfish (1). _V. mimicus_, when carrying genes that encode cholera
toxin, can cause severe watery diarrhea (2). Consumers and physicians
should be aware that improperly handled marine and aquatic animal
products can be a source of _V. mimicus_ infections. Consumers should
avoid cross-contamination of cooked seafood and other foods with raw
seafood and juices from raw seafood and should follow FDA
recommendations for selecting seafood and preparing it safely (3).

[Since 2000, at least 7 noncholeragenic _Vibrio_ species (_V.
vulnificus_, _V. parahaemolyticus_, nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_, _V.
alginolyticus_, _V. fluvialis_, _V. mimicus_, and _V. hollisae_)
(ProMED-mail Vibrio vulnificus, post-hurricane - USA(04): Additional
Vibrio species 20050915.2723) have been reported as causing illness
each year in the USA. Although these organisms and those that cause
cholera are grouped together under the genus _Vibrio_, they usually
cause distinctly different illnesses.

In the USA, noncholeragenic _Vibrio_ usually are either foodborne,
(such as, resulting from eating raw or undercooked shellfish,
particularly oysters, or other contaminated foods) or
wound-associated (such as, resulting from exposure to seawater or
brackish waters where the organism naturally occurs). Non-cholera
vibrios are not transmitted easily from person to person. Outbreaks,
which are rare, usually are the result of consuming contaminated shellfish.

_V. mimicus_ seems appropriately named since genetically it is the
_Vibrio_ species most similar to _V. cholerae_ (1). The organism was
first proposed to define atypical non O1 _V. cholerae_ that could not
utilize sucrose (2) but sucrose-negative strains of _V. cholerae_ do
exist. _V. mimicus_ and _V. cholerae_ share almost 100 percent of 16S
rRNA gene sequences and about 80 percent DNA-DNA relatedness and, as
in this case, _V. mimicus_ can share important virulence factors.

Multilocus sequence analysis can distinguish the organisms (3).
Additionally, like the cholera bacillus, _V. mimicus_ strongly
interacts with free living amoebae (4).

The largest reported foodborne outbreak associated with _V. mimicus_
occurred in 2004 in Thailand, involved at least 300 individuals and
was associated with undercooked seafood.

This crayfish-associated outbreak could have been avoided by
attention to good kitchen hygiene, that is, not placing cooked food
in the same place where the uncooked food was.

A crayfish is a freshwater crustacean that looks like a small lobster
to which it is related. A picture can be seen at
