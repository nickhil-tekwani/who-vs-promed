Italy on Wednesday [7 Mar 2001 sealed its borders to all animals from the
European Union (EU) and other countries at risk for Foot-and-Mouth Disease
(FMD), the health ministry said. The closure order signed by Health
Minister Umberto Veronesi is effective until 27 March 2001.
The order was more far-reaching than a EU decision taken Tuesday to ban all
livestock transport and close animal markets within the union for 2 weeks,
the ministry said.
EU veterinarians also extended until 27 Mar 2001 a ban on exports of
animals, meat and dairy products from Britain, where the FMD broke out 3
weeks ago.
Inside Italy, cattle transports from farms to slaughterhouses or between
farms can only be carried out after an authorization by health authorities.
Animals at risk for the FMD epidemic must no longer be exhibited at fairs,
or even circuses. Foot-and-mouth affects cloven-footed animals like sheep,
pigs, and cows and is highly contagious, although it poses virtually no
health hazard to humans.
Italy did not sign the EU ban, considering it insufficient to contain the
disease because of what it considered were loopholes. Scores of Italian
farmers blockaded 2 border crossings with Austria and France on Wednesday
to prevent meat and other animal products from entering Italy.

Japan has banned imports of pork and pork products from France, Belgium and
Northern Ireland following suspected outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease
(FMD) there, farm ministry officials said Tuesday [6 Mar 2001. The
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry ceased issuing quarantine
certifications for pork and processed pork products such as sausage, bacon,
and ham from Northern Ireland on Friday and France and Belgium on Sunday.
The ministry on Monday banned imports of Danish pork, which accounts for
about 30 percent of total pork imports, but then lifted it Tuesday after
receiving reports from Denmark that pigs there had tested negative for the
disease.
Since the disease is highly contagious, the ministry took precautionary
measures by banning the imports prior to receiving confirmation the animals
were infected, the officials said. Japan has banned imports of pork from
Britain since August 2000 following an outbreak of swine flu.
Outbreaks of FMD have been reported in Britain in the past few weeks,
leading to fears it will spread across Europe. The number of confirmed
infected sites in Britain, where 67 000 animals have already been
slaughtered in a desperate bid to stamp out the disease, rose from 52 to 69
on Sunday. Japan imported 650 000 tons of pork in 2000, of which 274 000
tons came from the European Union.
