Tuliau Dr Seine Vaai-Nielsen says there are now more than 2500 confirmed cases [of chikungunya virus infection], not counting the unreported ones. The Ministry of Health is calling on all sector partners to assist with raising awareness campaigns on chikungunya prevention, especially as it's now the rainy season in Samoa.

Our correspondent Autagavaia Tipi Autagavaia says chikungunya is now in all districts in Samoa. "The Ministry of Health has released the latest figures and also more advisories for the public to continue the safety measures [against] the chikungunya [virus], because the number of people affected from October to November [2014] has increased to 259, and the total so far [since] July [2014] according to Ministry of Health figures, is over 2500 people with chikungunya [virus infections]."

Autagavaia Tipi Autagavaia says the Ministry of Health is calling on the public to be more vigilant against the mosquito borne disease.

[The chikungunya outbreak continues to grow in Samoa, from 269 cases reported on 25 Aug 2014, to 433 reported on 8 Sep 2014, then to 626 cases on 20 Sep 2014, and now to an estimated 2500, with cases reported throughout Samoa. Vigilance alone will not halt the outbreak. The Ministry of Health and the public will need to cooperate in the elimination of the breeding sites of the vector mosquitoes.
