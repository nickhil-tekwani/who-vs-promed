The chikungunya epidemic is now spreading in the rural areas of Kassala locality, multiple sources told Radio Dabanga.

At least 25 chikungunya patients reportedly died in Kassala during the past 3 days. The El Hassan and El Hussein cemetery east of Kassala and the graveyard west of El Gash are daily witnessing burials of chikungunya victims.

According to medical doctor and university professor Tajeldin Mohamedein the disease has entered the epidemic stage. He pointed out that chikungunya leads to a drop in the number of platelets and to haemorrhages. It can lead to death among newborns and people suffering from chronic diseases. In general the health of many people in eastern Sudan is far from good because of poor nutrition caused by poverty, he added.

Chikungunya is a virus transmitted from human to human by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. The mosquitoes involved are _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, two species that can also transmit other mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue.

Mohamedein did not rule out the presence of dengue fever in Kassala as well. The only solution is to combat the vector of the disease, he said.

On [Mon 24 Sep 2018], Prime Minister Motaz Mousa visited various hospitals and health centres in Kassala. He ordered 2 tons of pesticides to combat the spread of the disease and stressed that more efforts have to be exerted to improve the environment.

Listeners told this station that the Kassala authorities transferred hospital patients suffering from chikungunya to health centres in order to disguise the scope of the epidemic.

On [Sun 23 Sep 2018], medical staff closed the children's ward at Kassala Teaching Hospital in eastern Sudan and ordered it to be sterilised after 2 children vomited blood.

The Governor of Kassala claims that the daily deaths are "unrelated to the disease". He confirmed that 10 900 infections have been diagnosed. Yet, 10 days ago, he acknowledged the death of 7 people from chikungunya fever, and that more than 6000 people have been infected in the recently confirmed outbreak of the disease.

Activists are calling on social media for support to halt the epidemic. On Twitter for example the hashtag #KassalaIsDying is being used (#كسلا_تحتضر).

Radio Dabanga received the 1st reports about the spread of chikungunya fever in Kassala in end August [2018].

[The ongoing outbreak of febrile illness has been confirmed by the local health department, Kassala as chikungunya.

In some cases, chikungunya is asymptomatic - people do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include sudden fever and severe muscle and joint pain. They can be accompanied by headache, fatigue nausea, vomiting, and a rash. Although most patients fully recover, chronic joint pain may last for several weeks or months. Other persistent problems may include eye, gastrointestinal, neurological, and heart complications. People with chronic health conditions, a weakened immune system, infants, and older persons are at risk of developing complications with this infection. Chikungunya is rarely fatal. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available.

Preventing or reducing vector-borne virus transmission depends entirely in controlling the mosquito vectors or interruption of human-vector contact. WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors. IVM is defined as a 'rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control." The aims are to improve efficacy, cost effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustainability.

Transmission control activities should target _Ae. Aegypti_ (or any of the other vectors depending on the evidence of transmission) in its immature (egg, larva, and pupa) and adult stages, in the household and immediate vicinity. This includes other settings where human-vector contact occurs, such as schools, hospitals and workplaces. - Mod.UBA]

[As chikungunya is rarely fatal, because of the number of deaths, it must be considered that other mosquito borne illnesses such as dengue and malaria are contributing to the death toll. - Mod.DK]
