Of the 40 000 tuberculosis (TB) cases recorded in the city [Mumbai, Maharashtra state] in 2013, more than 4000 patients were relapse cases, according to civic health department data. The count of relapse cases has remained constant over the last few years -- an indicator of the poor living conditions and of the hurdles in the treatment regime followed in public hospitals.

In 2013, over 10 per cent of TB cases (4467) were for re-treatment. In 2012, the figure stood at 4460 of 30 828 cases, and in 2011 it was 4329 of 29 212 cases. According to estimates, the actual count of relapse cases may be higher, as not all private hospitals are accounted for by the civic health department.

Over the last 3 years, the count of multi drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB cases has noticeably increased. From 181 new patients diagnosed with MDR TB and 288 already receiving treatment for it in 2011, the figure rose to 2195 new patients diagnosed with MDR TB and 1935 on treatment in 2012. In 2013, a whopping 2903 patients were diagnosed with MDR TB and 2604 were on treatment.

Dr Minnie Khetarpal, BMC's TB control officer, said, "Though MDR cases are rising, patients receive 2nd-line treatment. But in XDR cases, patients respond to very few drugs. Currently, Bedaquilin is considered a wonder drug, but is under clinical trials in India." The drug, which has been used on 5 patients in Mumbai, is being imported from Belgium.

In 2013, the count of XDR TB rose to 90 cases from 32 in 2012. This year [2014] till now, 24 patients have been labelled as XDR by the BMC. [The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is the civic body that governs the city of Mumbai.]

[India and China together account for almost 40 percent of the world's tuberculosis (TB) cases (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75938/1/9789241564502_eng.pdf).

Of the 2 countries, India bears a disproportionately larger burden of the world's TB cases. India has an estimated 2.8 million people infected with TB in 2012, whereas China has an estimated 1.4 million people infected with TB. For comparison, the US had 15 000 people infected with TB in 2012 (http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/profiles/en/).

Several molecular methods have been developed in recent years for the diagnosis of TB and rapid detection of drug resistance. The Xpert MTB/RIF is a cartridge-based, automated diagnostic test that integrates sputum processing, DNA extraction and amplification, identification of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex and resistance to rifampin. MDR-TB is defined as strains resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazid (INH), and rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for MDR-TB, because 95 percent of the strains resistant to rifampin are also resistant to INH. Test results with the Xpert MTB/RIF can be obtained within 2 hours. Because of its high sensitivity to detect TB (similar to culture) and rifampin resistance, together with its ease of use, WHO endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF technology in 2010 and encouraged its rapid adoption in endemic countries. India has been a major procurer of Xpert MTB/RIF (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf).

In addition to Xpert MTB/RIF, high MDR-TB burden countries must, nevertheless, maintain reference laboratories for drug susceptibility testing of other anti-TB drugs, and the increased capacity to diagnose MDR-TB must be matched with supplies of quality drugs and capacity to deliver effective treatment and care.

Although India is estimated to have the highest number of MDR-TB cases (64 000 cases) among its notified TB patients (almost 1.5 million), only 26 percent (16 588 cases of MDR-TB) of its estimated number of MDR-TB were actually detected in 2012; in part because only 55 611 patients were tested for MDR-TB and consequently only 14 143 were actually started on MDR-TB treatment (https://extranet.who.int/sree/Reports?op=Replet&name=%2FWHO_HQ_Reports%2FG2%2FPROD%2FEXT%2FTBCountryProfile&ISO2=IN&LAN=EN&outtype=pdf).

It is hoped that with greater access to rapid molecular testing, especially among the extremely poor in densely populated urban slums and in rural communities, a greater percentage of patients with MDR-TB will be identified, especially in people who failed their 1st treatment and who are most likely to already have MDR-TB. This must be combined with susceptibility testing to 2nd line drugs so that appropriate multidrug regimes with 2nd line drugs can be initiated for people with MDR-TB.

The goal of India's Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) is to achieve the following targets by the end of 2015: early detection and treatment of at least 90 percent of estimated TB cases in the community, including HIV associated TB; initial screening of all previously treated (retreatment) smear-positive TB patients for drug resistant TB and the provision of treatment services for multidrug resistant TB; offering HIV counselling and testing for all TB patients, and linking HIV infected TB patients to HIV care and support; successful treatment of at least 90 percent of all new TB patients, and at least 85 percent of all previously treated TB patients; and extension of RNTCP services to patients diagnosed and treated in the private sector (http://www.tbfacts.org/tb-india.html).

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of approximately 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra.
