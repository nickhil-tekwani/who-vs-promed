As deaths from the [hantavirus] continue to increase, health authorities
Tuesday advised tourists to take special precautions against the virus
during travels over the long holiday weekend.
[This hantavirus] is spread by long-tailed rats [_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_] and can cause fatal hemorrhaging and pulmonary failure. As
of Tuesday [September 16], 23 cases had been confirmed in Chile, counting
from 1995, when the virus reappeared here. There have been 15 fatalities,
10 of them this year and seven of those since July. Two of the dead are
foreigners, including an Argentinean soldier who died in Patagonia in August.
Long-tailed rats can be found anywhere in the country. While thus far the
virus has struck almost exclusively in the south, there is one confirmed
death and one unconfirmed case in Arica, which borders Peru in the north,
and another unconfirmed case in central northern La Serena.
The National Tourism Service (Sernatur) joined the Ministry of Health and
the Medical Association Tuesday on the committee charged with fighting the
[virus]. Sernatur will take part in the educational effort in hopes of
avoiding the kinds of blows to the tourism industry which Bariloche,
Argentina, suffered in 1996 because of a [hantavirus] scare. There will be
no restrictions on tourism [in Chile] due to the virus, however.
Health Minister Alex Figueroa said Tuesday that some 4.5 million Chileans
will be moving around the national territory over the weekend, and
therefore "the whole world" has to confront the threat from [hantaviruses].
"The country cannot run and hide like a rat," the Minister said. "Chile
can confront this public health problem with very simple measures.
Education is the fundamental key and the cornerstone of the fight against
this illness." He called for simple precautions such as washing kitchen
utensils, disposing of garbage properly and cleaning homes and lodging
areas that have been uninhabited for long [periods] of time.
Figueroa noted that common cleaning items such as chlorine, as well as mere
exposure to sunlight, are deadly to the virus.
A five-year-old boy died in the northern central town of Coquimbo from what
appeared to be a [hantavirus infection], La Tercera reported. The case has
yet to be confirmed [in the laboratory as being due to a hantavirus
infection].
