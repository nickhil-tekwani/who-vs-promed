CHOLERA IN REFUGEES - ZAIRE
===========================
Source: ABC-TV news (USA), 6:30pm EST Sunday 13 Apr.1996

Reporting from Kisangani, Zaire, the newscaster said that WHO had that day
(Sunday) declared a cholera epidemic in a huge refugee camp holding Rwandan
& Burundian refugees.
An aid worker said there was a shortage of food and clean water in the
camp. Refugees were shown bathing and washing clothes in the same stream
from which they get their drinking water.
I have held off posting this for nearly 24 hours, waiting for confirmation
from the WHO Website or wire services, but decided to go ahead and post now
anyway.
