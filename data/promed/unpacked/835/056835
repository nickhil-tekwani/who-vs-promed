["Rabies continues to threaten the health of both humans and animals. In particular, dog-mediated human rabies costs the lives of thousands of people every year mainly in Africa and Asia, even though the disease is 100 percent preventable. A global business plan for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies was launched in 2017, under the initiative of the "United against rabies" collaboration composed of the 4 partner organisations: World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC). Between 2017 and early May 2018, the disease was reported present in 57 percent of the 183 countries and territories which notified information to the OIE". http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/state-of-play-of-the-global-animal-health-situation/

Rabies can be found in dogs, bats, and other mammals in Kazakhstan, so CDC recommends this vaccine for the following groups: (see https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/kazakhstan).

- Travelers involved in outdoor and other activities (such as camping, hiking, biking, adventure travel, and caving) that put them at risk for animal bites.
- People who will be working with or around animals (such as veterinarians, wildlife professionals, and researchers).
- People who are taking long trips or moving to Kazakhstan
- Children, because they tend to play with animals, might not report bites, and are more likely to have animal bites on their head and neck.
