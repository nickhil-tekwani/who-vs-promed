The origin of the word avoirdupois apart, I think of these measures as
grains, drams, ounces, pounds etc. Cloves and tods were units used in
weighing wool -- thus a clove equals 7 pounds, a stone equals 14 pounds, a
tod equals 2 stone, a wey equals 6 and a half tod, a pack equals 240 pounds,
a sack equals 2 weys, and a last equals 12 sacks. How interesting life was
in pre-decimal days!

[This is fascinating. So I weigh a bit more than a wey, a stone and a
clove -- or just over a half sack, which doesn't sound quite so heavy! (I am
2 and 1/9 yards tall, however, so my body mass index is OK. - Mod.JW]

We had a long discussion in our practice re units now in use in the UK. One
of our colleagues (Belgian) is very pro-metric, while older folk such as
myself enjoy the intellectual exercise of working 2 systems.
One bizarre conclusion we came to is that many of the non-metric measures
will stay either because they are related to biological measures (inch and
foot), or convenience (pint), or for ladiesï¿½ diplomacy (stones and pounds
are weights that allow for latitude in interpretation), or simple
practicality: a crate of wine bottles has to have 12 to be properly packed.
The latter hints at the mathematical power of a system which includes the
number 12.
In conclusion, this side of the pond, non-metric units (I dare not say
imperial!) will continue to pop up.

[In the pre-decimal days we were weighed in stones. I always wondered why
such a clumsy method was used when livestock were weighed in pounds, and
grain in hundredweights. I suppose we were regarded as woolly-headed. -
