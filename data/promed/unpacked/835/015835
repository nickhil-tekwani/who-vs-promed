Mildew is ravaging Bordeaux's vineyards [Nouvelle-Aquitaine region] in France's largest wine-growing region. Few producers have been spared from the outbreak which they say has been caused by heavy rainfall in the spring [2018]. Most expect to lose between 20 and 70 per cent of their crop.

Joel Ortiz, a producer who advises the local Chamber of Agriculture, said: "Few vineyards are completely unaffected. It's widespread, although it hits some varieties of grapes worse than others." Merlot is most prone to mildew in organic vineyards, while cabernet sauvignon is the worst affected non-organic variety. Even organic winemakers are allowed to use copper as a preventive treatment, although the amounts are restricted. 'Bordeaux mixture', which contains copper sulfate and slaked lime, is most commonly applied but it is ineffective once fungi have become established. If applied in large quantities year after year, the copper can pollute the soil and other crops.

"We haven't had a series of disasters like this for decades," Mr Verdier said. "It's a 7-day-a-week struggle. We remove mildewed leaves to try to stop it spreading, then we apply the treatment, and then it rains again. Once the grapes start taking on colour and ripening more, the mildew should subside a bit, but the damage is already done."

[There are 2 mildews of grapevine. Downy mildew (DM) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Plasmopara viticola_. Symptoms include lesions on leaves which later become necrotic. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. Powdery mildew (PM) is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe_ (previously _Uncinula_) _necator_. Leaves heavily infected by PM have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and increased chance of winter injury to the vines.

Mildew spores are spread to the leaves and berries mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in infected leaves on the ground. Mildew diseases on grapevine can be extremely serious and will cause severe crop loss. They can be controlled with fungicides, however, wet weather may interfere with fungicide applications and fungal strains with fungicide resistances are emerging.

Both mildews have been reported in the Bordeaux area before (for example, ProMED-mail post 20070720.2323). However, PM is favoured by warm temperatures and the absence of rain. Since high rainfall is reported above to be the trigger for the mildew outbreak, it appears more likely that DM is the cause.
