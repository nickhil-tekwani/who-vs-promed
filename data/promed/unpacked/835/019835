Malaria in Travellers to The Gambia
-----------------------------------------
The UK-based Public Health Laboratory Service's (PHLS) Malaria Reference
Laboratory has released the following statement:
The number of cases of severe, and sometimes fatal, malaria in UK nationals
visiting The Gambia is causing concern and requires attention by both
travellers and their medical advisers. The early winter holiday period
overlaps with the high transmission season for falciparum malaria there,
and the travellers coming to harm are either taking no chemoprophylaxis or
inadequate chemoprophylaxis.
Imported malaria from The Gambia is predominantly due to the potentially
fatal _Plasmodium falciparum_, and the data given are only for this
species. 92% of cases are imported between August and January, with over
55% of them between November and January inclusive. The annual number of
imported cases from The Gambia averaged 30 between 1991-1998 (range 7 to 56
cases per year), with 43 reported cases in 1998. In 1999 72 cases were
recorded and this year 74 cases have already been reported excluding
December, and with the likelihood of some late-reported November cases
still to come. While some of the inter-year fluctuations are due to changes
in tourist numbers, these appear to have been relatively stable in the last
2 years. In the past 3 years, 59% of those who contracted malaria and on
whom there is relevant information were taking no chemoprophylaxis. Only
27% of the total cases said they had taken prophylaxis. 41 of the 51 who
had taken prophylaxis were using an inadequate drug or drug combination.
Of still greater concern, 5 deaths have been reported already in the year
2000 from falciparum malaria contracted in The Gambia. Of the 4 on whom
details are already available, they were aged 43-60 years, 3 had visited
The Gambia on previous occasions (maybe in the low transmission season) and
NONE had taken antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In 1999 there were 4 deaths,
3 of whom had taken no prophylaxis and one chloroquine with proguanil.
In recent weeks the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and other specialist
centres have admitted over 21 patients severely ill with malaria contracted
in The Gambia. Several of these patients have required intensive care. It
is clear that there is a substantial problem this year, and this is likely
to continue into January [2001.
These problems, and tragedies, are avoidable give appropriate action by
travellers and their health advisers. The following 3 issues need
emphasis:- (i) Travellers need to take appropriate prophylaxis - weekly
mefloquine or daily doxycycline (and in special cases daily malarone,
though this is an unlicensed use); (ii) travellers must be aware that any
fever or flu-like illness within 3 months of travel requires urgent medical
attention and may be falciparum malaria; and (iii) primary care doctors
need to be alert to the possibility of malaria, always take a travel
history of febrile (or history of fever) patients and take prompt action.
