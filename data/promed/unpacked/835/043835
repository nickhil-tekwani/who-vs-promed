The State Secretary of Health, through the Direction for Sanitary
Services issued an alert, because of a food poisoning outbreak
affecting at least 40 persons after eating cake, reported Dr Jose
Bustamante-Moreno, State Health Secretary. He commented that in the
Mexicali municipality, a food poisoning outbreak occurred after some
people ate cakes from a well-known local bakery. Personnel from the
Direction for Sanitary Services went to that facility in order to take
samples, since no cause is known (yet) for this occurrence.

He mentioned that the 40 people of every age group developed symptoms
such as fever, malaise, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 4 of them were
hospitalized, and the remaining had already been discharged from the
Mexicali General Hospital and from the local Mexican Social Security
Hospital, since their outcome was satisfactory.

Dr Bustamante-Moreno indicated that, because of this outbreak, the
Direction for Sanitary Services immobilized the product in every sales
point in Mexicali.

[In order to better assess the etiology of this foodborne cluster of
illness, it is important to know the kind of pies that are implicated,
the incubation period from ingestion of the alleged vehicle to onset
of symptoms and the length of illness. ProMED-mail awaits additional
information regarding this outbreak. - Mod.LL]
