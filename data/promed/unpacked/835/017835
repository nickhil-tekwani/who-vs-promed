Epidemic puts shrimp farmers in a tizzy
---------------------------------------
Shrimp farmers are concerned, as disease outbreaks continue to plague the
farms along the East Coast, from Tamil Nadu to Orissa.
Shrimp seeds, which were stocked in farm during January and February 2003,
have been completely wiped out, while those stocked in mid-March are
showing about 50 percent survival, according to farm sources.
Meanwhile, arrivals to the markets are low except for the smaller shrimp,
which are available following panic harvest by farmers concerned by disease
problems in the farms.
When a disease outbreak is reported in farms within 40-50 days of stocking
with shrimp seeds, the farmers opt for distress harvest.
[It has been suggested that] the main problem is the failure of the rains.
The water level in the creeks is down, and there has not been proper
flushing of the water systems. Therefore, bacterial load has increased,
according to farm sources.
Viral infection has also been noticed in the broodstocks (the mother prawns
used for obtaining the shrimp seeds). This has [damaged] the quality of
shrimp seeds.
Japan has not been picking up stocks in the market primarily because of
quality problems, according to some of the buyers. They are not willing to
predict when the purchases are likely to pick up.
Meanwhile, due to the indefinite strike announced by the transporters,
arrivals of inputs to the farms and seed sales by the hatcheries had been
delayed. With most of the farms having completed stocking activity in March
and most hatcheries out of production, the impact had been restricted to
the few hatcheries that were in operation, the sources said.
Sales to Kolkata and Andhra Pradesh from the hatcheries on the East Coast
Road had been down. If the strike was not lifted in the next few days they
could suffer losses. Normally, about one million shrimp seeds were
air-lifted to Kolkata every day, they said.

[From the information provided, it is not clear whether the economic losses
of the major shrimp industry on the eastern shores of India, along the Bay
of Bengal, are the outcome of environmental/climatic conditions or caused
by disease. Most likely, a combination of both factors is
responsible. Further information on the described syndrome will be
appreciated.
The OIE's Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases - 2000 covers 6
shrimp diseases, of which 3 are notifiable (Taura syndrome, White spot
disease, and Yellowhead disease). 3 additional diseases [Tetrahedral
baculovirosis (_Baculovirus penaei_), Spherical baculovirosis (_Penaeus
monodon-type baculovirus_), and Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic
necrosis virus] are described there as well, under the title "other
significant diseases."
