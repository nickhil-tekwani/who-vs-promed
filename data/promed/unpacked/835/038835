San Juan health authorities have confirmed 7 cases of St. Louis
encephalitis [SLE] [virus infection], an acute viral disease that
affects the central nervous system and that is transmitted by
mosquitoes that bite doves, pigeons, sparrows and chickens. The public
health service recommends that the populace prevent the proliferation
of these insects.

The diagnoses began to be reported 20 days previously and yesterday
[19 Apr 2011] the government managed, through the laboratory of the
National Institute of Epidemiology, to confirm the 7th case of the
disease, which causes inflammation of the brain after patients present
with high fever.

The provincial director of epidemiology, Frida Capato, asks the
population to be calm and take the same measures that govern
prevention for avoidance of proliferation of the mosquito that
transmits dengue. These include the use of bed nets, and avoiding
accumulation of water in catchments, and the use of repellants. [The
avoidance of mosquito bites in general is the only practical measure
to avoid infection by SLE virus. The breeding sites and biting
behavior of the mosquito that transmits dengue viruses, _Aedes
aegypti_ are very different from the _Culex_ species that transmit SLE
virus. - Mod.TY]

This most recent patient affected [by the disease] is a man from San
Juan who is currently "under observation and [whose] health is in good
condition," according to the provincial Ministry of Health.

Spokespeople from that agency stated that St. Louis [encephalitis]
virus is transmitted by the _Culex pipiens_ mosquito to people, and is
not spread [directly] from person to person. After infection [is
initiated], a person may or may not develop the disease, depending on
their defenses and antibodies that they have. [Only a small proportion
of individuals go on to develop encephalitis when infected with SLE
virus, with the elderly being disproportionally affected. Pre-existing
antibodies antibodies to other flaviviruses (the family to which SLE
virus belongs) found in Argentina are unlikely to provide significant
cross-protection against SLE virus infections. - Mod.TY].

In March [2011], the death of a person was investigated whose
diagnosis was similar to the infection caused by St. Louis
[encephalitis] virus, but the death of this patient having been due to
this type of encephalitis was not officially confirmed.

At the beginning of 2010, the national Ministry of Health reported 4
cases of St. Louis encephalitis [virus infection] within the Buenos
Aires city and province [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100402.1051].

The disease that this virus causes includes, as main symptoms,
headache, high fever, dizziness and nausea. Most of the cases
recuperate spontaneously, although some develop central nervous system
infection.

Given the situation, various San Juan [governmental] departments
initiated fumigation to combat mosquitoes in the areas where the
infected people were found. The sources in the health area stated that
the insect "bites virus-infected birds and later transmits it to the
people," which is why the use of repellants is insisted upon [along
with] window screens in the houses.

The virus is present throughout the American continent and the last
reported outbreak in the country was in 2005 [but there were a few
cases in 2010, as mentioned above. - Mod.TY].

[The number of individuals with SLE virus infections and encephalitis
in San Juan is not clear. The previous report of 5 Apr 2011
(ProMED-mail archive no. 20110406.1074) indicated that there were 16
suspected and 5 confirmed cases. Perhaps most or all of the suspected
cases have been discarded subsequently as not due to SLE virus
infections. ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing the current
number of confirmed and suspected cases. Apparently, there are now 2
additional confirmed cases since the 5 confirmed cases that were
reported earlier.
