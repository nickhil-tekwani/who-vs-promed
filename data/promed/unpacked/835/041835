Report: Delhi polo season scrapped
----------------------------------
In a big blow to Indian polo, the prestigious Delhi polo season has
been scrapped after 2 ponies were diagnosed as carrying the EIA or
Equine Infectious Anemia virus. To prevent the disease from
spreading, the infected area has to be quarantined for 90 days and
the infected horses have to be put down.

Delhi was set to stage 3 tournaments in February with a combined
sponsorship of over Rs one crore.

But despite the disappointment of missing the Delhi season, players
are thrilled that 3 tournaments will be held at Jaipur as
compensation.

[According to India's (2003) annual report to the OIE, the last year
in which equine infectious anaemia (EIA) occurred there was 1996.

Until recently, EIA belonged to OIE's list B diseases, and had to be
included in member-countries' annual reports. Following the recent
amalgamation of lists A and B, it will have to be reported at least
twice a year.

EIA is caused by a lentivirus and can be diagnosed on the basis of
clinical signs, pathological lesions, and serology. Infected horses
can remain viraemic carriers for life and will yield a positive
serological result. Antibody response usually persists and
antibody-positive animals older than 6 months are identified as virus
carriers For further background, see moderator's commentary in
