UNDIAGNOSED RESPIRATORY DISEASE, EQUINE - ICELAND: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Iceland's national horse festival, the Landsmot, will continue as
scheduled despite an outbreak of a yet undiagnosed infectious
respiratory disease, according to a statement from the Landsmot's
executive committee and a veterinary official. The country's
preliminary breeding shows, currently in progress, will also continue
as planned. However, additional breeding shows may be organized later
for horses that are too ill to compete in the regular program. "Horse
owners are encouraged to keep the well-being of their horses in mind
and refrain from attending breeding shows and qualifications with
sick horses," the statement read.

The decision was made in Skagafjorathur during a 7 May 2010 meeting
between the executive committee and Sigriathur Bjornsdottir, DVM,
PhD, Veterinary Officer for Horse Diseases at Icelandic Food and
Veterinary Authority (MAST).

Characterized primarily by a dry cough, the respiratory disease
causes weakness and sometimes nasal drainage, shortness of breath,
or, in more severe cases, fever. Symptoms can continue up to 6 weeks,
according to a fact sheet provided by MAST.

"It is not possible to stop the epidemic," Bjornsdottir said.
"Because it has such mild symptoms, it was already widespread when
reported to official veterinarians." The disease is particularly
common among riding horses because they are stabled with other
horses, she added.

Although the source of the infection has not yet been identified, the
most likely agent is a virus that is sometimes accompanied by a
bacterial infection, according to Bjornsdottir. Most known epidemics
have been ruled out, as well as any connection to the ash and gases
emitted by the 14 Apr 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull. "I can
confirm that equine influenza, equine herpesvirus, and rhinoviruses
have been excluded, and it has no relation to the volcanic eruption," she said.

The infection has spread rapidly since the 1st cases were reported in
early April 2010, leading veterinarians to believe this is a new
disease to Iceland, according to the MAST fact sheet. "This suggests
that the entire horse population is sensitive to infection, and
therefore, (there is) probably a new infectious agent involved in
this country," it read.

[Sounds like the equine version of Kennel Cough. While one might
expect that few horses from outside Iceland may have gone to this
event because of the ongoing volcanic activity, it would be wise if
any such horses are quarantined on their return. - Mod.MHJ]
