The following presentation on the updated entomological aspects of the
current BTV-8 epizootic in Europe, deserves the attention of subscribers. -

R Meiswinkel, C Staubach, E Dijkstra, P Leijs. Overview of the bluetongue
situation in Europe with emphasis on the _Culicoides_ vectors. presentation
given at the 2nd International Disease Control Workshop, Brussels, 18 Oct 2007
-----------------------------------------
a. Marked changes in vector abundances
1. In southern Holland in 2006 _C. dewulfi_ comprised 17 per cent of the
midges captured (and _C. obsoletus_ 68 per cent); the reverse occurred this
year [2007] with _C. dewulfi_ now dominant. If this applied elsewhere in
northern Europe then it might partly explain the intensity of the outbreak
this season.
2. There is no explanation for the increased abundances of _C. dewulfi_ and
may have been the case also in 2006 (but occurred before entomological
monitoring was implemented).
3. Nevertheless, the Obsoletus Complex has remained the most widespread
vector in 2007. Therefore, like in 2006, 2 or more species of _Culicoides_
appear to be driving the epidemic forward.
4. Like last year [2006], _C. pulicaris_ has NOT once been dominant in
collections.
5. _C. imicola_ has NOT been found amongst more than 500 000 _Culicoides_
captured. In a sense this is dire news demonstrating that _Culicoides_
endemic to Europe can disseminate BTV and on a vast scale.

b. The revelation that vector species are also diurnally active raises 2
points
1. Is BTV being transmitted during the day when animals are still at pasture?
2. Given this possibility, is it sufficient to monitor for _Culicoides_
using blacklight traps only?

c. The attack of livestock by day and at night, both indoors and outdoors,
complicates our fight against BT, and at this juncture vector control holds
little promise in our quest to halt the spread of the disease.

Conclusions
-----------
1. In 2007 BT continued to spread and included a jump across the English
Channel. The BT restriction zone now covers an area of almost one million
sq/km (386 102 sq/mi).
2. There are no obvious geographical or topographic boundaries that might
halt the dramatic advance of BTV-8. This makes it likely that it will
continue to spread in 2008 (and beyond) until it reaches the (as yet
unknown) limits of its range.
3. This is daunting when it is considered that vector _Culicoides_ (and
ruminant hosts) occur across the entire Holarctic Region.
4. The Holarctic includes the Mediterranean Basin where _C. imicola_ lies
in wait, and North America, where outbreaks of BT and epizootic
haemorrhagic disease of deer virus (EHDV) (another _Culicoides_-borne
pathogen) are occurring also.
5. Warmer winters in future will add to the conundrum by promoting rather
than suppressing virus survival and vector longevity.

re: Bluetongue - Europe (49): BTV-8, Switzerland: correction
------------------------------------------------------------
The farm is NOT located in the Canton of Bern but in the Canton of Basel.
It is a mixed dairy and beef holding.

The cow, which I had seen, had typical BT symptoms and was in bad
condition. The other animals did not show any clinical symptoms. 5 of them
had been virus and antibody positive.
