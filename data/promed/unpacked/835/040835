Indeed the list of differential diagnoses is large, but as the ProMED-mail
moderator said the description of this case is nearly pathognomonic. We've
never seen a tickbite eschar with the dimensions of a finger, with
surrounding edema; and we have seen at least a few patients each year with
African Tick Fever in our institute.

The serology for _Rickettsia conori_, _R. mooseri_, _Bartonella henselae_
and _B. quintana_ were negative. We have multiple serum samples and await
the anthrax serology. We may consider the specific serology for _R.
africae_, but there is nearly always positive cross-reactivity
An example of a long list is given by:

Differential diagnosis of eschar and ulceration:
A common initial diagnosis is that of a pruritic and papular arthropod bite
in the majority of patients. Once an ulcer or eschar develops, the
differential diagnosis includes:
. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ulcers
. Aspergillosis
. Brown recluse spider bite
. Coumadin necrosis
. Ecthyma gangrenosum
. Factitial ulcer
. Glanders
. Heparin necrosis
. Leishmaniasis, cutaneous
. Mucormycosis
. Orf/milker's nodule
. Plague
. Rat bite fever
. Rickettsial pox
. Staphylococcal/streptococcal ecthyma
. Tropical ulcer
. Tularemia
. Typhus, scrub and tick
Bites by spiders of the genus _Loxosceles_ have been implicated as a cause
of necrotic arachnidism, also in Africa -- but here is a very instructive
story highly resembling our case (see the picture at <http://www.nejm.org>)
N Engl J Med, Vol. 345, No. 22 -- November 29, 2001 1611
A 7-month-old male infant was hospitalized with a 2-day history of swelling
of the left arm and a weeping lesion at the left elbow (Panel A). The
patient was afebrile but had a 2-cm open sore with surrounding erythema and
induration that oozed clear yellow fluid. There was non-tender swelling and
erythema of the entire arm. The white-cell count was 28 100 per cubic
millimeter. Incision and drainage of the lesion produced 10 ml of dark red
fluid. A coronal, T1-weighted sequence from a magnetic resonance imaging
study (Panel B) demonstrated diffuse, severe edema of the subcutaneous
tissues extending from the shoulder to the hand. The working diagnosis was
_Loxosceles reclusa_ spider bite with superimposed cellulitis.
The child was treated with ampicillin-sulbactam and clindamycin. He had
been at his mother's office at a television network 3 days before
admission, 2 weeks after the destruction of the World Trade Center in New
York. After anthrax exposure was reported at another television network, 2
punch biopsies of the lesion were performed. Polymerase chain reaction and
immunostaining for _Bacillus anthracis_ were positive. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.

neatly demonstrates how an young infant brought into the office by its
mother and in being passed from cuddle to cuddle was infected. - Mod.MHJ]

Cutaneous anthrax in Lima, Peru: retrospective analysis of 71 cases,
including 4 with a meningoencephalic complication.

Anthrax is a zoonosis produced by _Bacillus anthracis_, and as a human
infection is endemic in several areas in the world, including Peru. More
than 95 percent of the reported naturally acquired infections are
cutaneous, and approximately 5 percent of them can progress to
meningoencephalitis. In this study we review the clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of the patients with diagnosis of cutaneous
anthrax evaluated between 1969 and 2002 at the Hospital Nacional Cayetano
Heredia (HNCH) and the Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von
Humboldt in Lima, Peru.
71 patients were included [49/71 (69 percent) of them men], with a mean age
of 37 years. The diagnoses were classified as definitive (44 percent) or
probable (56 percent). The most common occupation of the patients was
agriculture (39 percent). The source of infection was found in 63 (88.7
percent) patients. All the patients had ulcerative lesions, with a central
necrosis. Most of the patients (65 percent) had several lesions, mainly
located in the upper limbs (80 percent). 4 patients (5.6 percent) developed
meningoencephalitis, and 3 of them eventually died.
In conclusion, considering its clinical and epidemiological
characteristics, cutaneous anthrax must be included in the differential
diagnosis of skin ulcers. A patient with clinical suspicion of the disease
should receive effective treatment soon, in order to avoid neurological
complications, which carry a high fatality rate.

[Meningoencephalitis is commonly underdiagnosed in human anthrax. It is far
more frequent than the literature would indicate. Serology in humans is
rather touch-and-go as antibiotic treatment can limit antibody responses
significantly, which is odd, as humans need a big dose to infect but are
then very sensitive to the toxins.
We also had a similar but shorter communication from Dr. Maurilio Bruni.
While I may sometimes appear to be a one-trick pony and my clinical skills
are admittedly slight, I do not regard all black eschars as the lesion in
anthrax. The inflammation, vesicles, edema, and lack of pain associated
with the initial lesion are the collective signs that get my attention. My
reason for posting this is that cutaneous anthrax is under-diagnosed and
under-reported. I much appreciate Drs Van Gompel & Bruni's responses. -
