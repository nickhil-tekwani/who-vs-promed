The 1st ever case of leptospirosis has been reported from the
[Belgaum] district. According to sources in the district surveillance
department, a patient from Mamadapur village in Chikkodi taluk [a town
in the Belgaum district], who is undergoing treatment in Kolhapur
district government hospital in Maharashtra [a neighboring Indian
state to the north], has tested positive for the disease.

The number of patients with rat fever [leptospirosis] in the state
[Kerala] is on the rise. There are as many as 11 with rat fever
according to the update on 5 Jul [2011].

The health services director has warned against washing and bathing
in murky waters and has instructed the use of gloves and socks for
animal caretakers and agricultural workers to prevent the spread of
rat fever. They have also been directed to take a weekly preventive
medicine [doxycycline], which is available at the primary health
centres, free of cost. The symptoms of rat fever are high fever,
headache, body ache, red eyes, and muscle cramps.

Pregnant women, affected with fever, should consult a doctor at the
earliest [opportunity] and get the appropriate treatment. Those with
kidney trouble, liver functioning problems, and diabetes have also
been advised utmost caution.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by exposure to _Leptospira_
bacteria, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has
been contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of
the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira
interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs
for this organism.

The symptoms in humans appear after a 3-14 day incubation period.
Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made
confidently without laboratory confirmation. The news release from
Kerala above fails to note if the diagnosis of leptospirosis was
confirmed in any of the 11 cases.

The disease occurs worldwide and frequently follows flooding after
heavy rains. Karnataka, and the neighboring state of Kerala to the
south, are located on the south west coast of India. They are subject
to the southwestern summer monsoons, which begin around the 1st of
June (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon). In fact, heavy rain has
been reported in this region with a flooding alert in Kerala this week
(http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4531:heavy-rain-in-tamil-nadu-and-kerala-flood-alert-issued&catid=125:general-news&Itemid=400,
and
http://www.deccanherald.com/content/4084/karnataka-set-near-normal-monsoon.html).

Karnataka is heavily involved in the cultivation of sugar cane and is
one of the largest producers of sugar in India. Leptospirosis is also
known as canecutter's disease or sugar cane fever, because of the
spread of the disease by canefield rats. The news release from
Karnataka does not specify if the confirmed case in that state was a
sugar cane field worker.

Doxycycline in a single 200 mg oral dose, (or weekly, in cases of
prolonged exposure) has been used to prevent leptospirosis in exposed
people. The single dose of doxycycline is thought to provide
protection for about a week. However, different clinical trials to
assess the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis of leptospirosis have had
conflicting results
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no6/02-0751.htm,
http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/40553-Doxycycline-chemoprophylaxis-for-leptospirosis-a-brief-review).

The results of one randomized placebo-controlled trial study
indicated that doxycycline prophylaxis did not prevent leptospiral
infection in an endemic area during a seasonal outbreak, but had a
significant protective effect in reducing the morbidity and mortality
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10755239). Another randomized
placebo-controlled study of US soldiers training in Panama
demonstrated a 95 per cent protective efficacy with a weekly dose of
200 mg doxycycline for 3 weeks, compared to placebo (Takafuji ET et
al: An efficacy trial of doxycycline chemoprophylaxis against
leptospirosis. N Engl J Med. 1984; 310(8): 497-500; abstract available
at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805).

A Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking
doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials,
which "targeted different kinds of people -- travellers and people who
live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students,"
"did not support the practice in all cases, though short term
travellers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped."
