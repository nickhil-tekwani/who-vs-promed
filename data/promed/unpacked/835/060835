One new death of pig-borne endemic reported in Sichuan
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll of the pig-borne endemic in southwest China's Sichuan
Province had reached 37 as of Tue 2 Aug 2005, with one new death
reported, according to the Chinese Ministry of Health. Although no
new cases were reported, 8 retrospective cases were found. Among
them, 5 were confirmed and 3 suspected, said the ministry in a latest
report.
The province has so far reported 205 cases of swine _Streptococcus
suis_ type 2, with 159 confirmed and 46 suspected. 18 people have
been discharged from the hospital, and 29 others are in critical
condition.
The endemic broke out late in June 2005 and has now been pinpointed
in 10 cities, including Ziyang, Jianyang, Neijiang and the provincial
capital Chengdu. All the patients had direct contact with ill or dead
pigs.

[The total number of cases reported is now 205. - Mod.LL]
[From the perspective of a researcher in human streptococcal
infection, this emergence of _Streptococcus suis_ infection in humans
resembles the outbreaks of group B streptococcal infection that
emerged in human neonates during the 1970s and then in debilitated
adults in the 1980s. Both instances remain unexplained. Indeed, _S.
suis_ resembles group B streptococcus (_S. agalactiae_) in many
respects. Both are encapsulated hemolytic streptococci that have
propensity to cause bacteremia and meningitis in newborns after
exposure to the organism in vaginal secretions. Most newborns remain
asymptomatically colonized but in a minority progress serious
infection including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia and localized
infections. Both organisms remain susceptible to beta-lactam
antibiotics and, in humans, control of the infection has been largely
achieved by use of antibiotic prophylaxis of maternal carriers of
group B strep. during childbirth.
Diagnosis of _S. suis_ infection in both pigs and humans is based
upon culture of the organism from normally sterile sites and should
not be difficult. Clinical details from the current outbreak (both
from the pigs and the humans) are thus far lacking and it is
therefore difficult to assess whether some co-infection (or other
co-morbidity) may be accounting for this unprecedented cluster of
human disease. - Mod.LM]
