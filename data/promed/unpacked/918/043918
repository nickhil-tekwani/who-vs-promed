Man's arrest uncovers horse with Eastern equine encephalitis
------------------------------------------------------------
The arrest of a Columbia County [Florida] man who deputies said failed to properly care for several horses on his property has led to health officials issuing a mosquito-borne illness advisory. [The owner] was arrested Friday [1 Aug 2014] at the property on Northwest The Lords Court. [He] was booked into the Columbia County Detention Facility on 2 counts of animal cruelty and 9 counts of animal neglect. He was being held on USD 65 000. The horses were seized and impounded so they could receive proper care.

Deputies said their investigation began in mid-July [2014] when they were called to an address to check on horses that had wandered onto the neighboring property looking for water. Detectives said they found several horses suffering from illnesses such as "dew poisoning" and "rain rot." Deputies said one horse had injuries consistent with being caught in a fence and required medical attention, and another one was down with an unknown debilitating illness.

A veterinarian responded and evaluated the injured and downed horse, then took a blood sample. The veterinarian said the horse was suffering and recommended it be euthanized.

The blood sample revealed the horse had Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. It cannot be transmitted horse to horse or horse to human. Another horse in Columbia County has also tested positive for EEE this year [2014].

Although EEE is a health risk to humans, the disease is extremely rare in the U.S., with 5 to 10 cases reported annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of EEE in humans may include headache, fever, fatigue, dizziness, weakness and confusion. Physicians should contact the local county health department if they suspect an individual may have a mosquito-borne disease.

[Florida has a constant EEE problem and a very active program to encourage horse owners to vaccinate their horses. Unfortunately the owner of these horses was not so inclined. It will cost him.
