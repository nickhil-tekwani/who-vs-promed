An unprecedented outbreak of _Cryptococcus gattii_ genotype amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) 6/VGII on Vancouver Island,
British Columbia, Canada, is affecting both human and animal hosts
with normal immunity (1-3). So far, more than 100 human cases,
including at least 6 fatalities, have been reported by the British
Columbia Centre for Disease Control (4), (<http://www.bccdc.org>,
<http://www.cbc.ca>). Vancouver Island is a major tourist
destination, with about 7.5 million visits each year
(<http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca>). We report the first known
intercontinental transmission of _C. gattii_ from this outbreak in a
tourist from Denmark who visited Vancouver Island. This case
indicates a potential risk for tourism-related acquisition.
A 51-year-old, HIV-negative, apparently immunocompetent man from
Denmark, with known psoriatic gout and under treatment with a
nonsteroidial antiinflammatory drug, was admitted to a hospital in
Herning, Denmark, with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and
arm, lasting for one day. Six weeks before his admission, he returned
to Denmark from a 3-week trip to Canada, during which he visited
Victoria and surrounding areas on the eastern coast of Vancouver
Island for 7 days. During their stay, the patient and his 3 fellow
travelers visited gardens and studied the local natural vegetation.
During his stay in Canada, the patient had no symptoms, and symptoms
had not developed in any of his family members as of October 2006. On
admission to the hospital, his temperature was 38.2 degrees C [100.76
F], and a chest radiograph showed 3 large nodular infiltrates suspect
for malignancy or abscesses. Neither bacterial nor fungal pathogens
could be isolated from sputum by classic and molecular methods. After
4-5 days, his temperature was 40 degrees C [104 F], a productive
cough with dyspnea was noted, and his condition deteriorated. A chest
radiograph showed progression of the infiltrates, and a computed
tomography scan of the abdomen and chest showed infiltrates near the
pleura, suggesting encapsulated fluid [For figure see original URL -
Mod.LL]. An ultrasound-guided lung biopsy was performed, and mucoid
material was aspirated. Microscopy and a culture from the aspirate
showed a cryptococcal isolate. This isolate was further identified by
internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 sequencing, as well as
amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis (2). In addition,
detailed genotyping was performed by using sequences of 7 genes (IGS,
CAP10, GPD1, LAC1, MPD1, PLB1, and TEF1; GenBank accession nos.
DQ861593-DQ861599) (5).
Extensive molecular research showed that this isolate belonged to the
highly virulent AFLP genotype 6A (VGIIa) of _Cryptococcus gattii_,
which is the major genotype involved in the Vancouver Island _C.
gattii_ outbreak (1-4). All 7 sequenced genes had a complete match
with the sequence types specific for isolates involved in the
Vancouver Island outbreak (5). Thus, we conclude that the pathogen
was acquired during the patient's visit to Vancouver Island and
imported to Denmark. The presence of 3 cryptococcal masses of more or
less equal size suggests that the patient was exposed to a high
concentration of infectious cells of _C. gattii_. The observed
incubation time of 6 weeks is shorter than that was previously
reported for infections related to the Vancouver Island outbreak
(2-11 mo) (4). These observations, in combination with the absence of
any known predisposing factor in this patient, such as smoking or
treatment with corticosteroids, suggest that this specific AFLP6
genotype of _C. gattii_ is highly virulent (4,5).
This case suggests a potential risk of tourists acquiring
cryptococcosis while visiting Vancouver Island. Therefore, we
recommend tourists and medical staff of healthcare centers worldwide
be alert for symptoms of cryptococcosis after travel to Vancouver Island.

[_Cryptococcus neoformans_ is a pathogenic fungus that infects most
prominently the central nervous system. A sexual cycle involving
haploid cells of mating types seems to produce varieties (_C.
neoformans_ var. _neoformans_, serotype D, and _C. neoformans_ var.
_gattii_, serotypes B and C) and _C. neoformans_ var. _grubii_,
serotype A. The _gattii_ variant has been elevated to a species
level as _C. gattii_). _C. gattii_ had been found only in tropical
and subtropical areas and, unlike _neoformans_ and _grubii_,
generally causes disease in individuals who are not immunoincompetent.
_C. gattii_ serotype B infection has a strikingly higher incidence
rate compared with _C. neoformans_ in parts of Australia especially
in the Northern Territory (a subtropical/tropical climate area) and
in South Australia (a temperate area) (1). Isolates obtained from
the woody debris of eucalyptus trees (including _E. camaldulensis_)
appear to be identical to human isolates (2). Prior to this cluster
in Canada, human infections with _C. gattii_ have been described from
Australia as well as Papua New Guinea, USA (California) and parts of
Africa, India, southeastern Asia, Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay (3) and
infections in animals have involved cats, dogs, horses, and porpoises
as well as Australian marsupials.
The development of this cluster of Vancouver-related cases of _C.
gatti_ 2-11 months after exposure to the area (4) was described in
British Columbians who were non-residents of Vancouver following
discrete exposures to this region and this report expands the scope
to travelers from other parts of the world.
Why the outbreak began is not clearly established but has been
postulated to be related to global warming. However, a publication
by Fraser and colleagues (5) has suggested that the Vancouver strain
has a mutation dramatically increasing the mating efficacy of the
haploid yeast and enabling mating with otherwise "sterile" isolates.
This seemingly recent recombinant event may be responsibile for an
increased number of clinical isolates.
