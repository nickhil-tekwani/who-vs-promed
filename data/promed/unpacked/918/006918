A child who contracted the highly infectious Ebola-like Marburg virus in Ghana has died, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday [2 Aug 2022]. The death brings the total number of fatalities in the country to 3 since Ghana registered its first ever outbreak of the disease last month [July 2022].

The outbreak is only the second in West Africa. The first ever case of the virus in the region was detected last year [2021] in Guinea.

The virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with bodily fluids, surfaces and materials, WHO said.

The dead child, whose gender or age were not disclosed, was one of 2 new cases reported last week by WHO. "Last week I mentioned the 2 additional cases. One is the wife of the index case and the other one is the child of the index case and the child unfortunately died, but the wife is still alive and improving," WHO doctor Ibrahima Soce Fall told reporters. The Ghanaian health ministry has only reported 3 confirmed cases and further testing remains to be done on a 4th suspected case, Soce Fall said.

The first 2 cases, in southern Ghana's Ashanti region, both had symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, nausea and vomiting, before dying in hospital, WHO said previously.

[This unfortunate family was a cluster of 3 cases, one of whom, a child, has died. As with Ebola virus outbreaks, interfamily transmission is a risk especially as in the Ghana situation Marburg virus is new and likely not known to the populace. One hopes that the active surveillance under way and public awareness will stop this small outbreak.

As noted above and in the previous post, this is not the first time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the first confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman BR, Bird H, Bakarr IA, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be included among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
