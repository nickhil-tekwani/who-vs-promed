Vampire bats carry an infectious bacteria that is potentially deadly to humans, warns a new study. Researchers found that many carry bartonella bacteria that cause endocarditis, a potentially life-threatening illness in humans and domestic animals. The findings, published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [see reference below], show that common vampire bats in Latin America are frequently infected by bartonella. And their subsistence on blood creates a risk for bacterial transmission from bats to humans and livestock.

The researchers found that bartonella infections in vampire bats are highly prevalent in Peru and Belize, and that bartonella genotypes are distributed widely, rather than clustered geographically. Previous studies have suggested that vampire bats may be a source of bartonella infections among humans. But little was known about the bats' individual risk of infection, the genetic diversity of bartonella bacteria in bat populations, and how the bacteria may be transmitted among bats or to other species.

Over 2 years, the researchers collected blood, saliva, and faecal samples from vampire bats across Belize and Peru. Samples were then tested to ascertain how many bats were infected. Individual risk factors for infection were identified by analysing the relationship between bat age, sex, forearm size, and reproductive status. Samples testing positive for bartonella were then subjected to genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to shed light on possible bacteria transmission routes.

Two out of every 3 tested bats (67 per cent) were found to be bartonella carriers, with the highest risk of infection in large males. Bacterial genotypes were widely distributed across Central and South America.

The researchers also investigated how bartonella might spread between individuals. While _Bartonella_ spp are often transmitted by biting arthropods, vampire bat saliva, and fecal samples were also found to be positive for bartonella, suggesting the possibility that transmission could occur through bites or environmental contamination.

While the preliminary results provide insights into the infection rate among vampire bats and the genetic diversity of bat-endemic bartonella, study lead author Dr Daniel Becker, of Montana State University in the US, said further study is necessary. Dr Becker added: "Given the high rates of vampire bat bites and proximity to humans, and domestic animals, such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures would elucidate bartonella transmission dynamics in this common host species and the risks of cross-species transmission.

PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018; 12(9): e0006786. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006786; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0006786.

_Bartonella_ spp are usually transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. For example, _B. henselae_ utilizes fleas for cat-to-cat transmission, _B. quintana_ is vectored by lice, and _B. bacilliformis_ by sand flies. This finding suggests vampire bats may act as non-arthropod vectors of these pathogens.

There are 3 species of hematophagous bat in the neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses.

This research shows that there is high risk of bartonella infection following a vampire bat bite, and therefore more preventive actions should accompany the vaccination against rabies. - Mod.PMB
