The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) confirms a wild deer has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD).

The DNR says the deer was an adult buck harvested in the Town of Port Edwards [Wood County] during the 2020 gun-deer season and tested as part of the department's disease surveillance efforts.

"Unfortunately, I wasn't necessarily surprised by the announcement we found the 1st in Wood County, we've seen it pop up in surrounding counties Marathon, Adams, Juneau, and Portage in recent years so it wasn't necessarily unexpected but it is obviously disappointing to continue to see that spread," said Ryan Hafele a Wildlife Area Supervisor for the DNR.

He says there were 19 348 deer tested statewide in 2019 for CWD, and of that 1338 tested positive for the disease.

Due to the deer's location, the DNR is renewing bating and feeding bans in Juneau, Adams, and Wood counties, as required by law. The law requires the ban in counties or portions of counties within a 10-mile [16-km] radius of the deer testing positive for CWD.

The DNR says it will continue surveillance near the CWD positive detection location.

[We have had several reports recently of the spread of CWD in counties previously believed to be free of the disease. It continues to be disappointing to see the spread of this devastating neurological disease in the cervids.

Previously feeding bans have been enacted to attempt to lessen the spread of the disease, as it is thought it could spread between community feeding and close contact of deer, and the associated snorting, salivating, jostling, etc.
