About the alleged large-scale outbreak of the disease caused by Schmallenberg virus in Estonia
-------------------------------------
According to obtained information, lambs with congenital malformations, characteristic of the disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus, have been recorded in Estonia.

As known, the virus is widespread in the EU, which has not taken any measures to control and eradicate the disease. Moreover, since the end of May 2012 the virus was officially declared endemic in the EU countries in which the disease was initially reported. Since no official SBV reports are required, information about the SBV situation is no longer accessible.

Rosselkhoznadzor has reason to believe that undeclared outbreaks occurred in other European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Since introduction of breeding animals, infected with SBV, from Austria to Russia and Kazakhstan has been monitored while the EU veterinary services are inactive, this strongly suggests an increased risk of introduction of the virus into the territory of the Customs Union.

Rosselkhoznadzor considers it necessary to request information from the veterinary services of a number of EU countries, including Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, about the detection of SBV cases in these countries. Information is requested on the measures used in the case of seropositive and PCR-positive animals, and on the control exercised upon the movement of animals from countries or regions in which SBV is detected.

[The final report of the last General session of the OIE, Paris, May 2012, includes the following statement (art 244):

"The Director General thanked all the countries affected by SBV for notifying infections, in a timely manner, as an emerging disease. After end of May 2012, affected Member Countries that so desired could send a final report and consider the disease endemic*. The information published by the OIE on the safe trade of commodities and animals would be further updated as more information became available. More scientific research was needed on SBV and other viruses in the same family found in other countries of the world.

"He reminded the Assembly that revised criteria for the listing of diseases were being presented for adoption at the present General Session, indicating that this disease would not be eligible for the listing according to these revised criteria. After end of May 2012, affected Member Countries that so desired could send a final report and consider the disease endemic. The information published by the OIE on the safe trade of commodities and animals would be further updated as more information became available. More scientific research was needed on SBV and other viruses in the same family found in other countries of the world."

*The following 9 European countries, which initially notified SBV as an emerging disease, have submitted final reports in which they declared that the event was resolved and that no more reports will be submitted:

Country/ date final report/ Total outbreaks as of date of final report
Belgium/ 22 May 2012/ 15
France/ 22 May 2012/ 1471
Germany/ 30 May 2012/ 1376
Italy/ 22 May 2012/ 1
Luxembourg/ 2 Apr 2012/ 12
Netherlands/ 1 Jun 2012/ 345
Spain/ 22 May 2012/ 1
Switzerland / 10 Aug 2012/ 19
UK/ 22 May 2012/ 266

Other countries known or believed at present to be SBV-infected are: Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. In Italy, Sardinia has been added with multiple outbreaks. Slovenia is suspected as well (see item 2 further).

The most recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) which had, on its agenda, SBV, was held in Brussels on 5 Jun 2012. The report of the said meeting included the following statement: "The importance for the EU to continue in its transparency policy was stressed and, therefore, Member States were encouraged to continue providing data to EFSA enabling the issuance of future updates by them." Such updates, if becoming publicly available (e.g., in EU's SBV web-site http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/schmallenberg_virus/index_en.htm) would have enhanced transparency.

EFSA published on Nov 2012 an analysis with an overview of the "SBV situation after 1 year" (reporting period from 1 Aug 2011 till 31 Jul 2012), together with an update of newly affected herds. The document was reviewed in posting 20121124.1422556. - Mod.AS]

Schmallenberg virus also prevalent in Slovenia
----------------------------------------------
The presence of Schmallenberg virus in sheep in Slovenia has been confirmed. This has been reported by the Veterinary Chamber. Schmallenberg Virus was 1st discovered in 2011 in Germany and since then the disease has spread rapidly in northern and western Europe.

Evidence that exposure to Schmallenberg virus has been quite widespread in Southern & South-eastern counties of Ireland during 2012
-----------------------------------------
Blood samples which had been collected for brucellosis testing from herds in all 26 counties since mid November [2012] were tested for antibodies to Schmallenberg virus [SBV] -- the presence of antibodies indicating previous exposure to the virus. In summary, 15 brucellosis-tested herds were randomly selected from each county and 6 animals were randomly selected from each of these herds. The results are illustrated in the map in Annex 2 below [see source url] and show a very marked regional distribution -- greatest exposure to the virus having occurred in Southern and South-Eastern counties with much less evidence of exposure in the North and West.

Blood samples from randomly-selected sheep flocks have also recently been tested for antibodies to SBV but these samples were collected in late Summer/early Autumn for other purposes, and with the exception of one flock in County Waterford, showed little evidence of exposure to the virus at that time. Taken together this preliminary data suggests that the greatest risk of exposure of flocks/herds to this virus during 2012 was in the South and East of the country and towards the end of the vector season.

What does this mean for herd and flock owners? Firstly it is important to emphasise that to date we have only confirmed 33 clinical cases despite the evidence of widespread exposure to the virus.

However there are now numerous reports from flock owners of malformed lambs being born to early lambing flocks in the South East and a small number of these affected lambs have been submitted to Kilkenny and Cork RVLs since Christmas. Typical malformations in lambs can be seen in the attached photograph which shows a lamb with stiff neck, bent limbs and shortening of the lower jaw. Problems with malformed calves and lambs are most likely to arise when pregnant cows and sheep are exposed to the virus during a critical time window in early to mid pregnancy (estimated to be 40-120 days gestation in cattle and 20-80 days gestation in sheep). As the time of exposure is uncertain it is too early to estimate what percentage of exposed herds/flocks are likely to have affected calves/lambs. Based on the pattern in the UK and elsewhere, between 4-6 percent of holdings are likely to be affected. In those holdings that are affected, the within-herd/flock impact in terms of deformities is likely to be mild in most cases at 2-5 percent of affected pregnancies, but moderate at worst.

The highest level of problems would be expected in herds that have synchronised breeding programmes and where large numbers of animals were infected during the critical period of pregnancy in 2012.

Herd/Flock owners will need to be extra vigilant as foetal malformations can give rise to significant lambing and calving difficulties with associated welfare problems. Farmers are advised that as malformed lambs and calves may be alive at birth they should seek appropriate advice from their veterinary surgeon.

Farmers who suspect they have problems caused by SBV should discuss with their veterinary surgeon what action they should take including the submission of samples, if appropriate, to the local Regional Veterinary Laboratory. Deformed lambs or calves can be tested for the presence of virus. Alternatively, blood or milk samples can be tested for antibodies to confirm that the cow (or
ewe) has been exposed to SBV.

Further spread to unaffected herds/flocks in northern and western counties is very likely to occur during the 2013 vector season but should have relatively little impact in non-pregnant livestock. It is generally impractical to attempt midge control measures except for valuable breeding stock and it would be hoped that a strategy of exposure of non-pregnant animals may in fact be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus/disease (Akabane virus infection) we would anticipate that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection [see comment]. Although vaccine development is in progress there is likely to be some delay before any candidate vaccine is licenced and becomes commercially available, but the Department will monitor developments closely.

[While the Australian experience with Akabane virus and its control is of paramount value, its applicability in Europe, in relation to SBV, might be in need of modifications. Where Akabane virus is constantly present, animals usually become infected before their 1st pregnancy; clinical signs do not occur in their offspring. Clinical cases are usually reported only from "virgin" areas or on the edge of endemic areas, following the introduction of infected vector arthropods. In Australia, the virus is endemic in the northern parts of the country, which are rather identical with the geographic distribution of the vector. Occasional outbreaks, sometimes of big dimensions, occur in southern Australia when conditions are favorable for infected vectors to spread, in certain years and in certain climatic conditions, from endemic to neighbouring, "clean" areas. Therefore, vaccination in Australia is generally limited to susceptible cattle in those border areas or to susceptible animals which have to be introduced into the endemically infected region.

It deserves also to be borne in mind that while the Akabane virus is regarded to be transmitted by vectors exclusively, there is preliminary, experimental evidence (pending further study) that SBV in Europe may be transmitted in semen as well.

In Poland, it was suspected that bulls, imported from an SBV-infected country, have introduced the virus into a receptive area by means of local potent vectors (20130121.1508180).

Several factors, including the SBV-vector profile, their distribution, and the determination of the SBV endemic territories as well as "receptive" areas where the vector is present but the virus not (yet), deserve to be clarified if vaccination is considered. - Mod.AS.]
