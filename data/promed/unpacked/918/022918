Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Republic of the Congo - WHO Update 6
-------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 27 Feb 2003, a total of 5 laboratory-confirmed and 92 probable
cases, including 80 deaths, from Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has been
reported in the districts of Mbomo and Kelle in Cuvette Ouest Region (see
previous report: <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_26/en/> ).
The Congolese government has sent food for the communities in these
districts. The Ministry of Health, WHO and the international team from the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are training local health
workers in clinical management of the disease; carrying out active case
finding and contact tracing; and providing protective clothing and
essential medical equipment: <http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/>
They are also developing public health education messages about Ebola fever
with local leaders through the local radio and print media, and, with
volunteers from the national Red Cross Society, working to increase
community awareness and understanding of Ebola fever.
