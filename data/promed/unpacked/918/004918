Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) of the cattle is reaching epidemic proportions in the [Tamil Nadu] State, leading to death of about 1200 bovines including buffalos. A shanty was closed in north-west Tamil Nadu and Animal Husbandry officials are working closely with local communities to contain the disease.

The situation is serious particularly in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai.

A senior Animal Husbandry department officer conceded that about 1200 cattle would have died in the State due to FMD outbreak. Erode, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Tiruvannamalai and Cuddalore districts are where the outbreak of FMD had been reported.

In the worst affected districts, about 8000 animals have been infected, of which approximately 500 cattle have succumbed.

Most of the affected animals have crossed the active infection stage.

When contacted, Animal Husbandry authorities said they have stepped up vigil in the districts where cattle mortalities were reported. Senior officers from the Animal Husbandry department are camping in Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts to coordinate efforts. Another officer from the Animal Husbandry department said in some of the places the local people were complaining about the death of their cattle, as rumors spread that the government had proposed to pay compensation to the cattle owners.

R. Parthasarathi, a cattle farmer from Kovankudi village near Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district said cattle had, in the past, survived FMD attacks.

But this time even the buffalos had become victims.

The spread of FMD appears to have begun in January this year [2013], and 2 months later about 10 cattle died in his village, Mr Parthasarathy said. In Tranquibar taluk alone, nearly 100 cattle died due to FMD [outbreak] in Poompuhar, Thirukkadaiyur, Aappur, Chembonarkoil, Aarupathi and Vilanagar villages. "Only in the last 20 days the problem has become very severe in the area," Mr Parthasarathi said.

In Tiruchi district, officials said they had vaccinated 310 000 heads of cattle since [15 Sep 2013], and the early intervention has largely contained the spread of the disease.

"The district Collector had instructed panchayat heads to coordinate with us and ensure that all cattle are vaccinated without much omission," said I. Chinnadurai, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry, Tiruchi.

In Erode, the district Collector V.K. Shanmugam on Wednesday [13 Nov 2013] ordered temporary suspension of weekly shandies for cows and goats, due to the outbreak of FMD. In the last one month in Erode, 24 deaths of cows have been officially recorded and 146 heads of cattle continue to suffer from the ailment in the district.

"In recent days, the disease has claimed the lives of hundreds of cows across the State, as it was not taken seriously by the Animal Husbandry Department," said K.A. Sengottuvel, state president of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association.

"The government is carrying out the drive once a year whereas it should be carried out twice a year -- once before the South-West and the North-East monsoons," he said.

Vaccination for FMD should be carried out on the models of pulse polio vaccination.

[As it appears from recent media reports, a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O epizootic of considerable dimensions and, seemingly, characterised by high pathogenicity, is unfolding in the 4 southern Indian states Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

Earlier this year (2013), Indian authors published the emergence, since 2011, of a new FMDV serotype O lineage in the said 4 southern states of India. For the paper, received August 2012, available online 3 May 2013, see reference below. The paper's abstract follows:

"In India, emergence of Ind2001 lineage of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O was recorded in the year 2001. After causing sporadic incidences, the Ind2001 lineage that re-surged in 2008 out-competed PanAsia from the field during 2009 and continued its dominance during 2010 and 2011 as well. The lineage has diversified in due course of time, leading to 2 sub-lineages (Ind2001a and Ind2001b). The sub-lineage Ind2001a include isolates collected during 2001-2002 and sub-lineage Ind2001b is constituted largely by isolates collected during 2008-2012. The nucleotide substitution rate of sub-lineage Ind2001b was estimated at 6.58 X 10 (-3) substitutions/site/year.

"The most stable PanAsia lineage is restricted only to few outbreaks. During 2011, emergence of a new genetic group with higher than 9 percent nucleotide divergence from rest of the lineages circulating in the country was detected and named as 'lineage Ind2011'. Two specific amino acid substitutions at positions VP1-36 (F) and VP2-133 (T) were observed in the Ind2011 lineage. The new lineage at present is restricted only to southern states of the country.

"It is uncertain whether the emergence was triggered by immune pressure or due to a bottleneck in transmission or selected for higher fitness value. Six sites (4, 68, 83, 135, 138 and 209) in VP1 protein were identified to undergo episodic diversifying selection in serotype O field isolates. Both emerging and reemerging lineages had appropriate antigenic match with currently used vaccine strain, INDR2/1975. Irrespective of genetic variability, the field isolates showed remarkable conservation at antigenically critical residues that might contribute to the observed antigenic stability. With the emergence of a new genetic group after a span of 10 years, the overall epidemiological scenario in the region is expected to change in the coming years."

According to the full paper, the number of genotyped FMDV isolates from the 4 states was as follows:

State / Ind2001 / Ind2011 / PanAsia / Unnamed (Ind2011 / total)
Kamataka / 18 / 11 / 2 / 3 (11 / 34)
Kerala / 14 / 2 / - / - / (2 / 14)
Tamil Nadu / 6 / 5 / - / - / (5 / 11)
Andhra Pradesh / 2 / 1 / - / - / (1 / 2)

It will be of value to note if the observed exacerbation is caused by the new lineage and if the applied vaccines confer optimal protection. It would also help to establish the genetic relationship between the Ind2011 strain and the FMDV strain(s) circulating in Sri Lanka. Samples from Sri Lanka have been submitted during 2012 to the WRLFMD in Pirbright and genotyped (the most recent one sampled in June 2012). Their lineage was, reportedly, "unnamed."
