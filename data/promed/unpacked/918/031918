A budget of 2 million [USD or AUD?] has been set aside by the
Ministry of Primary Industries to permanently eradicate brucellosis
in the country. Ministry for Primary Industries spokesperson Josefa
Uluilakeba said the budget is directed at laboratory reagents and consumables.

The Agricultural Department has been tasked to carry out the
eradication work, which will ensure that the bacterial outbreak is no
longer a threat to Fiji's cattle and dairy industry. The Ministry
reported that as of yesterday [25 Jul 2009], a total of 9 field teams
have tested over 5000 cows from dairy farms around the country, and
results have come back negative.

Uluilakeba said the Wainivesi area, in Tailevu, is still under
quarantine, and movement has been restricted in and around the area.
Meanwhile, testing of brucellosis in the northern division is almost
complete and blood samples collected from selected farms in Bua and Dreketi.

Latest statistics, according to the ministry, show that 262 animals
were slaughtered out of a total of 264 that were confirmed positive.
Two died while still at the farm and were buried under strict
quarantine procedures. A time frame has been set with all testing to
finish in August 2009.
