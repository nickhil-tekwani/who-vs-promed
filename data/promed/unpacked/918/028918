NC horse tests positive for equine infectious anemia
----------------------------------------------------
Officials with the N.C. Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (NCDA) said a horse in North Carolina tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

According to officials, a horse in Henderson County was also tested and officials are waiting for results.

Officials said the horse in Surry County tested positive but there is no epidemiological link between the 2 cases at this time.

Equine infectious anemia is an incurable disease commonly spread by biting flies and ticks of shared medical equipment between equines such as horses, donkeys, and mules.

The disease was discovered through collaborative efforts by private veterinary practitioners, NCDA & CS Veterinary Division field staff, the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Raleigh and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The cases mentioned above are the 1st documents in North Carolina since August 2017.

"Both facilities are under quarantine, which restricts movement of equine until testing is completed by the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the epidemiological investigation is further along," said Dr. Catherine Harris, director of Livestock Health Programs. "The remaining equines will be observed and retested in 60 days. We are also monitoring neighboring facilities for the disease."

Clinical signs of the disease include: fever, weakness, edema, weight loss, anemia and death.

Officials said if infected, some equine might not show symptoms.

However to help prevent infection, follow these guidelines:
· Use sterile, disposable needles and syringes, one per horse, for all vaccines and medications.
· Test all horses for EIA every year and at the time they enter a new premises.
· Keep stables and other facilities sanitary. Regularly clean stalls and properly dispose of manure away from horse stabling areas.
· Implement approved insect controls, such as insecticides and good drainage of standing water, to minimize fly presence.
· Only participate in events that require evidence of negative Coggins test.
· Isolate new horses on a property until they are tested for EIA.
· Never mix infected and healthy animals. Do not breed horses infected with EIA.

Officials said this disease does not affect people.

For more information about EIA or other reportable animal diseases please call the Veterinary Division.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often inapparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include:
- Jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes);
- Rapid breathing, rapid heart rate;
- Swelling of limbs;
- Bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes; and
- Blood-stained feces.

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress: illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical.

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized.

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes, or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the United States." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia).

It is unfortunate that there is no vaccine in the United States. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seem to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see the following ProMED post: Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG
