[1] Cholera - Guinea (Forestiere)

Cholera continues to spread in Guinea Forestiere where over 200 cases have
been recorded in Lola and Yalenzou (near Nzerekore) since Oct 2005. This
surge in cases comes at a time when the caseload has been regressing across
the country.
UNICEF and government authorities conducted a chlorination of wells from
27-29 Dec 2005. A 2nd round is scheduled for later in Jan 2006. Recognizing
the direct link between water quality and cholera, OCHA has mapped out
water points to provide information on available water points and urgent
gaps to be filled.
The emergence of cholera in Guinea Forestiere, after coming to an end in
Moyenne Guinea, raises great concern among humanitarian partners.

[There are 4 major regions in Guinea - the coast is called Basse (low) or
Maritime Guinea, the next section of the interior is called Moyenne
(lesser) Guinea, the more mountainous area to the east is called Haute
(high) Guinea, and the tail that drops down to the southeast is called
Guinea Forestiere or Forest Guinea. These major division also provide broad
cultural division as well - Basse Guinea is primarily Susu people and
culture, Moyenne Guinea is more of the Pular people, who originate from
nomadic tribes, Haute Guinea is primarily Malinke and Forest Guinea is home
to the Toma, Kissi and similar groups who carry on strong traditional
practices for medicine and religion. - Mod.LL]

Over 70 new cases of suspected cholera have been recorded in the country in
the last 2 days. Health minister Sylvia Masebo on Tue, 24 Jan 2006, said
as at 24 Jan 2006, there were 3 070 cases recorded from the time of the
outbreak. On the previous day, Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary Dr
Simon Miti had confirmed a record of about 2 926 suspected cholera cases as
of that day.
Masebo said 339 cases had been recorded in Central Province, two in
Kasempa, while Copperbelt had 122. According to Masebo, Southern Province
had 55 and Luapula Province recorded 21 from the time the disease broke out
last August.
"From 21 Aug 2005 to date (24 Jan 2006) 3 070 have been recorded for
suspected and cholera cases, 19 deaths, 14 BIDs (Brought In Dead) while 207
are currently under treatment," Masebo said.
She expressed concern over the high number of cases being recorded in
Lusaka. "People visiting Lusaka should be careful and avoid unnecessary
movements," she said.
Masebo appealed to the public to avoid making statements on cholera unless
they were verified. She said only district and provincial health directors
and Ministry of Health officials could comment to avoid giving wrong
information which could cause unnecessary alarm.

25 people have been killed in a cholera outbreak in Zambia in Jan 2006,
state radio and the health ministry said on Mon, 23 Jan 2006. 5 members
from 1 family and 5 prisoners had been felled by the disease near the
southern town of Mazabuka - 120 km (75 miles) from the capital Lusaka -
adding to another 15 that died earlier in the month, the newspapers and
health ministry said.
Some 2721 had been admitted to state hospitals suffering from cholera,
officials said. Simon Miti, permanent secretary in the health ministry,
confirmed 15 deaths while a minister and a junior official in Miti's
department reported the additional 10. "A school has been closed and all
pupils sent home after 5 members of a family died of cholera at Chikani in
Mazabuka," state radio reported on Mon, 23 Jan 2006.
Cholera deaths have also been reported in neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi
in Jan 2006. Southern African countries are most vulnerable to the disease
at this time of year during the summer rains.

Another cholera patient has been admitted to Chikani Primary School in
Mazabuka bringing the total number of patients to 8. Acting health
district director Gideon Mwiche revealed this during an emergency epidemic
meeting yesterday, 22 Jan 2006.
He also disclosed that dysentery had broken out in Chikani area and that 3
patients were admitted to the school but isolated from cholera patients.
Dr Mwiche attributed the outbreak to poor sanitation. He said that unless
villagers were educated on the need to observe hygiene, outbreaks of
epidemics would continue haunting the area. Dr Mwiche, however, said
health personnel had embarked on disinfecting homesteads for cholera
patients to limit the spread of the disease. He also said Ministry of
Health had sent enough chlorine for distribution to all affected villages.
Dr Mwiche said investigations carried out by his office revealed that the
1st cholera patient died on 10 Jan 2006 and family members ignorantly went
ahead with the without knowing the implications of the disease. He named
the affected villages as Kasaka and Samboko of Chikani and Simwambwa areas.
He also said district health officials had held an emergency meeting with
village headmen in affected areas to help sensitise their subjects on the
epidemic.

A cholera outbreak at Domeabra in the Ahafo-Ano South District has claimed
the life of the Zonal Coordinator of the National Disaster Management
Organization (NADMO).
About 28 others have been admitted to the Domeabra Health Center and the
Mankranso Government Hospital. Briefing the Ghana News Agency Mr Johnson
Kwaku Adu, the Ahafo-Ano South District NADMO Co-ordinator, attributed the
outbreak to poor sanitation and contaminated water in the town. He said the
only stream that serves the people as drinking water has been polluted by
garbage that is washed into it during the rainy season.
Mr Adu said a task force was constituted to educate the people on the
importance of environmental hygiene and how to treat and prevent the
disease from spreading when it spread and killed 2 people at Domeabra and
Wioso.

Tamil Nadu has 9 Central Prisons and the article [referred to] doesn't say
which one.
However, the source above, which includes the whole article, tells which
prison:
"It may be recalled that over 79 inmates of the Tiruchirapalli Central
Prison were taken ill with vomiting and diarrhea after they consumed the
food supplied in the prison."
