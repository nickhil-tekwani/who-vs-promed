Ebola virus disease, West Africa (situation as of 22 April 2014)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
As of 18:00 on 20 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 208 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 136 deaths. To date, 169 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 112 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 69 deaths. In addition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases; 25 health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed).

Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (53 cases, including 23 deaths), Gueckedou (122/87), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4), and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Gueckedou (60/38), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). These updated figures include 3 new cases isolated on 20 Apr 2014 from Conakry and Gueckedou, 2 of whom are laboratory confirmed. 5 new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; all 5 of them were patients with confirmed EVD. 21 patients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Gueckedou (8), and Macenta (1), while 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital.

Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217 contacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their 21 days of follow-up. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.

Liberia
-------
From 13 Mar 2014, the date of onset of the 1st laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 Apr 2014 and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 Apr 2014. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado, and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities.

The number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to 2 as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall, only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future.

Following data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district in Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72 per cent (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17 percent, 28 contacts); 59 contacts (36 per cent of the total) have completed 21 days follow up and have been discharged from medical observation.

Sierra Leone
------------
As of 22 Apr 2014, clinical samples from 19 clinically compatible cases of EVD have been tested at the Kenema Government Hospital. All 19 samples tested negative for ebolavirus. As part of enhanced surveillance activities, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone also decided to test for the presence of ebolavirus in samples from patients referred to the Lassa Fever Isolation Ward of the Kenema Hospital for the investigation of viral hemorrhagic fever-like illness who tested negative for Lassa fever virus infection. The additional 24 blood samples collected from 16 Mar 2014 onwards were analysed and all tested negative for ebolavirus.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.

Guinea/Liberia: MSF continues Ebola response
--------------------------------------------
MSF is deploying more than 60 international staff and 270 Guinean and Liberian staff to respond to the Ebola [virus disease, EVD] outbreak in West Africa, which has so far claimed 135 lives according to official numbers [136 as of 22 Apr 2014, see [1] above]. MSF is supporting local health authorities by caring for infected patients and implementing measures to contain the outbreak in 3 locations in Guinea and 2 in neighbouring Liberia.

Strengthening the capacity to care for patients in Conakry
----------------------------------------------------------
In a treatment centre inside Donka hospital, MSF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation (WHO), is currently caring for 16 Ebola patients who are isolated in the centre. New patients arrive on a daily basis, which has prompted MSF to expand the capacity from 30 to 40 beds.

"Our priority is to continue to care for the people infected with the Ebola virus. From an epidemiological view it's too early to say which way the outbreak is going. For us, every new case is a challenge. We will continue to admit new patients until this outbreak is over," explains Henry Gray, emergency coordinator for MSF in Guinea.

Several patients have survived and recovered from the epidemic after being cared for by MSF medical teams. Ebola has a very high fatality rate, with up to 90 percent of infected patients dying from the disease [But see comment at end].

"When I was told I had the virus, the 1st thought in my head was -- am I going to die? But, thanks to the care I received, every day I felt better. By the grace of God, I survived the disease," says a Guinean patient who prefers to stay anonymous.

Continuation and reopening of activities in southeastern Guinea
---------------------------------------------------------------
MSF restarted activities last week [13-19 Apr 2014] in Macenta, after a few days suspension of activities following demonstrations by a small segment of the local population. MSF continues discussions with the local community to counter misunderstandings concerning the disease, and to ensure that they have the best possible understanding of how it is spread and the measures needed to contain it.

In Gueckedou, activities continue with 26 international staff and 156 Guinean staff who work together to fight the outbreak. MSF's centre, with a capacity of 20 beds, currently has 11 patients.

"We know our patients very well; their names, their age, their families, where they live, how they were infected. So when there are patients that survive the disease and can see our medical staff without the protective gear and shake our hands, it's really emotional," says Mano Canton, Field Coordinator for MSF in Gueckedou.

Positive cases in Liberia prompt extended response
------------------------------
Following reports of suspected cases in neighbouring Liberia, MSF has sent teams to Lofa and Margibi county and to the capital Monrovia.

In Foya Lofa, close to the Guinean border, 4 cases have been confirmed with EVD, of which all have died. MSF is currently constructing a centre to be able to isolate and care for cases in the area. MSF will also train local health staff, and make sure that alert systems are in place to refer suspected cases to the centre.

In the capital Monrovia, MSF supports the authorities and trains medical staff in JFK hospital and Elwa hospital. MSF has also constructed an isolation unit in JFK hospital.

In Margibi County, east of Monrovia, a small isolation unit has been built by a local company. MSF supports the unit with technical expertise and has organised training for local health staff. 2 cases in the county have been confirmed, both have died.

New strain of virus identified has no impact on medical response
----------------------------------------------------------------
A group of international doctors and scientists, among them 4 MSF epidemiologists, have conducted a study which suggests that a slightly different strain of the virus from the previously identified Zaire strain may have been circulating in the region for some time.

"These new findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest that the virus was not brought in from any other part of Africa," says Hilde de Clerck, one of MSF's epidemiologists and contributor to the study. "However, this does do not have any medical implications for how MSF is responding to the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Liberia."

[The most important statement above is that the fact that this is a new strain of ebolavirus has no impact on the medical response.

This is an increase for Guinea of 5 cases and 7 deaths since WHO's last update of 19 Apr 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140422.2421188). Liberia has corrected its counts slightly downwards, Sierra Leone remains negative apart from the 2 cases reported earlier who contracted EVD in Guinea.

One has to wonder what hemorrhagic fever caused the clinical symptoms suspected to be EVD in the 24 patients who tested negative for both ebolavirus and Lassa virus in Sierra Leone.

A map showing graphically the numbers of cases and deaths can be seen at http://gmggranger.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/random-analytics-ebola-2014-update-to-23-apr-2014. It shows that the CFR (case fatality rate) ranges from below 50 per cent in Conakry and Liberia, up to 100 per cent in remote regions. - Mod.JW
