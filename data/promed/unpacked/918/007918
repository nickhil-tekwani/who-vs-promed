Sanguinaria is bloodroot, a root used for bronchitis, to make escharotic
(cancer) salves, [some toothpaste, mouthwashes and red dye. It is taken
internally as a standard 5:1 tincture at 1 ml. three times per day or as a
decoction at 1/2 tsp. dried powdered root to the cup t.i.d. Powdered
sanguinaria can be taken as a snuff for the treatment of nasal polyps. It
is traditionally considered valuable to lower the pulse and to remedy
weakness and palpitation of the heart.
I am unaware of LD50 studies on sanguinaria alone. However a salve for
internal use composed primarily of of Sanguinaria, with Galangal, 18% Zinc
Chloride and distilled water was extensively tested by Vipoint
Pharmaceuticals who did a LD50 study and found it safe for internal use at
700mg/kg. The compound later was modified for toothpaste by excluding
galangal, which had little periodontic value.
Sanguinaria is emetic and expectorant, relaxes the bronchial muscles and
stimulates peripheral circulation. Alkaloids [contained in it include
sanguinarine, chelerythrine, protopine, curare, turbocurarine and B.
[beta? homochelidine.
It also contains red resin, citric and malic acids. It is considered
poisonous, and in toxic doses is known to cause burning in the stomach,
vomiting, intense thirst, vertigo, faintness, intense prostration and
dimness of eyesight.
There is no way _Sanguinaria canadensis_ root would be mistakenly included
in an Indian mustard seed oil, so I'm guessing that if the sanguinaria was
an adulterant, the color was used to darken the oil (although its color is
NOT like mustard oil -- it is red.) But the dose used to produce the
reactions might need to be high which might make the use as a color
adulterant too obvious. There is also the question of what oil was being
adulterated to mix with mustard oil.

I was interested in this posting as we know of a substance "sanguinaria" an
alkaloid extract from _Sanguinaria canadensis_ which was at one stage
thought to have anti-plaque properties and was used in toothpastes and
mouth wash preparations. It was found to be very toxic and is classified by
the FDA as an unsafe "herb". It is sometimes used in homeopathic medicines.

My 1987 edition of Manson's Tropical Medicine describes *sanguinarine* as a
poison found in the seeds of _Argemone mexicana_, the Mexican poppy, a
common weed in India often [fortuitously contaminating stocks of mustard
seed in India.

[This sounds to me a much more likely explanation than the N. American

[This episode recalls the major outbreak of illness, with many deaths, in
Spain, about 20? years ago, eventually attributed to mustard oil (rape seed
oil) which had been prepared with a toxic additive, an industrial lubricant
for machinery. This had been sold as olive oil on the black market. Cases
appeared to have lung disease/atypical pneumonia. Careful epidemiology
found that the common factor for the victims was purchase of the black
market oil.
