4th and 5th new human cases of avian influenza H5N1 in Cambodia in 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that 2 new more cases of avian influenza has been confirmed positive for the H5N1 virus.

The 4th case, a 17-month-old girl from Prey Nheat village, Prey Nheat commune, Kong Pisey district in Kampong Speu province, was diagnosed with H5N1 influenza on 26 Jan 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. She developed symptoms on 13 Jan 2013 with fever, cough, runny nose, and vomiting. She was initially treated by local private practitioners. Her condition worsened and she was admitted to Kantha Bopha Hospital on 17 Jan 2013 with fever, cough, somnolence, and dyspnoea. Unfortunately, despite intensive medical care, she died on 28 Jan 2013. There is evidence of recent deaths among poultry in the village and the girl had history of coming into contact with poultry prior to becoming sick.

The 5th case, a 9-year-old girl from Thmei village, Thmei commune, Toeuk Chhou district, Kampot province, was diagnosed with H5N1 influenza on 28 Jan 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. She became sick on 19 Jan 2013 suffering with fever and cough. She was initially treated by local private practitioners. Her condition worsened and she was admitted to Kantha Bopha Hospital with fever cough, somnolence, and dyspnoea on 27 Jan 2013. Despite intensive medical care, the patient died on 28 Jan 2013. There is evidence of recent deaths among poultry in the village. This girl is the 26th person in Cambodia to become infected with H5N1 virus, and the 5th person this year [2013]; she is the 23rd person to die from complications of the disease. [Of the 26 confirmed cases, 17 were children under 14 and 17 were females.]

"Avian influenza H5N1 is still a threat to the health of Cambodians. This are the 4th and 5th cases of H5N1 infection in humans in early [2013], and children still seem to be most vulnerable. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry, discourage them from playing in areas where poultry stay, and wash their hands often. If they have fast or difficult breathing, they should be brought to medical attention at the nearest health facility and attending physicians be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry," said HE Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health.

The Ministry of Health's Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have gone to the hospitals and the field to identify the patient's close contacts, any epidemiological linkage among the 3 cases, and initiate preventive treatment as required. In addition, public health education campaigns are being conducted in the villages to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is wash hands often; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat sick poultry; and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.

Globally, since 2003, there have been 615 laboratory confirmed cases of avian influenza with 364 related deaths.

The Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website at http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh, where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.

[ProMED-mail thanks Sonny Inbaraj Krishnan for forwarding this information to us. Descriptions of the 1st 3 cases in Cambodia in the current year (2013) are available in the preceding ProMED-mail posing Avian influenza, human (01): Cambodia, fatalities 20130125.1514597. Perhaps the most significant feature of these recent cases in Cambodia is the high proportion of fatalities and that children have been the most vulnerable. Parents and guardians are urged to keep children away from sick or dead poultry, discourage them from playing in areas where there are poultry.
