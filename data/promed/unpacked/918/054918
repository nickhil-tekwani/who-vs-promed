Two outbreaks, 2 entirely different outcomes. The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of Ebola over in the Democratic Republic of Congo after just 66 cases and 49 deaths. It lasted 3 months. Yet the epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been going on for 9 months, with more than 15 000 cases, 5000 deaths and no end in sight.

What's the difference? Experts say experience matters; it was the 7th outbreak in the former Zaire. But equally important is the fact that the village where it started was extremely remote, and the country has a rudimentary system of healthcare workers who know to look out for Ebola.

The latest outbreak started when a pregnant woman was preparing game [hunted wild animals] that her husband had brought home for the family in Ikanamongo, a village in northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). After she died of an unknown illness, healthcare workers performed a cesarean section to remove her fetus. "It's local custom; you can't be buried with a fetus inside," said Ben Monroe, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [US CDC] epidemiologist who's worked in both the DRC and Liberia. "All the health care workers involved fell ill." Within a week of the unfortunate woman's death on 11 Aug 2014, there were 23 other cases, and 13 of them had died.

"That raised a lot of alarm in the system. Someone in ... the health authority there recognized what was going on," said Monroe. "Congolese people have been hearing about Ebola for years and years and years," Monroe added. "They put a fair amount of effort into preparing for situations like this." Not too far away, the Ebola River flows. Dr. Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, named it after this river. [Correction: it was actually named by Karl Johnson's group from the US CDC. - Mod.JW]

It also didn't hurt that the CDC had been studying monkeypox in the same forests since 2010. "We go every year and train health care workers on infection control and disease surveillance," Monroe said. "There's been a lot of public education in this particular region in addition to training health care workers."

Local health experts knew to quickly identify potential cases and isolate them. It doesn't help the patients much -- the death rate is still very high -- but it keeps the virus from spreading. Isolation is also not difficult. The area is very heavily forested, and most people live along the rivers. There's not much travel or trade.

Compare that to the area where Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone come together in West Africa. The current boundaries cross over ancient kingdoms, and people travel freely across the borders in trucks, by canoe, on motorcycles and on foot. There's a lot of informal trade and commerce. Years of civil war have left little infrastructure and even less trust in government, especially in Liberia. Ebola had never been seen there. When someone shows up with fever at a clinic, health workers usually assume it's malaria, and if there are more severe symptoms, they might suspect another viral hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, or yellow fever. Ebola didn't enter anyone's minds for months as the virus was carried across borders and finally into crowded cities like Monrovia...

Ironically, many of the DRC's Ebola experts were not even on hand for the recent outbreak there. "They were in Guinea," Monroe said. "The DRC actually exports their Ebola expertise to other countries."... - more

[This analysis raises many of the issues that have been discussed in contrasting the Ebola situations in DRC and West Africa -- remoteness of the rural area in DRC, familiarity with Ebola -- but also mentions that frequent contact with CDC and others may reinforce prevention and control messages in DRC and that infrastructure devastation in West Africa also helps account for the different outcomes. - Mod.LM
