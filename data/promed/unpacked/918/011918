As part of their surveillance activity within the larger Protection Zone in
Surrey, Animal Health have identified a further herd of cattle which have
clinical signs of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Debby Reynolds, the chief
veterinary officer (CVO), has therefore ordered their slaughter on
suspicion of FMD. Animal Health staff are on site, and the cull of the
animals will begin as soon as it is practical. Samples have been taken to
the laboratory for testing to confirm disease.
CVO Debby Reynolds said: "The intensive work of Animal Health has meant
that we have been able to rapidly identify this suspect case and take
appropriate action swiftly. I continue to urge all animal keepers to be
vigilant for signs of disease and practice strict biosecurity."
