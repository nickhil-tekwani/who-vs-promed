A number of recent reports about children suffering fever and paralysis from unknown causes has prompted the National Institute of Infectious Diseases [Japan] to start investigating nationwide for similar cases. Some of the children were infected with enterovirus D68, and the national institute has been studying if the virus is responsible for the symptoms.

Enterovirus is a general term for viruses including those causing hand, foot and mouth disease and polio.

According to the health ministry, reports started coming in in August [2015] showing that 47 children aged up to 11 in about 20 prefectures had developed symptoms of paralysis. Out of 8 patients who were infected with viruses, enterovirus D68 was detected in 2 toddlers.

In the United States, more than 1000 children were infected with the virus last year [2014]. Experts are cautious because some of them later developed paralysis. Since the virus is usually prevalent from summer to autumn, a health ministry official said it is hard to expect the number of patients to surge further this year [2015].

Patients often suffer paralysis only in the hands or legs, making it hard for doctors to think they are infected with the virus, said Ryutaro Kira, head of the department of neurology at Fukuoka Children's Hospital.

Since 2005, there have been more than 200 patients infected with the virus in Japan. Washing hands can be an effective way to protect oneself from the virus, which can be transmitted by sneezing.

[Enterovirus 68 (EV D-68) belongs to the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, and species human enterovirus D (1). Infection with EV D-68 is generally associated with respiratory tract infections. The commonest age group for infection with EV D-68 is 1-4 years of age, but about 25 per cent of EV D-68 cases occur in adults over 20 years of age. EV D-68 is rarely detected in Japan, and no epidemics have been reported.

A study [A Kaida, H Kubo, J Sekiguchi, et al. Enterovirus 68 in children with acute respiratory tract infections, Osaka, Japan, Emerg Infect Dis. 2011; 17(8) http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/8/11-0028_article] found that enterovirus 68 strains were detected in 14 specimens from children with respiratory tract infections and 1 specimen from a child with febrile convulsions during 2010 in Osaka, Japan. These strains had deletions in the 5' untranslated region and were genetically different from reported strains. This virus is associated with respiratory tract infections in Japan.

This study noted that [previously] EV-D68 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid of a young adult patient with acute flaccid paralysis [Khetsuriani N, Lamonte-Fowlkes A, Oberst S, Pallansch MA. Enterovirus surveillance -- United States, 1970-2005. MMWR Surveill Summ. 2006;55:1-20].

However, if EV D-68 was isolated from only 2 of 8 patients as reported, other causes also must be explored. EV-C105, for example, was recently discovered, in a child with acute flaccid paralysis who tested negative for EV-D68.
