Outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in central Ohio (USA)
---------------------------------------------------
"The outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in central Ohio is getting worse.
Federal health officials continue to work in Delaware county, the area
where most of the people who have been infected live. The Delaware county
health department reports 115 people in a 4 county area have now tested
positive for the diarrhea causing virus [_Cryptosporidium_ is not a virus,
and it says more than 500 people have displayed symptoms of it. In fact,
the agency's Nancy Shapiro reports there is a shortage of kits to test for
the disease."

[The outbreak was initially reported as associated with contamination of
swimming pools, but the extent of the outbreak indicates a much wider
exposure in the community. Previous outbreaks have been waterborne which is
the most probable source of this outbreak too, but results on the ongoing
investigation of the source are still pending. -Mod.EP
[Person-to-person transmission, such as in day care centers, is also known
to occur. It would be interesting to know the age distribution of the
cases. -Man. Ed. DS
