Mount Isa has had a sudden spike in syphilis among young people over the past year and a half and the 9-fold increase is causing such concern among health workers that Queensland Health has launched a health screening incentive program.

The Mount Isa Health Service District has been notified of more than 110 infectious syphilis cases since January 2011; about 80 per cent of those affected were aged under 25. In contrast, records show there were 14 cases in 2010 and just 2 in 2009.

Queensland Health announced it would offer AUD 20 [USD 20.22] Telstra [Australian telecommunications and media company] credit vouchers to people in Mount Isa who undergo a free, confidential screening for the disease before 1 Jun 2012. Participants would also be put into a draw to win a mobile phone.

Clinical director and staff specialist at Mount Isa's Sexual Health clinic Dr Arun Menon said syphilis was a serious and potentially fatal illness. "The only way you can deal with it is by screening and by treatment," Dr Menon said. "Penicillin is very effective against syphilis and if people are allergic to penicillin, there are other alternatives."

This was the 1st time Queensland Health had tried to screen for syphilis in Mount Isa, Dr Menon said. "We've never done a screen in an urban situation before," he said. "It is quite a complex environment and we've engaged a lot of organisations, trying to get as many young people screened as possible."

It was important to screen for it, he said, because most people who had syphilis were asymptomatic. "They don't have any symptoms but there are long-term health consequences, including infections of the brain and other organs and fertility issues," he said. "It can also be fatal and harm unborn babies."

Health workers did not know why there had been such an increase in syphilis in Mount Isa. "We're not sure where this has come from but we do know there's been an increase in the Northern Territory as well," Dr Menon said. If people outside the under-25 year age would like to be tested, they would not be turned away.

Free confidential health checks are being conducted at 2 locations: Young People Ahead - 8-18 May [2012] from 10 am; Flexible Learning Centre - 21 May-1 Jun [2012] from 10 am.

[In a previous ProMED-mail post in February 2012 (Syphilis - Australia: (QL) 20120215.1042038), an outbreak of infectious syphilis in the Queensland, Australia mining town of Mount Isa was reported to be presumably due to heterosexual activity based on Mount Isa's booming prostitution trade. Fly-in/fly-out or drive-in/drive-out women sex workers travel great distances to the mining regions of Queensland for a few days or weeks in hotels, motels, or caravan parks before returning home or moving on to the next mining town in a circuit. Prostitution is said to be legal, but unregulated, for these women to work as sole operators as long as they don't solicit in public (http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/coal-girls-hit-paydirt-at-mines/story-e6freoof-1226186661381).

In contrast, infectious syphilis in the rest of Australia has been attributed mainly to sex between men (http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/2011/$file/KIRBY_ASR2011.pdf).

In the current news report above, no mention is made of prostitution. Other than mentioning that about 80 per cent of those affected were aged under 25 years of age, the news report above does not characterize the Mount Isa outbreak as to, for example, sex, race or minority group, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, other risk behaviors, such as the use of drugs during sexual activity, and HIV co-infection. A detailed epidemiologic investigation is required so that preventive measures can be targeted to specific high-risk groups and activities.

Mount Isa is a city in the Gulf Country region of Queensland, Australia, with vast mineral deposits of lead, silver, copper, and zinc found in the region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa).
