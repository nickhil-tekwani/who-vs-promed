[The outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir, Riyadh region continues with one newly confirmed healthcare-acquired case reported in the past 48 hours. In addition, 3 recoveries were also reported, 2 of whom were among those reported from Wadi Aldawasir, and the 3rd, a sporadic case reported from Al Jawf region. I look forward to seeing the next WHO update that will outline and discuss the ongoing outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir, as the case reports on the individual cases show that 9 of the now 39 confirmed cases (23.1%) were classified as primary community-acquired cases, 24 (61.5%) were classified as healthcare-acquired cases, 5 (12.8%) were classified as household contacts, and 2 (5.1%) were classified as unspecified secondary community-acquired contacts. Additional information that would be nice to have is how many healthcare facilities are involved in this outbreak, and clarification of the classification categories because some of the cases classified as healthcare-acquired cases also have a recorded history of contact with camels, raising the question of how does one decide the classification of a case if there is a history of both contact with camels and contact with known cases of MERS-CoV infection, unless there are genomic studies of the involved viruses.

From [1 Jan 2019] through [31 Jan 2019], the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 14 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 deaths. [Details of these cases are provided below and also can be found following a link at the source URL]. Of the 14 cases reported in January [2019], 8 are from 3 separate clusters of cases. Cluster 1 involves 3 cases (listed as Cases 1, 2 and 3) in Riyadh Province, and Cluster 2 involves 2 cases (listed as Cases 4 and 5) in the city of Jeddah. Cluster 3 involves 3 cases (listed as Cases 11, 13 and 14) in the city of Wadi Aldwaser [Wadi Aldawasir] and is currently ongoing. More details regarding the outbreak in Wadi Aldwaser and the implementation of interventions by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia will be provided in the next update.

The [information] below provides details of the 14 reported additional cases.

*Data are subject to change due to ongoing investigations. Fields related to the final status of the case are updated as information is available.
NA, not available; NR, not reported.

From 2012 through [31 Jan 2019], the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2298 with 811 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

As of [15 Feb 2019], there is an ongoing outbreak of MERS in Wadi Aldwaser [Wadi Aldawasir], which includes Cases 11, 13 and 14 reported above. WHO will provide details of the additional cases involved in this outbreak, as well as intervention measures implemented by the MoH. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are nonspecific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular handwashing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[According to the above report, since the 1st cases were reported in 2012, there have been a total of 2298 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 811 deaths reported globally (reported case fatality rate, 35.3%).

Additional information available on the 14 cases from the MOH case information includes the following: Case 1 was reported as having recovered on 10 Jan 2019; Case 2 was classified as a household contact (presumably of Case 1) and reported as having recovered on 22 Jan 2019. Case 3 was classified as a household contact (presumably of Case 1) and was reported as having recovered on 22 Jan 2019. Case 4 was reported as having recovered on 22 Jan 2019. Case 5 was classified as a household contact (presumably of Case 4) and was reported as having recovered on 21 Jan 2019. Case 6 is still pending outcome report. Case 8 was reported as having recovered on 5 Feb 2019. Case 10 was reported as having recovered on 5 Feb 2019. Case 11 was reported as having recovered on 11 Feb 2019. Case 12 is pending outcome report. Case 13 was reported as having recovered on 15 Feb 2019, and Case 14 was reported as having recovered on 11 Feb 2019. Both Cases 12 and 13 were classified as "secondary community acquired" cases, but the locale of presumed infection transmission was not specified.

These WHO updates are very helpful in filling in information on the cases, especially high-risk exposures and preexisting comorbidities. In the above listing of 14 cases during the month of January 2019, 10 of the 14 cases (71.4%) had a history of diabetes mellitus, including all 3 of the reported fatalities. - Mod.MPP]
