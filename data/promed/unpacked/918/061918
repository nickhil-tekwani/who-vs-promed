[According the OIE WAHID database, West Nile infection was last
reported here in 2003. Guadeloupe regularly reports bluetongue, bovine
anaplasmosis and heartwater over the past 3 years, but very few other
diseases, so this report is notable. The disease outbreak is
continuing and there is little information on source of the infection
or vaccination status in this report. - Mod.PC]

[Since these cases were detected during sentinel surveillance, they
may not have shown any clinical signs. Serologic evidence of WNV
infection was detected in 2002 in horses, chickens, and resident
free-ranging birds in Guadeloupe, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Mexico -- see ProMED archive West Nile virus update 2008 - Western
Hemisphere (09) 20080707.2056 below.
