[Since the start of the event, reportedly on 23 Dec 2015, the initial outbreak on the Armenian-Turkish border has remained solitary according to Armenia's official reports. This means that according to official information, the 2 suspected additional outbreaks reported by unofficial sources (postings 20160902.4459221 and 20160719.4354933) are regarded as excluded.

The animal movements restrictions and the extensive mass vaccination seem to have prevented, so far, the further spread of the FMD virus serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII, originating in south Asia (Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh). This virus has reportedly spread recently to 4 Near-East countries (in brackets, start of the event according to the country's initial notification to the OIE): Iran (30 Aug 2015), Saudi Arabia (13 Sep 2015), Turkey (29 Sep 2015), and Armenia (23 Dec 2015).
