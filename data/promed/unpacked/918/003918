RABIES, POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (2)
======================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis
In regard to the question concerning administration of post-exposure
treatment for individuals previously vaccinated for rabies, the
recommendation is dependent upon the type of vaccine the individual
received. In the USA the ACIP [Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee] recommends the following:
"If exposed to rabies, persons previously vaccinated should receive 2
IM [intramuscular] doses (1.0 ml each) of vaccine, one immediately and
one 3 days later. Previously vaccinated refers to persons who have
received one of the recommended preexposure or postexposure regimens
of HDCV [Human Diploid Cell Vaccine] or RVA [Rabies Vaccine Adsorbed]
or those who received another vaccine and had a documented rabies
antibody titer. HRIG [Human Rabies Immune Globulin] is unnecessary and
should not be given in these cases because an anamnestic antibody
response will follow the administration of a booster regardless of the
prebooster antibody titer."
MMWR Vol 40:13.
Regarding the other question concerning administration of postexposure
to those individuals that have not received preexposure vaccination:
There are several thousand individuals in the USA, (that have "potentially"
been exposed to rabies), that undergo the 5 dose postexposure treatment
every year. While a small percentage of individuals do experience some
side-effects, the benefits far outweigh the risk of contracting rabies.
As for having titers run, our laboratory has been conducting rabies
antibody serology on Peace Corps Volunteers and American Embassy
personnel since 1984. If you have one of these offices close to where
you are, you might be able to have them send us a serum sample.
However, I would not change the above stated recommendations even if
you had titers run because of the questionable rabies results on the
bovine.
