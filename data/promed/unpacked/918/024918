Today [4 Nov 2021] the Biden administration released details of its plan to require full vaccination or weekly COVID-19 testing for two-thirds of the nation's work force by 4 Jan 2022. The announcement comes as the country exceeds 750 000 COVID deaths. The plan will affect all employers with 100 or more employees, or 84 million Americans. The program will be overseen by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the Department of Health and Human Services will also require that all health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid are fully vaccinated, a rule that affects 17 million workers at about 76 000 health care facilities, including hospitals and long-term care facilities.

"The Administration has previously implemented policies requiring millions of federal employees and federal contractors to be fully vaccinated. To make it easy for businesses and workers to comply, the Administration is announcing today that the deadline for workers to receive their shots will be the same for the OSHA rule, the CMS rule, and the previously announced federal contractor vaccination requirement," the administration said in a press release (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-details-of-two-major-vaccination-policies/).

President Joe Biden announced the plan to introduce mandates in September [2021], after a nationwide vaccination campaign stalled in the summer, and cases rose sharply with the arrival of the delta (B1617.2) variant. "What more do you need to see?" Biden asked unvaccinated Americans during an address on 9 Sep 2021. "The vaccine is FDA-approved, over 200 million Americans have gotten the shot. We have been patient, but our patience is wearing thin."

In related news, Ford Motor Company became the first US automaker to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for its 32 000 salaried employees, CNN reports. Workers have until 8 Dec 2021 to be fully vaccinated; the company said 84% of US salaried employees are already vaccinated (https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/business/ford-mandate-vaccine-us-workforce/index.html).

And the US military said yesterday [3 Nov 2021] that almost 97% of active duty members of the Air Force have received at least one dose of vaccine, the New York Times reports. The Air Force is the first branch of the military to reach a vaccine deadline set by the Pentagon in August [2021] (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/air-force-reaches-vaccine-deadline.html). The vaccination deadline for the Navy and Marines is later in November, and the Army deadline is mid-December [2021].

The United States reached another grim milestone in the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 750 000 Americans now officially dead from the virus. According to Johns Hopkins University, 46 300 738 Americans have had confirmed COVID-19 infections, and 751 046 have died (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu).

The 7-day average of new daily cases is 71 619, with 1257 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker. Yesterday [3 Nov 2021] the newspaper recorded 84 800 new cases, including 1880 deaths (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

Colorado has emerged as the latest hot spot for virus activity. The state's daily case rate has more than doubled in the past month, and nearly 200 COVID-19 patients are being admitted to hospitals each day, ABC News reports (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=80899014#80954959).

[It is remarkable that in the USA, with as much vaccine as it needs and more, and no serious accessibility issues, "Yesterday the newspaper recorded 84 800 new cases, including 1880 deaths." How is this possible? Too many individuals are choosing not to be vaccinated. Vaccine mandates are needed, especially when masks are no longer required for vaccinated individuals in many indoor locations, as they still can transmit virus. - Mod.LK]

More than 28 million extra years of life were lost among 31 high- and upper-middle-income countries, and 33 nations saw declines in life expectancy, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, concludes a study yesterday [3 Nov 2021] in BMJ [British Medical Journal https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-066768.short; see below].

A team led by University of Oxford investigators conducted a time-series analysis of all-cause death data from the Human Mortality Database for 2005-2020 to estimate excess years of life lost and changes in life expectancy associated with the pandemic among 37 countries with reliable death data.

Decreases in life expectancy were estimated as the difference between expected and observed life expectancy using the Lee-Carter model, and excess years of life lost were estimated using the difference between the observed and expected years of life lost using the World Health Organization's standard life table. The authors noted that years of life lost had fallen among both men and women in most countries, except Canada, Greece, Scotland, Taiwan, and the United States, from 2005 to 2019.

All countries except New Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, which observed gains in life expectancy in 2020, saw declines in life expectancy among both men and women. Denmark, Iceland, and South Korea experienced no change in life expectancy.

The most marked declines in life expectancy were seen in Russia (men, -2.33; women: -2.14), the US (men, -2.27; women, -1.61), Bulgaria (men, -1.96; women, -1.37), Lithuania (men, -1.83; women, -1.21), Chile (men, -1.64; women, -0.88), and Spain (men, -1.35; women, -1.13).

Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea were the only countries that didn't experience years of life lost in 2020. The remaining 31 countries observed more than 222 million years of life lost, equaling 28.1 million more than were expected (men, -17.3 million; women, -10.8 million).

The most lost years of life per 100 000 people were seen in Bulgaria (men, -7260; women, -3730), Russia (men, -7020; women, -4760), Lithuania (men, -5430; women, -2640), the US (men, -4350; women, -2430), Poland (men, -3830; women, -1830), and Hungary (men, -2770; women, -1920).

Excess years of life lost were relatively low in people younger than 65 years, except in Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the US, where excess years lost were more than 2000 per 100 000 people. The ratio of years of life lost between people younger and older than 65 years was at least 0.2 in Estonia, Canada, Scotland, the US, Lithuania, and Chile.

The study authors noted that all-cause death data are better measures of the true impact of the pandemic than reported COVID-19 deaths because they are less sensitive to coding errors, competing risks, and possible misclassifications in the cause of death; as such, they facilitate comparisons between countries.

"Excess years of life lost associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than 5 times higher than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015," they wrote. "Our findings of a comparable or lower than expected YLL [years of life lost] in Taiwan, New Zealand, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and South Korea underscore the importance of successful viral suppression and elimination policies, including targeted and population based public health policy interventions."

Quantification of the effects of different policy interventions on the reduction of premature deaths can inform the creation of future policies, the researchers said. "As many of the effects of the pandemic might take a longer time frame to have a measurable effect on human lives, continuous and timely monitoring of excess YLL would help identify the sources of excess mortality and excess YLL in population subgroups," they concluded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Objective: To estimate the changes in life expectancy and years of life lost in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Design: Time series analysis.
"Setting: 37 upper-middle and high income countries or regions with reliable and complete mortality data.
"Participants: Annual all-cause mortality data from the Human Mortality Database for 2005-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex.
"Main outcome measures: Reduction in life expectancy was estimated as the difference between observed and expected life expectancy in 2020 using the Lee-Carter model. Excess years of life lost were estimated as the difference between the observed and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World Health Organization standard life table.
"Conclusion: More than 28 million excess years of life were lost in 2020 in 31 countries, with a higher rate in men than women. Excess years of life lost associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than 5 times higher than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015."

What is already known on this topic
-----------------------------------
- Reported numbers of deaths with COVID-19 are subject to changes within and across countries as well as some degrees of delays, inaccuracy, and incompleteness
- Excess deaths (difference between observed and expected numbers of deaths from all causes) allows the assessment of the full impact of the pandemic, including the direct effect on deaths with COVID-19, and the indirect effect of the pandemic on deaths from other diseases
- Estimation of excess deaths does not, however, consider the age at death, and therefore does not quantify the impact of the pandemic on premature deaths as years of life lost (YLL)

What this study adds
--------------------
- In 2020, life expectancy was lower and YLL higher than expected in all countries except New Zealand, Taiwan, Iceland, South Korea, Denmark, and Norway -- in the remaining 31 countries, >28 million excess years of life were lost
- Highest reduction in life expectancy in 2020 was observed in Russia (men, -2.33 years; women, -2.14), the US (men, -2.27; women, -1.61), Bulgaria (men -1.96; women, -1.37), Lithuania (men, -1.83; women, -1.21), Chile (men, -1.64; women, -0.88), and Spain (men, -1.35; women, -1.13)
- Excess YLL rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than 5 times higher than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015

Update on COVID-19: Europe and central Asia again at the epicentre of the pandemic
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Statement by Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, 4 Nov 2021 (video https://youtu.be/hL223ufhUhk)

Today [4 Nov 2021], every single country in Europe and central Asia is facing a real threat of COVID-19 resurgence, or already fighting it. The current pace of transmission across the 53 countries of the WHO European Region is of grave concern. COVID-19 cases are once again approaching record levels, with the more transmissible delta variant continuing to dominate transmission across Europe and central Asia.

Last week, with nearly 1.8 million new cases and 24 000 new deaths reported, Europe and central Asia saw a 6% increase and 12% increase, respectively, compared to the previous week. Over the past 4 weeks, Europe has seen a greater than 55% increase in new COVID-19 cases.

Last week, Europe and central Asia accounted for 59% of all cases globally and 48% of reported deaths. Cumulatively, there are now more reported cases -- 78 million -- in the European Region than in South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Western Pacific and Africa combined. We are, once again, at the epicentre.

We see increasing trends across all age-groups. Of most concern is the rapid increase in the older population groups since week 38, which is translating into more people with severe disease and more people dying. Currently, 75% of fatal cases are in people aged 65 years and above.

Hospitalization admission rates due to COVID-19 more than doubled in one week, based on WHO/Europe's latest data.

According to a reliable projection, if we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million COVID-19 deaths in Europe and central Asia by the 1st of February next year [2022] -- and 43 countries in our Region will face high to extreme stress on hospital beds at some point through the same period.

So why have Europe and central Asia been experiencing soaring cases for 4 consecutive weeks? There are 2 reasons: 1) insufficient vaccination coverage, and 2) the relaxation of public health and social measures.

1) Vaccines continue to save thousands upon thousands of lives

Despite near-record COVID-19 cases, new deaths are at approximately half the peak levels. This reflects the life-saving effects of vaccines and the herculean task of health authorities, the health workforce and communities to develop, administer and accept vaccines. One billion doses have now been administered in Europe and central Asia.

Countries of Europe and central Asia are, however, at various stages of vaccination rollout. On average, only 47% of people have completed a full vaccination series. While 8 countries have now exceeded 70% coverage, in 2 countries the rate remains below 10%.

Where vaccine uptake is low -- in many countries in the Baltics, central and eastern Europe, and the Balkans -- hospital admission rates are high. This variation in vaccination coverage reflects several issues around immunization service delivery, as well as a lack of trust and/or complacency among some population groups. It is imperative that authorities invest all efforts to accelerate the pace of vaccination rollout.

We need to make sure countries with low vaccination coverage among priority groups increase their coverage. Authorities are encouraged to offer an additional dose to moderately and severely immunocompromised people 1 to 3 months after they complete the primary vaccination series, and to consider offering an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all people over the age of 60.

In addition, I continue to urge countries to show global solidarity through sharing of doses.

Hospitalization rates in countries with low vaccine uptake are markedly higher and rising more quickly than in those with higher uptake. Most people hospitalized and dying from COVID-19 today [4 Nov 2021] are not fully vaccinated.

The vaccines are indeed doing what they were intended to do: preventing severe illness and death.

2) Relaxing of public health and social measures

Vaccines are our most powerful asset -- if used alongside other tools. Reliable projections show that if we achieved 95% universal mask use in Europe and central Asia, we could save up to 188 000 lives of the half a million lives we may lose before February 2022.

Testing, contact tracing, ventilation in indoor spaces and physical distancing remain part of our arsenal of defences, next to the rapid, fair and generalized uptake of vaccines by everyone eligible. These are tried and tested measures that enable lives to continue while controlling the virus and avoiding widespread, damaging lockdowns.

We must change our tactics from reacting to surges of COVID-19 to preventing them from happening in the first place.

In the situation Europe and central Asia finds itself today [4 Nov 2021], I am encouraged to see that over the past 2 weeks, 23 countries have responsibly strengthened social measures. But I am also concerned that 7 have eased up.

Measures should be commensurate with the local epidemiology, but with the widespread resurgence of COVID-19, I am asking every health authority to carefully reconsider easing or lifting of measures at this very moment.

Preventive measures, when applied correctly and consistently, allow us to go on with our lives, not the opposite. Preventive measures do not deprive people of their freedom, they ensure it. In other words, the best way to avoid lockdowns -- which are an absolute last resort -- is to apply such measures and keep COVID-19 transmission low.

As we enter the flu season, we face the prospect of both influenza and COVID-19 circulating. The same preventive measures work against both viruses, and we have effective and safe vaccines for both.

We are at another critical point of pandemic resurgence. Europe is back at the epicentre of the pandemic, where we were one year ago. The difference today is that we know more and we can do more. We have more tools and means to mitigate and reduce the damage to our communities and society.

The current situation and alarming short-term projections should trigger us to act. Ultimately, we are only getting out of this pandemic if politicians, scientists and the public work together. We need to stay cautious, act early on any change and stay ahead of the virus.

Thank you.
