The vector-borne deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus] toll in
eastern Uttar Pradesh today reached 346, following the death of 5 more
children in the last 24 hours. Official sources said so far 2281
patients had reported at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College here and
other district hospitals in the division, of which 346, including 37
from Bihar and one from Nepal had died. Since yesterday [24 Sep 2010],
50 fresh JE cases had come to light. Almost 270 JE patients were still
convalescing at the various hospitals.

JE patients mostly trickle from Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Sant
Kabirnagar, Deoria, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthnagar, Azamgarh,
Gonda, Bahraich, Mau, Ballia and Balrampur districts of UP.

Gorakhpur has the dubious distinction of being the JE epicentre in the
region. The endemic afflicts eastern Uttar Pradesh during monsoon
every year and continues to take people into its jaws till the onset
of winter.

[The death toll from encephalitis in the UP has increased from 319 on
20 Sep 2010 to 346 in this report. This report implies that all cases
are due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. However, previous reports
indicate that not all cases are due to Japanese encephalitis virus
(JEV) and the majority are caused by a different virus (perhaps an
enterovirus).

Since 2005, more than 3000 children have died of Japanese encephalitis
in the state. Experts believe the reason behind this is a failed
vaccine drive. Every year, the Centre is unable to provide the
required number of vaccines on time. And whatever little arrives, even
that is not fully used by the state. "Yes, it has been some sort of
failure," admits the state's Additional Director (Health), UK Srivastav.

"If the Centre could not provide the vaccine, isn't it the duty of the
state to source it? The vaccines cost barely 30-odd crores [USD
670,600] which is nothing compared to the thousands of crores spent on
building memorials" [a crore is a unit in the Indian numbering system
equal to 10 million. - Mod.TY] says Dr. RMD Agarwal, a paediatrician
and a BJP MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly].

The 1st bad strike of Japanese encephalitis came in the 2005 monsoons.
To stem it, in 2006, a vaccination drive was introduced, but reports
suggest that only 35 percent of children were actually immunized. For
the next 3 years, no child got the vaccine. And now in 2010, as the
disease returns with a vengeance, the vaccines the Centre had rushed
to UP turned out to be of such poor quality that they were completely
unusable. The next vaccination drive is planned for November 2010.

[ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for forwarding the above report. It was in
response to the question posed by Mod.TY about the vaccination efforts
in this area of UP. The above report goes on to further express the
local pediatrician's frustration and criticism about the lack of
effective JE virus vaccination efforts.
