The Ministry of Health in Senegal notified the WHO of 3 cases of
yellow fever in Kedougou and Saraya Health districts, near the border
with Mali and Guinea Conakry on 26 Oct 2011.

The index case was a 25-year-old female who developed symptoms of
fever, headache and vomiting, with no history of yellow fever
vaccination. She consulted the military health post of Kedougou on 23
Jul 2011. The case was detected as part of a surveillance project for
dengue and chikungunya conducted in the region. The WHO reference
laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar confirmed
the case (IgM by ELISA test and plaque reduction neutralization test
or PRNT) on 10 Oct 2011.

On 10 and 11 Aug 2011, 2 other cases were reported -- a 29-year-old
female and a 3-year-old male. All 3 cases have fully recovered. An
outbreak investigation team assessed the situation in the Kedougou and
Saraya districts from 8-29 Aug 2011, where a total of 76 people
(suspected cases and their contacts, including 10 deaths) were
identified. Laboratory tests conducted showed no evidence of recent
yellow fever infection among the 76 people. However, the tests (IgG)
indicated that 20 of them had previously been exposed to yellow fever
virus or yellow fever vaccine.

The health districts of Kedougou and Saraya benefited from a
preventive mass vaccination campaign in December 2007, where the
vaccination coverage was 94.9 per cent and 94.8 per cent
respectively.

The Ministry of Health of Senegal plans to organize a vaccination
campaign in mid-December 2011, targeting the non-vaccinated
individuals aged 9 months and above, excluding pregnant women in
Kedougou, Saraya, and Salemata health districts. The mass vaccination
campaign aims to protect the susceptible population living in the
area, which appears to have increased due to recent migration from
neighboring countries. A total of 159 626 doses of vaccine from the
GAVI-funded yellow fever emergency vaccine stockpile has been released
by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine
Provision (YF-ICG) for the campaign.

[Although these cases occurred 3-4 months ago, it is good to see that
no subsequent cases were reported and no outbreak happened as it did
in 2005 in the Kedougou area (see ProMED-mail archive no 20030110.0083). This situation is a good example of surveillance
supported by competent laboratory support, followed by a vaccination
campaign. The vaccination coverage in Kedougou and Saraya districts of
a little more than 94 per cent of the eligible population is
impressive and doubtless was a key factor in preventing an outbreak in
this area. However, vaccination coverage is a dynamic situation in
areas where migration is significant. Reinitiation of the yellow fever
vaccination campaign in these fluid situations is prudent.

[According to the IHR (WHO's International Health Regulations), an
outbreak of a disease with international implications should be
reported upon first suspicion, with later lab confirmation. In this
case the index patient was seen on 23 July, and 2 other suspect cases
were reported on 10 and 11 August, yet no report was made to WHO for
public release. Lab results were positive on 10 October, yet even
then the report was only sent to WHO on 16 October, and the first
vaccination program to be held in the area since 2007 will begin only
this month (December 2011). They are lucky there has not been epidemic
spread in the 5 months since July.

Guinea has reported small numbers of YF cases annually in recent
years, Mali not since 2005 (see refs. below). - Mod.JW
