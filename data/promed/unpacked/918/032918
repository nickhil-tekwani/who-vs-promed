10 people have died of a strange disease that broke out in mid-Feb 2006
year in Tcholindi village, about 50 kilometers [about 30 miles - Mod.LL]
north of Mungo district, Angola's central Huambo province, Angop learned.
The information was released by Tcholindi's chief, Antonio Epalanga, who
said he does not know the origin of the disease that attacks the legs
before expanding to the intestines, killing the patient in less than a
week. The source expressed worry about the situation, as there are no
medicines to deal with this and other diseases.
Antonio Epalanga explained that in the last few days, 5 people from the
village were attacked by the disease and were rushed to the hospital in
Kuito, in the neighboring province of Bie, but ended up dying.
In his turn, Mungo administrator, Mateus Rodrigues Sanjala, traveled to
Tcholindi, but is still to identify the type and origin of the disease.
Public Health specialists are expected in the region in the coming days to
study the disease.
