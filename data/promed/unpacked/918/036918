Health authorities in Christchurch are dismissing the coincidence of 2
outbreaks of legionnaires' disease in the city in 2005.
An elderly man has died and 3 others have contracted the disease from
potting mix and compost bags. This latest occurrence is not connected to
the outbreak earlier in 2005 which left 3 people dead and was linked to
cooling towers.
Medical Officer of Health Dr Alistair Humphrey does not consider the 2
outbreaks strange. He says the first outbreak was unusual, but cases linked
to potting mix are nothing new and people often die from it. Dr Humphrey
says gardeners need to take extra care when opening potting mixes or
compost bags.

The death of a Christchurch man from bacteria inhaled from common gardening
potting mix has prompted a nation-wide warning. Health officials say dust
from potting mix and even garden compost can [cause] infection and should
be treated carefully, especially during warm periods.
With the onset of some warm weather, gardeners up and down the country are
being warned of the dangers potting mix following a death which has been
linked to it.
Christchurch health officials say they've also treated 3 other people
who've been in contact with potting mix who are now recovering
satisfactorily. Gardening as a pastime has obvious benefits for health and
fitness but for 4 Canterbury gardeners it's been anything but. 1 died and 3
others became sick after contracting legionnaires' disease from potting mix.
"Generally speaking it's inhaled which is why we advise people strongly to
dampen down potting mix before they use it and to open bags away from them
in case the bag is dried out and stuff flies up in front of their faces,"
says Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Alistair Humphrey.
"And it's not as uncommon as you might think. We usually get between about
5 and 8 cases per year and a lot of those are _Legionella longbeachae_
which is most of these cases," Dr. Humphrey said.

[_L. longbeachae_, originally described in 1981 (1), has been associated
with lower respiratory infection in normal and immunocompromised
individuals. The organism, especially in Australia, appears to be unique in
being associated with pneumonia after exposure to soil. The organism has
been found in soil and potting mixes from Australia but not from potting
mix made in Europe.
Importantly, the legionellae from the soil and the Australian patients
appear to be closely related (2,3). However, cases of _L. longbeachae_ (see
ProMED-mail posting: Legionellosis, potting soil - USA: May-Jun 2000
(20000904.1503)) associated with potting soil have been described in the
USA and Japan (4,5) as well.
Additionally, a presumed outbreak of hospital-related _L. longbeachae_
infection has been reported from Australia (6). The presumed source may
have been related to demolition of a building adjacent to the health care
facility.
