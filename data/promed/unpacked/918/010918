_E. coli_ outbreak linked to baby spinach
-----------------------------------------
Fast facts
Illnesses: 10
Hospitalizations: 2
Deaths: 0
States: 7
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that Josie's Organics prepackaged baby spinach may be contaminated with _E. coli_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 15 Nov 2021, a total of 10 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 7 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2021/o157h7-11-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 15 to 27 Oct 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2021/o157h7-11-21/epi.html).

Location / Number of sick people
--------------------------------
Indiana / 3
Iowa / 1
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 2
Missouri / 1
Ohio / 1
South Dakota / 1

Sick people range in age from 2 to 71 years, with a median age of 26, and 70% are female. Of 8 people with information available, 2 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _E. coli_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 6 people interviewed, 5 (83%) reported eating spinach in the week before they got sick.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

Officials in Minnesota found _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a package of leftover Josie's Organics baby spinach collected from a sick person's home. The leftover spinach had a "best by" date of 23 Oct 2021. WGS is underway and results will be reported once available.

Public health actions
---------------------
CDC is advising people not to eat, sell or serve Josie's Organics prepackaged baby spinach with "best by" date of 23 Oct 2021.

[ProMED awaits the results of the WGS testing to confirm that the EHEC isolated from a spinach sample was the same as the outbreak strain, that is, finding the "smoking gun." Although the classical source of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections is ground beef, fresh produce as in salad ingredients are also well represented as vehicles of transmission. - Mod.LL
