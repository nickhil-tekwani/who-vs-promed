More than 20,000 pigs in Kampung Sungai Nipah, Bukit Pelandok, are expected
to be killed over the next few days to check the spread of Japanese
encephalitis [JE in the area. State Executive Councillor and Lukut State
Assemblyman Datuk Dr Yeow Chai Thiam said the move followed the death of
four men, aged between 32 and 60, involved in the trade since last Friday.
"The pigs to be killed belonged to victims who died as well as those
admitted to hospital for suspected encephalitis," he said after meeting
with pig breeders today [Sunday, 28 Feb.
He said a victim died at the Seremban Hospital this morning, two others
died at the Tawakal Hospital in Kuala Lumpur yesterday while another
49-year-old man died at the Tawakal Hospital on Friday. Three of the
victims were from the village while the fourth was from Seremban.
Dr. Yeow said 13 others, including a 45-year-old woman, involved in the
business had also been admitted into various hospitals in Seremban and
Kuala Lumpur for suspected encephalitis.
"I had two meetings with the breeders [who agreed that pigs belonging to
those who died or were admitted into hospital would be destroyed.", he
said. He also said piglets brought in from other States would also be
destroyed.
He said that there were about 100 families involved in pig breeding in
Kampung Sungai Nipah with its pig population estimated at between 30,000
and 40,000. Bukit Pelandok is the biggest pig farming area in the country
and Southeast Asia with a population of 800,000 pigs reared by some 850
breeders.

[I assume that the decision to destroy pigs to control the spread of JE in
the human population was made after last week's conference on the diagnosis
and control of JE held in Ipoh, Malaysia, which was attended by several JE
experts from the region as well as Dr. Ted Tsai from CDC, USA.
According to Jane Cardosa of the University of Malaysia Sarawak (see
ProMED-mail post 990117185804) "JE is largely seasonal in Malaysia and
normally occurs during the months of Nov/Dec/Jan. The fact that we are
seeing an increase in JE cases during this period is therefore nothing new
nor particularly unusual. What is unusual about the fatal cases is that
they are young adults and they are dying."
Prof Lam Sai Kit of the University of Malaya at the above Ipoh conference
presented data showing that between 1989 and 1993. about 52% of the
reported cases were in children aged between 7 and 15 years and only 8%
were in adults older than 25 years. [[80% of patients in the recent Perak
outbreak were adults. - Mod CHC
It should be noted that in the current JE outbreak in Malaysia, not all the
reported cases have had their diagnosis confirmed by laboratory tests.
Health Officer Dr Marina Abdul Hamid, who reported on the outbreak in Kinta
district in Ipoh, said that out of the reported 24 cases of suspected JE,
only 9 "have been confirmed to carry the JE virus [not sure what test was
used while others have viral encephalitis."
Mod.JW (ProMED-mail post 990214190815) has suggested that "Either JE virus
has changed its characteristics this year, or there is a second virus
involved." and that "Malaysia has highly competent virologists who should
be able to give an answer." (I endorse that.) I hope there will be a
scientific report of the above Ipoh conference and be available soon to
update us on what is actually happening. - Mod.CYC
[This sounds to me as though it is an exceedingly complex situation. Data
are needed (and may already have been obtained, I simply do not know)
regarding vaccine coverage of the human population, vaccine coverage of the
pig population, prevalence of JEV in wild and domesticated birds in the
area, laboratory confirmation of clinical suspicions, evidence that killing
infected pigs (which do not have persistent infections) is a reasonable
choice and tool for virus control, molecular data regarding sequence
differences between the currently circulating strains and
prototype/historic strains, infection rate in children and adults with a
"history of vaccination against JEV", etc. This is a remarkable research
opportunity. - Mod.CHC
