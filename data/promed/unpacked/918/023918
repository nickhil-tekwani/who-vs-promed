At least 34 dead or dying ducks were discovered Friday night [29 Jun
2007] along Lake Monroe, adding to the mystery of 2-dozen dead birds
found earlier in the week.
Seminole County spokesman Steve Olson said that a number of adult
birds were among those found Friday night [29 Jun 2007] on Marina
Island, and that the ducks that were still alive appeared to be
paralyzed. All the dead ducks found before were juveniles.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is
investigating the deaths, but Olson said no cause had been
determined. He said avian flu had been ruled out.

[Interesting that only one species of avian is affected. My initial
impression is botulism. However, if someone has more detailed
information we would appreciate your sharing it with us.
