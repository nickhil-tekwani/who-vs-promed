Two people have been hospitalized with suspected anthrax and more
than 10 are under medical observation in the Nookenskiy rayon
[district] of Kyrgyzstan in the south of the country. The ministry of
emergencies of the country has announced that the people might have
contracted anthrax after eating contaminated beef. The results of the
laboratory testing are awaited.

The status of the hospitalized cases is satisfactory and all are
receiving appropriate treatment. The suspected infection happened on
[6 Jun 2011], when a farmer sold the meat of a sick animal to the
local villagers. The number of suspected cases is being specified.

[We now have some better numbers than in the previous report. 12 sick
and/or under observation is a common number for folk clinically
exposed to contaminated meat.
