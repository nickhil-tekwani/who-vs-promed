Prevention and control of influenza
-----------------------------------
This report updates the 2006 recommendations by the United States Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccine and
antiviral agents. [See: General recommendations on immunization:
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). MMWR 2006; 55(RR-15)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm> - Mod.CP].
The groups of persons for whom vaccination is recommended and the antiviral
medications recommended for chemoprophylaxis or treatment (oseltamivir or
zanamivir) have not changed.
Estimated vaccination coverage remains <50 per cent among certain groups
for whom routine annual vaccination is recommended, including young
children and adults with risk factors for influenza complications, health
care personnel (HCP), and pregnant women. Strategies to improve vaccination
coverage, including use of reminder/recall systems and standing orders
programs, should be implemented or expanded.
The 2007 recommendations include new and updated information. Principal
updates and changes include:
1) reemphasizing the importance of administering 2 doses of vaccine to all
children aged 6 months to 8 years if they have not been vaccinated
previously at any time with either live, attenuated influenza vaccine
(doses separated by >6 weeks) or trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
(doses separated by >4 weeks), with single annual doses in subsequent years;
2) recommending that children aged 6 months to 8 years who received only
one dose in their 1st year of vaccination receive 2 doses the following
year, with single annual doses in subsequent years;
3) highlighting a previous recommendation that all persons, including
school-aged children, who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with
influenza or of transmitting influenza to others should be vaccinated;
4) emphasizing that immunization providers should offer influenza vaccine
and schedule immunization clinics throughout the influenza season;
5) recommending that health care facilities consider the level of
vaccination coverage among HCP to be one measure of a patient safety
quality program and implement policies to encourage HCP vaccination (such
as obtaining signed statements from HCP who decline influenza vaccination); and
6) using the 2007-2008 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)-like (new for this season), A/Wisconsin/67/2005
(H3N2)-like, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like antigens.
This report and other information is available at CDC's influenza website
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu>. Updates or supplements to these recommendations
(such as expanded age or risk group indications for currently licensed
vaccines) might be required. Immunization providers should be alert to
announcements of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza
website periodically for additional information.
