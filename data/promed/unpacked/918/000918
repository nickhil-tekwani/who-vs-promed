Two new cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were reported today [21 Dec 2022] by the Epidemiology Department of Provincial Regional Health, bringing the total cases in 2022 to 36. The new cases are of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and both patients, a 33 year old man and a 49 year old woman, are from the Tonosi district.

To date, 21 HCPS and 15 hantavirus fever cases have been registered, without fatalities. The district [in Los Santos province] with the most cases is Tonosi with 10 fever cases and 13 HCPS cases, followed by Los Santos with 3 fever cases and 4 HCPS cases, Las Tablas with 1 fever and 2 HCPS cases, and Macaracas with 1 fever and 1 HCPS case.

MINSA [Ministerio de salud; ministry of health] recommends that people keep their houses and surroundings clean and keep grains (such as rice and maize) in sealed containers in order to avoid contact with rodents and their feces and urine. It is also recommended that premises are kept clean and that inside stoves and utensils are protected to prevent the rodent from having any kind of contact.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) says that hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is transmitted via inhalation of saliva, urine, or excreta of infected rodents. The symptoms include fatigue, fever, and myalgia, especially in the thighs, hips, and back. Patients also present with headache, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. From 4-10 days after the initial phase of the disease, the symptoms include cough and severe diarrhea that require intensive care. It can cause death.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus and cases occur there every year. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms ProMED's conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
