[According to the above report, the disease continued during January to April 2013, with 17 villages affected in January 2013, 15 in February 2013, 18 in March 2013, and 6 villages in April 2013. Their respective locations and the situation in May 2013 remain to be noted.

A summarising map of the 49 SAT 2 outbreaks officially reported to the OIE throughout the epizootic which started in February 2012 is available in the bottom of the archived accumulating report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013290_20130524_152230.pdf.

Egypt declared the outbreak "resolved" on 27 Jul 2012; this was probably based on the assumption that the disease became endemic.

Subscribers' attention is drawn to Egypt's decision to contract quantities of the exotic FMDV serotypes SAT 1 and Asia 1 vaccines "for emergency vaccination as a precautionary step to provide in case of introduction of these 2 serotypes." - Mod.AS]
