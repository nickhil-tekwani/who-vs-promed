Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[In the last week, only 9 cases are reported with no more deaths. More than a 1/3rd of the cases had neither homelessness nor substance abuse risk factors. Further follow up can underscore whether this decrease is a trend. It is possible that subclinical hepatitis A in food handlers may be responsible for some of the cases with no clear risk factors. Three additional MSMs, 1 additional health care worker and 1 additional food service worker are reported as primary cases. Recommending hepatitis A vaccination among food handlers, as done in San Diego County, should be a consideration in Michigan. - Mod.LL]

One of the fears surrounding San Diego's hepatitis A outbreak may have been realized. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that 2 tourists who visited San Diego to attend a Metallica concert in August 2017 developed cases of hepatitis A when they returned home to Utah.

One of the men contacted the Union-Tribune because of reporting about a Pacific Beach restaurant, World Famous, where a worker had tested positive for hepatitis A. The man, a 43-year-old, said he and his friends ate at World Famous. A San Diego County official told the Union-Tribune that the county is aware of the Utah cases. "We are certain they did not contract hepatitis A from our known case [at World Famous]," county spokesman Michael Workman told the Union-Tribune. "More likely culprits would be publicly-shared bathrooms on or off property, another unknown infected person, or any contaminated surface in or around the establishment."

California health officials have stepped up their hepatitis A prevention efforts in recent days as new fronts emerge in the battle against the state's massive outbreak. Most of the 20 people killed and more than 600 sickened in the outbreak that began in San Diego were homeless. But cases have begun to surge in Los Angeles County among gay and bisexual men who are not homeless. And an LAPD officer who works on skid row was recently infected with the virus.

As a result, county officials have called for first responders, members of law enforcement working in the field, and men who have sex with men -- as well as homeless people -- to get vaccinated against hepatitis A. "We've got to be there with those that we're asking to help us deal with our homeless population," said L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn. "We've got to be as concerned about their public safety as we are the safety of those who are sleeping on the streets. ... This could be a huge public health crisis."

California declared a state of emergency last month [October 2017] because of the outbreak, which now ranks as the 2nd-worst in the nation in more than 2 decades.

Hepatitis A outbreak:

544 cases in San Diego County
76 cases in Santa Cruz County
29 cases in LA County
14 cases elsewhere in the state

LA County has seen 15 reported cases among those who are homeless or use recreational drugs since the outbreak began. But officials say an unrelated hepatitis A outbreak affecting the LGBT community has sickened 14 gay or bisexual men in 2017, compared with 9 in 2016 and 1 in 2015.

"The sheer number of cases ... is what's alarming," said Dr. Adam Cohen, director of advocacy and policy research for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The uptick is particularly worrisome because there have been recent large hepatitis A outbreaks among gay men in Colorado and New York, as well as in Chile and several countries in Europe, said Dr. Prabhu Gounder, a medical epidemiologist with LA County's public health department. "What we were concerned about is that we're at the beginning of a similar trend in LA, and we wanted to get ahead of that," Gounder said. Some in LA County who are infected had traveled to regions with outbreaks, he said.

Officials in San Diego County ramped up efforts to vaccinate gay and bisexual men. There have been 13 gay or bisexual men infected there in 2017, compared with 1 or 2 in a typical year. Gay and bisexual men generally are at high risk for hepatitis A and make up 10 percent of all new cases in the USA each year, according to the CDC.

The recently infected officer, said Los Angeles Police Protective League director Mark Cronin, is assigned to the LAPD's Central Division, which includes downtown. "Anybody that goes to Central Division drives through or walks through skid row every day," he said.

On Tue 7 Nov 2017, the LA County Board of Supervisors approved a motion asking the health department to make sure there was enough vaccine to cover the first responders most at risk of being infected. About 18 000 doses of hepatitis A vaccine have been distributed by the department, 3500 of which have gone to first responders.

"Our first responders are our 1st point of contact with many of our homeless, especially in the downtown skid row area, and it's important we provide all resources available," Supervisor Kathryn Barger said.

Gounder said that the risk of service providers contracting hepatitis A while working is not high. People who live or spend time downtown and don't fall into the high-risk groups should not be concerned about hepatitis A, he said. "For the general community ... just by being in the environment, we think the risk associated with that is extremely low," Gounder said.

For those who are homeless and at highest risk of contracting hepatitis A, there's a dire shortage of bathrooms and wash stations on skid row, said Amy Turk, president of the Los Angeles Central Providers Collaborative and chief program officer with Downtown Women's Center.

A report produced by activists and service providers found that sanitation conditions on skid row fall below USA standards for refugee camps, with 9 public toilets available overnight for the 1800 people living on the streets. "Most of the bathrooms shut down at night," Turk said. "Come nighttime, folks have virtually no option but to use the streets."

[4] Nationwide cases/Vaccine availability

An ongoing hepatitis A outbreak among more than 1200 people in at least 5 states, with more than 800 hospitalizations and 40 deaths, has local and state officials struggling to meet vaccination needs.

Many of the victims of the outbreak -- described by the California Department of Public Health as the largest person-to-person hepatitis A outbreak in America since a vaccine for the virus became available in the mid-1990s -- are homeless people or substance abusers, or both. However, 1/3rd of the 644 confirmed ill people in California and a 4th of the 495 confirmed ill people in Southeast Michigan are neither homeless nor substance abusers. Other states reporting confirmed outbreak cases are Utah, Arizona and Colorado.

City, county, and state officials from Ohio to Alabama and back to California are entertaining discussions about how they can decrease the possibility of outbreaks in their communities and how to curb outbreaks already underway. Those efforts include considering whether to open new public restrooms; raiding areas where substance abusers and homeless people are known to congregate; and closing down food programs for the homeless operated by churches and charitable organizations.

Cases across the country in people of all walks of life have been confirmed by laboratory evidence as well as epidemiologic evidence. The outbreak is caused by related strains of the same hepatitis A virus genotype (IB), which is not commonly seen in the USA, according to public health officials.

As frantic as local and state officials are, with some posting weekly victim counts and details about vaccination locations, federal officials have been less vocal. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last posted an outbreak update on 8 Aug 2017, saying: "Vaccination is safe and an effective approach for hepatitis A prevention, so it is a focus of the public health response to several ongoing outbreaks." The HHS department page did not have current outbreak counts as of Thu 9 Nov 2018.

The CDC updated some of its outbreak information as recently as Monday, 6 Nov 2017, posting Utah's case count of 57 victims with 30 hospitalizations. However, as of Thu 9 Nov 2017, the CDC outbreak page was still showing 27 Oct 2017 numbers from California. The CDC has not updated its "Current Vaccine Shortages & Delays" information on hepatitis A vaccine since mid-October 2017, although officials in California and Michigan have been complaining for weeks that supplies are running short of demand.

"In light of ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis A among adults in several U.S. cities, the demand for adult hepatitis A vaccine has increased substantially over the past 6 months, and vaccine supply to meet this unexpected demand in the USA has become constrained," according to the CDC website. Those "constrained" supplies led California Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency on 13 Oct 2017 in an effort to secure more of the vaccine. Under the declaration, the state can "purchase additional vaccines directly from manufacturers and coordinate distribution to people at greatest risk in affected areas," according to the California Department of Public Health. But the CDC reports the 2 USA-licensed manufacturers of hepatitis A vaccine for adults, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck Vaccines, are having difficulties meeting demand, regardless how it's being purchased.

"Merck has reported that its adult hepatitis A vaccine is temporarily unavailable for shipping," according to the CDC's mid-October [2017] update.

Other details on the vaccine supply were not available this week from the CDC. Questions submitted to the agency Monday morning [6 Nov 2017] by Food Safety News had not been answered as of Thursday night, 9 Nov 2017.

The ongoing outbreak includes restaurant workers in at least 2 states, California and Michigan, but officials at all levels say foodservice employees are not the cause of the outbreak. Rather, they are victims themselves of the highly contagious virus. That assurance does nothing to protect the consumers who ate at restaurants where infected employees were working. From Champs Rotisserie and Spirits in Grosse Point Woods, MI, to MacKenzie's Sports Bar and Grille in Sacramento, CA, diners have been advised to seek post-exposure shots to help prevent infection. The post-exposure treatment must be taken within 2 weeks of exposure to be effective. However, that window of opportunity can be closed before it even opens because infected foodservice workers may not be diagnosed in time for customers to be treated.

Foodservice workers can spread the hepatitis A virus by working while infected, which often occurs because infected people are contagious before they develop symptoms. That fact, combined with failure to follow proper hygiene and handwashing procedures is a recipe for disaster in any foodservice operation.

One solution would be for all restaurant and other foodservice workers to be vaccinated for hepatitis A. Unlike most children in the USA, who since 2000 have been routinely vaccinated against the virus, the majority of adults in the USA have not received the vaccine.

"Restaurants can't require their employees to be vaccinated," said Seattle food safety attorney Bill Marler. "But they can encourage them to do so, and they can pay for the vaccinations. Restaurant owners who don't are just being stupid, willfully stupid." Marler doesn't believe the government should mandate hepatitis A vaccinations for foodservice workers, though. He sees the situation as one of industry engaging in self-policing. "I don't think it's really a government thing, it's a self-protection thing for restaurants," Marler said. "I've taken millions of dollars from restaurants in the past 15 years because they had employees who weren't vaccinated."

Those millions involved reimbursement for consumers who sought post-exposure treatment. Just paying for the doctor visits, injections and time away from work adds up quickly when tens of thousands of people are involved. Marler said it is much less expensive to pay for employees to be vaccinated than to pay for customers to receive post-exposure treatment. Restaurant owners can also be on the hook for hepatitis A outbreaks related to food that was contaminated before they took possession of it. Such outbreaks usually have many more illnesses than those associated with an infected employee.

In 2016, an outbreak traced to frozen, raw scallops imported from the Philippines and served at Genki Sushi restaurants in Hawaii sickened 292 people and killed 2. Also in 2016, a hepatitis A outbreak traced to frozen strawberries imported from Egypt and served at Tropical Smoothie restaurants sickened 134 people in 9 states.

In 2003, an outbreak among patrons of a Chi Chi's [restaurant] in Beaver County, PA sickened more than 650 people and killed 4. The victims included at least 13 employees of the restaurant and numerous residents of 6 other states. The outbreak was traced to fresh green onions. More than 9000 people who had eaten at the restaurant during the period of potential exposure, or who had been exposed to ill people, received post-exposure treatment. "There's no question that contaminated food can make for bigger outbreaks," Marler said. "It's an efficient way to poison people."

Food safety regulations and testing can help decrease outbreaks traced to contaminated food, but the dozens of outbreaks traced to infected workers each year are completely preventable. The vaccination takes care of the problem before it starts, Marler said. He also said the one positive from hepatitis A scares that cause restaurant goers to seek post-exposure injections is the lasting impact such situations have.

"The success of the post-exposure vaccine can be seen because there are fewer people getting sick over the long run," Marler said

[The Southern California and Southeast Michigan outbreaks, with spillovers into some other states, are unusual in that the outbreaks are not primarily related to food exposures but rather related to person-to-person spread and sanitation issues. Those not in the high-risk groups may well have been infected by asymptomatic HAV infected food handlers. - Mod.LL
