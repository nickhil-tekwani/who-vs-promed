Florida strawberries are being attacked by an aggressive fungus. Experts say _Pestalotiopsis_ is not a new fungus, but this seems to be a "different species". It's reported to be a lot more progressive than what has been seen before.

One grower lost as many as 80 acres. Wish Farms said it has been widespread since Christmas [2019]. "At this point, we've lost about 40% of the crop; we've just abandoned the fields because it got so bad." They said it mainly affected organic crops because farmers are limited on what fungicides they can use.

Natalia Peres, University of Florida, said nurseries outside the state are likely the source. Florida gets its plants from Canada, California and North Carolina, but it's too early to say where exactly it came from. "We suspect that it has to do with other plants around the nurseries, that this fungus jumped to strawberries. It's spread by water and we had a lot of rain. The fungus is also favored by warm temperatures, which we had in December [2019]. So it just had the perfect conditions."

Researchers are working with nurseries to solve the problem and will be watching the fungus to make sure it does not find another host plant to establish itself in Florida.

[Root and crown rot of strawberry is caused by _Neopestalotiopsis clavispora_ (Nc; previously _Pestalotiopsis clavispora_), which can also cause leaf spot and fruit rot on the crop. It was known as a pathogen of blueberries with a plant mortality of up to 30% per cent but was only recently identified in Europe as affecting strawberries. Nc symptoms on strawberry may include discolouration or necrosis of crown and root, slow growth and stunting of plants, poor root development and weakening or premature death of transplants.

Fungal spores are mainly spread by rain and wind. External stress factors and bad growing conditions of the host favour disease development. Not much is known about the life cycle of the fungus. Disease management may include cultural methods (no overhead irrigation, removal of affected plants, optimising plant nutrition), phytosanitary measures and sprays with agrochemicals or copper fungicides.

In the report above, it is claimed that the outbreak appears to be due to a "different species". However, while the noted increased aggressiveness of the disease may indeed point towards a new emerging fungal strain, it may also be due to the perfect conditions for disease development, as described as well. Molecular studies would be needed to identify a potential new strain.

Some species of _Pestalotiopsis_ also affect strawberries with similar symptoms. _P. palmarum_ causes grey leaf spot (or leaf blight) of coconut and other related palms (for more information, see ProMED-mail post 20160608.4272407).
