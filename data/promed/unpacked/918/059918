Malaria outbreak in Bobirwa
---------------------------
A total of 6 people have died of malaria in the Bobirwa area, while
201 others were treated for the disease, a public health specialist
has said. Dr. Trude Arnesen, who covers Selebi-Phikwe and Bobonong
areas, said these were confirmed cases from Mmadinare, Bobonong and
Selebi-Phikwe hospitals since 1 Mar 2008 to date.

"So far we have 6 deaths and 201 sick lab-confirmed cases, and this
is unusually high in Bobirwa as the area usually report few cases,"
she said. "And it's double the figure of the previous 2 years." A 600
figure have not been confirmed.

Bobirwa areas include Mmadinare, Bobonong and areas around
Selebi-Phikwe. Badly hit areas include Tshokwe, Motlhabaneng, Tobane
and Bobonong and some of the patients from these areas are treated in
Selebi-Phikwe.

Dr. Arnesen said she feared that some people were not coming forward
because they did not know they had malaria, especially that the
disease had vague flu-like symptoms which included muscle pain,
chills, fever, vomiting and headache as main symptoms.

"The message we want to get through to the people is for them avoid
being bitten by the mosquito by putting on protective clothing, using
mosquito repellents, nets and spray rooms before they go to sleep,"
she said. Most vulnerable people are babies and pregnant women.

Dr Arnesen said clinics and hospitals in Bobirwa had started rapid
tests for malaria on all patients who visit their facility to aid
detecting disease early and treating affected people. She said a new
treatment drug called co-artem was in place to treat patients and was
more effective than previously used drugs which the mosquito parasite
has developed resistance to.

She said district health teams were on high alert and working hard to
test patients and to provide treatment. Mosquito bed-nets would be
provided to pregnant women.

However, Selebi-Phikwe was still not much affected by the outbreak
although medics were on alert to monitor the situation. BOPA

[Selebi-Phikwe is considered a low risk area for malaria. It is
located at the eastern tip of Botswana close to Zimbabwe and the
Republic of South Africa. An increase could be linked to an increase
of malaria in Zimbabwe, either through an increased trans border
transmission or through the influx of refugees from Zimbabwe infected
with malaria. Co-artem is an artemisinin derivative effective against
P.falciparum infections, resistant to other drugs.
