Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus - Papua New Guinea [2 Jul 2018]
-------------------------
On 21 May 2018, the regional polio reference laboratory reported to WHO the isolation of vaccine derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) from a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Lae, Morobe province, Papua New Guinea. The onset of the child's paralysis occurred on [24 Apr 2018].

In response to this single case of VDPV1, enhanced surveillance and active case finding were implemented, including the collection of stool samples from household and community contacts of the index case.

On [20 Jun 2018], the regional polio reference laboratory notified WHO of the isolation of VDPV1 from the stools of 2 healthy community contacts of the index case. These results were sent to the global polio reference laboratory at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and it was confirmed on [21 Jun 2018] that these 2 isolates are genetically linked to the index case, indicating the circulation of poliovirus within the community.

Public health response
----------------------
In response to the detection of poliovirus in the index case, mop-up vaccination was undertaken in Lae where the case lives and in Eastern Highlands province where the case had stayed prior to onset of paralysis. In addition, medical record review and active case searching was undertaken in the affected province to identify any missed cases of AFP.

Prior to the detection of VDPV1 in contacts of the index case, preparation is underway for implementation of broader polio supplementary immunization activities as well as surveillance system strengthening in the affected province and surrounding provinces.

WHO is working with partners to support the Government of Papua New Guinea to undertake appropriate outbreak response measures in accordance with the requirements under the temporary recommendations of the International Health Regulation's (IHR) Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus and standard operating procedures of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).

- Statement of the Seventeenth IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus [available at: http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/10-05-2018-statement-of-the-seventeenth-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-the-international-spread-of-poliovirus]
- Temporary Recommendations to Reduce International Spread of Poliovirus [available at: http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/public-health-emergency-status/]

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized.

A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country and suboptimal surveillance for AFP and poliovirus, the risk of further spread of cVDPV within the country is deemed to be high. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.

WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread of poliovirus from Papua New Guinea to be low, as the affected province shares no international borders.

WHO emphasizes the need for a full and complete outbreak response in line with the GPEI Standard Operating Procedures: Responding to a poliovirus event or outbreak. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with persons who frequently travel to and have contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of bivalent oral poliovirus (bOPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. International travellers undertaking urgent travel should receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure. Travellers should be provided with a written record of such vaccination, preferably using the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Some polio-free countries may require travellers resident in polio affected countries to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. The International Travel and Health country list provides a summary of country's requirements for incoming travellers.

Alarming polio outbreak spreads in Congo, threatening global eradication efforts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overshadowed by the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), another frightening virus is on the loose in that vast, chaotic country: polio. Public health experts have worked for months to stamp out the virus, but it keeps spreading. It has already paralyzed 29 children, and on [21 Jun 2018] a case was reported on the border with Uganda, far outside the known outbreak zone, heightening fears that the virus will sweep across Africa. The DRC is "absolutely" the most worrisome polio outbreak today, says Michel Zaffran, who heads the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland.

The outbreak also underscores the latest complication on the bumpy road toward polio eradication. It is caused not by the wild virus hanging on by a thread in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and perhaps Nigeria, but by a rare mutant derived from the weakened live virus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which has regained its neurovirulence and the ability to spread. As OPV campaigns have driven the wild virus to near-extinction, these circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) have emerged as the greatest threat to polio eradication. If the outbreaks are not stopped quickly, polio scientists warn, they could spiral out of control, setting eradication efforts back years. "There is an urgency" to stopping these vaccine-derived outbreaks, says epidemiologist Nicholas Grassly of Imperial College London. "It is so much more important than controlling the wild virus."

Safe and effective, OPV has long been the workhorse of the eradication effort. But a feature that makes the vaccine so powerful can also be a serious downside. For a short time after vaccination, the weakened live virus can spread from person to person, boosting immunity even in those who didn't receive the polio drops. But in rare instances, in poor countries such as the DRC where many children have not been vaccinated, the virus can continue circulating for years, accumulating mutations until it reverts to its dangerous form. The vast majority of cVDPVs are caused by serotype 2, one of 3 variants of the virus.

Almost as soon as cVDPVs were discovered in 2000, the World Health Assembly in Geneva declared that all use of OPV must stop when the wild virus was gone. In 2016, with the threat of cVDPVs looming larger -- they now cause more cases of paralysis than the wild virus -- GPEI decided waiting was no longer an option. By then, poliovirus type 2 had been eradicated in the wild, which meant that every type 2 virus originated from the vaccine itself. In April of that year [2016], the 155 countries still using the trivalent vaccine, which targets all 3 polio variants, replaced it with a bivalent vaccine with the type 2 component removed. No one knew exactly how this experiment would play out. It was clear, however, that for a few years some type 2 outbreaks would still occur - either those that had started before "the switch," as it is called, but had not been detected or those caused by the last use of trivalent OPV.

In a virological catch 22, the only way to stop type 2 outbreaks is with a version of the same vaccine that gave rise to them in the 1st place -- somehow without seeding another one. The virus in the inactivated polio vaccine cannot revert, but it simply does not pack enough punch to stop an outbreak.

A virus on the march
--------------------
In the past year, multiple vaccine-derived polioviruses have paralyzed children across the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
[an excellent map of spread is available at the source URL above: (MAP) A. CUADRA/SCIENCE; (DATA) WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION]

To fight these outbreaks, created a closely guarded stockpile of a new monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2), which can only be released with the approval of the director-general of WHO. If mOPV2 is used judiciously and sparingly, it can stop an outbreak without starting a future one, Zaffran says. Speed is essential because population immunity to the type 2 virus is waning now that it has been removed from the vaccine, setting the stage for an explosive outbreak.

The type 2 vaccine has been released to fight outbreaks in 10 countries, and so far the strategy seems to be working, although a type 2 outbreak in Syria paralyzed 74 children before coming under control last year [2017 -- see ProMED-mail posts referenced below. - Mod.MPP] The outlier is the DRC.

The outbreak was first detected in June 2017 in Maniema province in the middle of the country. Within days, another case was reported about 900 kilometers [559 mi] away in Haut-Lomami province in the southeast. Genetic analysis revealed it wasn't the same strain as in Maniema, but a type 2 cVDPV that had emerged independently. Even worse, the sequences indicated both had been circulating undetected for at least 2 years.

The country and its international partners targeted mOPV2 campaigns to 8 health districts deemed at highest risk -- the minimum, experts thought, to get the maximum effect. But vaccination campaigns in the DRC, with its remote villages, crumbling infrastructure, and weak health system, are tough. They failed to reach enough children. The Haut-Lomami virus broke through, spreading south to Tanganyika and then Haut-Katanga.

Then in the 1st week of June [2018], officials confirmed another case on the other side of the country, not far from the Ebola outbreak, where health workers are already stretched thin. This strain, too, emerged independently, an indication of just how weak surveillance is in the country. More alarming still, about 2 weeks later a polio case was reported in the northeast, close to the Uganda border. The Haut-Lomami virus had made the big jump northward, to an area where no mOPV2 campaigns were underway. "This really increases the risk of international spread," says Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesperson for polio eradication at WHO. And insecurity in parts of the province "makes everything more dangerous and more complicated."

In the worst case - if type 2 explodes across Africa, or if case numbers shoot up exponentially - the only option would be to reintroduce OPV2 into routine immunization, says Mark Pallansch, a molecular virologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The switch will have failed, turning back the eradication clock years and ratcheting up costs, which now run about USD $1 billion a year, to the dismay of tapped-out funders.

But that scenario is years away, Zaffran says. Pallansch agrees. "At present, I truly believe [type 2] cVDPVs can be managed. The only question is for how much longer," he says. "I have yet to see anything that makes me think eradication is not possible. But the endgame is proving to be much more complicated than eradicating the wild virus."

[The outbreak of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea and the outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the Congo DR serve to further highlight the challenges facing the goal of global eradication of polio. Note that I refer to a single outbreak in Papua New Guinea, but to more than one outbreak in Congo DR, reflecting the genetics of the cVDPV2 isolates. It is also noteworthy that both outbreaks in the Congo DR are related to cVDPV2s that have been circulating undetected for 1-2 years, serving to further emphasize the challenges faced in areas with sub-optimal surveillance combined with suboptimal vaccination coverages.

I have previously expressed concern about the use of mOPV2 (monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2) to stop the cVDPV2 outbreaks, resulting in a Catch 22 situation, where the "cure" may create further disease, resulting in a vicious cycle. The discussion presented by Leslie Roberts in [2] above is right on target, with the outbreaks in the DR Congo serving to bring these concerns to the forefront. - Mod.MPP
