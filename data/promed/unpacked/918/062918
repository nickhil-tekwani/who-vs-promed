There have been 17 confirmed cases of _E.coli_ O157 infection in Leicester
prison, and 5 prisoners have been admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary for
observation.
A range of experts have been involved in investigating these cases,
including PHLS staff, the Health Authority and the City Council.
Information on personal hygiene has been issued to prisoners, staff and
visitors to help minimise person-to-person spread of the organism.
Further information on this incident is available from the Home Office
press office.
