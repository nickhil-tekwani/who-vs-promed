Fatal chicken disease a blow to food security in Burundi
--------------------------------------------------------
Food security in Burundi's Kayanza province is under threat because
of an untreatable disease that has killed more than 1000 chickens in
one commune, according to a senior official.

"The disease has also been reported in other parts of the country but
total numbers of dead chickens are not [yet] available," the director
of the Animal Health Department in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Stockbreeding, Pierre Bukuru, told IRIN. "With the pandemic among the
chickens, the population will face a significant lack of animal
proteins and many people will suffer from the shortage, as chicken is
widely raised and consumed in Burundi," he added.

Bukuru said the illness, which has similar symptoms to Newcastle
Disease, was affecting the economic lives of people raising chickens
or trading in meat and eggs.

"Egg production has dropped by 80 percent," he said.

He added that the meat of infected chickens did not pose a threat to
human health as long as it was well-cooked. And although the disease
itself can be passed on to humans, the only effects are mild conjunctivitis.

Laboratory tests were being carried out to determine the precise
identity of the disease, although he ruled out the possibility of it
being avian influenza.

"Bird flu has not yet reached Burundi up to now," Bukuru said.

No treatment is available for the disease, and although chicks can be
vaccinated, doing so would be impractical in a country where most
poultry is kept by individual households.

[Kayanza is situated in northern Burundi, adjacent to the border with
Rwanda; map at

The HPAI H5N1 outbreak so far closest to Burundi, was reported more
than 1000 km (620 miles) away, namely in Juba, southern Sudan, in Oct
2006 (see map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?WAHIDPHPSESSID=45ca2b5d8490369d72ba5d634274b19a&selected_start_day=1&selected_start_month=1&selected_start_year=2005&selected_end_day=31&selected_end_month=12&selected_end_year=2008&page=disease_outbreak_map&date_submit=OK>).

Differentiation between Newcastle disease ("Pseudo fowl plague") and
Highly pathogenic avian influenza ("fowl plague") can be achieved in
the laboratory. Information on the laboratory test results, hopefully
excluding avian influenza, is anticipated. - Mod.AS

Newcastle disease symptoms include respiratory symptoms and diarrhea,
symptoms shared with avian flu, therefore a lab test is essential to
distinguish the 2 infections. ProMED last reported NDV in Africa in
2005 -- see ProMED archives below. OIE's WAHID database shows Burundi
reported NDV twice in 2005 but without specifying the number of
outbreaks.

Link to WAHID: <http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=home>,
select Disease information from the left margi, then specify Single
Region and Africa, starting Jan 2005 (the furthest back the database
currently extends). - Mod.JW]
