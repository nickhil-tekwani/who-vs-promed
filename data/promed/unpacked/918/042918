Bird flu maintained its relentless march across the globe on Tuesday [21 Feb
2006] with Malaysia the latest country to report an outbreak in poultry, while
in India hundreds of people turned up at medical camps in bird flu-hit areas.
At least 12 nations worldwide reported outbreaks over the past 3 weeks [see
updated figures in final commentary]. Migratory birds are thought to be at
least one way the disease is being carried.
Bosnia confirmed its 1st cases of bird flu on Monday [20 Feb 2006].
Croatia reported its second outbreak.
Germany: soldiers in biohazard suits were deployed to prevent the spread of
bird flu after H5N1 reached the mainland.
India: 8 people have been quarantined as officials scramble to contain a major
outbreak of bird flu in poultry before it takes hold in the world's second
most populous nation. So far, there are no confirmed human cases.
Malaysia stepped up its defences against bird flu on Tuesday, killing poultry
and sending health officials to track any human infections, after it reported
its 1st case of the H5N1 virus in more than a year. "There's no cause for
worry because no human beings are infected," Malaysian Health Minister Chua
Soi Lek Chua said. The fresh case of bird flu hit shares of poultry farms and
prompted neighbour Singapore to suspend imports from the central Malaysian
state of Selangor, where officials said the virus had killed 40 chickens last
week.
China's agriculture minister told state media more bird flu epidemics were
possible this spring because of the movement of migratory birds after the
winter, and more shipping of poultry as the new breeding season begins. 8
people have died of bird flu in China and more than 30 outbreaks in poultry
and wild birds were recorded last year. State media said on Tuesday [21 Feb
2006] the government has banned imports of pet and wild birds from 10
countries recently hit by bird flu.
Italy: 30 000 workers have been laid off in the poultry industry as demand for
chicken meat plunged by 70 percent, while in parts of India, sales have also
dived.
Egyptian officials said bird flu had spread to new parts of the country,
adding to the devastation in a poultry industry which provided a vital part of
Egyptians' diet.
In Europe, officials urged people to carry on eating poultry meat despite
outbreaks of the lethal H5N1 bird flu strain, saying European Union
authorities had the means available to wipe out the disease. A string of EU
countries have now confirmed H5N1 in wild birds, knocking consumer confidence
in poultry meat -- especially chicken. But the EU farm chief rejected requests
from member states to support poultry prices saying the situation had not yet
become sufficiently severe.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday [20 Feb 2006] that
mutations in the H5N1 virus are seemingly making it more deadly in chickens
and more resistant in the environment, but without yet increasing the threat
to humans.
The recent surge in outbreaks in Europe, Asia and Africa has led to a plunge
in poultry sales. The WHO says well-cooked chicken meat and eggs are safe to
eat. But consumers are afraid.

Bird flu spreads, thousands tested in India
-------------------------------------------
Hungary & Croatia: the H5N1 strain of bird flu was confirmed in Hungary &
Croatia on Tuesday [21 Feb 2006] as the deadly virus spread around the globe,
while EU officials considered measures to vaccinate millions of birds in
France and the Netherlands.
India: officials are scrambling to contain a major outbreak in poultry,
hundreds of people turned up for screening at medical camps in areas where
bird flu has been reported.
Hungary said on Tuesday that tests showed the virus in 3 dead swans found last
week.
Croatia also confirmed H5N1 had been found in a dead swan on an island in the
Adriatic.
Bosnia confirmed its 1st cases of bird flu on Monday [20 Feb 2006].
Malaysia said the H5N1 avian flu virus killed chickens near the capital [Kuala
Lumpur].
France & Netherlands: in Brussels, EU animal health experts met to consider
requests from France and the Netherlands, among Europe's biggest poultry
producers, to be allowed to vaccinate millions of birds against avian
influenza. "The Commission is considering plans that were submitted last night
by the French and Dutch authorities," a European Commission official told
reporters. "Every country that wants to do preventive vaccination has to
submit a plan, explaining the controls that they will apply to distinguish
between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals," he said.
UK: in London, the famous ravens at the Tower of London were brought inside to
protect them from bird flu. Legend has it that if the ravens leave the Tower,
where the Crown Jewels are stored, the Kingdom will fall.
At least 15 nations have reported outbreaks in birds this month, an indication
that the virus is spreading faster [or that surveillance is at last being
tajen seriously? - Mod.JW]
Migratory birds are thought to be at least one way the disease is being
carried and more than 30 countries have now reported cases since 2003, 7 of
them recording human infections.
The WHO says thoroughly cooked poultry meat and eggs are safe to eat but that
assurance has failed to calm consumers.

The Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry Ministry has confirmed that the deaths
of chickens at 4 villages along Jalan Genting-Klang here last week were caused
by the H5N1 strain of the avian influenza.
However, Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the people need not worry as
there was no human fatality. "Laboratory tests by the Veterinary Laboratory in
Petaling Jaya and the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh confirmed the
cause of death was due to the H5N1 strain," he said in a statement to Bernama
yesterday.
Muhyiddin, who is in Dubai where he is heading a trade mission, said all
chickens in Kampung Pasir Wardieburn, Taman Danau Kota, Pekan Danau Kota and
Kampung Belakang JPJ had been culled.[Kampong or kampung is a word in Malay
which means "village"]. "The Veterinary Services Department, Kuala Lumpur City
Hall, and the Health Ministry had initiated an immediate and integrated action
to control the disease from spreading," he added.
Besides culling the chicken, the integrated action also included setting up
checkpoints and patrolling the roads in the affected areas to prevent chickens
from being moved out, he added.
He said all chicken coops in the area would be disinfected, and urged the
public to contact the department if there were any large-scale deaths of any
type of bird.
Selangor and Federal Territory Poultry Traders Association adviser Datuk Dr
Lee Chong Meng said the public should not be unduly alarmed as the Government
had acted swiftly to deal with the affected chickens in Gombak.
Dr Lee said it was possible that the villagers smuggled in fighting cocks from
Thailand and these birds may have infected the kampung chickens.
He stressed that the public should not over-react and chickens were still safe
for consumption as no commercial chickens were involved.
Meanwhile, Singapore is suspending poultry and egg imports from Selangor with
immediate effect, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) said in a
statement yesterday. The current suspension will not affect poultry imports
from Johor, Malacca, Perak and Negri Sembilan which are free from the deadly
avian flu virus. The AVA said although 5 chicken broiler farms in Selangor
were permitted to supply poultry to Singapore, there had been no exports from
these farms since August 2004.

Stock prices of poultry companies listed on Bursa Malaysia plummeted after the
suspected case became known.
This is the second time there had been H5N1 case reported in the country in
the past 3 years. The last case in 2004 was in Kota Baru where several
fighting cocks smuggled in from Thailand died of the disease.

21 tons of poultry meat found in Benidorm
------------------------------------------
21 tons of poultry has been intercepted by local police in Benidorm as it was
being imported without control from China. [Benidorm is a coastal town in the
province of Alicante, Spain].
Local police found the meat, chicken, duck and also rabbit, inside a Benidorm
warehouse where there were also other items such as clothes and toys, all
thought to have been imported from China illegally. It is thought the meat had
been brought to Spain by lorry, and that its final destination was to have
been Chinese restaurants across the Province of Alicante. Several people were
in the warehouse at the time of the police raid, and they are now helping
police with their enquiries.
The meat has been taken to the Customs Authorities in Alicante who will
analyse it before deciding whether to incinerate it.

The following details on the detection of avian influenza H5 in the village
Plivsko jezero, Canton of Srednjobosanski (44.34694�, 17.18855�) are derived
from the official notification sent to the OIE on 20 Feb 2006 by JOZO BAGARIC,

About 15 swans arrived around 11 Feb 2006 on the location of Plivsko lake. On
16 Feb 2006, 2 swans were showing signs of disease, killed and sent to the
laboratory for further examination. Pathological findings and fast test
immediately showed strong suspicion on avian influenza and further tests by
egg inoculation showed H5 strain. Historical records show that every year,
only one flock of swans were coming to Plivsko lake during bird migrations.

Tests confirm first H5N1 cases in Hungary
-----------------------------------------
A British laboratory detected the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain in 3 dead swans
found in Hungary last week, confirming the 1st cases of the virus in the
country, the government said on Tuesday [21 Feb 2006].
"According to the official British tests, the 3 dead swans found in Hungary
last week had the H5N1 bird flu strain," spokesman Andras Batiz said in a
statement. He said this week Hungarian authorities have sent 4 further samples
from swans to Britain for testing from the same area in southern Hungary where
the 3 swans had been found.
Batiz said there was no need for further precautionary measures after the
steps taken last week when the swans found near the villages of Nagybaracska
and Csatalja had tested positive for the H5 avian influenza virus.
Hungarian authorities had applied the same precautionary measures as other
European Union member states in which the H5N1 virus has been confirmed or was
suspected in wild birds. [These] include setting up a 3km protection zone
around the area where the swans were found, and a surrounding surveillance
zone of 10 km. Poultry must be kept indoors in the area, but there are no
nationwide restrictions yet.
Poultry sales in Hungary have been so far unaffected.

[7] Switzerland, preparedness

As France prepares to vaccinate almost a million birds against avian flu, the
Swiss government says vaccination only makes sense if the virus is rife.
EU agriculture ministers met on Monday [20 Feb 2006] to discuss ways to combat
bird flu �- which has now spread to 6 member countries �- including a Europe-
wide vaccination programme.
"In the current situation Switzerland will not vaccinate poultry," Marcel
Falk, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, told swissinfo. "In
our view it would be too risky. If bird flu is introduced to our chicken
population, it's vital that it's detected quickly. "Vaccinated animals still
get infected and pass the virus to other animals. But they don't get sick and
die, so you can't recognise if bird flu has been introduced."
He said vaccination made sense if the virus was widespread, as in Asia, and if
it was no longer possible to eradicate it. "At the moment Switzerland's goal
is protecting its poultry from bird flu," added Falk.
On Monday [20 Feb 2006] the Swiss government reintroduced a ban on keeping
chickens outdoors to prevent contact with migratory birds from Africa that
might be carrying the H5N1 virus. Falk described this as "the most important
measure to protect poultry" and said the birds would be kept cooped up "until
there is a better solution".
Christian Griot, head of the national laboratory for highly contagious animal
diseases, echoed the view that rapid identification and elimination of
infected birds represented the best course of action at present. "It's true
that killing flocks of [poultry] largely eliminates the virus from a
particular spot, but it has the disadvantage that every bird ends up dead," he
told Swissinfo.
