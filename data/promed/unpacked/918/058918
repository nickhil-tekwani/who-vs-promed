I would imagine that, from the badgers' point of view, the problem is those
damned cows.

Re: Bovine tuberculosis, human - UK (Gloucestershire): beef farmer and wife
caught TB from cattle
-----------------------------------------------
It's perhaps a good time to go back over the UK bovine TB control methodology.
In the 1970's, bovine TB was all but eradicated, with only sporadic
outbreaks from the wilder parts of western England. This had been achieved
by regular testing and culling of cattle, and, in persistent cases, the
elimination of badgers around the infected farm.
The situation, when I started farming here in the mid 1970's, was of large
badger populations locally and no bovine TB. In discussions with other
farmers, this seems to have been quite a general situation outside those
areas close to areas where sporadic outbreaks still occurred.
The UK seems to have arrived in the position where, for almost all of the
country, TB had been eradicated from cattle, and, as a by-product,
eradicated from badgers.
At some point (I think in the 1980's) badgers became protected, and the
culling of badgers near TB infected farms effectively ceased.
I do not wish to get into any argument as to whether badgers are, or are
not, an important vector in the spread of bovine TB, as work on this is in
progress, and it generates a quite unscientific passion on both sides. I
don't think, however, that there is any disagreement that cattle can spread
TB to badgers, and, badgers can spread it to badgers.
Suffice to say that, after a lag, bovine TB stopped being under control and
started to spread to areas previously TB-free for many years.
Unfortunately, it has continued to spread, and, shows no signs of being
under any sort of control. One must assume that more badgers are becoming
infected and that this infection is also being uncontrollably spread within
the (large) badger population (see above).
In the past, badgers that attempted to move into areas of population were
removed, but protection now makes this difficult. There are numerous
reports of badgers being seen in suburban areas (usually to the delight of
residents), and this is likely to increase.
My point is that I don't think anyone has seriously considered the effect
of TB infected badgers within urban areas. Badgers excrete TB, and
commonly, soil grassland. This may be one thing in a field full of stock,
but quite another when it is on parks and domestic lawns, where children of
all ages regularly play. I wonder if this poses a significant risk.
In conclusion, I have serious doubts as to whether UK farming could any
longer control badgers in the way it did in the middle of the last century.
Farms are running with critical levels of staffing (some may say
sub-critical), and there is not the slack in the system, or the financial
resources, to carry this operation out. Should it turn out that selectively
controlling badgers is required to bring this outbreak under control, I'm
not sure the UK would be able to execute it.

[I well remember being asked, in the early 1970s, by my then Weybridge CVL
director, Alec Paterson, to sit in on a discussion of the one failing TB
eradication program in the furthest parts of west Cornwall, which had been
very successful elsewhere in the country. The problems were many, but,
essentially, TB came from infected badgers, and, coupled with that fact,
the repeated testing of the affected area cows, at short intervals,
resulted in the cows being desensitized, and therefore, reactors being
unrecognized, and so, the disease refused to disappear. Since then, the
MAFF Veterinary Field Service (broadly equivalent to APHIS) was reduced to
a shadow of its former self, when, to be frank, it was normally very
efficient (we in the Research Service were severe critics). Now, the field
officers have little contact with their farmers. Before, each county office
knew its farmers by name. Then came the great badger culling experiment,
the distractions of the 2001 FMD epidemic, and everything went wrong. The
UK has now regressed some 40-plus years in TB control, a very expensive
experience for all. Rural UK often is a very different place from the rest
of the UK to the present day, as Oz points out. The cost effective
solutions are not obvious. - Mod.MHJ]
