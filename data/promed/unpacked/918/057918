[1] CDC Report of positive product cultures

Public health officials in multiple states, with the assistance of
the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the FDA
(Food and Drug Administration), are investigating a large multistate
outbreak of _Salmonella_ serotype Tennessee infections. An
epidemiologic study comparing foods that ill and well persons said
they ate showed that consumption of Peter Pan peanut butter and Great
Value peanut butter were both statistically associated with illness
and therefore the likely source of the outbreak. Product testing has
confirmed the presence of the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_
Tennessee in opened jars of peanut butter, obtained from ill persons.
PulseNet (the national subtyping network for foodborne disease
surveillance coordinated by CDC) detected a slowly rising increase in
cases of _Salmonella_ Tennessee in the fall of 2006. OutbreakNet (the
national network of public health officials coordinated by CDC that
investigates enteric disease outbreaks) then worked for several weeks
to identify this unusual food vehicle.
Public health officials from several states have isolated
_Salmonella_ from open jars of peanut butter of both Peter Pan and
Great Value brands. For 4 jars, the serotype has been confirmed as
Tennessee and DNA fingerprinting has shown that the pattern is the
outbreak strain.

ConAgra Foods announced today [Thu 22 Feb 2007], that testing by some
states has detected the presence of _Salmonella_ within samples of
peanut butter manufactured in its Sylvester, GA plant.
"We are truly sorry for any harm that our peanut butter products may
have caused," said Gary Rodkin, chief executive officer of ConAgra
Foods. "Our immediate recall of 100 percent of our product was taken
with the assumption that a link could be found between our peanut
butter and the reported cases of _Salmonella_. We are committed to
taking all reasonable steps to remedy the situation."
ConAgra Foods has authorized retailers to accept returns of open or
unopened jars of Peter Pan Peanut Butter or Great Value Peanut Butter
marked with a product code beginning with "2111" for a full refund.
Consumers should return peanut butter to the store where they bought
it. Alternatively, consumers can send their Peter Pan Peanut Butter
or Great Value Peanut Butter lid or label with the product code
beginning with "2111", along with their name and mailing address for
a full refund, to ConAgra Foods, at P.O. Box 3768, Omaha, NE 68103.
It is not necessary to send samples of peanut butter through the mail.

with the same DNA fingerprint pattern, is now being reported. - Mod.LL]
