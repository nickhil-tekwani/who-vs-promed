Having disregarded a state instruction to kill cattle left behind in areas near the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, some local farmers have been struggling to keep about 430 cows within a 20 km [12.4 mi] radius of the complex exposed to radiation.

The instruction was issued 2 months after fuel meltdowns at the plant in northeastern Japan were triggered by a massive earthquake and a tsunami on 11 March 2011, for about 3500 cows kept within the area adjacent to the Fukushima Daiichi complex.

Regarding their cows as "family members," some farmers ignored the instruction, while others who followed it say they still suffer psychologically. The central government allowed cattle breeding in the 20 km [12.4 mi] zone in 2012, but shipments are still banned.

Keiji Okada, a professor of veterinary science at Iwate University and a researcher of animals exposed to radiation, has been taking blood and urine samples from cows at a couple of farms in the zone to see if there are any genetic abnormalities in them.

One farmer who is cooperating with the research is [FW], a 60-year-old local cattle farmer, in the town of Namie, several kilometers from the Fukushima plant.

[FW] said he wants to protect his 50 cows "until they die a natural death, just like human parents protect their children."

Before returning to Namie in October last year [2017] after evacuation orders for some parts of the town were lifted, [FW] used to shuttle between the farm and his shelter, which was about 50 km [31 mi] away, by applying for special entry permission to take care of his cows.

Radiation levels at [FW]'s farm stand at 15-20 microsieverts per hour, the highest among the 7 farms where the 430 cows are kept, but his cows are "so far in perfect health," Okada said. "This research is internationally rare, and it could be applied to protecting cattle when a nuclear disaster occurs," he said.

Another farm, dubbed "Moo Mow Garden," in the town of Okuma, where the Fukushima plant is sited, is run by [ST], 36, who initially worked as a volunteer following the disaster. Eleven cows are still kept at the 6 hectare [14.8 acre] facility in the community that became a ghost town.

[ST], a former company worker in Tokyo, originally came to Fukushima to protect stray cows after seeing news about cattle starving to death in the disaster-hit areas. She came up with the idea of having the cows, which eat 60 kg [132 lb] of grass every day, help to manage and conserve desolate farmland.

The cows released at the farm not only ate the weeds but knocked down a 3 m [9.8 ft] tall scrub and ate its leaves, transforming the deserted farm into a tidy field.

"I was always depressed to see the ruined farm every time I came back for a temporary stay, but now I feel better," said the farm's landlady, who is in her 70s.

[ST], who now works part time at a convenience store to make a living, said she aims to make a business out of her farm project. "I want to maintain the farmland so residents returning to the town in the future will be able to resume farming," she said.

On the other hand, [KS], 68, who agreed to abandon his 30 cows in 2013, has regretted his decision. It was tough for him to visit the farm exposed to high levels of radiation from his shelter.

"Yasuhira, Haruka, each of them had a name. It's like I've killed my family," [KS] said of his cows. "If I could have moved them to a safer place, they would have lived." But it was impossible, because the government prohibited evacuation of the cows outside the 20 km [12.4 mi] radius to prevent their meat from being marketed.

[KS], who has evacuated from Namie to the city of Sayama in Saitama Prefecture, about 200 km [124 mi] away from his hometown, said he has yet to find a new motivation in life.

[This is actually incredible research. To learn the cows are living and breeding and information is being collected from them is good news. The fact they seem to have no obvious health problems is very encouraging. It would be wonderful if the veterinarian taking blood and urine samples would share his data to show us if the animals handle the radiation differently than people, as well as to document how the calves are doing health-wise, according to the blood and urine data. While I deeply feel for those who left their animals and either returned or complied with government orders, I find it encouraging that this opportunity to study these animals is happening. I am delighted to hear some of the animals are still being cared for and doing well. I hope the farmers who complied with the orders will be able to start farming again or assist the farmers who are still taking care of their cows, to achieve at least a reason for living and loving the cows remaining in this area.
