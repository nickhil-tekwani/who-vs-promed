Soybean rust found in Mississippi sentinel plot, Florida field
-----------------------------------------------
The latest incidence of Asian soybean rust [ASR] in Mississippi was
found in a Poplarville-area sentinel plot sponsored by the
Mississippi Soybean Promotion Board.
Meanwhile, Extension soybean specialists and plant pathologists
reported more findings of ASR in Georgia this afternoon [5 Aug 2005],
and more rust was also confirmed in Alabama and Florida on Thursday
[4 Aug 2005].
The infection level on the Group 5 soybeans found at the Poplarville,
Mississippi site was "less than half of one percent," said Alan
Blaine, Mississippi Extension soybean specialist on Friday [5 Aug
2005] morning.
Blaine said farmers south of highway I-20 should apply for fungicide
application, because ASR appears to be spreading a little. However,
he did not think that the ASR inoculae have built up as much here as
they appear to have in the Southeast. Prevailing winds look to be
helping us.
Next week [2nd week August 2005], Moore and colleagues will "have an
intensive look at producer fields around Hazelhurst."
On Friday [5 Aug 2005] afternoon, ASR was confirmed at 2 new sites in
Georgia's Laurens and Tift counties. Tift County has already had
several incidences of ASR, and the disease in Laurens County is a 1st.
In Laurens County, ASR was found on a couple of leaves out of a
100-leaf sample on plants at R-5/R-6, according to Bob Kemerait,
Georgia Extension plant pathologist, but there were definitely
pustules and sporulation happening.
ASR has quickened its march across the state's coastal plain.
"Laurens County is on the northern edge of the plain. This is further
evidence coastal plain growers need to spray their crops with a
fungicide."
"Laurens County is basically at the same latitude as ASR sites in
Effingham County and Auburn, AL. Since that's the case, we're
beginning to look harder at northern Georgia. Producers in north
Georgia may not need to spray a fungicide immediately, but they do
need to be prepared to do so." Kemerait did not think it would be too
long before we find ASR moving into their area.
The Tift County rust was found near Chula on a private research
farm's beans at R-3. Sporulation from the site was much more
pronounced than in Laurens County.
"Rust hasn't taken over the field, but there are a lot of leaves
involved with many pustules. It's a bit more dramatic than what we've
seen before."
The latest cases have led Kemerait to believe ASR has reached a
critical phase. "I think we're now on the verge of an epidemic. Over
the next few days, the weather is supposed to be rainy, and I suspect
the rust is about to take off for the 1st time this year [2005]."
The latest Florida finding marked the 1st time ASR has been found in
a commercial soybean field in that state. The discovery is in
Hamilton County, on the north-central border with Georgia.
"The rust isn't severe at all, from the central infection, the rust
might have branched out a foot or 2," said David Wright, Florida
Extension soybean specialist on Friday [5 Aug 2005] morning.
Lately, growing conditions in Florida have been excellent. Since the
field's canopy was so dense, "air wasn't moving through the crop very
well. That's one reason infection was able to get going."
Patches of ASR have now been found across the Florida panhandle, and
Wright believes current weather conditions -- daily showers and warm
temperatures -- will lead to even more. "It wouldn't surprise me at
all to find more rust over the next week or so. We're set up for more
infection."
For that reason, "we're recommending soybean producers in the early
bloom stage use a fungicide with curative effects. If weather
conditions remain this damp, another application may be needed in a
couple of weeks."

[The possibility that an epidemic of ASR in the southern states is in
the offing is disconcerting. For the 1st time in this season (2005),
pathologists are openly considering applying fungicides to control
ASR.
