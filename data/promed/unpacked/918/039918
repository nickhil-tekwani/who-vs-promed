Officials in Northern Ireland suspended beef exports on Monday after a
failure in a system which traces cattle from herds which have had cases of
mad cow disease.The Department of Agriculture in the British-ruled province
announced the suspension after a European Union (EU) inspection of its
animal health computer system. The Department said the suspension would be
lifted as soon as the problem was sorted out.
Inspectors from the European Commission arrived in Belfast last week after
the fault in the tracing system resulted in the export of meat from 19
cattle that was ineligible for such trade, official sources said.
"Every effort has and will be made to address the issues raised by the EU
inspectors and the commission. A temporary suspension of exports is
currently in place," the department said in a statement.
EU imposed a ban on British beef exports in March 1996 because of a scare
over mad cow disease -- known medically as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE).
Northern Ireland is the only British region which operates the computerised
tracing system. The tracing system was a major factor in a decision by the
EU last year to end a ban on beef exports from Northern Ireland before the
rest of Britain. Before the ban the province's annual beef exports were
worth around 120 million pounds.
The EU inspectors are believed to have suggested a number of extra
measures, including the employment of additional veterinary surgeons.
The latest interruption to Northern Ireland's beef export trade was seen as
a setback to the industry's efforts to recover from the impact of the ban.
