The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting 2 recent confirmed plague cases in 52-year-old and 62-year-old females from Santa Fe County. With the addition of these cases, there have been 3 human plague cases from Santa Fe County in 2017. All 3 cases required hospitalization. There have been no deaths from plague in 2017.

NMDOH conducted environmental investigations around the homes of the patients to look for ongoing risk and to ensure the safety of the immediate family and neighbors.

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets. Plague can be present in fleas that infest wild rodents in Santa Fe County, including the city limits of Santa Fe, and several other New Mexico counties.

"Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. "Keeping your pets at home or on a leash and using an appropriate flea control product is important to protect you and your family."

These cases all come from various locations in Santa Fe County so there is no single focal point of plague activity. New Mexico has had laboratory confirmed plague cases in 5 cats and 12 dogs from various counties in North Central New Mexico (Santa Fe, Torrance, Los Alamos, Sandoval, Bernalillo, Rio Arriba, and Taos counties) so plague activity is fairly widespread in this area."

[The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case, the 2nd and 3rd for 2017, are not stated in the report but it is likely to have been bubonic plague.

2015 was a "banner year" for _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA with 15 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.

The following was extracted from: Prentice MB, Rahalison L. Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207, with the citations removed:

"Some plague cases (10-25 percent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteremia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteremia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites." - Mod.LL
