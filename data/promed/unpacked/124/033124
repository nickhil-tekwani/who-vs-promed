A total of 100 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bareilly have been reported from 19 states and the District of Columbia. The 7 new cases are from Connecticut (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (2), New Jersey (1), Pennsylvania (1), and Wisconsin (1).

Among 100 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 28 Jan 2012 to 25 Mar 2012. Ill persons range in age from 4 to 78 years, with a median age of 31. 47 percent of patients are female. Among 51 persons with available information, 10 (20 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 8 Mar 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported

State public health officials are interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week prior to illness. On initial interviews, many of the ill persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill. Among 51 ill persons for whom information is available, 35 (69 percent) reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in the week before illness onset. This percentage is higher than expected compared with results from a survey of healthy persons in which 5 percent of persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or ceviche made with raw fish or shellfish in the 7 days before they were interviewed. The investigation into specific types of sushi is ongoing.

The investigation has not conclusively identified a food source. Investigation is ongoing into individual food items and their sources. CDC, FDA, and state and local public health partners are continuing surveillance to identify and interview other ill persons about the foods they ate. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.
