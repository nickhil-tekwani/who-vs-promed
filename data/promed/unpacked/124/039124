Haiti continues to be affected by a convergence of humanitarian needs further worsened by hurricane Matthew. UNICEF and its partners continue to respond to humanitarian needs including in hurricane-affected areas.

Achievements in the 1st half of 2017 include the following:
The number of suspected cases of cholera continue to decline nationally with 7626 cases reported up to [Fri 30 Jun 2017] compared to over 21 000 in the same period in 2016. This indicates that the efforts made toward ensuring effective coordination increased the number of rapid response teams that achieved progress towards the goal of eliminating cholera in Haiti.

A total of 120 schools damaged by the hurricane have been rehabilitated, facilitating the return to class for more than 30 000 students. Up to 139 schools received over 10 000 items of school furniture, and 26 000 children received psychosocial support.

Over 550 000 people benefited from access to safe water.

Situation in Numbers
- 3 200 000 Total people affected (OCHA-HNO)
- 1 100 000 # of children in need of humanitarian assistance (UNICEF)
- 1 600 000 # of adults in need of humanitarian assistance (OCHA-HNO)
- 7626 suspected cholera cases and 87 fatalities (MSPP - 1 Jan to 1 Jul 2017)
- 12 000 # of children in situation of vulnerability (UNICEF, OCHA-HNO)

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs:
[Thu 1 Jun 2017] marked the official start of the 2017 hurricane season in Haiti. The rainy season that began in April 2017 has resulted in floods and landslides, damage to homes and destruction of harvests, especially in the departments of South, Grand'Anse and Nippes, which were the most affected departments by hurricane Matthew. Erosion of roads have impacted access to several communes, especially in the South department. The rainy season will coincide with the hurricane season, which will affect Haiti, usually lasting until 30 November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) indicated to a 70 percent probability of 11 to 17 storms, of which 5 to 9 could become hurricane including 2 to 4 major ones of category 3 to 5.

Despite the strong rainfall since April 2017, the trend of cholera continues to decline at the national level and is currently at its lowest level since the beginning of the epidemic largely due to effective coordination and increased number of rapid response teams. This presents an opportunity to accelerate elimination of the disease sooner than expected. However, cholera efforts are severely underfunded. Strong financial support is necessary to maintain the current levels and further lower the number of cases.

[The statistics regarding cholera are as follows:

Year / Cases / Total deaths / Incidence (per 1000) / Fatality rate in hospitals [expressed in percentages]
2010 / 185 351 / 3951 / 18.36 / 2.43
2011 / 351 839 / 2918 / 34.33 / 1.04
2012 / 101 503 / 908 / 9.73 / 0.96
2013 / 58 574 / 581 / 5.57 / 1.05
2014 / 29 078 / 297 / 2.71 / 1.01
2015 / 36 045 / 322 / 3.9 / 0.75
2016 / 41 421 / 447 / 3.74 / 0.91
2017 (1 Jan-30 Jun) / 7626 / 70 / -- / --

Total 813 000 / 9676

The total number of cholera cases in 2011, the 1st full year of the epidemic has now been surpassed dramatically in 3 1/2 months by the epidemic in Yemen and the almost 7 year total of 813 000 will likely be surpassed in less than 6 months in Yemen. - Mod.LL
