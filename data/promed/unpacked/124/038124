[The above follow-up report adds a 6th, suspected outbreak, in Kefar
Szold, to the 5 previous FMD outbreaks reported in Hazafon (Northern)
province of Israel. Kefar Szold (map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Kefar_Szold.html)is adjacent
(4 km) to Snir, where several FMD cases were identified in fattening
calves on 26 Apr 2011 (see 20110430.1340).

Sudden mortality in offspring (10 days old) of sheep and goats, as
observed in Sharona, is a common, and diagnostically important,
feature of FMD in Israel and elsewhere. It explains the striking
difference between the 'apparent case-fatality rates' of cattle (nil)
and sheep (32.84 percent), as given in the summary. Since Israel does
not apply stamping out (ruminants are compulsorily vaccinated), the
statistics (in particular morbidity rates) are more realistic than
those derived from countries which apply stamping out (early culling
preventing spread among the unit's susceptible animals).

During the late 1980's and throughout the 1990's, wildlife
surveillance was performed in northern Israel, infected wild boars
discovered in several cases (in 1992, a clinically affected boar was
sampled at Dan, near Snir/Kefar Szold; see the above map).

A small-scale FMD surveillance in wild boar, in 3 locations in
northern Israel, was undertaken in early 2007, discovering 85.7
percent seropositives (ELISA NSP tests). In at least one case, the
virus activity in boar seemed to have taken place some time before
outbreaks in adjacent domestic livestock (see 20070517.1571).

It will be interesting to note the current situation in the local
wild boar population. - Mod.AS]
