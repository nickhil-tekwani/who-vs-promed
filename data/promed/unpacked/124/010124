- Puerto Rico: microcephaly. An 18 Apr 2017 report indicated that the number of microcephalic babies in Puerto Rico was less than predicted. Some experts are beginning to question whether the actual count is being significantly underreported. The criteria for microcephaly used in Puerto Rico are different from those used by the USA CDC, and might account for the small number of reported cases in Puerto Rico.

[2] Epilepsy
Date: Tue 18 Apr 2018
Source: American Hospital Association (AHA) News [edited]
http://news.aha.org/article/170418-cdc-zika-cases-in-brazil-highlight-need-for-enhanced-epilepsy-surveillance


Seizures and epilepsy were reported last year [2016] in some infants in Brazil with probable or laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection, according to a commentary co-authored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in JAMA Neurology [http://goo.gl/ev1jU5]. In a study of 48 infants with probable congenital Zika virus syndrome, 50 per cent reportedly had clinical seizure, the authors said. In another study of 13 infants with laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus, 54 per cent were diagnosed as having epilepsy. CDC said cases of Zika virus-associated epilepsy may be misdiagnosed or underreported because seizure symptoms in infants and children are difficult to recognize. "Better recognition, diagnosis, and reporting of seizures and epilepsy in infants and young children will help guide interventions to make sure families receive the right support and treatment," the agency said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We reported 2 fatal cases of congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Brain anomalies including atrophy of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, and cerebellar aplasia were observed. The spinal cord showed architectural distortion, severe neuronal loss and microcalcifications. The ZIKV proteins and flavivirus-like particles were detected in cytoplasm of spinal neurons, and spinal cord samples were positive for the ZIKV RNA.

[4] RADAR diagnostic test

http://medcitynews.com/2017/04/xprize-winner-nanobiosym-gets-fda-emergency-use-authorization-zika-diagnostic-test/?rf=1


Nanobiosym, a former Nokia XPRIZE winner, has been granted emergency use authorization for its point of care diagnostic test to detect the Zika virus from the US Food and Drug Administration. The authorization for the Gene-RADAR Zika Virus Test is Nanobiosym's 1st FDA-cleared test, although this is one of several that have been authorized to screen for the Zika virus, which is carried by mosquitoes.

The Gene-RADAR Zika Virus Test is designed to cut the amount of time it takes for a diagnosis by analyzing blood samples with a nanochip.

The authorization is not the same as a clearance and only lasts as long as the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection of Zika virus as well as the Zika virus infection, a company press release said.

Nanobiosym's Zika Virus test will only be used to detect the presence of the virus in human serum, not for any other body fluids or any other viruses or pathogens, the release said.

What makes the Zika virus particularly worrisome is that when infection occurs during pregnancy, it can produce devastating neurological problems in developing infants, such as severe microcephaly, decreased brain tissue, and brain damage. More than 43 000 people in the US and its territories have been infected by the Zika virus, including at least 4750 pregnant women, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[An increasing number of diagnostic tests are being developed that are reported to be fast and sensitive enough to differentiate between infection with Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. A recent entry in the field is the DiaSorin launches the new LIAISON® XL Zika Capture IgM, reported to be the 1st and the only fully automated test for specific and accurate diagnosis of Zika virus infection (http://www.diasorin.com/en/news/diasorin-launches-new-liaisonr-xl-zika-capture-igm). It is particularly important to be able to identify Zika virus infections in pregnant women, so that the development of their fetuses can be monitored. It will be interesting to see which of these recently developed diagnostic tests performs best in the field. - Mod.TY

[5] Virus persistence
Date: Thu 27 Apr 2017
Source: Science News [edited]
https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zika-hides-out-bodys-hard-reach-spots


Zika virus plays hard to get. Weeks after the virus disappears from the bloodstream, it still lingers in the lymph nodes and the central nervous system of rhesus monkeys, researchers report online [27 Apr 2017] in Cell. That could help explain why Zika infection can cause neurological problems in both infants and adults.

"Zika does stick around for a lot longer than we originally thought," says Dan Streblow, a virologist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who wasn't involved in the study. Streblow's lab recently reported in PLoS Pathogens that Zika can also linger in rhesus monkeys' reproductive tracts and peripheral nervous systems. And recent studies in humans have shown evidence of the virus hanging around in semen (SN Online: 14 Feb 2017; https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/see-how-long-zika-lasts-semen-and-other-bodily-fluids). Now, it appears the central nervous system and lymph nodes are also long-term hiding places.

That persistence could help explain why Zika "does substantial damage in the central nervous system," says Dan Barouch, a study coauthor and virologist at Harvard Medical School. Infection in utero can cause microcephaly in infants, for instance, and the virus has been linked to an increased risk for a neurological autoimmune disease called Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults (SN: 2 Apr 2016, p. 29; https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-probe-zika's-link-neurological-disorder).

Barouch and colleagues infected rhesus monkeys with Zika [virus] and monitored the early stages of infection. The virus disappeared from the monkeys' bloodstreams after 10 days. But it lingered for as long as 42 days in cerebrospinal fluid, which circulates throughout the brain, and up to 72 days in the lymph nodes. Even though antibodies that recognize and disable the Zika virus appeared within days in the bloodstream, they weren't detected in the cerebrospinal fluid during the study.

A look at how the monkeys were making certain proteins revealed a few potential reasons for the virus's persistence. Monkeys with ongoing Zika [virus] infection in their cerebrospinal fluid made more of a protein called mTOR and a set of other proteins that interact with mTOR, the researchers found. That makes sense because mTOR, also called mechanistic target of rapamycin, has previously been shown to influence both immune response and neural development, Barouch says. Increased levels of the protein might be contributing to Zika's effects on the brain, though more research is needed to show exactly how.

Sick monkeys also made less of certain proteins that coordinate communication between cells. Blocking those cell-to-cell messages might prevent immune cells from making their way to the virus's hiding places. That group of proteins is similarly affected by dengue virus, suggesting that the 2 illnesses might share some of the same infection tricks.

The findings suggest that the virus might have neurological effects beyond what's been seen so far, Barouch says. And it adds another layer of complexity for scientists searching for a treatment: A successful treatment will need to remove the virus from the bloodstream as well as the nooks and crannies in the body where it seems to hide.

It also makes finding a preventative strategy more important than ever. Barouch's lab is one of many working on a Zika vaccine to stop infection from ever setting in (SN: 18 Mar 2017, p. 12; https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-may-offer-rapid-road-zika-vaccine). Their vaccine is currently in early stage clinical trials.

Abstract
--------
The epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in South America has led to World Health Organization's declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To further inform effective public health policy, an understanding of ZIKV's transmission mechanisms is crucial. To characterize the intercontinental transmission of ZIKV, we compiled and analyzed more than 250 gene sequences together with their sequence-related geographic and temporal information, sampled across 27 countries spanning from 1947 to 2016. After filtering and selecting appropriate sequences, extensive phylogenetic analyses were performed. Although phylogeographic reconstruction supported the transmission route of the virus in Africa, South-eastern Asia, Oceania, and Latin America, we discovered that the Eastern Africa origin of ZIKV was disputable. On a molecular level, purifying selection was found to be largely responsible for the evolution of non-structural protein 5 and envelope protein E. Our dataset and ancestral sequences reconstruction analysis captured previously unidentified amino acid changes during evolution. Finally, based on the estimation of the time to the most recent common ancestors for the non-structural protein 5 gene, we hypothesized potential specific historic events that occurred in the 1940s and might have facilitated the spread of Zika virus from Africa to South-eastern Asia. Our findings provide new insights into the transmission characteristics of ZIKV, while further genetic and serologic studies are warranted to support the design of tailored prevention strategies.
