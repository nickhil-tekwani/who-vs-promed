The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Mario Saroli Sales
Inc. are warning the public not to consume Saroli brand Green Bella
di Cerignola Olives described below because the product may be
contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by this
type of bacteria may cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.
The Saroli brand Green Bella di Cerignola Olives, a product of Italy,
is sold in 1-litre containers bearing UPC 7 79390 00404 1 and the lot
code 075/6. The affected product has been distributed in Ontario.
There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption
of this product.
Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or
smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with the toxin may
cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision,
dry throat, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of
illness, people may die.
The importer, Mario Saroli Sales Inc., Vaughan, Ontario, is
voluntarily recalling the affected product from the marketplace. The
CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.
For more information, consumers and industry may call one of the
following numbers:
-Mario Saroli Sales Inc. at 905-265-2227
-CFIA at 1 800 442-2342. 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. local time, Monday to Friday.

[The Bella di Cerignola (or commonly just Cerignola) olive is
cultivated in the Apulia region in the Southeastern corner of Italy,
at the'heel of the boot' and is cured in brine and vinegar. Its
crunchy texture and mild flavor makes this Moderator think it is an
excellent choice for an appetizer or snack.
A similar recall occurred with the same brand of olives in November
2005
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2005/20051108e.shtml>.
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such
recalls even if, as here, there are no human cases associated with the food.
ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for this posting. - Mod.LL]
