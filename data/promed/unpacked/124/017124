The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [13 Jan 2014] provided an update on the confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a man aged 65. The patient passed away at 7.02 pm tonight.

"The CHP will report this case to the World Health Organization. The epidemiological investigations, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education about avian influenza are proceeding," a spokesman for the DH said.

As of 4 pm today [13 Jan 2014], the number of close contacts remained at 5, while there were 98 other contacts. Close contacts were put under quarantine for 10 days from their last contact with the patient and were prescribed the antiviral Tamiflu [oseltamivir] for prophylaxis, followed by 10 more days of medical surveillance.

Other contacts remain under medical surveillance. They include another family member of the patient, health care workers, clients and visitors of relevant health care facilities, an officer at a border control point, and the patient's neighbours. Eight of them developed non-specific symptoms. The respiratory specimens of 7 of them tested negative for H7 virus, while the result of the remaining sample is pending.

Since the 1st confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong on 3 Dec 2013, the CHP's hotline has been set up for public enquiries. As of 4 pm today [13 Jan 2014], 122 calls have been received.

In addition, the CHP today [13 Jan 2014] received notification of 4 more human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Foshan (2 cases) from the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province, and in Zhejiang (2 cases) from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. As of 9:00 pm today, a total of 169 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland, including Zhejiang (60 cases), Shanghai (36 cases), Jiangsu (30 cases), Guangdong (16 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Fujian (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (2 cases), Hunan (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases), and Hebei (one case).

"Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces, with fever or respiratory symptoms should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas and provinces," the spokesman advised.

In Guangdong, 2 more cases of people infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu have been reported, according to a statement from the provincial centre of disease control and prevention.

One patient is a 29 year old man who sells bean curd at a market in the Tianhe district of the city. He became sick on 3 Jan [2014] and was admitted to hospital on Thursday [9 Jan 2014]. He is in a critical condition.

The other patient is a 76 year old man in Shenzhen. He also fell ill on 3 Jan [2014] and is in a stable condition in hospital.

So far, Guangdong has confirmed 14 human cases of the H7N9 virus since August [2013]. Hong Kong's secretary for food and health, Dr Ko Wing-man, yesterday [12 Jan 2014] called on people in Hong Kong not to visit markets in Guangdong or the eastern mainland when they visited their relatives during the Lunar New Year holiday. But the food and health chief said there was no need to ban all live chicken imports from the mainland. He said chickens imported into Hong Kong were raised separately from poultry sold on the mainland.

"There are no direct grounds to say that chicken breeding places that send chickens to Hong Kong are questionable because there are problems with the markets in the mainland," Ko said. No traces of the virus have been found on mainland farms, he said.

[There is concern in Hong Kong about this virus entering the city because it borders Guangdong province, and there is considerable traffic across the border. It will be interesting to see whether the breeding flocks with chickens to be sent to Hong Kong can maintain their H7N9 virus-free status, given the presence of the virus in other flocks in the province. - Mod.TY]
