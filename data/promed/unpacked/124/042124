Foot-and-mouth tests negative in pig
-------------------------------------
Final results of tests carried out on a slaughtered pig suspected of having
foot & mouth disease have proved negative.
The animal, discovered at an abattoir in Leicestershire, was killed after it
showed symptoms of the disease. But the sow has been cleared of both foot &
mouth & swine vesicular disease following definitive tests by the Institute
for Animal Health.
Fears that foot & mouth disease had returned were raised when the pig was
found with sores around its feet and mouth at the Dawkins International
slaughterhouse in the village of Congerstone. All animal movements were
suspended within a 5-mile radius of the abattoir, a rural area which
included numerous farms and a zoo.
The Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs says
restrictions on farms put in place as a precautionary measure will now be
lifted.
