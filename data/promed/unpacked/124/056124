Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) in France
----------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
France has reported an outbreak of BTV-8 in the Allier region, Central France (OIE, 2015; see map [at the source URL]). Clinical signs (facial oedema, respiratory problems and increased temperature) in a single sheep present at the holding were 1st observed on 21 Aug 2015. Samples tested positive from 5 out of 175 sheep and 27 out of 147 cattle. Disease control measures are in place: according to the French Ministry of Agriculture, a 150-km zone has been put in place, where there is a restriction of animal movement, active surveillance and a ban on gatherings. In addition, the French government and livestock sectors have in place a vaccination strategy and 1.3 million doses of vaccine will be made available as soon as possible. Preliminary investigations suggest an additional 7 holdings in the 2km zone around the index case have PCR-positive animals.

2. Situation Assessment
These are the 1st outbreaks of BTV-8 reported in the EU since 2011, and since 2010 in France. At present, the results of the epidemiological report suggest this is not a recent import of infected animals, but whether this is the result of unreported virus circulation (possibly in livestock or wildlife), a vaccine problem or imported infected midges is not known. More investigations will be carried out in the region and the neighbouring areas to determine the source of infection.

According to TRACES (the EU trade notification system), there have been no recent direct cattle or sheep / goat imports from this region or the neighbouring Puy de Dome region (since 1 Aug 2015). However, as many consignments come through assembly centres, it is not always obvious what the place of origin would be and therefore livestock keepers in the UK should be vigilant to possible clinical signs.

Although Bluetongue is generally considered a disease of sheep, in the previous BTV-8 epizootic, cattle, goats and New World camelids were also susceptible to infection and showed clinical signs.

The disease is not zoonotic and there are no food safety issues; milk and meat of infected animals are safe to eat. A vaccine is authorised and available in the UK for BTV-8.

Conclusion
Until the origin of disease and the extent of spread are clear, it is difficult to assess whether this outbreak signifies an increase in our risk level from low to medium. Meteorological modelling of recent weather conditions to assess whether the UK has been at risk of incursion in the past 2 months will be carried out.

Once more information is known, we will update this assessment.

[Declaring a surveillance zone around an outbreak with restrictions on animal movements therein is a common control measure addressing an infectious animal disease. A radius of 150 km for such a zone seems severe. But the past experience with BTV-8 in France provides full justification for this measure as applied by the French authorities. This is apparent from the following data, included in the introduction to the Ref 1 paper (thanks to Sabine Zentis for bringing this 2012 paper to our attention):

"After the introduction of BTV-8 in the Netherlands in the summer of 2006, BT spread rapidly across northwest Europe; by the end of 2008, more than 86 000 holdings in 14 countries were reported to be affected by BTV-8. France was impacted heavily with more than 43 000 holdings affected over the 2007-2008 period. The epidemic wave progressed from north-eastern to south-western France at an average velocity of 5.6 km/day. However, the disease did not spread at the same velocity throughout the country. The infection progressed more rapidly in some geographic areas that seemed to act as corridors facilitating the spread of the disease. On the other hand, some areas were characterized by a slow progression of the infection. In the absence of detailed knowledge of _Culicoides_ biology, determining the ecological characteristics of areas associated with rapid and slow BT spread is crucial to enhancing knowledge on the epidemiology of BT."

At the beginning of 2009, an outbreak of BTV serotype 1 was reported from the Allier department, currently affected by BTV-8 (see posting 20090905.3124). It will be interesting to note if BTV-8 was identified in this region during the major epizootic of 2007-2008.

France is scheduled to present today (15 Sep 2015) to EU's Standing Committee on Plants, animals, Food & Feed (Section Animal Health & Welfare) during its emergency meeting in Brussels, an "update on the bluetongue epidemiological situation and the measures taken."
