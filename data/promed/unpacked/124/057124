New Hampshire public health officials say a Manchester [Hillsborough County] resident is the 2nd person to die from eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] [virus infection] this season [summer and fall 2014].

Public Health Director Dr. Jose Montero says the individual was exposed to the virus at the end of August and died in mid-September [2014]. He says testing was complicated, and the virus was not confirmed until after the patient died.

In the 1st fatal case, someone who became sick in the Conway [Carroll County] area in August died last month [September 2014]. A 3rd person also has been diagnosed with EEE, which is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes and can lead to seizures and coma. Symptoms can include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat.

[These cases in New Hampshire are not surprising since they occurred within the geographical range of EEE virus in the eastern USA, where human and equine cases occur sporadically. As is usual, there are many more equine than human cases.

There have been recent human cases in New Hampshire and an equine case involving a mule (see ProMED archives listed below). The virus is maintained in passerine birds and transmitted among them by the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_. The species occasionally feeds on mammals and may have been the bridge transmitter in the above case.

There is a vaccine commercially available for equine administration but not for humans. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to avoid mosquito bites. [Particularly in areas where equine cases have been reported. - Mod.JW]
