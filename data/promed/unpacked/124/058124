Dead fish in Vermont.'s Lake Champlain a 'natural occurrence'
-------------------------------
BURLINGTON, Vermont.-- Bacteria has killed hundreds of fish in the northern
reaches of Lake Champlain.The fish, mostly yellow perch, have been washing
up on the Lake Champlain shore since early July 2002.
"We have probably bagged in the last couple of days over 1000 fish,"
said Carl Glickman of Georgia. In 20 years spending summers on St. Albans
Bay, Glickman said he's never seen such a large fish kill.
State biologist Thomas Jones said the occurrence is natural. The fish have
succumbed to some type of bacterial infection.
Strong storms at the end of June stirred up bacteria in the lake and then
the heat in early July likely stressed the immune system of the fish, said
Jones, fish health biologist with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department.
The conditions likely made them more susceptible to bacterial infection.
Glickman worried the fish had been exposed to some type of chemical
contaminant in the water. Jones said the event is totally natural.
"We consider it a natural type of fish kill," Jones said. "It's a common
event. We see it in various locations almost on an annual basis on Lake
Champlain."
The hardest hit area is the Inland Sea, an area including St. Albans Bay on
the northern end of the lake, Jones said. Judging by the level of
decomposition of the fish, the worst of the kill appears to be over. Now
the fish are being carried around the lake on currents, he said. Jones
recommended using gloves when handling the fish and burying them
or disposing of them in a sanitary landfill.
