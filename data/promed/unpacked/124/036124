FOODBORNE BOTULISM - TEXAS, USA (2)
===================================
Here are a few comments from the source state for the two
botulism cases in Texas.
We identify about four foodborne botulism cases per year in
Washington State, which has about 5 million people. The cases are
almost always from home canned foods improperly prepared with
boiling water baths, rather than pressure cookers. While a
variety of low-acid foods have been implicated (including a
series of outbreaks from home canned salsa in 1989) about half of
our usual cases are from improperly canned asparagus.
I recall a previous out of state outbreak related to improperly
canned asparagus from Washington, which occurred about six years
ago.
Continued efforts have been made by the agricultural extension
program to encourge use of proper canning methods.
