The moderator indicated that he was unsure why 2 _Aedes_ (genus)
mosquitoes reported positive in New York State are not on the CDC
list of mosquitoes testing positive for WNV. This year saw a change in
the genus of certain mosquitoes from _Aedes_ to _Ochlerotatus_. The
NY list used the _Aedes_ nomenclature while the CDC used the
_Ochlerotatus_ genus name. They are one & the same.
