WARNING TO VISITORS TO WILLIAM HEISE COUNTY PARK, COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO,
CALIFORNIA, USA
The Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC), Health Canada, has been
informed that routine testing conducted by the Department of Environmental
Health, Vector Surveillance and Control Division, County of San Diego,
California, USA, has revealed that two ground squirrels at William Heise
County Park were exposed to plague.
Although no cases of human infection have ever been reported in San Diego
County, officials from the County Department of Health Services and
Environmental Health Services are advising people to take appropriate
precautions when camping, hiking or picnicking in the region.
Wild rodent plague exists in the western half of the USA (the major
enzootic states are Arizona, New Mexico, California, Colorado, Oregon,
Nevada and Utah). Human plague in the western USA is sporadic.
