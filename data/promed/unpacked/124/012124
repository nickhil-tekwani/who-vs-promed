When you think of animals carrying fleas, what comes to mind are dogs and cats, a problem that most responsible pet owners know all about. But an equal, yet lesser-known threat is lurking in the wild and, unbeknownst to homeowners, living under the floorboards or in the attic. We are talking about opossums.

In fact, the opossum was named by public-health officials this past week [week of 8 Oct 2018] as a main carrier of fleas that transmit typhus fever. The opossum, or possum, is a major contributor to the outbreak in Pasadena, [CA], where a record 20 cases have been reported this year [2018] as of Thursday [11 Oct 2018], an "elevated level" well above the average of one to 5 cases per year, according to the city of Pasadena.

Los Angeles County is reporting 59 cases of typhus fever so far this year [2018]. Of those, 9 are associated with an outbreak in downtown Los Angeles, and 6 of those were among people experiencing homelessness. Specific outbreak locations are being withheld by the county.

L.A. County Department of Public Health reported on Wednesday [10 Oct 2018] that about 60 cases per year is average, so the county is ahead of its yearly rate.

Long Beach, [CA], has had 12 cases of flea-borne typhus, according to a city advisory in September 2018. Both Long Beach and Pasadena cases are not included in the Los Angeles County health department total.

Fleas hosted by these animals can carry one of 2 strains of bacteria, _Rickettsia typhi_ or _Rickettsia felis_, that cause typhus fever when they bite humans or simply land on human skin and deposit feces that get rubbed into the body and enter the bloodstream. The L.A. County health department, in an emailed response to questions on Wednesday [10 Oct 2018], reported that the carriers are feral cats, infected rats, and opossums.

The disease can cause high fever, chills, headaches, and rash. Typhus is fatal in only about 1 percent of the cases, according to the county health department. "Typhus fever is a disease that can cause serious complications requiring lengthy hospitalization and, rarely, death," said Dr. Ying-Ying Goh, Pasadena's health officer, in a city announcement dated Fri 5 Oct [2018].

The disease, also known as murine typhus, responds well to treatment, mostly antibiotics, said Michael Johnson, director of the Pasadena Public Health Department, during a phone interview Wednesday [10 Oct 2018]. Johnson said all 20 victims are recovering. "I don't believe any are still hospitalized, although some of them were," he said.

He said the cases are spread throughout the city of Pasadena, from the foothill neighborhoods to the central core to the more residential southern sections. He said more study needs to be done as to why there has been a jump in the number of typhus fever cases this year [2018].

Fleas can come from pets inside a home and from possums moving through neighborhoods from wilderness areas, he said. "It is an endemic problem, but the opossum is very much a part of the problem."

A single opossum can carry as many as 700 fleas, said Levy Sun, public information officer with the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District. "If you were to capture an opossum, you would see it has a very heavy flea load." He has received an uptick in calls, including some from worried Pasadena residents who want to see the opossums killed and the fleas sprayed with insecticides. Both are not practical options, he said. It is not possible to keep up with the flea population, he said. One female lays up to 50 eggs that hatch into mature adults in about 2 weeks.

Robert Messersmith, owner of All Star Animal Trapping, serving the greater Los Angeles region, says trapping opossums is the 3rd-most logged call, with raccoons 1st and skunks 2nd. When he finds any of these animals, he's often covered in fleas, he said. Messersmith said a meeting was planned for Thursday [11 Oct 2018] "to figure out how to take better precautions." He said opossums, the only North American marsupials, are very prevalent in urban communities because they have no living predators. Opossums are typically 2 feet [about 30 cm] long and eat just about anything, from worms to garbage to pet food. They can employ a defense tactic by "playing dead," which is really entering a coma-like state for up to 2 hours. They are nocturnal, meaning they sleep during the day and forage for food at night. The number-one cause of death is being hit by a car, Messersmith said. When he traps them, he'll drive them 10 miles [16 km] outside the area and then let them go. Only injured animals can be euthanized under the law, he said.

The best way to avoid getting typhus fever is to reduce exposure to fleas. Experts recommend the following actions:

- Reduce vegetation on a yard's perimeter, where opossums or feral cats can hide;
- Fill in holes in eaves, crawlspaces, or sheds;
- Don't leave cat or dog food outside;
- Pick up fruit from trees;
- Keep garbage containers tightly covered; [and]
- Use flea-control medication on your pets.

Pasadena residents can report suspected or confirmed cases of typhus to the city health department at 626-744-6089 (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) or 626-744-6043 after hours. L.A. County residents can call: 888-397-3993.

[The news report above says that the total of 59 cases of murine typhus in Los Angeles (L.A.) County includes the 9 cases in downtown L.A. but does not include the cases in the L.A. County cities of Pasadena (20 cases) nor the cases in Long Beach (12 cases). Consequently, the total number of murine typhus cases in L.A. County in 2018 so far is 91 cases.

Although cases in the city of L.A. are apparently concentrated among homeless individuals in the downtown area, we have not been told of the characteristics of the other 50 cases reported by the L.A. County Health Department. The 20 cases in Pasadena, we are told, are spread throughout the city, from the central core to the more residential sections of Pasadena, but we have not been told anything about the characteristics of the 12 cases in Long Beach.

Although the news report above says that flea-infested animals (e.g., feral cats, rats, and especially opossums) are responsible for the county's outbreak, we have not been told about the history of possible or known flea exposure for any of the cases. ProMED-mail would appreciate a more detailed description of the epidemiology of the murine typhus outbreak in L.A. County from knowledgeable sources.
