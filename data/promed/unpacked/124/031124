RE: Smallpox vaccine, eczema vaccinatum - USA
--------------------------
Going beyond the important point that this individual (the soldier)
should have self excluded from the vaccination is the point that this
individual was clearly not given the education and information that
he truly needed to avoid spreading the vaccination virus to any
contact or to himself. Regardless, if this person did not feel he had
the option to be excluded from the vaccination for various reasons,
if he had been given clear instructions on how to care for the
vaccination site, he could have very easily avoided spreading the
virus to anyone whether or not they were at high risk of adverse events.
I have been supervising the vaccination program for my lab staff
numbering into the hundreds for over 3 years now and know how
important it is to provide not only the appropriate information and
guidance on care of the vaccination site, but also the proper
supplies (breathable and waterproof bandages to keep the vaccination
site covered at all times). This case exemplifies the necessity for
not only proper screening of potentially vaccinated individuals, but
also proper education and information on what to do once you are
vaccinated. This is not the 1st case of a military individual
spreading the vaccinia virus to close contacts (see post Smallpox
Vaccine Adverse Events Among Civilians -- United States, 25 Feb-3 Mar
2003 [reference available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5209a4.htm> - Mod.MPP])
and is another clear example of the lack of training and education
that some individuals receive after vaccination.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Marriott for her comments. Dr.
Marriott raises the issue of information given to vaccinees prior to
their vaccination both in terms of avoiding contact with high risk
individuals as well as the care and management of vaccination site to
avoid spread to others who may be in contact with them. A very valid
concern/observation. The Military Smallpox vaccination information
website <http://www.smallpox.army.mil/education/toolkit.asp>,
contains a series of documents related to educational material
available. Among these documents is a brochure about family contacts
in which there is a discussion of risk factors for self exclusion as
well as appropriate care of the vaccination site to prevent exposure
of family members (<http://www.smallpox.mil/documents/628FamilyBrochure.pdf>).
Drawing upon memories and observations of working in the clinical
setting, while informed consent forms are used prior to doing any
procedure (including vaccinations in the civilian population), it is
very clear that many patients (and family members) do not fully grasp
what is being told to them at the time of the procedure, although
they may have indicated to the health care workers that they did
fully understand what had been said. In addition, while patients may
be given information sheets, it is not always clear that they have
read and comprehended the information provided to them. One would
imagine that a soldier preparing for deployment to a location with
potential personal danger might well have other things distracting
from full attention to such items as an information sheet. In
addition, a soldier about to visit with family members prior to this
deployment might also have strong reasons that would lead to
non-compliance with self exclusion. - Mod.MPP]
