Security guard dies of rabies
-----------------------------
A security guard in Barangay Mabolo is the 1st casualty of rabies in Cebu City this year [2013], although it was learned that the victim was bitten by a rabid dog last year and refused to get treated for rabies. The victim was bitten by his own pet dog and ignored the advice of neighbors to immediately seek the help of the Animal Rabies Control section of the City Health Department. [A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines and is the native Filipino term for a village, district or ward. In colloquial usage, the term often refers to an inner city neighbourhood, a suburb or a suburban neighbourhood. - Mod.CP]

Dr Pilar Romero, assistant head of the Department of Veterinary Medicines and Fisheries [DVMF], said there had been 12 rabies cases among dogs last year [2012]. The Districts Basak-Pardo, Apas, Sambag 1, Hipodromo, Pasil, Guadalupe, Sambag 2, Mabolo, Sudlon II, Punta Princesa each reported a single case each while 2 were reported in Barangay Bulacao.

There were 2405 dogs registered with the DVMF last year [and presumably vaccinated], a little more than the 1841 reported in 2011. Romero said 4005 dogs were registered in 2008, then the number rose rose to 5261 the following year and 5454 in 2010. The records showed that only 3 human rabies cases have been reported since 2009. Meanwhile, animal rabies cases decreased from 20 in 2008, down to 9 the following year, down to 7 in 2010, and back up to 15 rabies cases in 2011.

Cebu City Veterinarian Alice Utlang said her office personnel will intensify the information campaign about rabies because March has been declared as the Rabies Awareness Month. Utlang said her personnel will start scouring the different barangays of the city to compel dog owners to have their pets registered and vaccinated against rabies. The DVMF personnel will ask household owners if they have dogs and ask if they have the registration papers for their pets. If the owners do not have the required registration documents of their dogs, the City Hall personnel will issue them citations for violating Republic Act 9482, or the Act for the Control and Elimination of Human and Animal Rabies. The law strictly requires dog owners to register and have their dogs vaccinated, otherwise they will be fined for every violation.

[Previously, as late as 2011, the Philippines was estimated to be among the top 10 rabies hot spots in Asia. More recently, there have been successful efforts in some parts of the country to improve the situation by enhanced dog rabies control programmes and increasing awareness of the general population. Good progress appears to being made in the control of canine rabies in Cebu City. The failure of a small number of dog owners, such as the security guard described in this report, are still thwarting efforts to eradicate the disease locally.

Cebu City is the capital city of Cebu and is the "second city" in the Philippines. The city is located on the eastern shore of Cebu province. A map showing the location of Cebu City can be accessed at http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/asia/philippines/.
