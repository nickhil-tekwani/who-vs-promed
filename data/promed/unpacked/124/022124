Two persons dead after contact with diseased pigs
-------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the central province of Quang Nam suspect cause of death of two persons due to contact with diseased pigs. On 2 Feb 2013, Tran Van Mai, deputy chairman of the People's Committee of Dai Loc District in Quang Nam Province said vets had destroyed eight pigs that were diseased and could have been the reason for the deaths of the 42-year-old [female] owner of a slaughter house in Binh Tay Village who died on 8 Feb 2013, and the 41-year-old owner of a slaughter house in Xuan Tay Village who died on 10 Feb 2013. Health staff took samples of the two persons to test at the Department of Animal Health in the central city of Da Nang.

On 4 Feb 2013 the Binhh Tay resident bought 24 pigs from vet Vo Thien Sinh in Dai Thang Commune for selling in the market. However, after killing eight pigs she experienced symptoms of fever, diarrhea and internal bleeding. She was rushed to hospital but succumbed to the infection on 8 Feb 2013.

Later, vet Sinh brought the remaining pigs to the Xuan Tay villager and asked him to slaughter them. The villager developed the same symptoms as the other owner after he had killed two pigs and he died on 10 Feb 1013.

After the local residents tipped of the authorities, vets from the Department of Animal Health in Dai Loc District arrived at the houses of the two owners to bury the remaining pigs.

[The descriptions of the deaths of the pigs and the disease developed by the two pig-keepers in separate villages in Quang Nam Province are too sparse to suggest a causation. The deaths of the two villagers slaughtering the pigs seems to have been rapid and abrupt. Curiously a local vet and the Animal Health Department vets dealing with the situation so far seem to have been unaffected. Further information is awaited.
