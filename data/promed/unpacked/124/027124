[This past week has seen confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV1) in environmental samples, and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV1 and cVDPV2) continue to be identified in multiple countries. Note that while Pakistan hasn't reported any AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection in the past few weeks, the positive ESs confirm that the virus is still circulating in the country. In the past week cVDPV1 associated cases have been confirmed in Madagascar and Mozambique and cVDPV2 cases have been confirmed in Benin, Ghana, Niger and Togo and positive ES samples identified in the Central African Republic. Hence there are 8 countries confirming a poliovirus circulating in the past week.

2022 continues on a trajectory of more cases of AFP associated with WPV1 infections than in 2021, and cVDPV infections in 2022 exceed the number for the same period in 2021.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan: environmental samples
Date: Fri 2 Dec 2022
Source: Express Tribune [edited]
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2389148/polio-detected-in-sewage-samples-from-faisalabad-peshawar-sources


The wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) has been detected in samples collected from sewage lines in Faisalabad and Peshawar, sources in the health ministry said on Friday [2 Dec 2022]. They said that the samples were collected on 11 Nov 2022, adding that poliovirus has been found in 34 environmental samples this year [2022].

Sources said that 22 of those samples belonged to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 9 to Punjab and 1 each to Sindh and Islamabad.

In the year 2021, the virus was found in 65 sewage samples in the country. Meanwhile, a high-level global delegation appreciated the efforts of Pakistan for the elimination of poliovirus, reiterating support to help end poliovirus transmission by 2023. "There is unprecedented support and commitment to ending polio in Pakistan by 2023, and with the current momentum maintained, the country will be able to interrupt transmission in the coming year [2023]," said the head of the delegation and Chair of the Polio Oversight Board (POB) Dr Chris Elias, WHO Regional Director Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari and UNICEF Regional Director George Laryea-Adjei. "The last steps to ending polio are the toughest but eradication is within reach. Thanks to the hard work happening in Pakistan," Dr Elias said.

"During my 3-day visit, I was again impressed by the resolve of the government and community, especially frontline workers, to ensure polio is gone forever," he added. "Reaching every child during the upcoming polio campaigns and strengthening the routine immunisation system are now critical to success." The Polio Oversight Board is the highest decision-making body of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. This is the delegation's 2nd visit together to Pakistan this year [2022].

The earlier visit was in May [2022] following the detection of a polio case in Pakistan after nearly 15 months. The recent visit comes following the destruction of several health facilities and mass displacement due to catastrophic floods, which increased the risk of polio transmission. WHO Regional Director Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari reaffirmed that Pakistan is in the "final stretch" of the road to eradication. "The progress this year [2022] has well-positioned the country to end all poliovirus transmission in 2023. However, ensuring that we reach our goal will require political and administrative commitment during 2023," he said. "Under our regional vision of health for all by all, we all have a role to play in ending polio through our collective solidarity and action."

UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei said that Pakistan's success in containing the spread of polio through joint efforts by the government, donors, frontline health workers and partners is truly commendable. "The recent flooding has exacerbated health risks for millions of children, especially those living in districts historically at the highest risk for polio, so we must redouble efforts to engage parents and caregivers to protect these children," he said.

"The end of polio is near, and we must now go the last mile to ensure every child is protected against this debilitating disease."

[The 2 new positive ESs are most likely the 2 reported in this week's update as it was announced after last week's update was published. Faisalabad is located in Punjab province and Peshawar is located in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province (see https://reliefweb.int/map/pakistan/pakistan-districts-map-03-december-2018).

It's curious that there have been fewer positive ESs for WPV1 in Pakistan during 2022 than in 2021 -- 34 vs 65, when this year (2022) there have been significantly more AFP cases associated with WPV1 infections (20 vs 1). - Mod.MPP]

[3] USA (NY): wastewater positive
Date: Wed 7 Dec 2022
Source: Times Union [edited]
https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Polio-transmission-wastewater-analysis-NY-counties-17634734.php


Wastewater samples in 3 upstate counties continue to show signs of polio transmission, according to the most recent sequencing data published by state and federal health agencies.

Rockland, Sullivan and Orange counties have had multiple polio detections in recent weeks, all of them genetically linked to the strain of the disease that partially paralyzed a 20-year-old Rockland County man in June [2022], according to the state Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Statewide, 94 wastewater samples collected between March and mid-November [2022] have tested positive for polio, though 7 of those samples could not easily be connected to the Rockland case, according to the state Department of Health.

State health officials say signals are starting to lessen in those areas, though the threat of polio remains a concern. "This proactive monitoring will continue, as will efforts to immunize young children and communities in counties of concern to ensure that we have both early detection systems and long-term strategies in place to continuously protect New Yorkers against the threat of paralytic disease," department spokeswoman Sam Fuld said.

The wastewater testing has also helped public health experts determine where the virus is not.

According to a recent CDC report, which covers samples collected between [9 Mar-11 Oct 2022], 6 of 13 New York counties where wastewater was tested produced samples with polio linked to the Rockland case. Wastewater facilities in Putnam, Suffolk, Westchester and Ulster counties are among those recently sampled that so far appear to be polio-free. One county, Nassau, had only a single detection and therefore was not considered to have evidence of transmission, according to the CDC.

Several samples collected in Queens and Brooklyn suggest that polio could be circulating in New York City, though the data is less reliable due to the size of the sewage facilities where samples were drawn and other factors, the CDC report states.

Before the Rockland County case was identified, polio was effectively eradicated in the U.S. Experts have determined that the virus was derived from a live version of the polio vaccine which is still used in countries where the paralytic disease is endemic. Since less than 1% of polio cases result in severe symptoms like paralysis, state health officials are concerned that hundreds more may unknowingly have the disease [be infected with the virus]. About 25% of people with polio experience mild or flu-like symptoms.

Noting the benefits of targeted polio surveillance, CDC last week announced that it was looking to expand its polio testing of wastewater in other under-vaccinated parts of the country, including Oakland County, Michigan and a county in the Philadelphia area. Once initiated, testing will last at least 4 months.

Wastewater testing for poliovirus is different than it is for other pathogens such as COVID-19 in that it is not routinely or broadly recommended, and there are strict laboratory safety requirements, according to the CDC. But findings will help determine whether polio is present in other parts of the country and aid vaccination efforts in communities of concern, according to Dr. José R. Romero, Director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

"Wastewater testing can be an important tool to help us understand if poliovirus may be circulating in communities in certain circumstances," Romero said in a statement. "Vaccination remains the best way to prevent another case of paralytic polio, and it is critically important that people get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families and their communities against this devastating disease."

Wastewater data cannot be used to determine or identify who is infected or how many people or households are affected, but it can enhance other data that are used as part of polio prevention programs. "It would not be surprising if poliovirus is detected by testing wastewater because strains of poliovirus can be shed in people's stool without symptoms, putting unvaccinated people at risk," CDC officials wrote in a press release. "However, not all potential detections will be cause for concern," since 92% of Americans were vaccinated in childhood.

In New York, the Department of Health says it continues to actively test wastewater for signs of poliovirus in communities and is targeting its vaccination efforts towards school-aged children in under-vaccinated areas.

Between [21 Jul and 28 Nov 2022], 46 718 polio vaccine doses were administered to children 18 years and younger in Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Nassau counties -- a 20% increase compared to the same time period in 2021, according to data submitted to the New York State Immunization Information System. Health officials noted that over 86% of those doses were combination vaccines, with polio included.

Four doses of the polio vaccine are recommended to prevent paralytic polio, experts say. The shots also reduce the amount of virus that people shed once they have been exposed, lowering the risk of transmission.

[The unsettling news is that the virus is still circulating in 3 counties with identified pockets of unvaccinated individuals (a map of the affected counties is available at the source URL). The same communities have been rejecting measles vaccine as well. It should be noted that Judaism does not have a ban on vaccinations and Rabbis (spiritual leaders) have held vaccination clinics in the synagogues and schools in the affected communities. The power of misinformation campaigns cannot be ignored.

[4] Polio control in conflict zones
Date: Fri 9 Dec 2022
Source: SciDev.net [edited]
https://www.scidev.net/global/supported-content/the-peril-of-polio-control-in-shadow-of-war/


Conflict zones pose enormous challenges to those involved in polio surveillance and eradication, as security fears close off access routes and push populations underground.

Polio is a debilitating viral disease that mainly affects children under 5 [years], where 1 in every 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and up to 1 in 10 paralysed will die. Vaccination is the only way to stamp it out.

"There are special strategies that need to be adapted and they depend on the individual situation of each conflict zone," says Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesperson for the poliomyelitis eradication program at WHO in Geneva.

For example, the 2002 civil war in Côte d'Ivoire gave health agencies just 2 groups to negotiate with, but in Syria the WHO had to spend time reaching out to several conflicting groups.

"Each time, we have to look at the specific situation not only in the affected country, but also in the sub-region, to find the best ways to access children," says Rosenbauer. Yet in all cases, health agencies need to work "through intermediators and negotiators -- those trusted on both sides of the conflict", explains Carol Pandak, director of the PolioPlus program at Rotary International, a network of decision makers working to improve living conditions around the world through, among other things, the fight against disease.

Organisations such as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) work to maintain relationships with both sides of the conflict in order to ensure work is not disrupted. This approach reaped benefits in Afghanistan when there was a transition in government. "The program had been working with anti-government elements and was able to sustain relationships after the regime change," Pandak says.

During negotiations with warring factions, health workers underline the risks of polio and the benefits of vaccination. "We have found that parents on both sides of a conflict want to protect their children from disease and perhaps death," says Pandak. "We appeal to their sense of wanting to protect their children and argue that health is apolitical."

At the Alliance for International Medical Action (Alima), an organization specializing in medical action with vulnerable groups, health workers underline their neutrality to get access. "We are able to deploy ourselves by making the various actors understand the independent, neutral, impartial nature of our intervention and by having a community anchor," explains Soma Bahonan, head of mission of Alima in Cameroon. The NGO operates in northern Cameroon, amid attacks by Boko Haram in the far north of the country, and a war with the English-speaking minority in the north west.

Health agencies say warring groups usually agree to temporary ceasefire agreements or conflict-free days to allow their staff to vaccinate the children. Children will then be taken out of risky areas to checkpoints in the markets and in refugee camps.

Yet sometimes, health worked are faced with blunt refusals from warring factions, with fighters fearing an enemy ploy. It happened during the 2016 conflict with Boko Haram in Borno, in north eastern Nigeria. "There were a lot of military movements and the situation changed from week to week," Rosenbauer says. "So we could only do vaccinations when people were leaving the area."

Yet it is very often not the conflict itself that prevents vaccination, but managerial, logistical and administrative issues, he says. When a population is being permanently displaced, it can be very difficult to find children to be vaccinated, and if health agencies can't get a handle on the number of people involved, they can't prepare the right number of vaccines, or make enough provision for the cold storage needed to keep doses fresh.

---------------
To try to overcome these difficulties, health workers turn to geographic information system (GIS) software that uses satellite imagery to estimate the size and location of the population in inaccessible places, and to follow the progress of surveillance. This allows for mapping that can identify and indicate the location of villages and children who have not yet been reached by vaccination.

In addition, these maps provide distance and proximity readings to ensure that all settlements and hamlets are visited by vaccination teams, and that the appropriate number of teams are deployed.

[In the last update (Poliomyelitis update (48): WPV1 ES, cVDPV1 AFP, cVDPV2 AFP and ES, USA wastewater 20221204.8707076), there was an article on violence against polio workers and the team protectors (police and military) in a conflict zone within Pakistan where domestic terrorism is impacting vaccination efforts. This article illustrates how the global vaccination programs (Official and NGO) are trying to deal with vaccination efforts in conflict zones and the challenges. While vaccination efforts are the focus, the impact on surveillance activities may permit outbreak viruses (both WPVs and cVDPVs) to circulate under the radarscope in these areas as seen with the WPV1 outbreak in northern Nigeria (Borno) in 2016 (see Poliomyelitis update (10): Nigeria (BO), new cases, RFI 20160811.4408853; Poliomyelitis update (11): Nigeria (BO) 20160811.4410331; Poliomyelitis update (12): Nigeria (BO) comment, WHO 20160813.4414854). A WHO press release stated (in the latter ProMED post), "Genetic sequencing of the viruses suggests that the new cases are most closely linked to a wild poliovirus strain last detected in Borno in 2011. Low-level transmission of the poliovirus is not unexpected, particularly in areas where it is difficult to reach children with the vaccine. Subnational surveillance gaps persist in some areas of Borno, as well as in areas of neighbouring countries." - Mod.MPP]
