Since the beginning of the year, 89 cases of leptospirosis have been reported in Reunion (against 50 in 2017). This disease can be contracted through contact with contaminated wetland (stagnant water, mud, etc). The West and South are the most affected regions with 21 confirmed cases in Saint-Paul.

Once again, the cleaning of courtyards and gardens or bathing in fresh water [flood water that is contaminated with urine from infected animals, e.g., rats, dogs?] after heavy rains is particularly at risk. The ARS Indian Ocean [the French Regional Health Agency in charge of health administration for Mayotte and La Réunion islands] wants to sensitize the population: it is essential to apply protective measures and fight against rats.

In addition, in the context of a proven epidemic of dengue fever, it is recommended to consult your doctor in case of high fever, in order to be tested and treated appropriately if necessary.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis probably related to the rainfall.

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 mi) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 mi) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.
