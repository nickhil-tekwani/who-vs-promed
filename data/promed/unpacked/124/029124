[This is the formal report to OIE on the livestock side of the 15 human cases reported previously; see ProMED-mail posting 20131007.1988953. These cases were ascribed to "eating the meat of dead animals". [Note plural.] This laboratory confirmation was based just on one animal -- that is, the meat sample submitted to the laboratory.

This is a shortcoming in the OIE data: they can only report on what they are told, and too often the data comes from the veterinary diagnostic laboratory and the samples they received, irrespective of the actual events in the field -- for example, an outbreak results in one sample, thus only one animal affected. When the case number and the number dead are very close, one can presume that it was anthrax. But there are times when the number of "cases" far exceeds the number dying and then one must have doubts as to whether it was anthrax or clostridiosis.

One can successfully treat animals with clinical anthrax but one has to move fast with the antibiotics or it is dead; frankly it is better to treat them when they are in the incubating phase and seemingly healthy. But all this takes skill and the ready availability of antibiotics; not a normal state of affairs in the backcountry in many parts of the world -- which is why we see the Muslim tradition of slaughtering and butchering sick stock, and the potential for human anthrax cases.
