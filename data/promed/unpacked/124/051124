on 10 Apr 2004 with fever and rash over hands and mouth. He was admitted to
Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 14 Apr, discharged on 15 Apr, and recovered. He
had not travelled recently.
Cumulative Total in 2004: 3 imported and 0 local cases. The total number of
cases in previous years: 60 in 1998, 22 in 1999, 6 in 2000, 30 in 2001, 5

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a generally benign form of
enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infection which produces superficial rashes on the
mouth and extremities of the limbs of children. In a small proportion of
cases there may be severe neurological sequelae (For a description of a
recent fatal case in Macao, see "Enterovirus 71 encephalitis, fatal - China
(Macao) 20040415.1027"). HFMD is relatively rare in Europe, North America,
and Australasia, but since 1997 there has been a significant increase in
EV71 epidemic activity throughout the Asia-Pacific region, often associated
with severe encephalitis and high case fatality rates. The emergence of
large-scale epidemic activity in the Asia-Pacific region has been
associated with the circulation of 3 genetic lineages that appear to be
undergoing rapid evolutionary change. - Mod.CP]
