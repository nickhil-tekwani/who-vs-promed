[1] Wales (Carmarthenshire): wild duck

The 1st finding of an infectious strain of avian flu in a UK wild bird has been confirmed in Carmarthenshire.

The H5N8 strain found in a wild duck at an estuary near the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) Llanelli Wetland Centre is the same which hit a turkey farm in Lincolnshire last week [the 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N8 in the UK in 2016, reported to OIE on 17 Dec 2016; see archive no 20161219.4710246].

The centre said it had closed "as a precautionary measure".

Rural Affairs Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the risk to humans was "very low" and poultry was safe to eat.

The Welsh Government said it was the 1st time the H5N8 strain had been found in a wild bird in the UK.

It was described as "extremely concerning" by the Welsh Conservatives which called on the government to ensure safety measures were in place. Restrictions were imposed across Britain to keep birds indoors after the disease came to light across Europe, the Middle East, and north Africa.

On [Tue 20 Dec 2016], the measures were tightened to ban any indoor gatherings of birds at events such as livestock fairs, auctions, and bird shows.

Ms Griffiths said: "This finding is not unexpected and follows calls for bird keepers to be more vigilant for signs of the disease. It is likely that more cases will be confirmed.

"There have been no reports of human infection from the H5N8 strain and the risk to human health is very low. The Food Standards Agency has also confirmed it is safe to eat poultry meat, such as turkey, goose and chicken."

In a statement on [Thu 22 Dec 2016] confirming its temporary closure, WWT Llanelli Wetland Centre said: "This is a concern for local birds -- not humans. This is not a strain of bird flu that has ever transferred to people. The finding is not unexpected as the disease has already been found across Europe.

"Like other organisations across the country, we have been keeping a close eye out for any signs of the disease in birds this winter [2016-17]. We will remain closed while we increase surveillance among wild birds on our reserve and our collection of zoo birds, and put in place any measures necessary to help protect them."

Welsh Conservative spokesman for rural affairs, Paul Davies AM, said: "If it is allowed to spread then it could have a devastating impact on poultry farming across Wales. The Welsh Government must ensure that all farms provide details of their flocks to the poultry register and are appraised of all relevant safety measures in the event of an outbreak."

Chief Veterinary Officer Christianne Glossop urged people to report any sightings of dead waterfowl, or groups of at least 5 dead wild birds of other species in the same location, to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.

H5N8 HPAI virus has now been confirmed throughout Great Britain. H5N8 HPAI virus appeared in China in 2010, and propagated to other countries since 2013. Recently, it has spread throughout in Europe. This is the 1st case in a wild bird in Great Britain, but earlier this month (11 Dec 2016) it was detected in a flock of turkeys in Lincolnshire (England). There were also reports of wild birds infected with this strain in Scotland and England (see below).

Some recent studies suggest that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8.- Mod.PMB]

[2] Scotland (Dumfries and Galloway): peregrine falcon

A peregrine falcon found in Dumfries and Galloway has tested positive for bird flu. Scotland's chief veterinary officer said the discovery confirmed that H5N8 avian influenza was present in the country's wild bird population.

Sheila Voas urged the public to be vigilant for signs of disease in both wild and domestic birds.

Another 2 cases of birds infected with avian influenza have also been detected in England.

The H5N8 strain has been spreading rapidly in Europe, though it is considered far less risky than the H5N1 outbreak in 2006, and is believed to pose a low risk to humans.

Ms Voas said: "This underlines the crucial importance of bird keepers and members of the public remaining vigilant for signs of disease in domestic or wild birds. Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons, or other birds of prey or 5 or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra helpline."

The Scottish government said there was strong evidence from Europe that the disease was getting into housed poultry.

The heavy rainfall brought by Storm Barbara [23 Dec 2016] could heighten the risk of contaminated water entering poultry houses, it added.

Producers have already been ordered to house birds or ensure they are kept separate from wild birds. Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: "With the recent disease confirmations in both England and Wales, it is not unexpected for avian influenza to be found in a wild bird here in Scotland. We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their bio security is up to scratch and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds."

A further 2 cases of avian influenza have been detected in wild wigeons in Somerset and Leicestershire [England].

NFU [National Farmers' Union] Scotland said it was a "very worrying" time for poultry keepers. An NFU spokesman said: "Whether your poultry flock is large or small, we urge you to ensure your bio-security measures to protect the health of your flock are as robust as possible.

"Given the spread of the disease in wild birds, flock owners must continue to comply with the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, put in place on [6 Dec 2016], which requires that all poultry and captive birds in Scotland be kept indoors, or otherwise kept separate from wild birds."

The spokesman added that consumers should have no concerns about eating eggs or poultry meat.

[3] England (Somerset, Leicestershire): wigeon ducks

Two wild birds have tested positive for bird flu -- the 1st cases in the wild in England, the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer has confirmed.

The H5N8 strain of avian flu was found in Leicestershire and Somerset in 2 dead wigeons -- a type of duck.

It follows the discovery of the virus in the wild in Scotland and Wales and on a Lincolnshire farm last week [11 Dec 2016].

Chief vet Nigel Gibbens said the public risk was "very low" but experts would "strengthen surveillance" of the virus. Today's confirmed findings mean that avian flu has now been found in wild birds in widely separated parts of England, Wales and Scotland," he added.

"This is far from unexpected and reflects our risk assessments and the measures we have taken including introducing a housing order for poultry and a ban on gatherings. We'll continue to work with ornithological groups to further strengthen surveillance and our understanding of the extent of infection in wild birds."

The H5N8 strain has been circulating in Asia since 2010 and has caused 2 separate outbreaks in Europe following the autumn migration.

It is a highly infectious strain of flu in birds but there have been no recorded cases in humans anywhere in the world, the BBC's health and science reporter James Gallagher said.

The government imposed a protection zone earlier this month [December 2016], ordering all kept birds to be housed in doors.

Hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled in Europe with the virus reported in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries.
