The increase in the number of patients visiting hospitals with viral
fever and joint ache have set an alarm of a possible attack of the
dreaded chikungunya in the district. Some 18 cases suspecting
chikungunya were reported from Mala Primary Health Centre of Karkala
taluk from 12-21 May [2008]. However, the District Health
Administration has taken up all the precautionary steps by conducting
house-to-house survey, educating people regarding the preventive
measures and symptoms of the disease, and distributing pamphlets
comprising the details of the disease. [A taluk is an administrative
division in some Indian states, and consists of a headquarters city
with authority over villages and municipalities within its
jurisdiction. - Mod.TY]

Speaking to Deccan Herald, Udupi District health officer, Dr M R
Naik, informed that 2 blood samples have been sent to National
Institute of Virology in Bangalore for confirmation and no cases have
been reported since 21 May [2008]. No proved cases have been
registered in the district till today [27 May 2008], he added.

[Assuming that these cases are confirmed as chikungunya, this disease
is continuing to spread in the general Mangalore area. ProMED-mail
requests information on the laboratory test results as they become
available.
