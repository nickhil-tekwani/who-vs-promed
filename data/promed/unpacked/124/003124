The Cuyahoga County Board of Health says the amount of confirmed hepatitis A cases in the county is on the rise. As of [8 Nov 2018], there have been a total of 13 confirmed cases of hepatitis A among Cuyahoga County residents. On average, there are typically 4 confirmed cases per year in the county. In September [2018] alone, there were 4 diagnosed cases in Cuyahoga County, according to health officials. All 4 cases are believed to be linked to a multi-state outbreak affecting several states, including Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and West Virginia. A total of 3 additional cases confirmed in October [2018] are also likely linked to the outbreak.

Hepatitis A is a liver disease that usually spreads when a person ingests fecal matter, whether it is through contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the stool of an infected person. The vaccine-preventable disease can also be spread through sexual contact.

According to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health, at-risk individuals include:
- People who have direct contact with individuals infected with the virus
- Men who have sex with men
- Users of street drugs, whether they are injected or not
- Those who are incarcerated
- People experiencing homelessness
- Those traveling to other areas of the USA currently experiencing outbreaks
- Those traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis
- Those with an occupational risk for infection
- Household members and other close personal contacts or adopted children newly arriving from countries with high or intermediate Hepatitis A endemicity
- Persons who have chronic liver disease
- Persons who are at increased risk for complications from H\hepatitis A, including people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C
- Persons who have clotting-factor disorders

Children over 1-year-old, homeless individuals, and drug users are urged to be vaccinated for hepatitis A.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health is warning about a Hepatitis A outbreak in our region. So far in 2018, there have been 81 cases in Pennsylvania. That is an 80% increase over the past 5 years. Allegheny County has had 8 cases reported within the past month [October 2018].

"This year [2018] seems pretty unusual with the amount of hepatitis A that's spreading. This seems to be quite isolated, in a pocket. They do believe that this is possibly related to the IV drug abuse that's so prevalent in our area," said Dr. Brent Rau, of Allegheny General Hospital.

Pennsylvania is not the only state being affected by the outbreak. Hepatitis A cases have also been reported in Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, Florida and North Carolina.

With 899 cases of hepatitis A reported in Michigan in the outbreak [since August 2016], it should come as no surprise some of those cases are in Kent County. The Kent County Health Department was recently notified of a 4th case that is linked to this outbreak. Because the case was diagnosed within 100 days of a previous case, Kent County is now listed as part of the state's outbreak jurisdiction.

According to a press release, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services identifies geographic areas within the outbreak jurisdiction as those where there is a potential for ongoing transmission of hepatitis A.

"Kent County normally sees about 1 case of hepatitis A per year," says Adam London, Administrative Health Officer at KCHD. "In 2018 we have had 8 cases so far, including 4 of the same genotype. It is a reminder about how communicable this illness is and that we need to be vigilant about protecting ourselves and our loved ones."

[Outbreaks of hepatitis A continue in a number of states of the USA. Kentucky and West Virginia by far lead the country in cases. The mode of transmission in these outbreaks (Kentucky is reporting more than 100 new cases per week) parallels that of a 3rd world country related to poor sanitation rather than a particular contaminated food vehicle. Because of this, a change in the prevention paradigm is needed to address the needs of this underserved group of Americans. - Mod.LL
