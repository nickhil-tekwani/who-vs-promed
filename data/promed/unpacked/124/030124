Farms cull pigs after fever outbreak
------------------------------------
A Stavropol region collective farm and nearby villages are culling around
7000 pigs after an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] began to spread,
and the nearby city of Sochi said it had allotted 4 million rubles (USD 126
000) to contain an outbreak there.

The disease, which is still prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, has been
largely eradicated in the rest of the world, although there was a major
outbreak in the Caucasus in 2007. The disease is not dangerous to humans.

A Stavropol region veterinary official told Interfax that 1000 animals were
culled on Wednesday [14 Jan 2009] at the Rostovanovsky collective farm,
bringing the total to around 2600. The farm had 6500 pigs, and there are
another 640 within the quarantine zone, said Viktor Sankin, the region's
head veterinarian.

Krasnodar deputy governor Vladimir Kharlamov said Tuesday that 10 pigs had
died in his region, apparently of ASF, and a quarantine was opened to
contain the outbreak.

The disease was detected on 8 Jan 2009, and about 200 pigs have died of the
infection. An earlier outbreak in the Stavropol region in October [2008]
was contained, the report said. 4 collective farm workers have been charged
with violations of veterinary regulations for the earlier outbreak in the
Gorkaya Balka village.

A major outbreak in the Caucasus region prompted a scare in 2007, and
Georgian authorities killed some 30 000 pigs after the UN warned that it
could cause an economic disaster for the region.

The disease was 1st reported in Russia after several wild boars were shot
in late 2007 in Chechnya, Interfax reported. The nearby republics of
Ingushetia, North Ossetia, and the Orenburg region also registered cases.

Outbreak of African swine fever in the Kuban [The Kuban is a district
within Krasnodar. - Mod.AS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From 4 to 12 Jan 2009, 11 pigs died and 10 pigs have been slaughtered in 4
private farms in the Khostinskiy district of Sochi.

DNA of ASF virus was revealed by PCR on 12 Jan 2009 in the Kropotkinskaya
veterinary laboratory in samples obtained from dead pigs. For confirmation
of the diagnosis, samples has been sent to the All-Russian scientific
research institute of veterinary virology and microbiology. Dead and
slaughtered animals have been burnt. Quarantine has been implemented in the
territory of the ASF focus. Disinfection and other preventive measures have
been applied.

[The ASF epizootic continues its spread to new territories of southern
federal districts of Russia. Preventive measures in the Stavropol region
have not been completed yet. The outbreak in the Stavropol region is
related to purchase of pigs in the neighbouring Kabardino-Balkaria and
Northern Osetia where outbreaks of ASF were recorded during 2008.
Meanwhile, the new outbreak has been registered near Sochi in the Krasnodar
region. Earlier, in 2008, outbreaks of ASF in the Krasnodar region were
recorded in the Novokubanskiy district. Â­ Mod.NP

Russia submitted to the OIE its 12th follow-up report on ASF on Wed 14 Jan
2009, notifying 2 new outbreaks: one outbreak, involving domestic pigs, in
the village Plastunka (district Khostinsky, Krasnodarskiy Kray), which
reportedly started on 4 Jan 2009, involved 10 cases out of 265 susceptible
animals. Two of the sick pigs died, 8 were destroyed. No culling of the
remaining 255 animals is reported. The 2nd outbreak involved one wild boar,
which (probably due to observed clinical disease) was culled in the "game
husbandry "El'brusskoye" in El'brussky, the Kabardino-Balgarskaya Republic.
No additional data are given concerning the (estimated) size of the wild
boar population in the affected "game husbandry". This outbreak started,
reportedly, on 3 Jan 2009. A map, showing the respective locations of the 2
outbreaks, is included.

The report included the following epidemiological comments: "The concerned
territory shares borders with the Abkhazia Autonomous Republic (Georgia),
that has not been ASF-free since 2007. The migration of wild boars takes
place between the autumn and winter seasons." The follow-up report is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7683>.

While the report mentions stamping out among the measures "to be applied",
at the time of the submission, 10 days after the start of the outbreak in
domestic pigs, such a measure has not yet been applied. From the media
report it may be concluded, however, that stamping out is being applied;
official confirmation would be appreciated.
