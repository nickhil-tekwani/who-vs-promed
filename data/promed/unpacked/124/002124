The Mercer County Health Department announced that there is an _E. coli_ O103 outbreak linked to "extensive fast food exposure." At this time, the health agency has not yet announced what fast food restaurants those who were ill ate at. Many of those who are ill are children, but the outbreak does not appear to just be limited to children. The health department has confirmed 19 cases in central Kentucky. This investigation into this outbreak is ongoing, but here is what we currently know about the _E. coli_ O103 Kentucky Kids Fast Food Outbreak:

According to the Mercer County Health Department's Facebook announcement:
Kentucky Department for Public Health issued an alert regarding a sudden increase in _E. coli_ O103 cases in Kentucky. These cases, reported [5-25 Mar 2019], have been found in children and teenagers with an extensive exposure to fast food. The outbreak is not limited to young people. Acute diarrhea is a symptom of _E. coli_ O103 infection. Please seek medical attention and ask the clinician about possible E. coli infection."

[In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. Five (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.
