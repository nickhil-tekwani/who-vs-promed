SpillOver: A New Tool for Viral Risk Ranking Incorporating Wildlife Data
----------------------------------------------------------
It is estimated that there are up to 827 000 undiscovered viruses in animals. Of this large pool, which viruses pose the greatest threat to humans? Conventional approaches to understanding the risk of viral spillovers from wildlife, such as relying on the genetic relatedness of viruses, have proven insufficient. We developed an interactive web tool called SpillOver to assess whether a wildlife virus is more or less likely to spillover and cause a new epidemic in humans. This app uses a combination of scientific evidence and expert opinion to produce a risk report for hundreds of wildlife viruses. The report details the relative risk of host, viral, and environmental factors that may contribute to a given virus' overall spillover risk score. This approach allows comparison between viruses found in the USAID PREDICT wildlife surveillance project and known zoonotic viruses and identifies those with the highest potential for zoonotic transmission.

The web application is intended for use by policy professionals, scientists, and the general public to compare and explore the relative public health risk for wildlife viruses. This is the 1st time a crowd-sourcing website has been developed in which all can collaboratively participate in the collation of data and viral risk ranking. As viral discovery efforts reduce the unknown burden of what is out there, and our understanding of viral outbreaks increases, SpillOver provides an adaptive platform to improve our perceived risk, with the ultimate aim of forecasting and preventing future disease outbreaks.

[This SpillOver application was presented at the 68th Annual International Conference of the Wildlife Disease Association, held 4-9 Aug 2019 https://wda2019.ucdavis.edu/.

Generating information about the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of infectious diseases is both very important and extremely challenging. Tools like this are useful to aggregate and integrate evidence and expert opinions on an important subject for which there is limited available data. - Mod.PMB

ProMED thanks Dr. Hamilton for communicating this report. We look forward to the full publication and internet launch of this new web application. - Mod.LXL]
