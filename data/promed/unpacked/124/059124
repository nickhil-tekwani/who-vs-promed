[Bear meat is a well-known route of Trichinella infection in Russia.
Bears have a high prevalence of Trichinella, and the only way of
avoiding infection is by not consuming raw or undercooked bear meat.
ProMED has reported several previous outbreaks including several
cases from the same area after eating meat from an infected badger
(see below). - Mod.EP]
