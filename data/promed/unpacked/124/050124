New events: Influenza A H1N1 - Ghana

Event description: Ghana: 77 cases, 4 deaths. 5.2 percent case fatality rate

On 6 Dec 2017, the Ghana Ministry of Health notified WHO of a focal outbreak of influenza A H1N1 in a school in Kumasi city, Ashanti region. The event was detected on 30 Nov 2017 when a cluster of 13 cases of severe acute respiratory illness was reported from Kumasi Academy Senior High School. The initial cases developed illness on 29 Nov 2017 and 3 deaths were reported by 1 Dec 2017.

The case-patients presented with fever, cough, headache, joint and body pains, and abnormal chest auscultation. As of 9 Dec 2017, 77 cases with 4 deaths (case fatality rate 5.2 percent) have been the reported. The majority of the cases, 66 percent, were males and over 95 percent of the cases are teenagers. Thus far, the disease is still localized in the school as no cases have been reported among community members.

Laboratory specimens, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and throat swabs were collected from the case-patients and sent to Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research (KCCR), and other public health laboratories. Test results from NMIMR (a national influenza centre) released on 6 Dec 2017 indicated that 12 out of 19 throat swabs were positive for influenza A H1N1 2009 pandemic strain using polymerase chain reaction.

Corroborative test results from KCCR released on 7 Dec 2017 showed that seven out of 25 nasal and throat swabs were positive for influenza type A using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR).

2 blood specimens tested negative for Ebola and Marburg virus diseases, Lassa fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus. Specimens analyzed in other public health and research laboratories were negative for meningitis and encephalitis. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health has declared an outbreak of influenza A H1N1 pandemic strain as further epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

Kumasi Academy High School is a mixed sex school with total population of 3010 (2814 students including 541 day students, 127 teaching staff, and 73 non-teaching staff).

Public health actions
---------------------
The Minister of Health and the WHO Representative held a press briefing to inform the public and provide updates on the outbreak.

The Ministry of Health deployed a multi-disciplinary rapid response team to Kumasi to conduct the outbreak investigation and support response actions. WHO provided technical and logistical support to the investigation mission.

Active surveillance has been enhanced: a case definition was developed and active case search is being done among students and staff at the school and four healthcare facilities that treated the ill students. Suspected cases are being line listed.

Four hospitals in Kumasi have been designated as isolation and treatment centres. Doctors have been assigned to the school Sick Bay to provide high-level pre-referral care to students.

Public health education and community sensitization are ongoing. The Public Health Directorate has granted media interviews to provide updates on the outbreak and actions being taken. Simple messages on infection prevention and control have been developed for education at the school.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The influenza A H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 pandemic is now a regular human influenza virus circulating seasonally worldwide. However, seasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools. This is the case for the event in Kumasi, Ghana. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and are spread to persons in close proximity who breathe these droplets in. The virus can also be spread by contamination of hands with influenza viruses, which are then deposited on fomites.

Ghana has a good influenza preparedness system. The National Influenza Centre at NMIMR is part of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), coordinated by WHO since 1996. Furthermore, the country is benefiting from the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework for determination of influenza burden of disease. The PIP Framework facilitates sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits to improve global pandemic influenza preparedness and response. These capabilities enhanced the ability to detect the current outbreak in real time and initiate containment measures. Going forward, it is necessary to remain vigilant and continue active epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance for early detection of further transmission of the virus in the community.

To provide some information on the H1N1 outbreak in Kumasi Academy, the 19 samples received for testing at Noguchi Memorial Institute were nasopharyngeal swabs from some of the sick individuals on admission at the time.

[The diagnosis for the illness that affected a total of 77 Kumasi Academy students since the end of November 2017 has now been apparently confirmed to be influenza due to A/(H1N1)pdm09. We are told that over 95 percent of the cases are teenagers. However, we still have not been informed if A/(H1N1)pdm09 was detected in the 4 Kumasi Academy students who died, or about the results of the post-mortem exams on the fatal cases.

Kumasi Academy is a public secondary boarding school located in Asokore-Mampong, a suburb of the city of Kumasi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi_Academy). Kumasi, with an estimated population in 2013 of over 2 million residents, is the capital of the Ashanti region of Ghana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi).
