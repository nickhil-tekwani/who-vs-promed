Federal District reports another suspected death due to hantavirus infection
---------------------------------------------------------
A 64-year-old trader may be the 4th death due to hantavirus infection
in the Federal District (DF). The patient died early yesterday
morning in the Regional Hospital of Asa North (HRAN) with the same
symptoms of the other cases from May 2004: high fever, body pains and
respiratory distress.
The case also lived in Sao Sebastiao, the same locality where the
other 3 cases lived. Since yesterday, teams from the Health
Secretariat of the DF, the Adolfo Lutz Institute of Sao Paulo (IAL)
and the Ministry of Health (MS) went to the city to capture mice. On
the 1st day, out of 320 traps that were set, 156 trapped mice in the
area. Blood and organs from these animals will be analyzed by the IAL to
see whether hantavirus can be detected. Blood from this current case
will also be tested by IAL to determine whether a hantavirus is
responsible for his death.
The 1st case of hantavirus infection of humans in Brazil was reported in 1993
in the interior of Sao Paulo. According to the Secretariat of Disease
Surveillance of the Ministry of Health, since then there have been 353 cases
of the disease reported, resulting in 161 deaths. The states that have
reported the highest numbers of cases have been Parana (92), Sao Paulo and
Minas Gerais (60), and Santa Catarina (51) [all in the southern & south-
eastern, less forested part of the country. - Mod.JW]
Hantaviruses cause a rare disease transmitted by saliva, urine and feces
of wild rodents. The cases reported in the DF have presented with
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), whose main symptoms are high
fever, body pains, abdominal pain, headache, dry cough, tachycardia
and difficulty breathing.
The principal approach to avoiding the disease is to eliminate food
sources for rodents, but in Brasilia the situation is more
complicated, as the city sanitation workers have been on strike since
last Thursday (8 Jun 2004).

[If confirmed, this will be the 4th death attributable to hantavirus
pulmonary infection in the Federal District (the greater Brasilia
area) in Brazil in the past several weeks (see references below). In
3 of the cases reported earlier, sera were IgM-positive for
hantavirus infection. More information from reliable sources on
results of investigations to date would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
