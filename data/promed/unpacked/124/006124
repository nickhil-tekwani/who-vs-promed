This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: Tehuacan, Puebla
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (27 Mar 2015)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Birds / 324 / 49 / 4 / 320 / 0 /

Outbreak 2: Santiago Yaitepec, Oaxaca
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Mar 2015

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 26.53 / 17.94 / 67.63 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Following the notification by the owners of an increase in sudden death in birds at 2 backyards located in the States of Oaxaca and of Puebla, animals showing clinical signs suggestive of avian influenza were identified in both outbreaks. The official veterinary services launched the necessary epidemiological investigation and the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N3 was confirmed. Control measures implemented immediately are, among others: quarantine, movement restrictions, stamping out and sampling in the focal and perifocal areas. Both outbreaks were confirmed as positive for avian influenza on 9 Mar 2015 and later by determining the intravenous pathogenicity index. So far, no epidemiological link has been identified between them.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Level 3 Biosecurity Laboratory, SENASICA (National laboratory)/ Birds/ virus isolation/ 9 Mar 2015/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Mexico has been affected by a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H7N3 since June 2012.

Based on their OIE annual animal health reports of 2012 and 2013, from June 2012 to December 2013, Mexico reported 110 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H7N3:
Year / No. outbreaks
2012 / 46 (see annual report: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2012&semester=0&wild=0&country=MEX&this_country_code=MEX&detailed=1).

2013 / 64 (see annual report: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2013&semester=0&wild=0&country=MEX&this_country_code=MEX&detailed=1).

According to information available from OIE's WAHID database, during the 1st semester of 2014 Mexico reported HPAI as absent since 20 Dec 2013. See 6-monthly report January-June 2014: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2014&semester=1&wild=0&country=MEX&this_country_code=MEX&detailed=1.

Based on Mexico's follow-up report No. 11 submitted on 19 May 2014 on this HPAI H7N3 which began January 2013, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015140_20140520_132607.pdf all 64 outbreaks reported were resolved; however the event continues to be reported as active, and no closure follow-up report has been sent to date.

In this latest immediate notification, the last occurrence of HPAI is indicated as having occurred in September 2014. Given what is officially available, no outbreak of HPAI was reported in the country during all of 2014.

It would be of interest to learn if any HPAI event occurred during the 2nd semester of 2014, and if so, what was its subtype, number of events, and location.

During all of 2014, only 1 event of low-pathogenicity H7N3 was reported in the State of Nuevo Leon; see ProMED-mail post 20140325.2354578. - Mod CRD
