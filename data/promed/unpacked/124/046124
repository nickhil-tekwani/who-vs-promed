Plum pox potyvirus occurs in Kazakhstan
---------------------------------------
Central Asia is considered the region of origin of apricot (_Prunus
armeniaca_). In Kazakhstan, wild populations of apricot grow on the
slopes of the Tien-Shan mountain range. These trees are useful
sources of material for plant breeding. Studies were done on the
presence of Plum pox potyvirus (PPV) (EPPO A2 list) on wild apricot
trees growing in the northern range of Tien-Shan (Zailiyski Alatou)
and on plum trees from a collection (Pomological Garden in Talgar,
east of Almaty). PPV was detected in 11 plum trees by ELISA and
molecular tests and in 9 apricot trees. All tested plum trees
presented severe leaf symptoms, whereas only a single apricot tree
showed fruit symptoms. The isolates from plum and apricot were typed
as D strain.

The EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of PPV
in Kazakhstan.

The situation of Plum pox potyvirus occurs in Kazakhstan can be
described as follows: Present, reported in 2004 in wild apricots and
one germplasm collection of plum.

[Strain typing of detected isolates was especially important, because
an unusual and potential new strain of PPV was detected recently in
plum that originated from Eastern Europe. It is interesting that, in
spite of identification as D strain based on RFLP analyses, the
Kazakhstan plum and apricot isolates displayed atypical
electrophoretic mobility of the CP subunits, migrating similar to
that of the M isolate.

The DAG motif was detected in both the plum and apricot isolates of
PPV from Kazakhstan, indicating that they have the potential for
aphid transmission. The 6-nt (2 amino acid residues) deletion
observed in the plum isolate of PPV described in this study is the
1st deletion of this nature observed among isolates of PPV, but its
biological significance is not known at present.

The plum and apricot isolates appear to be closely related, sharing a
number of nucleotides that appear to be unique to the Kazakhstan
isolates. Based on these results, it is possible that the plum
isolate was derived from the apricot isolate, because the latter
appears to be more typical in terms of the number of nucleotides in
the CP coding region of the genome. - Mod.DH]
