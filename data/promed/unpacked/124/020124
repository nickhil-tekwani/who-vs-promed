On 18 Jun 2022, the body of a female ibex was found in the Aravis range [Savoie and Haute-Savoie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region]. It was positive for brucellosis.

Until now, it was the Bargy massif [Haute-Savoie] that was mainly concerned. But the Aravis massif was also under surveillance, because of its proximity to the center of the epizootic. Following this discovery, the prefectures of Deux Savoie decided to reinforce the surveillance of the herds which are currently in the summer pastures.

Several measures come into force now:
- annual screening between 1 Mar and 15 May 2022 of herds, supplemented by health checks on the return from summer pastures and animal sales;
- removing anything that can attract ibexes (salt stone, continuous feed supplement);
- the distribution of food in the middle of the pasture away from fences;
- increased surveillance in early grazing areas during the birthing period of female ibexes;
- adaptive herd management by guarding and/or herding dogs.

For its part, the ONF [Office National des Forêts] has decided to step up surveillance of the Aravis ibex population to detect any clinical signs on the animals.

ANSES (l'agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail; National Agency for Food Safety) is responsible for assessing the risk of exposure to brucellosis in herds. Additional analyses are under way on the corpse of the ibex to find out if the strain of brucellosis from Aravis is the same as that from Bargy.

[The Alpine ibex (_Capra ibex_) population from the Bargy area in France has suffered a major outbreak of brucellosis caused by _Brucella melitensis_, and now a case has been found in a neighboring population. European wild ungulates were seen as dead-end hosts for this bacterium, and all previous outbreaks of brucellosis in wild populations disappeared spontaneously. The situation in Bargy is different and alarming since the disease has affected an unprecedented high proportion of the ibexes (38% in 2013). Brucellosis persisted at high levels in the following years despite intense culling of animals which led to the removal of 40% of the population.

The Alpine ibex is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) but went through a population bottleneck. By the early 1800s, less than 100 animals survived in a single population in the Italian Gran Paradiso mountain massif. This has led to very low genetic diversity across populations- For a picture of a male Alpine ibex see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alpensteinbock_(Capra_ibex)_Zoo_Salzburg_2014_h.jpg. - Mod.PMB
