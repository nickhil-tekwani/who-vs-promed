The San Diego County Department of Environmental Health announced on 2 Jul [2020] that they have found rodents that tested positive for the hantavirus. Health officials from the San Diego County, as part of their routine monitoring in the Campo area, recently collected 4 wild mice -- one deer mouse, one brush mouse, and 2 California mice -- that tested positive for hantaviruses. They were added to the 22 rodents that all tested positive for the same virus this year [2020].

Hantaviruses have the potential to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the United States and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia [and, due to Seoul hantavirus infection, around the world, including the USA, harbored by the ubiquitous brown rat, _Rattus norveigicus_. - Mod.TY]. The rare disease can be caught after wild rodents have deposited urine, feces, or saliva that has dried up and mixed with the air or airborne transmission. The virus particles can then be inhaled via the air, or, in extremely rare cases, the infection can be contracted by getting bitten by a mouse with [a] hantavirus.

HPS is a respiratory disease caused by this viral infection. So far in America, there has not been a reported case of human-to-human infection, yet authorities are still reminding everyone to be cautious.

[The finding of hantaviruses in wild rodents in San Diego County, California, is not surprising, and a report of hantavirus-infected rodents there was posted on ProMED-mail last year (2019) (see Hantavirus - Americas (25): USA (CA) 20190527.6489779). The last case of a human hantavirus infection in California was in northern California (Placer County) in 2018 (see Hantavirus - Americas (39): USA (CA) 20180603.5835571).

The hantavirus involved in these California mice and the previous human cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Human fatalities are due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

It is not unusual to find deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) infected with Sin Nombre hantavirus throughout its extensive geographic range, including in California. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Other rodents may also harbor the virus. With the spring and beginning of the summer season, people in the USA and southern Canada will be opening up storage areas, cabins, and other buildings that have been closed for the winter. Individuals cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

To minimize the risk of hantavirus infection, one should follow these simple measures:
- Avoid contact with all wild rodents, their droppings, and their nesting materials.
- Before entering an enclosed area that may be infested with rodents, allow it to air out for at least 30 minutes.
- Do not dry sweep or vacuum areas that rodents have potentially contaminated.
- Surfaces that rodents may have contaminated with urine or droppings should be made wet with a 10% bleach solution or a commercial disinfectant following label directions before mopping up.
- Promptly dispose of all cleaning materials when done, and thoroughly wash hands and clothes.
- Examine the outside of all buildings, and seal any holes or other areas that would let rodents get inside.
- Store all food items securely in rodent-proof containers.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
