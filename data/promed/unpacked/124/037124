A total of 110 young people from the Bochil secondary school in Chiapas, in southern Mexico, have had to be treated after consuming water from the school contaminated with cocaine. This is the 3rd similar case in the state of Chiapas so far this year [2022].

The drug was diluted in the water of the fountains of the Juana de Asbaje Secondary School, so they ingested it unknowingly, reports the newspaper Proceso. Images and videos have surfaced of family members carrying their sons and daughters between 12 and 15 years old, some crying, others fainting or saying incoherent words.

Those affected were taken to the IMSS Rural Hospital in Bochil. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in Chiapas has confirmed having treated 57 adolescents with symptoms of intoxication. All were stable, except for one who has been transferred in serious condition to the Hospital General de Zona Número 2 de Tuxtla Gutiérrez and is intubated.

The State Attorney General's Office is already investigating what happened after one of the laboratory tests performed on one of the young people was positive for cocaine. The families of some of the students claim the substance was in something they consumed in the cafeteria of the center.

On 6 Sep 2022, another 10 adolescents were intoxicated at the Escuela Telesecundaria Número 388 Ricardo Flores Magón of Tapachula, but the causes are not yet known. The students suffered convulsions and fainting.

At the end of September [2022], some 30 students of the Federal Constitution Secondary School of Tapachula were intoxicated by drug use and suffered nausea, dizziness and fainting. A 13-year-old student tested positive for cocaine.

[This seems odd someone would have laced a public (presumably) water system with cocaine. How much cocaine would a water system need to affect this many students? Alternatively, is this cocaine in water bottles distributed throughout the school? This is exceptionally dangerous to the students with potentially lasting consequences. One student appears to be in a more serious situation. We hope all students will recover completely.

If the authorities are investigating how this happened, then perhaps any future such events can be prevented.

There is such a thing as cocaine toxicity or poisoning:
"Cocaine Toxicity
Three stages of acute cocaine toxicity have been described and include the following:

"Stage 1
• CNS: Headache, nausea, mydriasis, vertigo, twitching, pseudohallucinations, and preconvulsive movements
• Vascular: Increased BP, ectopic beats
• Pulmonary: Tachypnea
• Skin: Hyperthermia
• Psychiatric: Paranoia, euphoria, confusion, aggression, agitation, emotional lability, restlessness

"Stage 2
• CNS: Encephalopathy, seizures, increased deep tendon reflexes, incontinence
• Cardiac: Hypertension, arrhythmias, peripheral cyanosis
• Pulmonary: Tachypnea, gasping, apnea, irregular breathing
• Skin: Hyperthermia

"Stage 3
• CNS, Areflexia, coma, fixed and dilated pupils, loss of vital functions
• Cardiac: Hypotension, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest
• Pulmonary: Apnea, respiratory failure, cyanosis, agonal breathing
"Evaluation
-----------
"Depending on the patient's presentation, laboratory testing for suspected cocaine toxicity can include complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry panel, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, creatinine kinase, urinalysis, urine toxicology screen, and electrocardiogram. Imaging may also include chest x-ray, abdominal x-ray for suspected body packers or stuffers, and head CT if altered mental status suggests intracranial hemorrhage.(9, 10)

"Creatine kinase may be useful for the detection of rhabdomyolysis. Urinalysis may detect myoglobinuria. A urine drug screen is a must to detect other illicit substances. Most cocaine disappears from the body within 24 hours, but the metabolite, benzoylecgonine, may persist for weeks. This metabolite can also cause neurotoxicity.

"A myocardial infarction should be ruled out with troponin, and if meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture should be done.

"The chest x-ray may show signs of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or even aspiration pneumonia. The abdominal x-ray may reveal swallowed packets of cocaine. Because of false negatives with the plain x-rays, a contrast-enhanced study or CT scan is recommended. The risk of bag rupture increases with time, so it is important to make the diagnosis promptly.

"CT scan of the head is recommended in patients with seizures to identify any other pathology. An ECG should be done if the patient has chest pain, dyspnea, irregular pulse, or hypoxia.

"Treatment / Management
-----------------------------
"Patients with cocaine toxicity need to be stabilized, and attention should be paid to the ABCDEs. The patient's fever should be managed, and one should rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. A pregnancy test should be ruled in women of childbearing age. The treatment should be based on clinical symptoms, and one should avoid physical restraints.

"Based on a large systematic review referenced below, cardiovascular toxicity and agitation are best-treated first-line with benzodiazepines to decrease CNS sympathetic outflow.(11) However, there is a risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression with escalating and numerous doses of benzodiazepines, which is often necessary. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil have been shown to reduce hypertension reliably, but not tachycardia. Dihydropyridine agents such as nifedipine should be avoided, as reflex tachycardia may occur. The alpha-blocker phentolamine has been recommended but only treats alpha-mediated hypertension and not tachycardia. It is a rarely-used drug, and most clinicians are unfamiliar with its use and limited titratability. Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside are effective at lowering blood pressure, but the risk of reflex tachycardia should be recognized. The mixed beta/alpha blocker labetalol has been shown to be safe and effective for treating concomitant cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia, without any "unopposed alpha-stimulation" adverse events recorded. The use of labetalol is approved by a recent AHA/ACC guideline for cocaine and methamphetamine patients with unstable angina/non-STEMI.(12)"

"Differential Diagnosis
-------------------------
• Hypoglycemia
• Anticholinergic toxicity
• CNS hemorrhage
• Delirium tremens
• Acute schizophrenia
• Phencyclidine (PCP) toxicity
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

"Prognosis
-------------
"Cocaine toxicity is associated with high mortality. Also, injection of cocaine can be associated with pneumothorax, thrombosis, endocarditis, pseudoaneurysm of the central vessels, and arteriovenous fistulas. Other sequelae include cellulitis, HIV infection, thrombophlebitis, abscess, tetanus, and necrosis. For those who develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, the recovery is often prolonged and may not be complete.

"Complications
-----------------
• Thrombophlebitis
• HIV
• Cellulitis
• Hepatitis
• Endocarditis
• Pulmonary emboli
• Aneurysms"

"To date, there is no drug to prevent or cure cocaine addiction. The key is to educate the patient when he or she presents to the emergency department. Patients should be urged to seek drug counseling. Those who intended to commit suicide should be referred to a mental health counselor prior to discharge."
