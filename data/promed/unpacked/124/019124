Direct blood inoculation for the Sicilian doctor, no delay in the liver.
Inoculation with a single parasite would give detectable parasitaemia 14-20
days later, if it was a biggish inoculum (high parasitaemia) then the timing
is feasible.

Imported African malaria and fatal malaria are not unusual for Italy;
however, the mode of transmission is rather unique. The following
background data were extracted from GIDEON software:
1,087 cases were reported during 1973 to 1982, all or most imported. 1,941
cases were reported during 1989 to 1992 (including 23 fatal cases, all
returning tourists from Africa). _Plasmodium falciparum_ accounts for 74.2%
of cases, and Africa is the source for 86.5%. No cases of 'airport malaria'
were reported during 1994 to 1995. The local potential vectors are
_Anopheles superpictus_, _An. atroparvus_ and _An. labranchiae_ (south).
