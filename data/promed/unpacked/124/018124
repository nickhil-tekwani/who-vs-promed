Bighorn sheep near Darby dying of pneumonia
-------------------------------------------
Montana wildlife officials say 2 bighorn sheep south of Darby have
died from pneumonia -- raising fears about the health of a large herd
along the East Fork of the Bitterroot.

Pneumonia outbreaks among bighorn sheep can cause herd die offs. One
last year [2008] in the Elkhorn Mountains near Helena killed an
estimated 200 sheep and similar die-offs occurred in 1995 in the
Highland Mountains and 1993 in the Tendoy Mountains.

Fish, Wildlife and Parks veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey says wildlife
agents plan to cull the East Fork Bitterroot Herd to remove sick
animals. The hope is to limit the spread of the disease, but once an
animal becomes sick it will likely die in a matter of days.

The herd of about 185 sheep was established in 1972 when 32 of the
animals were transplanted into the area.

Bitterroot bighorn sheep herd has pneumonia; disease fatal
----------------------------------------------------------
State wildlife officials have confirmed that bighorn sheep from the
East Fork Bitterroot herd south of Darby recently died of pneumonia.

"It's really bad news," said Craig Jourdonnais, Bitterroot-based
biologist for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. "There's been a
history of herds losing 60 to 70 percent of their numbers in a very
short period of time when something like this hits."

The nearly always fatal respiratory disease was first suspected after
hunters reported seeing coughing bighorn sheep near the East Fork
last Sunday [22 Nov 2009].

Jourdonnais said he found 2 dead sheep on the East Fork Road. The 2
rams -- an 8 1/2- and 4 1/2-year-old -- tested positive for pneumonia
at FWP's wildlife laboratory in Bozeman Tuesday [24 Nov 2009].

"Both had a very advanced case of pneumonia," Jourdonnais said. "The
vet had to almost peel their lungs away from the rib cage."

Jennifer Ramsey, FWP's wildlife veterinarian in Bozeman said the
state will attempt to cull more sheep from the herd over the coming
weeks. "Our top priority is to remove sick and dying animals and to
collect biological samples for testing," she said. "Additional
laboratory tests will determine the specific strain of the bacteria,
and removing sick animals could help slow the spread of the disease."

Jourdonnais said he will shoot 3 or 4 sheep that are exhibiting signs
of the disease on Wednesday [25 Nov 2009] for further testing.
"Typically we don't have a lot of options in cases like this,"
Jourdonnais said. "It tends to have to run its course." Once bighorns
contract pneumonia, they die within a few days. There are no known
vaccines to prevent pneumonia in wild sheep.

The East Fork bighorn sheep herd was established in 1972 when 35
sheep ere transplanted there.

Jourdonnais said he counted 185 sheep last year [2008] during an
aerial survey last March [2009]. "They all looked vibrant and healthy
at that time," he said.

The herd has been the source of some "tremendous rams" over the past
few years, with a few close to record book size, Jourdonnais said.
"They are a real asset to the Bitterroot," he said. "The East Fork
herd is pretty well known."

In extreme cases, pneumonia-related outbreaks among bighorn sheep can
result in herd "die-offs." The most recent case in Montana occurred
in the Elkhorn Mountains near Helena. Similar die-offs happened in
the Highland Mountains in 1995 and in the Tendoy Mountains in 1993.

Jourdonnais said there's no evidence the disease originated in
domestic sheep or goats. "We do have a few isolated herds of sheep
and goats nearby, but there is absolutely no knowledge that has
anything to do with what's going on here," he said.

It is illegal to possess a bighorn sheep head picked up in the wild.
Anyone who finds a dead or sick bighorn sheep is asked to call FWP in
Missoula at 542-5500.

[_Mannheimia haemolytica_ (formerly _Pasteurella haemolytica_) and
_Pasteurella multocida_ are the most common bacterial organisms
causing pneumonia in sheep. Most sheep affected do display some
degree of anorexia, some evidence of labored breathing, and loss of
weight.

While culling of sick animals may seem extreme, this particular
disease runs through bighorn sheep with disastrous results so it may
be the way to save the larger portion of the herd.

If samples from any of the bighorn sheep have been sent for testing,
we would appreciate knowing outcome of the bacterial cultures.
