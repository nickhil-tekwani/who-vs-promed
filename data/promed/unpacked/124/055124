TUBERCULOSIS, SCREENING OF IMMIGRANTS - UK: REQUEST FOR INFO

A ProMED-mail post

PLEASE REPLY TO Peter.English@esurrey-ha.sthames.nhs.uk.
We have a number of immigrants bypassing the ports and arriving in our area.
We would like to develop a protocol that can be administered by a health
visitor (a nurse with additional community/public health qualifications) to
authorise chest X rays, and to agree who should have skin testing (Heaf test).
Does anybody have a protocol (preferably evidence-based) that we could look
at and possibly adapt to our needs?
Can anybody advise me where (preferably on the internet) I can find a list
of countries considered to have a high prevalence of tuberculosis -
somewhere on one of the WHO sites perhaps?
Is there anything else that we ought to be doing urgently?
Thanks in anticipation, Peter.
