The outbreak of toxic shellfish poisoning in the Bay of Plenty in the last week is the worst the region has experienced according to health authorities.

A total of 20 people have been poisoned by eating shellfish collected from the shoreline including Mount Maunganui and Papamoa since 12 Dec 2012. 10 were admitted for hospital care after suffering symptoms ranging from tingling around the mouth to difficulty walking.

BOP [Bay of Plenty] District Health Board communications manager Diana Marriott says 4 of those people remain in hospital including a 42 year old woman and 60 year old man in the intensive care unit at Tauranga Hospital while a 57 year old patient remains in a ward after being admitted at the weekend .

Earlier today [18 Dec 2012] it was reported 8 people had come to Tauranga Hospital suffering from the toxic poisoning. Of those, 5 required admission and the remaining 3 were treated and discharged.

At Rotorua Hospital 4 were admitted for treatment, 3 have since been discharged, and 1 remains in the hospital.

One case has been presented to Whakatane Hospital.

Dr Neil de Wet, medical officer of health, says the levels of toxins being reported from routine shellfish sampling, and the number and severity of cases underline that collecting shellfish from the affected area is a significant health risk.

"Tell your family, whanau [extended family], friends, and tourists that collecting shellfish is not safe at present. If you see someone collecting shellfish remind them -- we don't want anyone else in hospital this holiday."

As reported yesterday (17 Dec 2012), a health warning is already in place advising against the collection of shellfish from Tairua on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, south to Waihi Beach, and along the Bay of Plenty coast to Whakatane Heads in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. The warning includes Tairua Harbour as well as Tauranga Harbour, Maketu and Waihi estuaries, Matakana and Motiti islands, and all other inshore islands along this coastline.

The health warning applies to all bivalve shellfish including mussels, pipi, tuatua, cockles, oysters, scallops, as well as cat's-eyes and kina (sea urchin). Shellfish in the affected area should not be taken or consumed. Paua, crayfish, and crabs can still be taken but as always, the gut should be removed before cooking.

Consumption of shellfish affected by the paralytic shellfish toxin can cause numbness and tingling around the mouth, face or extremities; difficulty swallowing or breathing; dizziness; double vision; and in severe cases, paralysis and respiratory failure. These symptoms usually occur within 12 hours of a person consuming affected shellfish. Anyone suffering illness after eating shellfish should seek medical attention.

Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals who swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms. Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this genus are capable of causing "red tide" that may be visible for long distances along a coastline.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the USA. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

Alexandrium blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new name -- _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_ -- was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida (http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=%28renamed%29%20Red%20Tide%20Update_608&category=Ecotoxicology).

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours. - Mod.TG]
