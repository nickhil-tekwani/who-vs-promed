Oklahoma has seen a significant increase in sexually transmitted disease infections over the past few years, causing great concern among the public health community.

In 2015, Oklahoma had the 5th highest rate of gonorrhea in the United States and, in 2016, the 7th highest rate of chlamydia. Additionally, from 2013 to 2015, Oklahoma saw a 77 percent increase of 1st- and 2nd-stage infections of syphilis.

State epidemiologist Kristy Bradley told the state Board of Health at its Tuesday meeting that social networking apps are one of the biggest drivers of the increase. "It has definitely contributed to an increase across the country," Bradley said. "The increased use of social media and these apps to have hook-up sex have facilitated more sexual contacts among people who don't know the health of the person they're having sex with." Another driver of the increase has been people trading sex for drugs, Bradley said.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia can be prevented by properly using latex condoms, available at some county health departments upon request, officials say. Condoms also can prevent syphilis from being transmitted, unless a person has contact with a sore that is in an area of the body not covered by the condom.

If left untreated, STDs can cause long-term health issues. For example, in women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which could lead to the formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes; ectopic pregnancy, or a pregnancy outside the womb; inability to get pregnant; and long-term abdominal pain.

Bradley said it's important for Oklahomans who are sexually active to get tested, either by their primary care physician's office or at the county health department. County health departments do not charge Oklahomans who cannot afford testing, and health departments can also provide antibiotics to treat STDs.

[This news report fails to characterize as to the sex and sexual behavior of patients contributing to this increase in sexually transmitted diseases in Oklahoma.

The USA national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2000 and 2001, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). Subsequently, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year. Men account for the most cases of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, with the vast majority of those cases occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm). However, during 2013-2015, the rate increased among women, as well as men, perhaps as a spillover of the ongoing syphilis epidemic in MSM that could be attributable to MSM who also have unprotected sex with women. During 2014-2015, the incidence rate of P&S syphilis increased 18.1 percent among men (13.7 per 100 000 in 2015) and 27.3 percent among women (1.4 per 100 000 in 2015).

Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy. Consequently, accompanying the increase in the rate of P&S syphilis in women is an increase in congenital syphilis cases in the USA as a whole.

It is important to know if this situation is also occurring in Oklahoma. In fact, in Oklahoma during the years 2012-2015, the rates of P&S syphilis were almost 8 to 14-fold higher in men than women; the rate of P&S syphilis increased in women from 0.3 in 2012 to 1.1 per 100 000 population in 2015 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/28.htm and https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/29.htm); and the rate of congenital syphilis increased from 0.0 in 2012 and 2013 to 11.2 in 2014 and 13.1 per 100 000 live births in 2015 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/41.htm). - Mod.ML
