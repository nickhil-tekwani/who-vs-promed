SCREWWORM ALERT - USA (ALABAMA)

A man who returned from Brazil with "flesh-eating" screwworm maggots on his
scalp may have introduced the lethal insect to northern Alabama, health
officials said.
The traveler sought treatment when he noticed growing sores on his scalp
after arriving home from his trip July 31. Health officials said they
believe screwworm flies probably laid eggs in an open wound on his head
while the man was in the Brazilian rainforest.
"During the insect's three-week life cycle, the eggs pupate and become
larvae, which then feed on the host animal's flesh until they turn into
flies. Screwworm larvae can devour a 600-pound steer in 5-7 days, experts
said."
Although the man has been treated, officials are worried that some of the
maggots might have escaped the man's house and gotten into the soil, where
they could become flies and then breed.

[I have delayed posting on this as it is more fuss than risk but it is a
useful example of community risks presented by ecotourists. The AP report,
which I have seen in various papers from the USA, London, and Brisbane, is
extracted as above but I kept the nonsense on its life cycle and cattle
eating potential as a warning to us all to provide accurate information to
journalists. - Mod.MHJ]
