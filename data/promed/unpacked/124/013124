Outbreak of _Pepino mosaic virus_ in Finland
--------------------------------------------
In Finland, the presence of _Pepino mosaic virus_ (_Potexvirus_, PepMV
- EPPO Alert List) was detected in one tomato production site in May
2011. Tracing-back studies showed that the planting material had been
produced in another site in Finland (where tomato plants are grown
from seeds). However, this site producing tomato planting material had
been regularly inspected (every 2 weeks) and no symptoms were found.
In addition 35 samples had been taken from asymptomatic plants and
PepMV was not detected. It is concluded that the origin of PepMV was
most likely linked to imports of tomato fruit from other countries.

[_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first
identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is
spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a
few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and
aubergine, but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato.
Symptoms may include blotches and scarification on fruit as well as
mottling, distortion, and necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The
virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse
tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality.

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect
vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by
mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect
activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting and with infected plant
material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing
contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the
embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and
appears unlikely for PepMV, but more studies are needed. Disease
management is usually focused on phytosanitation (removal of infected
plants, disinfection of tools) and use of certified clean seed and
tomato explants.

At least 2 strains of the virus exist (pepino, tomato). It has been
reported in coinfection with _Potato virus S_ and the newly described
Tomato torrado virus. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect
of the interactions with these and possibly other viruses on crop
damage.

In Finland, PepMV was first reported in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20010916.2240) on glasshouse tomatoes.
