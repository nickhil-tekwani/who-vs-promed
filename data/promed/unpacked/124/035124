Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 5 Jul 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia has announced 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases and 2 deaths in previously confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The new cases are a 69-year-old male and a 66-year-old male from Riyadh. Both were admitted to hospital on [28 Jun 2013] and are currently in critical condition in an intensive care unit.

In addition, the 2 deaths in previously confirmed cases are a 63-year-old female from Riyadh and a 75-year-old male from Al Ahsa.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 79 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 42 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[As stated in the WHO release above, the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO is now 79 cases including 42 deaths.

The report of new cases occurring in Riyadh highlights the continued presence of the as yet unidentified source of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, and the resulting continued risk of infection. The lay press has had coverage of studies underway in Saudi Arabia to identify possible animal reservoirs/sources of the MERS-CoV, but to date (6 Jul 2013) results of these studies are still pending (see Denise Grady's 1 Jul 2013 article in the New York Times, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/health/experts-scramble-to-trace-the-emergence-of-mers.html).

[2] Saudi Arabia: new cases, MOH
Date: Sat 6 Jul 2013
Source: Ministry of Public Health, Saudi Arabia [in Arabic, machine trans., edited]
http://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/Corona/PressReleases/Pages/mediastatement-2013-07-06-001.aspx


In the framework of epidemiological investigation for the new coronavirus disease (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health reported 3 confirmed cases: 2 cases in citizens in Riyadh, aged 66 and 69 years, [comatose] in the intensive care [unit], and a 3rd [a] resident working in the health sector in Hafr Al-Batin. The Ministry also announced the death of citizens announced previously, 1 infected in the Eastern Province at the age of 53, and another, a 2-year-old boy in the Jeddah region, suffering chronic lung disease. There have been 77 laboratory specimens tested for MERS-CoV since the last update announcement, all negative except for the cases announced above.

[The announcement above adds an additional 3 cases of MERS-CoV to the global tally and 2 new deaths. From the information provided, it appears as though 2 of the 3 new cases are included in the WHO update above -- the 66 and 69-year-old individuals from Riyadh. The additional case, a "resident working in the health sector in Hafr Al-Batin" (age and job description not provided) appears to be a new case not described elsewhere.

In addition, the 2 reported deaths referred to in the statement above have occurred in previously reported cases, but have not previously been reported as fatalities, and differ from the 2 fatalities reported in the WHO update below.

As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, presenting an accurate tally of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection is a challenge with the official sources of information releasing reports at different times. As best as this moderator is able to determine from the information available, this current MOH report, when added to the WHO statement above, will increase the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 80, and the number of deaths to 44.

Hafr Al-Batin is located in the Northeastern region of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, 480 km (298 mi) the north of Riyadh, 90 km (56 mi) from the border with Kuwait, and about 70 km (44 mi) from the border with Iraq (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafar_Al-Batin for more information on Hafr Al-Batin and a map showing its location). - Mod.MPP]

[3] WHO: emergency committee meetings on MERS-CoV

Emergency Committee meetings on MERS-CoV announced
--------------------------------------------------
WHO is convening an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The Emergency Committee will meet on [9 and 11 Jul 2013].

[The statement above is currently [6 Jul 2013] available on the main page of the WHO website.

According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), the IHR Emergency Committee "is made up of international experts to provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a "public health emergency of international concern" (PHEIC). Depending on the circumstances, the Emergency Committee may advise on whether or not a PHEIC is occurring. If the Director-General determines that the event constitutes a PHEIC, the Emergency Committee will then provide advice on appropriate Temporary Recommendations of health measures to be implemented by States Parties. As a PHEIC proceeds, the Emergency Committee continues to provide advice to the Director-General on termination of the PHEIC, and the modification and termination of Temporary Recommendations. All decisions on these issues are taken by the Director-General." (http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/ihr_committees/en/index.html.

Accompanying the announcement of the convening of an IHR Emergency Committee was a press conference with Dr Keiji Fukuda. According to newswire releases, a key item on the committee's agenda is whether MERS-CoV should be declared a public health emergency of international (PHEIC) concern under the International Health Regulations, a global health treaty. (Reported by Helen Branswell in Global News, http://globalnews.ca/news/696817/who-setting-up-emergency-panel-to-advise-on-mers-coronavirus/).

ProMED-mail would like to thank ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka for submitting numerous updates on MERS-CoV, including an alert of the information above.

This will be the 2nd time an IHR Emergency Committee is being convened. The 1st meeting was convened on 25 Apr 2009 to address the influenza pandemic A(H1N1) 2009. The committee held 9 meetings addressing the A(H1N1)2009 pandemic (see http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_ec/en/index.html for details).

We await conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee meetings. - Mod.MPP]
