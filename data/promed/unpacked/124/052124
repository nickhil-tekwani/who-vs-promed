Update on the Zika outbreak in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia.
------------------------------------
New cases continue to present at the hospital outpatient department
and community health center sites. However, the rate has slowed since
the peak of late May [2007]. Additional laboratory testing has
returned from the CDC lab in Fort Collins. As of Fri 6 Jul 2007,
there are 60 confirmed Zika cases by PCR and IgM analysis. An
additional 65 probable cases have presented to the outpatient
department of the Yap Memorial Hospital and at the Wa'ab Community
Health Center. Lab tests are pending on these individuals.
Several suspected cases have now been identified through the
neighboring island surveillance program. Arrangements to obtain blood
samples for confirmation are being made.
Current activities by the Yap Department of Health Services include:
1) Public Awareness Campaign - community meetings, radio announcements, fliers
2) Continue Prospective Surveillance - In depth signs and symptoms
interviews with paired serum to better characterize the illness
3) Community Survey - To assess environmental risk factors, mosquito
vectors and island-wide infection rates
These activities are being carried out with assistance from the FSM
National Government, CDC, WHO and Institut Pasteur.
Again, a travel advisory for all in-bound and out-bound passengers to
Yap remains in effect. It asks that individuals visiting Yap avoid
mosquito bites. If a visitor to Yap falls ill while in Yap or after
returning home, they are requested to report to a health
professional. In order to reduce the risk of infecting other islands
or other countries, individuals are strongly advised not to travel if
they are feeling ill. Health professionals who suspect Zika in a
patient (especially with recent travel to Yap) are asked to
immediately inform their local health department and the FSM
Department of Health at (691) 320-2619. To reduce the risk of
establishing local transmission, patients should be instructed to
avoid mosquito exposure during their acute illness.
A short revised summary of the Yap Zika outbreak is below:
Zika is a flavivirus that is similar to the dengue virus, causing
similar but milder symptoms. Like dengue, it is transmitted by
mosquitoes. It was first identified in 1947 in rhesus monkey serum in
Uganda. In 1978 a small outbreak of acute fever in Indonesia was
caused by Zika virus. From the limited cases reported in the
literature, Zika is not believed to have long term health effects in
people. There is no evidence that this infection has affected
pregnant women or their babies in the past
On 22 Jun 2007 blood specimens collected by Yap Department of Health
Services and tested at CDC labs showed that the recent illness on Yap
is likely caused by the Zika virus
The Yap outbreak appears to have started in April 2007 and to have
peaked in late May, however cases continue to present. In this
outbreak the symptoms are mild and generally last for 4-7 days. A
probable case is defined as illness in a resident or visitor to Yap
State with onset since 15 Mar 2007 and 2 of the 3 following signs or
symptoms:
* a maculopapular rash involving the trunk and extremities that is
sometimes pruritic.
* conjunctivitis; and
* joint pain that can affect both large joint and the smaller joints
of the hands and feet.
Other symptoms that have been noted in the Yap outbreak include
fever, retro-orbital eye pain, headache, myalgias, lower extremity
edema, lymphadenopathy, and diarrhea.
Traditionally, illness caused by Zika was termed "Zika Fever."
However most fevers have been subjectively reported; measured fever
has been an inconsistent feature of this Zika outbreak. Rapid tests
used in Yap for Dengue have given false positive results on patients
with Zika virus (PanBio and Pentax).

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bel for this timely update and summary of the Zika
virus situation in Yap, and requests additional information as it
becomes available especially if the virus is isolated (Zika virus has
been identified by CDC by PCR -- polymerase chain reaction -- with
patient blood samples). It would be interesting to know which
mosquito vector(s) (_Aedes_ or others) are transmitting Zika virus in
this outbreak.

Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya share many epidemiological, clinical and
geographic features. (See maps at
http://exhibit.gideononline.com/zika.jpg). An etiological diagnosis
for febrile rash in these regions will increasingly depend upon viral
studies.
