["Avian influenza A viruses are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on molecular characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting. HPAI and LPAI designations do not refer to the severity of illness in cases of human infection with these viruses; both LPAI and HPAI viruses have caused severe illness in humans.

"Poultry infected with LPAI viruses may show no signs of disease or only exhibit mild illness (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production), which may not be detected."

"There are 9 known subtypes of H7 viruses (H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N5, H7N6, H7N7, H7N8, and H7N9). Most H7 viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H7 virus infection in humans is uncommon. The most frequently identified H7 viruses associated with human infection are Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, which were 1st detected in China in 2013. While human infections are rare, these have commonly resulted in severe respiratory illness and death. In addition to Asian lineage H7N9 viruses, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7 virus infections have been reported. These viruses have primarily caused mild to moderate illness in people, with symptoms that include conjunctivitis and/or upper respiratory tract symptoms."

In 2018, the 1st report of a human case infected with avian influenza A/H7N4 was reported in China, see Mod UBA's comments in ProMED-mail post 20180214.5628629. - Mod.CRD
