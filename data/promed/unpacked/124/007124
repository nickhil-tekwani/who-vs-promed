The following item was culled from the printed version of the latest
monthly issue No 24 (July) of the MAFF BSE Enforcement Bulletin. The
on-line version is downloadable from the MAFF Web site as a pdf file.
"Public Summary" of the SEAC meeting of 15 June
[This contained information that has already appeared in the news, but the
following item that I have not seen reported before - JRB
"The Committee reviewed a proposal for research into the possibility that a
hitherto unrecognised strain of BSE could exist in a sub-clinical form,
i.e. cattle could be infected with BSE without ever showing clinical signs
of the disease. They considered a number of methods of detecting a
sub-clinical strain of BSE and the difficulty of distinguishing such an
infection from pre-clinical BSE, i.e. BSE that had not yet reached the
stage at which clinical signs of the disease were apparent. SEAC concluded
that this area of research should be given high priority but noted that
further refinements to the diagnostic tests and to the design of possible
studies were necessary".
