[According to the report above, a total of 82 954 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 7 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (16 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 7 new cases of confirmed infections -- 3 locally acquired cases (2 in Jilin province and 1 in Shanghai) and 4 imported cases, (all 4 from Inner Mongolia).

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1704 imported cases reported.

There were 18 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 16 locally acquired cases and 2 imported cases. There were no cases with conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 448, and 31 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 15 cases with 1 death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (16 to 17 May 2020) when there were 13 newly confirmed cases and no deaths. A total of 11 065 confirmed cases and 263 deaths were reported today (17 May 2020), up from 11 050 cases and 262 deaths yesterday (16 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 45 consecutive days and below 50 for 38 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 10 days. In today's (17 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 10 of the cases were import related, and 5 were locally transmitted. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (2), Chungbuk (2) and Daegu (1). Imported cases were in Quarantine (7) and 1 each in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Chungbuk.

The English language update on the 15 newly confirmed cases (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) presents graphs and tables on the epidemiology of the cases in terms of age distribution, types of cases, case fatalities by province, population based rates by province, and by age group, and epidemic curves.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 225 435 cases, including 31 908 deaths, up from 224 760 cases and 31 763 deaths reported on 16 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 15 and 16 May 2020 was 675 newly confirmed cases, compared with 875 newly confirmed cases between 15 and 16 May 2020, a decrease of 200 from yesterday's (16 May 2020) change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 67.1% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 48.3% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Today (17 May 2020) for the 1st time, Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 11 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (2 provinces, Aosta Valley and Calabria, reported no new cases), and another 6 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Lazio are the 3 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 64 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 63 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. See section [7] from COVID-19-update (157): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local transm, Italy phase 2 20200505.7300349 for details on phase 2 opening.

[4] Iran: 120 198 total cases, 6988 deaths
Date: Sun 17 May 2020
Source: Arab News [abridged, edited]
https://www.arabnews.com/node/1676281/middle-east


Large swaths of Iran faced a lethal "2nd wave" of coronavirus infections on Sunday [16 May 2020] as the official death toll surged toward 7000.

The southwestern province of Khuzestan is the new focal point, with the most critical "red" ranking on the country's color-coded risk scale. "Khuzestan is in a critical situation," Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. Iran stopped publishing provincial figures for the coronavirus last month [April 2020], but the Health Ministry's latest report on Sunday [17 May 2020] said there was a "rising trend, or the beginning of a peak" in 8 provinces, including Khuzestan.

Jahanpour said the COVID-19 illness had claimed a further 51 lives over 24 hours into Sunday [17 May 2020]. The ministry raised the overall death toll to 6988 since Iran announced its 1st fatalities in the pilgrimage city of Qom in February [2020]. The number of infections rose by 1806 to an official total of 120 198, but experts both inside and outside Iran have voiced skepticism about the official figures, and say the real toll is much higher.

Adding fuel to that speculation, organizers of Iran's annual Quds Day rallies in support of the Palestinians defied President Hassan Rouhani and canceled the events. Rouhani had said on Saturday [16 May 2020] that the parades would go ahead next Friday [23 May 2020] with protective measures against the virus, but organizers said on Sunday [17 May 2020] the rallies could not be held "decently" and would be scrapped, apart from a televised speech by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

[In the 24 hours from 16 to 17 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 118 392 to 120 198 total cases, an increase of 1806 compared with 1757 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (16 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6937 to 6988, an increase of 51 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Spain, the UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 17 May 2020; 19:31 EDT (GMT-4). As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 527 664, including 90 978 deaths, an increase from 1 507 773 cases and 90 113 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 359 847 (23.6%) cumulative case reports and 1748 (8.8%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 190 408 as of 1:45 PM EDT on 17 May 2020, including 15 888 confirmed deaths and an additional 4832 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (1808 -- 9.1%), New York (1748 -- 8.8%), Illinois (1734 -- 8.7%), California (1580 -- 7.9%), Massachusetts (1077 -- 5.4%), Texas (1005 -- 5.1%), and Maryland (836 -- 4.2%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Maryland.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Russia, Spain, UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, and New Jersey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 India, 13 Illinois, 14 Peru, 15 Massachusetts, 16 China, 17 California, 18 Canada, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Italy and France (it would be number 7).

The US military has confirmed 8374 cumulative cases, with no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 12 060 cumulative cases and 64 new cases today (17 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 3912 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (no newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2646 cases (57 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Florida with 777 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Connecticut with 716 newly confirmed cases, Virginia with 705 newly confirmed cases, Minnesota with 699 newly confirmed cases, Michigan with 638 newly confirmed cases, North Carolina with 529 newly confirmed cases, and Pennsylvania with 509 newly confirmed cases. 30 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

There were 421 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 539 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 14 to 15 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 231 350 [277 719] cases as compared with 230 698 [276 505] confirmed cases on 16 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 650 deaths reported today (16 May 2020) and 27 563 deaths reported on 15 May 2020, an increase of 87 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 20.45, a continual slow decrease over the past 26 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 20.45 today (16 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.
