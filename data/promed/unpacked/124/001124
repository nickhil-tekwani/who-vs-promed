A baby died and 9 other newborns were seriously ill on Tuesday [30
Dec 2008] after a suspected outbreak of the rare Legionnaires'
disease at a hospital in Cyprus, medics said.

The newborn died on Tuesday [30 Dec 2008] and a 2nd was in critical
condition while 8 more were being treated for exposure to the same
bacteria, doctors said. All 10 were born at the same private clinic
in December [2008] and were less than 2 weeks old.

"Initial tests suggest it is the legionella bacteria," said health
minister Christos Patsalides. The private hospital has shut down its
maternity ward.

Legionnaires is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia, caused by an
airborne bacteria normally generated in moist environments.

[Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About
80-90 percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immuno-suppression.
Pediatric cases of Legionnaires' disease are uncommon. Most reported
cases have involved neonates and children who are immunocompromised.
Nosocomial Legionnaires' disease associated with water birth has been
reported in a few neonates
(<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/965492-overview>).

Usually the water system in a hospital is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are usually found primarily in the hot water portion of
plumbing systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of
25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the
organism in plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded
in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's
pipes and containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can
be increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols
can be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems,
shower heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>

An epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of
_Legionella_ organisms should be initiated when the 1st case of
hospital-acquired legionellosis is identified. Genotyping patient and
environmental isolates will help to confirm the environmental source.
