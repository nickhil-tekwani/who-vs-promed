Parks Canada says 47 bison carcasses have so far been counted as an outbreak of anthrax continues inside Wood Buffalo National Park.

Bison are susceptible to anthrax, and past Northwest Territories [NWT] outbreaks have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of animals. Ordinarily, Parks Canada said, the Wood Buffalo herd numbers around 5000 animals.

Not all carcasses observed may necessarily be part of the outbreak. Parks Canada says 2 field-tested cases have been identified to date, and none have been confirmed in a laboratory. "We're certainly keeping an eye on what's happening," said Jean Morin, the park's acting superintendent, on Friday [22 Jul 2022], adding that the number of deceased bison did not yet appear to be having a significant impact on the herd as a whole. "As soon as the weather cools off a little bit, usually the outbreak stops," he said. "I don't expect we'll reach a number that would be significant enough that it would have an impact."

The outbreak was first reported earlier this week.

Anthrax outbreaks don't happen every summer but are triggered, Morin said, by conditions similar to those experienced over the past couple of years: fluctuations in the water table followed by heat. The park, he said, has an outbreak of note every 5-10 years.

In 2012, an anthrax outbreak among bison in the Northwest Territories killed more than 300 animals. Morin said Parks Canada was "in contact" with NWT authorities, but the risk of the current outbreak spreading from herd to herd is considered low.

At the moment, carcasses are turning up in the southern reaches of the park. Several areas near the Peace River -- the Sweetgrass Station, the Trident Creek and Meadows area, and the Peace Point junction with the old Garden River Road -- have been closed.

The remainder of the park is open, and Parks Canada says the risk to humans is minimal.

"We have a team to deal with carcasses," said Morin. "It's important to tell all the land users that are out and about, whether it's in the park or outside, to keep an eye and report any animals they come across that are deceased. Then we can better assess them and keep an eye on the larger picture."

I am puzzled that the laboratory was unable to confirm the field test results that it was anthrax. In my experience, the field test kit that they use is very reliable. If and when they sample again, it would be wise to also take nasal turbinate swabs and culture the swabs, which, if it is anthrax, should have viable anthrax spores. An old problem is that when you take blood samples but are delayed getting it/them back to the lab, the vegetative organism will have died. The spores are robust; the vegetative cells are not. We have seen this problem before when there were delays in getting blood samples down to the Lethbridge diagnostic laboratory in southern Alberta. And whatever the cause might be, at present I am very comforted by the fact that the carcasses are now being burned. The Canadian Hot-Shot teams are extremely efficient, and it takes them less than 8 hours to complete a carcass burn. These are big animals, and the average weight of an adult working bull bison is 2500 lbs.

The 1st reports of bison anthrax were by the Hudson Bay Trading Co, which reported widespread bison deaths in 1843 or so in the Peace River area. It is not a new disease in these northern wood bison. - Mod.MHJ]
