I am performing a review about bleeding in patients with dengue in order to
update the pathophysiology and [case] management. If you have or know any
good report (with solid evidence), please send it to me at my mailing
address below. Of course, I would welcome any suggests, comments,
recommendations [via] e-mail.

[Abstracted from "Fields Virology": The W.H.O. has formulated specific
guidelines for the management of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases (World
Health Organization. Technical guide for diagnosis, treatment,
surveillance, prevention, and control of dengue hemorrhagic fever. W.H.O.,
Geneva, 1982). Treatment is dictated by the need to closely monitor the
patient's vital signs and hematocrit and to replace plasma volume by fluid
replacement. Oxygen should be administered. Heparin therapy my be
considered if disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs.
Salicylates and hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided.
If one of our readers has detailed text on this subject, please send it
