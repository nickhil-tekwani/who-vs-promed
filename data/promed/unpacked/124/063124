There is a worrisome outbreak of leptospirosis in Santa Fe province.
Following the storm that blew across the region in April 2007,
various foci of infection were detected. In Rosario, there are 39
suspected leptospirosis cases, of which 3 were confirmed, and an
alarming number of cases of this disease in Santa Fe, where the
number reached almost 400 cases. In the capital city, there now have
been 5 deaths with symptoms [compatible with] this disease.
The 39 suspected cases occurred in the zones most affected by the
floods in this city. Most are from the Cristaleria, Nuevo Alberdi and
Empalme Graneros neighborhoods in the area northwest of Rosario.
As far as prevention tasks go, the Secretary of Health explained,
"prophylaxis is being carried out house-by-house in all of the
Northern District in conjunction with the provincial authorities to
deliver treatment measures and prophylaxis in this situation."
Finally, the national Ministry of Health put the nation on alert for
all of those provinces with flooding emergencies similar to those of
Santa Fe.

[Exposure to water contaminated with urine from leptospira-infected
animals is the major risk factor for leptospire infection. The
symptoms of leptospirosis in humans are similar to several other
tropical and subtropical diseases. It is likely that the numbers of
infected individuals in this outbreak are considerably higher than
the nearly 400 reported here, as both misdiagnosis or failure to
detect milder cases would affect the actual incidence. An excellent,
more complete discussion of leptospirosis by Mod.LL can be found in
archive no. 20040805.2141.
