According to the Ministry of Health, 240,587 cases of dengue were reported
in 1997 in Brazil (57,121 more cases than in the year 1996). In only the
southeast area in January of 1998 the transmission increased 586% when
compared with January of 1997. According to the Minister the amplification
of virus (principally dengue-1 but also dengue-2) is due to the effects of
El Nino (increase in mean temperature and humidity in the past months,
advancing the rainy season, foreseen for March to June).
The lack of resources for prevention and vector control in municipal
districts is thought to have contributed to the acute increase in number of
cases.
