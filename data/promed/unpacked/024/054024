The mosquito variety capable of carrying dengue has extended its presence from San Luis, Arizona to Somerton, and maybe into parts of Yuma.

The Yuma County Pest Abatement District earlier this summer [2015] set out about 150 mosquito traps in and around Somerton, finding the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in traps in 17 homes in the city, the district's entomologist, Chris Summer, says. The district also reported collecting eggs of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in a residential subdivision in Yuma.

So far, there have been no reported cases anywhere in Yuma County of anyone actually contracting dengue, although the county health department says it has received reports of people having moved here after having gotten the virus elsewhere.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito must 1st bite a human carrier of dengue [virus] before it can pass it along to another person. It breeds in stagnant water, prompting the district and the health department to make periodic reminders to residents to dry up puddles in their yards or empty containers or receptacles that collect water.

_Aedes aegypti_ typically is found in tropical areas, and Richard Cuming, a vector control specialist for the health department, said that before turning up last year [2014] in San Luis, this mosquito had been seen little, if at all, in the Yuma area since the late 1950s.

_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in even higher numbers in the Phoenix area and Tucson in the last year [2014], and the mosquitoes also have turned up in San Luis Rio Colorado and throughout Sonora [Mexico], where health officials have reported numerous cases of dengue among the Mexican state's residents in 2014.

As winter arrived in 2014, the mosquitoes became dormant, but with the onset of hot weather this spring and summer [2015], they're active again, not only reappearing in San Luis but extending their range to Somerton. Sumner said the Somerton residences where the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were trapped were typically older homes with green landscaping and potted plants.

While more at home in tropical areas, he said, _Aedes aegyti_ can thrive in drier climates if they can find suitable shade and water sources, such as gardens and watered lawns. They also can thrive indoors, providing they can find a small receptacle of water where they can breed, said Sumner. "They fit in well with the urban lifestyle," said Sumner.

"It's not boiling over (with _Aedes aegypti_), but there are obviously more than what we found," he added. "I've not had complaints about mosquito abundance in Somerton. These mosquitoes are not in big enough numbers to cause complaints."

The likelihood of a mosquito transmitting dengue to a human is complicated by several factors, said Summer. 1st, the mosquito must bite a person already infected with dengue [virus], and so far no cases have been found of Yuma-area residents contracting it locally. Then the virus must incubate about 2 weeks in the mosquito before it can be transmitted, he said. If after the [extrinsic] incubation period it's still alive, the insect has a short flight range that may preclude it from reaching any or a large number of people. But the risk of human infection becomes greater, says Cuming, if someone contracts dengue elsewhere and then brings it to the Yuma area, where he or she may be bitten by a mosquito that, in turn, passes it along to anyone else living under the same roof.

As with other maladies, the best treatment for dengue is prevention, Cuming and Sumner say, and the best way to prevent its spread is to deny breeding sites to the mosquitoes. Birdbaths, water bowls, saucers for potted plants should be emptied or at least routinely changed, and discarded cans and jars should be collected before they can accumulate water, they said. Swimming pools are OK as long as they're maintained, Cuming says.

[It is not clear whether the _Ae. aegypti_ in Arizona came from the adjoining state of California or across the border from Mexico. This mosquito has been found at several locations in California in the past 3 years and again this year (2015). So far, there have been no reports that this mosquito has become permanently established either in Arizona or in California. However, the risk of ongoing transmission of introduced viruses remains as long as this vector mosquito is present.

It is likely that a few travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in Arizona sporadically. One case of chikungunya virus infection in Arizona, but acquired elsewhere, has already been documented this year (2015). Should _Ae. aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in Arizona because window and door screens and air conditioning present barriers for vector mosquitoes, and especially because of effective vector control. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks. - Mod.TY
