Viet Nam: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 16
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has provided WHO with official
confirmation of an additional 8 human cases of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection. 2 of the cases were recently detected,
between 2 and 8 Apr 2005, in Hung Yen and Ha Tay Provinces,
respectively. Both patients are alive. The other 6 cases are thought
to have been detected prior to 2 Apr 2005. WHO is seeking further
details from the authorities on these 6 cases.
The Ministry of Health has reported to WHO that 41 cases from 18
cities and provinces have been detected in Viet Nam since
mid-December 2004. Of these cases, 16 have died and 6 remain under
treatment.

Viet Nam: HIV Carrier Infected with Avian Influenza Virus
--------------------------------------------------
A 21-year-old woman has been infected by both the HIV/AIDS virus and
avian influenza virus, the 1st such case in Viet Nam, health
officials said on Thu 14 Apr 2005. Nguyen Van Thich, head of the
Centre for Preventive Medicine in the northern province of Quang
Ninh, said the woman, the 1st to be diagnosed with both avian
influenza virus and HIV in Viet Nam, used to work at a hairdressers's
shop. She was hospitalised in late March 2005 with fever and
coughing. "She is still very weak," he told Reuters, adding that the
woman has been treated at a provincial hospital. Quang Ninh province
bordering China has one of the highest number of HIV carriers in Viet
Nam, most of them drug addicts and prostitutes.
The Health Ministry said 2 other patients have been diagnosed with
the H5N1 virus in the northern provinces of Ha Tay and Hung Yen
between 2 and 8 Apr 2005, but no deaths were reported. The latest
findings brought to 41 the total number of patients who contracted
avian influenza virus infection in Viet Nam since December 2004, 16
of whom have died, the Ministry said in a statement.
Viet Nam has reported 68 human infections of the H5N1 virus since the
disease first hit Asia in late 2003, killing 36 Vietnamese. 12 Thais
and 3 Cambodians have also died of the virus that the World Health
Organisation says has the potential to mutate into a form that could
pass easily between humans and cause a pandemic in which millions
could die. Doctor Hoang Thuy Long, former head of the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, told a government meeting on
Wednesday that most of the infected people in Vietnam, including
several family clusters, had contact with sick birds. "Even though so
far the transmission mechanism of the disease remains unclear, avian
influenza H5N1 serotype virus in Viet Nam shows no sign of being
spread directly from human to human."

[The fate of the patient experiencing HIV and AI virus co-infection
may give an initial indication of any effect of HIV status on
susceptibility to avian influenza virus infection. The HIV patient --
though weak -- appears to be resisting AI virus infection better than
some of those not known to be HIV carriers, and hopefully the outcome
will show that an HIV/AIDS status does not predispose individuals to
greatly enhanced risk. - Mod.CP]
