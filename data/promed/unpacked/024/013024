At the weekly meeting of the National Crisis Committee on Epidemics
on 6 Sep 2007, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Public Health
noted that, in Guinea, there was a slight decrease in the number of
cholera cases compared to the previous week. Nevertheless the state
of alert should be maintained. With several weeks more to go before
the end of the rainy season, the number of cases and deaths is likely
to rise. In 2006, the month of November recorded the largest number of cases.
Between 27 Aug and 2 Sep 2007, 573 new cholera cases and 22 deaths
were reported in Guinea, 349 cases including 12 deaths in Conakry
alone. Other towns include Fria (an industrial city) with 70 cases
and 4 deaths, Coyah with 58 cases including 3 deaths, Kindia with 39
cases including 3 deaths, Dubreka with 34 cases, Forecariah, 14
cases, Gueckedou (Guinee Forestiere) 6 cases, and Boffa with 3 cases.
Since the beginning of 2007, more than 3847 cholera cases have been
reported in the country. The number of cases is more than twice as
high as it was this time in 2006, 1789. About 135 people have died
from cholera in Guinea in 2007 as compared to 148 in 2006.
In rural areas, other towns have reported cases of severe diarrhea,
including fatalities. The town of Telimele (135 km (84 mi) from
Kindia) reported 19 cases including 4 deaths and Banko, a village in
the town of Dabola, recorded 23 cases and 2 deaths. Stool samples
collected from patients are being sent to Conakry for confirmation of
cholera. Immediate measures are being taken to provide potable water
and adequate drugs to affected areas, which would help in preventing
the spread of the epidemic. New centers for the treatment of cholera
have been opened and a sensitization campaign launched in Telimele and Dabola.

of the cases are reported from the western part of the country
(Guinee Maritime) in the regions of Kindia (where Conakry is) and
Boke, but other cases are more central in the Haute Guinee area
(Faranah region) as well as in southwestern Guinee Forestiere
(Nzerekore region). - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Swaziland (Shiselweni)
Date: Tue 11 Sep 2007

Information Networks (IRIN) report [edited]

Swazis have become acquainted with the term "water rationing" as they
struggle to cope with one of the longest dry periods in memory.
"Water levels are down nationwide," said Jameson Mkhonta, public
relations officer for the Swaziland Water Services Corporation, the
parastatal water utility. "The drought ... [has affected the entire
country], and not just in the south and east where it is usually dry."
About 40 percent of Swaziland's one million people are facing acute
food and water shortages, according to UN agencies. Most of the water
cuts are unannounced, but when they last for several days the
government trucks in water to the affected communities.
The rapidly shrinking water sources have undoubtedly aggravated the
plight of the food insecure. "You wonder what people are doing with
the maize meal they receive as food aid when there is no water for
cooking?" asked a humanitarian relief worker in Manzini.
Families have resorted to drinking water from small local dams,
streams and rivers and even, in some cases, sharing dwindling water
supplies with livestock, sparking fears that waterborne diseases,
which have already occurred, could spread.
Hlatikhulu Government hospital, in the rural Shiselweni Region in the
south of the country, this week reported a substantial increase in
cases of cholera, an acute intestinal infection caused by
contaminated water or food.

[3] Cholera - Iraq (northern)

The cholera outbreak in northern Iraq has so far been limited to 3
provinces but could spread south, though countermeasures are being
taken, a Health Ministry official said Wed 12 Sep 2007.
Since the disease broke out in mid-August 2007, 10 people have died
and some 700 others have been confirmed with cholera, said Adel
Muhsin, the Health Ministry's inspector general. Another 11 000 are
suffering from symptoms like severe diarrhea and vomiting, Muhsin said.
Worst hit has been the city of Sulaimaniyah, in the province of the
same name, which has seen 4600 cases of diarrhea and 300 cases of
cholera, said Sherko Abdullah, the head of the regional health
ministry department. Of the 10 deaths, 9 have been in the city, he
said. It has also been reported in the northern provinces of Erbil
[spelled Arbil on the map below - Mod.LL] and Tamim [At Ta'mim on the
map, also known as Kirkuk province. - Mod.LL]
"No new cases have been discovered yet in other parts in Iraq and it
is not impossible this will happen, but we are taking steps to
contain and prevent the disease from spreading to other areas," Muhsin said.
Last week [3-9 Sep 2007], United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
official Paolo Lembo said the outbreak was caused by the "inadequacy
of the water supply system and deteriorated infrastructure" of the
area. Now, medical teams are regularly testing drinking water in
Baghdad and other areas, and the Health Ministry is working to
provide chlorine to drinking water plants, which can kill the
bacteria responsible for cholera.
"The more we pay attention to the drinking water regarding chlorine,
the more we prevent an outbreak of this disease elsewhere," Muhsin said.

[The numbers of estimated cases of diarrhea are increased, but how
much of these numbers are cholera is unclear. The affected provinces
can be found on a map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/iraq.pdf>. Given
the overall state of the infrastructure of Iraq further spread to
more central areas of the country is certainly possible. - Mod.LL]
