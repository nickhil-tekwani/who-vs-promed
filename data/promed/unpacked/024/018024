The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in
collaboration with the WHO Representative Office in China, has
released a preliminary report on the hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) outbreak due to enterovirus 71 (EV71) in Fuyang City, Anhui
Province [the most severely affected locality - Mod.CP].

Reporting on the occurrence of HFMD in Anhui province and the rest of
the country will now take place on a monthly basis together with
other notifiable diseases in China.

As part of the efforts to implement the International Health
Regulations, IHR(2005), China will further strengthen the early
warning system by immediate notification of clustering of clinically
abnormal and severe cases, as well as increasing international
collaboration and information exchange.

An English version of the preliminary report can be downloaded from
the World Health Organization China Office website:
