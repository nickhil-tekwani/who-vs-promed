The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections involving 3 provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario.

Based on the investigation findings to date, Rosemount brand cooked diced chicken has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Rosemount cooked diced chicken was supplied to institutions (including cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes) where many of the individuals who became sick resided or visited before becoming ill.

On [18 Aug 2019] the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued a food recall warning for Rosemount brand cooked diced chicken meat '13mm - Â½" (hash 16305), packdate - 01/21/2019'. During the food safety investigation, the CFIA identified additional affected products, and updated food recall warnings have been issued. For additional details on all recalled product names and lot codes, please consult CFIA's website.

Canadians are advised not to eat any of the recalled products or any foods containing the recalled products. Food service establishments are advised not to sell or serve any recalled products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using recalled products.

The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that more products linked to the outbreak investigation will be identified. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary
---------------------
As of [23 Aug 2019], there have been 7 confirmed cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ illness in 3 provinces: British Columbia (1), Manitoba (1) and Ontario (5). Individuals became sick between November 2017 and June 2019. A total of 6 individuals have been hospitalized. Individuals who became ill are between 51 and 97 years of age. The majority of cases (86%) are female.

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated because of an increase of listeria illnesses that were reported in June 2019. Through the use of a laboratory method called whole genome sequencing, 2 listeria illnesses from November 2017 were identified to have the same genetic strain as the illnesses that occurred between April and June 2019. It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because of the period of time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. In national _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak investigations, the reporting time period is usually between 4 and 6 weeks.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also investigating an outbreak of listeria illnesses occurring in several states. The type of listeria identified in the USA is closely related genetically (by whole genome sequencing) to the listeria making people sick in Canada. Canada and US public health and food safety partners are collaborating on these ongoing investigations.

Epidemiological information
---------------------------
Figure 1 [at the source URL] is an epidemiological curve for this outbreak. This information is used by outbreak investigators to show when illnesses begin, when they peak, and when they trail off. It can take several weeks from the time a person becomes ill to when the illness is reported and testing confirms a link to the outbreak. Data are available for 7 cases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), several states, and federal partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections. This investigation is ongoing and has not identified a specific food item, grocery store, or restaurant chain as the source of infections. CDC is not recommending that consumers avoid any particular food at this time. Restaurants and retailers are not advised to avoid serving or selling any particular food. We will update our advice if a source is identified.

Latest outbreak information:
- Reported cases: 24
- States: 13
- Hospitalizations: 22
- Deaths: 2

A total of 24 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 13 states. Of 23 ill people with information available, 22 hospitalizations have been reported. In addition, 2 deaths have been reported.

_Listeria_ specimens were collected from ill people from 20 Jul 2017 to 1 Aug 2019. Ill people range in age from 35 to 92 years, with a median age of 72. Sixty-three per cent of ill people are female.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is also investigating an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections in several Canadian provinces linked to cooked diced chicken. Whole genome sequencing showed that the type of listeria making people sick in Canada is closely related genetically to the listeria making people sick in the USA.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures they had before their illness started. CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[In the USA and Canada, clusters of possibly related cases are identified based on genotypes of their clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that match. In the USA, these isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the listeria case report from patients in the cluster to identify a common food source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

In Canada, a cluster of 7 cases, aged 51 to 97 years, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, identified by whole genome sequencing, occurred in 3 provinces between November 2017 and June 2019. Cooked diced chicken from 2 producers has been recalled and is identified as a likely source of this outbreak.

In the USA, a cluster of 24 cases, aged 35 to 92 years, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, identified based on whole genome sequencing, occurred in 13 states between July 2017 to August 2019. The outbreak strain of listeria identified in the USA is closely related genetically by whole genome sequencing to the Canadian outbreak strain. However, the specific food item has not been identified as yet in the USA as the source of the infections.

We await further developments as the investigations proceed. Because of delays in reporting and the long incubation period of listeriosis of up to 70 days after exposure to listeria for symptoms to develop, more cases can be expected. - Mod.ML
