According to the Department of Emergency Situations, 5 inhabitants of the
settlement Talovka, in the Zhanibekskiy district, have been delivered to
the district hospital with symptoms of cutaneous anthrax, a form of the
disease less dangerous than the pulmonary form. In the settlement, the
deaths of 4 cattle have also been recorded.
According to Alexander Grazhdanov, chief of the anti-plague station, the
infection of people takes place during the butchering of sick animals.
Presently, representatives from the management of the state sanitary
epidemiological supervision and anti-plague station have arrived in
Talovka. The focus of infection and patients are protected by the police.
The last case of anthrax in the western Kazakhstan region was registered 8
years ago. At that time, the focus of the epidemic was located by the
efforts of physicians, and all patients received medical treatment and
recovered.

[Western Kazakhstan borders 5 Russian regions: Astrakhan, Volgograd,
Saratov, Samara and Orenburg and 2 regions in the Republic of Kazakhstan:
Aktyubinsk and Atyrausk. The total area of the region is 151 300 sq km. The
city Uralsk is the capital of western Kazakhstan. - Mod.NP]
[Unfortunately, the activities of the Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture do not
receive equal news coverage, so it is unclear whether the Kazakh Veterinary
Service was involved before or after the human cases were found, if at all.
And thus, the laboratory confirmation on the 4 dead cows is not provided.
In a number of countries, it is an unfortunate fact of life that anthrax
control procedures are invoked only after human cases are found or
suspected. As only a proportion of livestock cases result in human cases,
the true situation is, thus, not known, and by only activating control
programs for this minority of human-related outbreaks, the disease
continues expensively on its merry way. - Mod.MHJ]
