Spain is on Salm-Net. All the data from the European countries
are centralized in London, where we have sent our own data.
Anyway if you need any particular data from Spain, the same information sent
to Salm-Net can be found in our Boletin Epidemiologico Semanal
[described in the previous post on this subject].
