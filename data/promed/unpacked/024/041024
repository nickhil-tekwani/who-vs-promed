Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Nubian ibex: _Capra nubiana_ (bovidae) / 30 / 14 / 13 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The herd of ibexes is in a vast enclosure in the biblical zoo of Jerusalem. The clinical symptoms seen are diarrhea, which turns to bloody diarrhea, recumbency, crusts on the muzzle. At post-mortem, there was classic abomasitis and diarrhea (in 50 percent of the cases, bloody diarrhea). In 2 of the ibexes, bronchointerstitial pneumonia was found.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Nubian ibex: _Capra nubiana_ (bovidae) / 46.67 / 43.33 / 92.86 / 43.33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The epidemiological investigation revealed that no new animals have been introduced into the herd during the weeks before the outbreak. Also, it was concluded that no contact is possible between the ibexes and wild or domestic ruminants from outside the zoological garden. Humans or fomites could be the source of introduction of the virus into the zoo.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; zoning; no treatment of affected animals; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

[The event has taken place in Jerusalem's renowned biblical zoo. Their web-page on the Nubian ibex (_Capra ibex nubiana_) is at https://www.jerusalemzoo.org/home-english. Ibex in Israel are found in 4 subpopulations: Judean Desert, the Negev Highlands, Eilat Mountains and Golan Heights. Additional information is to be found at https://www.teva.org.il/?CategoryID=949&ArticleID=4910.

PPR appeared 1st in northern Israel in January 1993 (notification in OIE's Bulletin of 29 January 1993, Vol. 6 - No. 3). The route of introduction (most likely, from Lebanon) has not been established. Since then, the disease has become endemic and controlled mainly by mass vaccinations.

On 1 Jul 2016, Israel's State veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) published the discontinuation of compulsory, State organized PPR vaccinations, declaring further vaccinations as privatized and voluntary. - Mod.AS
