Bluetongue in Spain: Follow-up report No. 6
-------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 28 Jan 2005 from Dr Arnaldo Cabello
Navarro, Deputy Director General of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, Madrid:
End of previous report period: 9 Dec 2004.
End of this report period: 27 Jan 2005.
Precise identification of agent: bluetongue virus serotype 4.
Details of new outbreaks:
[The report includes a table -- omitted here -- specifying the details of
116 outbreaks which started between 15 Oct and 23 Dec 2004 in 3 provinces
("1st administrative division"): 102 in Andalusia, 2 in Ceuta and 12 in
Extremadura. Further details in the table: Lower administrative division/
Type of epidemiological unit/ Name of the location/ Date of start of the
outbreak/ Species/ Number of animals in the outbreak/susceptible/ cases/
deaths/ destroyed/ slaughtered. All said data may be viewed to at the above
web-site. - Mod.AS]
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete
Diagnostic tests used: ELISA for antibody detection; RT-PCR.
Source of outbreaks: vectors.
Control measures undertaken:
- control of arthropods;
- partial stamping out [the total number of destroyed animals, as detailed
in the above table, was 168];
- movement control inside the country;
- zoning;
- vaccination.
Vaccination in response to the outbreaks:
1st administrative division/species/ Total number of vaccinated animals/
Details of the vaccine
Andalusia/ bov*/ 328 258/ serotype 4 monovalent live attenuated virus vaccine
[* bov should probably read ovi. - Mod.AS]
Extremadura/ ovi/ 426 246/ serotype 4 monovalent live attenuated virus vaccine
Treatment of affected animals: no.
Vaccination prohibited: no.

[The affected species, as reported for each of the 116 outbreaks, were the
following: ovines 59; bovines 34; caprines 4; ovines+caprines 10;
bovines+ovines 3; ovines+caprines+bovines 6. Though not specified in the
report, it might be assumed that most if not all cases reported in bovines
and caprines were subclinical. More detailed information pertaining to this
issue could help. - Mod.AS]

In relation to Bluetongue, the said table contained the following data:
France confirmed 5 outbreaks during the said period (last date of
confirmation 1 Feb 2005).
Spain confirmed 6 outbreaks during the said period (last date of
confirmation 3 Jan 2005).

[Portugal has not reported any outbreaks during 2005; the last outbreak
there, according to Portugal's follow-up report No 4 to the OIE (14 Jan
2005), occurred in a sheep flock in Alentejo, starting 7 Dec 2004. Of 135
susceptible animals, 49 showed clinical signs, 22 died, and 113 were
destroyed. <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_10.HTM#Sec9>
As recently summarized by Purce et al [1], since its arrival in Europe in
1998, BT has caused the deaths of more than one million sheep. The epidemic
began during October 1998, when BTV-9 was detected on 4 Greek islands close
to the Turkish coast (Rhodes, Leros, Kos and Samos). In subsequent years up
to 2004, BTV-9 spread northward (into western regions of Turkey, Bulgaria,
Kosovo, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia) and westward (into mainland
Greece, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica). A further 3 serotypes, BTV-1,
BTV-4 and BTV-16, also entered Europe from the east (through Greece) and
then spread westwards. A separate incursion of BTV-2 also occurred in 2000,
spreading from Tunisia and/or Algeria into Sardinia, Sicily, mainland
Italy, Corsica and the Balearic islands. In late 2004, further incursions
(this time of BTV-4) occurred from Morocco into southwestern Spain and
southern Portugal. This last outbreak is expected to be terminated by now,
following the seasonal pattern, related to the annual fall in temperatures,
as observed in other BT-infected Middle-Eastern countries for decades.
The outbreaks involving Spain and Portugal were caused by BTV serotype 4.
Its recurrence next season (generally, commencing in July/August) cannot be
predicted at this stage. Some serotypes have now persisted for up to 6
years in parts of Europe, a pattern that is consistent with frequent
over-wintering as opposed to reincursion of particular strains.

spread into and within Europe:
