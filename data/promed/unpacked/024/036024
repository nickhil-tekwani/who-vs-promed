Key points

Table 1: Summary of current week indicators [for week 3]
Suspected cases (negative): 159 (78)
Confirmed cases: 81
Deaths: 10
Case fatality rate (CFR): 12.3%
Number of states affected: 6
LGAs affected: 17

Table 2: Cumulative data compared to previous year (week 1 - current week) [for 2019 and 2020]
Suspected cases (negative)
- 2019: 379 (237)
- 2020: 398 (235)
Confirmed cases
- 2019: 141
- 2020: 163
Deaths for confirmed cases
- 2019: 33
- 2020: 24
CFR%
- 2019: 23.4%
- 2020: 14.7%

Highlights

- In week 3, the number of new confirmed cases has increased from 64 cases in week 1, 2020, to 81. These [new cases] were reported from 6 states (Ondo, Edo, Delta, Taraba, Plateau, and Bauchi) (Table 3).
- The number of deaths has decreased. The overall CFR for 2020 is (14.7%), which is lower than the CFR for the same period during 2019 (23.4%) (Figure 5).
- In total for 2020, 9 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 32 local government areas [LGAs].
- 89% of all confirmed cases are from Edo (38%), Ondo (38%), and Ebonyi (11%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 11-40 years (range: greater than 11 to 60 years; median age: 33 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1 (Figure 3).
- The number of suspected cases has increased but is lower than the numbers reported in 2019.
- No healthcare-worker infection was identified in the reporting week 3.

Table 5: Response activities

Challenges
- Sustainability of Lassa fever outbreak response by states
- Poor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high-burden communities
- Poor risk communication activities at the state level leading to late presentation of cases
- Poor IPC institutionalisation at state level and treatment centres
- Implementation of rodent control measures in hotspot LGAs - phase 2

Notes on this report
Data source
- Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the Technical Working Group.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, or
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, or any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation)
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever
- Active state: means where there has been at least one confirmed case, and contacts within 21 days post-exposure
- CFR for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[2] Ondo state

In Ondo state, 16 people have been confirmed killed as a result of a Lassa fever outbreak. The state chief epidemiologist, Dr Steven Fagbemi, disclosed this on Tuesday [21 Jan 2020] at the governor's office in the Government House in Akure, the state capital.

Dr Fagbemi made the disclosure while briefing Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as well as the local government chairmen from Ondo North and Central senatorial districts of the state. He also revealed that 84 cases have been reported so far in the state since 1 Jan 2020.

According to the epidemiologist, 16 of the patients have passed on, as their cases had reached the advanced stage before they were taken to the hospital. He added that 47 patients on admission were responding to treatment, while 21 others had already been treated and discharged.

The outbreak is said to have affected Owo, Akoko South-West, Akure South, and Ondo West LGAs of the state.

Also confirming the outbreak, the commissioner for health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, noted that the disease has been occurring in the state for some years, especially during the dry season. He therefore advised Nigerians to visit hospitals when they noticed symptoms of fever.

Earlier, Governor Akeredolu advised the local government chairmen in the state to deploy cleaners to markets and public places to prevent the outbreak of diseases. He also called on residents to maintain a high level of hygiene to curtail further spread of the Lassa virus in the state.

[The 81 new confirmed and 159 suspected cases in week 3 of 2020 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing to accelerate. The 1st report above confirms that Ondo state has the majority of cases, tied with Edo state. Nigeria is now entering the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:
_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis
_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/
The pygmy mouse (_Mus baoulei_) has recently been implicated as a reservoir species in West Africa but not in Nigeria.

There is no specific mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
