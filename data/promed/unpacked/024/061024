More than 50 cows were infected with brucellosis at the Gosamrakshana Sala of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD).

Animals infected by the pathogenic bacteria have been segregated to prevent the spread of the disease. A separate shed has been built for these animals 30 km away from the temple town of Tirupati. There are nearly 3100 cows and bulls at the goshala.

The milk used in all TTD temples is supplied from the same dairy farm. Out of the 30 Indian breeds, nearly 10-12 are seen in the same farm.

Humans dealing with infected animals are likely to be infected by brucellosis. They can also be infected if they consume non-pasteurised milk or products made from the milk of infected animals. It may cause fever, spondylitis, and muscular and joint pain in humans.

Director of the Gosamrakshana Sala K Harnatha Reddy said: "It is very difficult to detect the disease; it is possible only when the animals are pregnant. As a result, the animal will suffer a miscarriage and lose their ability to reproduce."

[To have built a barn or shed 30 km away for infected animals is a bit of expense. But as this is milk for the TTD temples, it is likely worth it.

Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_ (which affects mainly goats and sheep), and occasionally by _B. suis_ (porcine brucellosis). Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.

Clinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ bacteria from abortion material, udder secretions, or from tissues removed post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

Though both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included in India's OIE report for 2015 in the list of diseases "for which no information has been provided."

According to India's most recent available (2014) annual statistical-epidemiological report to the OIE, a total of 113 cases of bovine brucellosis in cattle and one in a buffalo, in 7 new outbreaks, were recorded during that year. The final annual report for 2015 is not yet available. The actual data on the ground are, most likely, significantly higher, as apparent from a recent presentation by Prof Narinder Singh Sharma at the regional FAO/OIE/APHCA (Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia and the Pacific) workshop on Brucellosis Diagnosis and Control in Asia-Pacific Region, held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, 18-21 Mar 2014, where he presented the following data:

- Slide 8: addresses _B. melitensis_ serological study in animals in Tamil Nadu State, revealing incidence of 13.85, 9.96 and 20.35 percent positive animals (3 serological tests applied).

- Slide 15: presents the results of a serosurvey in humans, demonstrating incidence of 11 percent among (118) veterinarians, 25.3 percent among (87) veterinary paraclinical staff and 16.1 percent among (62) dairy farmers.

People may contract this bacterium in a number of ways that may result in disease. The bacteria may be transmitted through ingestion, usually of contaminated products such as milk, or cheese, or other milk related products. It may also be contracted through inhalation or an open wound for those who work with the animals. Blood, urine and tissues of the infected animal(s) have high concentrations of the bacterium. The placenta from an infected animal is particularly highly concentrated with the causative _Brucella_ agent. Veterinarians or others who are assisting in difficult birthings of an infected animal are particularly at risk.

Symptoms of brucellosis in humans may seem like the flu and may include: an undulating fever (one that comes and goes), headaches, joint pain, lethargy and a listless feeling, chills, loss of appetite, weight loss, back pain.

Tell your physician you have been around brucellosis-infected animals. Brucellosis may be diagnosed by blood tests, a culture of the urine and/or blood marrow. Cerebral spinal fluid may be cultured, but likely one of the others will be positive.

If you test positive for this disease, it is treatable with several antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. Generally, it is a 6-week course of antibiotics. - Mod.TG
