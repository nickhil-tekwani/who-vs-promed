One of the world's largest virus research centers, located in Siberia, was reportedly engulfed in flames after a sudden explosion rocked the secretive compound, known for its stores of Ebola, HIV, anthrax, and other strains. Firefighters and rescue services scrambled on [Mon 16 Sep 2019] to respond to a fire that broke out in Koltsovo, a scientific hub several kilometers from Novosibirsk. The situation was quickly upgraded from an ordinary emergency to a major incident as the explosion and fire affected Russia's research center of virology and biotechnology, often referred to as the Vector Institute.

The laboratory is known for having developed vaccines for Ebola and hepatitis, as well as for studying epidemics and general issues surrounding immunology. During the Cold War, it was thought to be part of the now-defunct Soviet biological weapons program, meaning that some of the most dangerous strains -- including that of smallpox, Ebola, anthrax, and certain plagues -- are still being kept inside the institute's building.

With that in mind, a local branch of the Emergencies Ministry swiftly responded to the call, sending in 13 fire engines and 38 firefighters, who entered the 6-story building minutes after arrival. The fire was located and quickly extinguished on the 4th floor where some "construction works" were being carried out. Reports by local authorities were conspicuously light on detail, with various sources suggesting it was a gas blast that had triggered a fire at the construction site. One construction worker suffered burns to his legs and was taken to hospital for trauma care.

The mayor of Koltsovo, for his part, assured the public that there was no release of hazardous substances in the area. Still, the cause of the blast remains unknown, and an investigation has been launched.

An explosion has caused a fire at a Russian biological research facility that's one of only 2 centers in the world known for housing samples of the smallpox virus. The blast occurred [Mon 16 Sep 2019] during repair work of a sanitary inspection room at the Russian State Centre for Research on Virology and Biotechnology, known as Vector, near the Russian city of Novosibirsk in Siberia, the center said in a statement.

One worker was injured in the incident and is being treated in intensive care for burns, Russia's TASS news agency reported. In its statement, Vector said that no biohazard material was being stored in the room where the explosion took place. The city's mayor also insisted that the incident does not pose any biological or any other threat to the local population, according to TASS.

The fire broke out when a gas cylinder exploded on the 5th floor of the 6-story laboratory building in the city of Koltsovo. The blast caused windows to smash but there was no structural damage to the building, TASS reported.

Founded in 1974, the Center for Virology and Biotechnology was once known for developing biological weapons research during the Cold War Soviet era. It is now one of the worlds largest research centers developing vaccines and tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases. The head of the Koltsovo science city, where Vector is located, told Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti that there was no biological threat. Scientists at the center are developing vaccines for swine flu, HIV, and Ebola. In February [2019], scientists there wrapped up clinical trials of an Ebola vaccine, according to TASS.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only other center in the world approved and known to have live samples of the deadly smallpox virus. Last year [2018], the US Food and Drug Administration announced its approval of the 1st drug to treat smallpox. The contagious disease was eradicated in 1980 thanks to vaccination efforts, but there are concerns that it could be used in a bioterror attack.

Could viruses survive a blast?
Dr. Joseph Kam, Honorary Clinical Associate Professor at the Stanley Ho Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases (CEID) told CNN that rules for storing viruses are very strict and highly dangerous diseases such as Ebola and smallpox would be stored in the highest "Level 4" laboratory. Access to the samples would be limited, special containers are used and the storage mechanism is different from other laboratories, Kam said.

He added that while fire would be hot enough to destroy viruses, an explosion could risk spreading the virus and there would be a danger of infecting those in the room or contaminating the immediate area. "Viruses are fragile and more than 100 degrees or more will kill them," Kam said. He added that under certain circumstances, an explosion could spread the virus. "Part of the wave of the force of the explosion would carry it away from the site when it was 1st stored," he said. That contamination zone could be 10 to a few hundred meters depending on the size of the blast and other factors such as wind speed and direction, and whether it was an airborne virus.

The incident comes just weeks after an explosion near the site of a suspected failed missile test in northern Russia that killed at least 5 nuclear specialists and caused radiation levels to spike. Conflicting official accounts regarding the incident heightened concerns of a potential cover-up.

An explosion blew out windows and caused a fire at a huge Russian medical research center, one of only 2 in the world that stores the killer smallpox virus.
The blast at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, also known as the Vector Institute, in Koltsovo, near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, injured one worker who suffered 3rd-degree burns.

Local officials have told state-run media that the blast was probably caused by a gas explosion in a room on the building's fifth floor during repairs. State news agency TASS cited Koltsovo city head administrator Nikolai Krasnikov as saying that no biohazardous materials were stored where the explosion and blaze took place and that there is no threat to the general population.

There is not yet any indication from independent media outlets that the population is in danger. Some 13 fire trucks and 38 firefighters were sent to the scene to extinguish the fire, which covered 300 square feet.

The facility was created in 1975 and housed biological weapons research during the Soviet era. Spread across dozens of acres, it employs thousands of workers. It is considered to be one of the world's leading epidemiological research centers, developing an Ebola vaccine earlier this year [2019], according to TASS.

In 2004, Ebola researcher Antonina Presnyakova died at Vector after pricking herself with a needle that had the killer virus. The New York Times reported that there was a delay of several weeks before the incident was reported to the World Health Organization, which meant the agency's scientists "could not provide prompt advice on treatment that might have saved her life."

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited a report from PBS that a high-ranking Soviet official who defected to the United States in the 1990s had claimed smallpox was shifted to the site to conduct bio-weapons research.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta is the only other place which stores samples of smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, having killed up to 500 million people in the 20th century.

In 2016, USA Today reported that there were safety concerns at CDC with shortcomings in its decontamination chamber amid concerns in Congress about how its lab is regulated and whether serious safety problems are kept hidden from the public.

The blast in Russia comes shortly after another explosion at a facility conducting high-risk research. In August [2019], a blast at a northern Russian military base in the Arkhangelsk region that killed at least 5 scientists sparked fears of atmospheric radiation.

[It is always worrying when such institutes get caught up in such unexpected damaging events. Hopefully the damage was limited to this gas explosion and associated fire, and that truly there were no pathogen escapes. So far, so good. - Mod.MHJ
