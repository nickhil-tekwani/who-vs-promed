The drastic increase of tomato leaf mould in Switzerland during the last years is due to the emergence of a new race of the causative fungus. Race 2.9 can overcome resistance based on the Cf-9 gene, which is widely used in commercial tomato cultivars.

Leaf mould management is mainly based on use of resistant cultivars. But increasing incidence of the disease points towards failing host resistance in current tomato varieties, which is based on a single gene.

To confirm the presence of a suspected new strain, 12 fungal isolates from different parts of the country were analysed by Agroscope. All of them were genetic variants able to overcome host resistance based on Cf-9. This points towards a distribution of the new strain throughout the country.

Fungicides can be used to control leaf mould, but only a few are currently approved in Europe. A better solution to the problem would be breeding new tomato varieties with different leaf mould resistance genes, but they would also need to be assessed for their suitability to other current commercial requirements.

[Tomato leaf mould is caused by the fungus _Passalora fulva_ (previously _Cladosporium fulvum_, _Fulvia fulva_). It is a destructive foliar disease of the crop which is becoming increasingly more important in Europe where outbreaks have occurred most years over the last decade.

Symptoms may include leaf discolouration and necrotic spots, brown velvety growth on leaf undersides and premature leaf fall which leads to loss of plant vigour and reduced fruit production. In temperate regions, it is primarily a problem in glasshouse crops, because disease development is favoured by high humidity and warm temperatures. For example in the UK, 1/3rd of all glasshouse crops have been reported to be affected. Spores can survive up to 1 year at room temperature and are spread by human activities, air currents, water and with infected plant material. Disease management may include phytosanitation, cultural measures, fungicides and biocontrol organisms, but (as mentioned above) has mainly relied on use of resistant cultivars.

Disease resistance based on single host genes must be expected to break down sooner or later, since pathogens evolve constantly. The approach proposed above of breeding crop varieties including multiple resistance genes makes adaptation by pathogens more difficult, and, therefore, disease resistance in these cultivars can be expected to last longer. This strategy is being used worldwide in a range of crops.
