[1] New CDC immunization recommendation

An advisory committee of the CDC unanimously voted Wednesday [24 Oct 2018] to recommend the use of routine hepatitis A vaccination for all homeless people ages one year and older to protect them against infection. The CDC is expected to approve the committee's recommendation.

Hepatitis A is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. Stomach pain, low appetite, nausea, fatigue and jaundice are common symptoms, which usually end within 2 months of infection. People usually get sick when they touch a door handle or surface that has been contaminated. Eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water can also cause sickness. The virus can also be spread through sexual contact or from generally poor sanitary conditions or, if they are drug users, via contaminated needles and other paraphernalia.

More than 6500 hepatitis A infections in 10 states have been reported from January 2017 to October 2018, and homeless people made up more than 40% of the cases occurring in San Diego and Utah, according to the CDC. In Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, more than 10% were among homeless people. Not all states include complete information about those who are infected, the agency noted.

The more than 6000 infections reported by the CDC led to more than 3800 hospitalizations and an estimated 70 deaths. Sick once, you are protected for life against reinfection. Hepatitis A is also vaccine-preventable. The vaccine comes in the form of a shot, usually given in 2 doses.

The hepatitis A vaccine 1st became available in the USA in 1995, and currently there are 3 licensed vaccines, according to the CDC. Following that year, rates of infection declined by more than 95%. After a long downward trend, the 1st increase between 2012 and 2013 (1562 and 1781 reported cases, respectively) was due to a large multi-state outbreak. Between 2015 and 2016, the reported cases increased by 44.4% from 1390 in 2015 to 2007 cases in 2016. After adjusting for under-reporting, the estimated number of new infections in 2016 was 4000, with this increase due to 2 outbreaks linked to imported foods.

The current hepatitis A vaccine recommendation includes these at-risk groups: travelers, men who have sex with men, users of drugs, people with clotting-factor disorders, those who work with nonhuman primates, people who anticipate a close personal contact with an international adoptee from a hepatitis A-endemic country, and people with chronic liver disease. The CDC also recommended the vaccine for healthy people between the ages of 12 months and 40 years after exposure to the disease. With the new recommendation, homeless people will be included on this list.

Dr. Mona Doshani, a scientist in the division of viral hepatitis within the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the CDC, noted in her presentation to the advisory committee that analysis of data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for a single year ending in 1996 showed more than 400 cases of side effects and 93 serious adverse events among 6 million doses of the hepatitis A vaccine.

On a single night, more than 553 000 people are homelessness in the USA, according to government reports. In a given year, about 3 million people -- 1% of the population -- are homeless. Just under two-thirds stay in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs, while one-third live outside. These homelessness numbers are on the rise, according to the CDC.

Homelessness is associated with a 2 to 3 times higher odds of infection with hepatitis A and, if infected, a 2 to 4 times higher odds of severe outcomes, such as hospitalization or death, according to a not-yet-published study performed in San Diego County. The vaccine would be dispensed at clinics where homeless people receive healthcare and, in some states, would be covered by Medicaid, according to the CDC.

https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Madison-County-declares-hepatitis-A-outbreak-as-cases-increase-498418931.html


The Madison County Health Department has declared a hepatitis A outbreak, as the number of cases has increased. Health leaders are now recommending everyone in the county to get a hepatitis A vaccination because of the regional and state increase in reported cases. Madison County is now reporting 24 cases, and there are a reported 2050 cases across the commonwealth [at last report, 2159 - Mod.LL].

"We have always known that Madison County would eventually declare outbreak status due to the nature of the statewide situation, which is why we have been so proactive in our efforts to vaccinate the at-risk populations in the county," Madison County Public Health Director Nancy Crewe said. "These efforts should have a mitigating effect on the severity of the outbreak."

The Ohio Department of Health declared a statewide outbreak of hepatitis A in June 2018, and the cases are continuing to rise. As of 22 Oct 2018, Ohio has reported 717 cases affecting 54 counties, including Noble, Guernsey, Monroe and Washington counties. In 2017, Ohio recorded only 45 cases for the year.

Outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring in several states across the USA, including neighboring states of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia.

https://www.newschannel5.com/news/hepatitis-a-outbreak-grows-to-134-cases-in-nashville


The hepatitis A outbreak in Nashville has grown to 134 confirmed cases since December 2017. Officials with the Metro Public Health Department have continued to work with the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH), as well as other Metro departments and community organizations, in response to the outbreak. Work has continued to reach 3 at-risk groups.

Those at greatest risk of exposure to hepatitis A in the current outbreak include people who use drugs (not just injection drug use), men who have sexual contact with men, and individuals experiencing homelessness. More than 6800 people in Nashville have been vaccinated since the outbreak was announced in late May [2018].

[5] Florida (Hillsborough County) - food handler case
Date: Fri 26 Oct 2018

https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/Hamburger-Mary-s-worker-tests-positive-for-hepatitis-A_172992956


The Ybor City location of Hamburger Mary's is closed Friday [26 Oct 2018] after the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County said a worker tested positive for hepatitis A. According to the agency, the worker worked at the restaurant chain's Centro Ybor location between 4 Oct 2018 and 20 Oct 2018. Lab tests confirmed the presence of the disease, and a sign on the door dated 24 Oct 2018 stated the restaurant will be closed until the Department of Business and Professional Regulation's Division of Hotels and Restaurants can inspect and approve the drag-themed eatery.

The health department is encouraging anyone who was a customer at Hamburger Mary's between 4 and 20 Oct 2018 who has not already received a hepatitis A vaccine to do so immediately. If you have already had it, the health department said, nothing further needs to be done.

The Department of Health-Hillsborough said it has also advised doctors and hospitals to stay alert for possible cases. Reports of hepatitis A have risen sharply in Hillsborough County in 2018, with 37 reported cases so far. In 2017, there were only 10 cases, and 5 were reported in 2015 and 2016. In Pinellas, there have been 58 cases in 2018. In 2016, there were only 2 cases, and in 2015 there were 4.

Agency spokesman Kevin Watler said, among other states, California, Michigan and Kentucky have also seen increases in hepatitis A cases. In Florida, he said, the Tampa Bay area and Central Florida have seen the largest increases. "It's not contained through one area and we're not the only state seeing it," Watler said. "There's no real explanation at this stage to identify what's going on."

The best course for now, health department officials across the Tampa Bay say, is to get vaccinated.

[As more cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection occur in more states, it remains important to develop a different paradigm of prevention. In the USA, HAV infection is no longer a disease of travelers to the developing world, eaters of contaminated foods or in males who have sex with males. These outbreaks reflect what occurs in the developing world transmission related to poor sanitation.

Because many of these disenfranchised cohorts have little access to health care and little funds to pay for the care and vaccines, it is difficult to make headway, although the San Diego county response to their outbreak did demonstrate ways to control it. It is also likely that these cohorts spend time working as food workers, and as the Florida post documents and many more media reports in various states underscore, there is substantial risk of overflow into the unsuspecting restaurant-going public. Just as the CDC is now recommending immunization for the homeless population, it is high time to consider the same for food preparers. - Mod.LL
