Two men died after having a kidney transplant from the same donor whose organs were allegedly infected with a parasitic worm, solicitors say. An inquest will be held into the deaths of [the men], [one] from Cardiff and [the other] of Bridgend [both in Wales], next week.

Lawyers for their families say they hope to find answers on why their deaths happened. The donor of the kidneys also died from the same infection, according to solicitors Irwin Mitchell. The inquest is scheduled to be heard at Cardiff Coroner's Court on Tuesday [18 Nov 2014].

It will be almost a year since the deaths of [the men, one of whom was 67 years old and the other, 42 years old]. Both transplants took place at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

According to Irwin Mitchell, both died of an infection caused by a parasitic worm known as halicephalobus, which lives in soil and is often found in horses. The lawyers say there have only been a handful of cases in the world of people diagnosed with the infection, and all have died.

Julie Lewis, of Irwin Mitchell, said both families were going through an "incredibly difficult time" and were "desperately seeking answers". Ruth Walker, director of nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: "This is a unique and tragic case and everyone at the health board extends their sincere and heartfelt sympathies to the families involved. "The health board requested its own independent, external review to establish why these patients died. That report has been provided to the coroner's office and we continue to support his investigation into these tragic deaths. It would be inappropriate to comment further ahead of the inquest." A Public Health Wales spokesman said: "Given that the inquest into the deaths has not begun yet, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."

[The posting on the BBC website provides no details on how the highly unusual diagnosis was made. Infestation with the nematode _Halicephalobus gingivalis_ is known in horses, but the genus includes eight species and the report above does not state which species is thought to be responsible.

Looking at the pictures posted on the BBC website, the nematode looks like _Strongyloides stercoralis_, a nematode which easily infects humans and can remain asymptomatic in the human host for decades. _Strongyloides stercoralis_ can cause a fulminant, fatal infection in immunocompromised persons. If the diagnosis of halicephalobus infestation has not been confirmed by molecular methods, infection with _Strongyloides stercoralis_ from the donor should be considered. - Mod.EP

ProMED-mail would appreciate further details from knowledgeable sources as they emerge following the coroner's inquest. - Mod.SH
