Today [16 Jul 2011] 2 events were reported. There have now been 22
recorded Hendra outbreaks since September 1994, with 8 (36 per cent)
of those happening since 26 Jun 2011. All but 3 events have been in
Queensland. The balance have been reported in New South Wales (NSW).

The 1st report today (16 Jul 2011) relates to a horse euthanised on
14 Jul 2011 from Hervey Bay, Queensland. The 2nd has occurred at
Boondall, Queensland, where one horse was euthanised on 15 Jul 2011.
(Boondall is the correct name. The name is very similar to Bundall, a
racing course and the site of a fruit bat camp dispersal during June
2011. They are geographically close but different places.)

This information, written for horse owners waiting on a test result,

caring for a suspect horse and may provide further background
information to readers.

[ProMED is grateful to Storm Stanford for continuing to keep us up to
date on the continuing cases of equine Hendra virus infections, and
providing links to additional information. One hopes that as horse
owners follow the preventive measures indicated in the Queensland
government's recommendations cited above, there will be no additional
cases.
