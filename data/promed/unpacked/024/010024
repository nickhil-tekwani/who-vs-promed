Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary says it has been getting an unusually
large number of calls about sick or dead songbirds found under bird
feeders, particularly pine siskins, goldfinches and house finch
species.
The sanctuary staff believes salmonella is the cause, and it is
asking residents to do their part in helping to stop it from
spreading.
Mike Reed, the sanctuary's curator, says they've been getting calls
from throughout the greater Green Bay area, as well as Pulaski,
Bonduel, Shawano and Manawa. While it is impossible to estimate how
many birds have died, the sanctuary staff believes it's significant.
"We are concerned because of the large numbers already reported dead,
and although it is rare, salmonella can potentially be spread to
humans and animals," Reed said.
"To be safe, always wear disposable gloves and wash hands thoroughly
when handling feeders or birdbaths, and remember to keep pets away
from sick or dead birds."
Sick birds are usually puffed up and lethargic, and they typically
sit under feeders and let people approach them.
Reed said it is common to see salmonella in songbirds this time of
year, because there is a higher concentration of birds and feeders
and baths. The birds are not as strong following the winter months,
so they may not be able to fight off the disease.
If you see numerous sick or dead birds near your feeders or baths,
contact Reed or Lori Bankson at Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary at
(920-391-3671).
