Four people who died under mysterious circumstances in Nantou County
in July 2011 were most likely killed by a toxic chemical, not botulism
as had been previously supposed, the Nantou County Prosecutors' Office
said on Thursday [1 Sep 2011]. The conclusion was reached at a meeting
of toxicology experts on Wednesday, the office said in a statement.

Judging from the autopsy results and an analysis of an examination
report submitted by the Council of Agriculture's Agricultural
Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute, toxicology experts
believe the 4 were poisoned by 2 chemicals, 2-chloroethanol and
chloroacetric acid, the statement said.

Even though blood samples from one victim did contain botulism, it
only confirmed the presence of the bacteria, not the cause of death,
the experts said.

Clinical research has shown that poisoning by the 2 chemicals would
take effect sooner than botulism poisoning, and the experts said they
believe the victims would have died before botulism occurred. In
addition, they said, botulism poisoning is treatable.

On 5 Jul 2011, a man and his wife, both farmers in Hsinyi Township,
had dinner with another. They became sick later that night and went to
the hospital. All 4 were dead by the next day.

Investigators cited botulism, caused by an extremely toxic bacteria
often found in canned and preserved foods, as the possible cause of
death, until a man came forward on 22 Aug 2011 to say he had sent
poisoned wine to the wife.

An ex-boyfriend of the wife reportedly told police that he had sent
her 6 bottles of rice wine in June 2011 that had been laced with 10cc
of 2-chloroethanol because he was jealous that she had married the
husband earlier in the year.

Prosecutors said on Thursday [1 Sep 2011] the amount of the toxic
chemical that would have been needed to kill them would have been much
more than the 10ccs the boyfriend claimed he had put in; he could face
murder charges now that experts have concluded the 4 victims had died
from poisoning, law enforcement sources said.
