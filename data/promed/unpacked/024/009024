[Sorry it wasnÂ´t clear. The hantavirus involved is Hantaan virus...
- Mod.JW
I think we have the same confusion here as earlier in the fall
with HFRS in Bashkortostan, northeast of Samara, i.e. it is
not a question of Hantaan but of Puumala virus.
The previous HFRS epidemic in Samara a couple of years ago
was due to an outbreak of Puumala hantavirus spread by the bank
vole _Clethrionomys glareolus_, and I strongly suspect that this the
case now also .
Once again, there is no evidence (so far, at least) of real Hantaan
virus in Europe. Instead, there is a strain of Dobrava virus in [the
mouse _Apodemus agrarius_ (the carrier of Hantaan virus in the
Far East) in Eastern Europe and Russia. Another strain of
Dobrava is found in _A. flavicollis_ in the Balkans.

[The information that the virus was Hantaan came from Russian
scientists via ProMED-mail's Regional Moderator -- see ref.(02)
above. Perhaps we will hear from them of some published work
demonstrating the presence of Hantaan virus in Europe -- or
perhaps it is a mistaken identification? - Mod.JW
