Two cases of polio have been reported in the westernmost Zakarpattia region.

Health Minister Alexander Kvitashvili told reporters at a briefing on [Tue 1 Sep 2015], a Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"Lately, 2 cases of polio have been confirmed in the Zakarpattia region. Our goal is to notify the World Health Organization and our partners in Europe and take all possible measures in order to prevent spreading of the epidemic throughout Ukraine," Kvitashvili said. He noted that these cases have been localized.

The minister said that the polio vaccine is available in the country in sufficient supply.

[Presumably, since this announcement is attributed to the Minister of Health, this report refers to confirmed cases of poliovirus-associated disease. The report does not specify the actual virus(es) isolated as to whether they are wild poliovirus (WPV) or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a distinction that is relevant. More information on these cases would be greatly appreciated. Information on the genetic profile of the poliovirus(es) isolated would be helpful in determining the origin of the virus(es) involved as well as the results of epidemiologic investigations.

According to the WHO archive on reported cases of polio, the last reported case of polio in the Ukraine was in 1996 (there was 1 case in 1996, 1 case in 1995, 14 cases in 1994, 5 cases in 1993, 12 cases in 1992, and 3 cases in 1991 -- the 1st year when individual reports were received from the Ukraine -- see http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencepolio.html)

If confirmed as due to WPV, these cases would represent the 1st cases of WPV in a non-endemic country reported in 2015. The most recent case of WPV associated disease reported from a non-endemic country was in Somalia and had a date of onset of 11 Aug 2014 (see table in Poliomyelitis update (03): Nigeria, Pakistan, global update, chronic shedder 20150901.3614553). The European region of WHO was certified as polio free in 2002 with the last endemic case reported from Turkey in November 1998. Importations of the virus with local transmission occurred in the European region in 2005 in Tajikistan and in 2013-2014 in Israel (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/polio/Pages/index.aspx).

Of note, in a media report in Newsweek on 1 May 2015 (http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/01/millions-ukraine-children-risk-new-epidemics-323992.html) there was an alarmist description of the situation with vaccinations in the Ukraine. "Ukraine is in imminent danger of experiencing the 1st polio epidemic Europe has seen for decades, health experts have revealed, warning that millions of children are at risk from a range of crippling or fatal infectious diseases, including measles, diphtheria, and rubella. The rate of protection against contagious disease in the country has dropped rapidly since 2008, when a 16-year-old boy died days after he was given a shot against measles and rubella, leading to a media storm. Although the United Nations concluded that the death was unrelated to the vaccine, demand for vaccines fell dramatically to what the UN describes today as "zero coverage." With an average of 500 000 children born each year in Ukraine, the number of infants vulnerable to infection is approaching 3 million."

In a 2013 UNICEF media report (published in Lancet, http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/media_24342.html), UNICEF had the following information: "WHO and UNICEF have also recently said that an outbreak of polio is a real danger. The disease is rarely seen in Europe today but Ukraine is particularly vulnerable to an outbreak, experts say, with only 74 percent of the population immunised against it. This compares to average coverage in Europe and the USA of more than 90 percent. The chances of an outbreak are so great that Ukraine last month [May 2013] hosted a WHO-led polio simulation exercise. Concerns are rooted in low coverage for vaccinations, brought about because of not only supply problems but also the fact that a large minority of parents refuse to have their children vaccinated. "Public trust in vaccinations has been eroded in recent years and this has to be changed. People's confidence in vaccinations has to be won back," Dorit Nitzan, head of WHO's Ukrainian branch, tells The Lancet. A survey by UNICEF last year [2012] showed that as many as 1/3 of Ukrainian parents are against vaccinations. Only around 50 percent of children in the Ukraine are fully immunised against polio, measles, rubella, and other diseases."

A map showing the location of the Zakarpattia oblast can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakarpattia_Oblast. Zakarpattia is located in the southwest of the Ukraine. It is located the Carpathian Mountains, and borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. It has been a major tourist destination with ski and spa resorts in the mountains. - Mod.MPP
