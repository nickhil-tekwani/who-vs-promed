The presence of a further 'significant' wheat yellow rust race in the UK has been confirmed by the UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS). Using a new system, the race has been named Red 24. It joins a 2nd new race, called Blue 7, announced by the UKCPVS in March [2017].

Both races were present in the UK pathogen population in 2016 and tests suggest both races contributed to the major revision of AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] Recommended List (RL) disease ratings. Yellow rust has been much more stable in 2017 and no significant shifts in associated disease ratings are anticipated in the RL 2018/19 (due for publication on 4 Dec 2017).

Dr Sarah Holdgate, UKCPVS, said: "Our tests reveal many varieties are affected by Red 24 and Blue 7, so these races are significant. As we also know some varieties are more susceptible to one race over the other, it could explain some of the regional disease variation seen in commercial crops recently. The diversity in the pathogen population is captured more effectively by the new naming system and it allows us to separate out the individual races more easily. We'll name each race as we find it and continue to raise awareness of those which are agronomically important."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrid) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

In the UK, emerging new strains have been reported repeatedly over recent years (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20160711.4337095, 20160219.4033809, 20140122.2224928) and populations of stripe rust are changing, as is being observed in the whole of Europe. It is not clear what the new naming system for stripe rust pathotypes mentioned above entails. It is also not clear whether it is thought that the new races reported here evolved in the UK, or that they may have been incursions imported from somewhere else but only characterised in the UK.
