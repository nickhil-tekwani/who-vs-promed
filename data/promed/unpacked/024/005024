22 suspected dengue cases
-----------------------------
Reported dengue cases are on the rise in Penang. There are now 22
suspected dengue cases in the various hospitals here, Health Ministry
parliamentary secretary Datuk Lee Kah Choon said yesterday [10 Mar
2006]. "But these cases can only be confirmed after tests have been
conducted," he said. Lee said there were 88 reported dengue cases
between 20 Feb and 5 Mar 2006.
For the week of 20 to 25 Feb 2006, there were 30 reported cases in
the state. "But in the following week, from 26 Feb to 5 Mar 2006,
there was a 93 percent increase to 58 cases," he said. "But there is
no cause for alarm, as these numbers are quite normal," he said. "As
a precaution, I have directed the state health department to keep me
updated and identify the hotspots," he added. He reminded people to
take the usual precautions to rid their homes of mosquito breeding
grounds.
A check by The Star showed that there were more than 3000 reported
dengue cases last year [2005]. Out of these, only 875 were confirmed
cases. 7 people died from the disease last year [2005].
Council urban services, public health and licensing director Dr. Goh
Kok Yeong said fogging was an on-going exercise. "Fogging is
conducted in areas where a dengue outbreak has occurred before. "The
risk of the _Aedes_ mosquito breeding in an open environment is
reduced because of the hot and dry weather now," he said. "But the
risk is still there. House owners should ensure that their compounds
are kept clean," he added.
In Alor Star, Taman Wira and Taman Datuk Kumbar have been identified
as dengue hotspots. Health Committee chairman Datuk V. Saravanan said
fogging is being conducted at the 2 areas daily. He said dengue
hemorrhagic cases had been on the rise in both these areas since last
month [February 2006] but declined to give details. "The situation is
under control and preventive measures taken," he said. He said 2000
used tires were collected from Taman Wira, and _Aedes_ larvae were
found in the water that had collected inside some of the tires.

Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are acute febrile diseases
found in the tropics, with a geographical spread similar to malaria.
Caused by one of 4 closely related virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2,
DENV-3, & DENV-4) of the virus species _Dengue virus_ , which is
classified in the genus _Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_. Each
serotype is sufficiently different that there is no cross-protection,
and epidemics caused by multiple serotypes (hyperendemicity) can
occur. Dengue is transmitted to humans by the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_ (rarely _Aedes albopictus_).
