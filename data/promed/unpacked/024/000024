[The amount of hysteria and hype that has been in a crescendo phase
following the anthrax isolates in Florida and most recently in NYC is
very disconcerting. The news wires have been listing the various scares
(other NYC locations, Reno, Los Angeles to name a few), in some places
people who have opened envelopes with powder are being hospitalized
(4 Denver postal employees, a Sony picture employee in Culver City)
for testing. There was a news wire report in the past hours about a US
Airways jet en route to Denver from North Carolina was diverted to
Indianapolis for an unscheduled landing when a flight attendant found
"suspicious white powder" in the bottom of a trash bag in the plane's
galley. There was a news wire report of 5 people being taken to a
hospital in Genoa, Italy for testing after handling a suspicious letter
with white powder and threats of BT.(Preliminary testing has been
negative for anthrax.) Dick Cheney is saying that while there isn't
evidence, terrorism must still be considered. NYC ERs are being
overwhelmed by people wanting to be tested and wanting to have
prescriptions for Cipro (in an Op-Ed piece by Frank Rich in the NY Times
today he mentioned that Cipro has surpassed Viagra sales on the internet
-- that's how serious the hysteria has gotten).
The situation is well summed up by a headline in today's Telegraph
(London):
New anthrax case sparks panic in US

While not dismissing the present threat there is a need for calm. Attached
is a very responsible editorial from today's NY Times for our members to
read, along with a request for a discussion of how we might help to simmer
down the ongoing hysteria here in the US, as well as among our friends in
other countries who are being caught up in the same scare fever. Clearly
things are getting out of hand. In addition, we at
ProMED-mail are very concerned about the potential negative impact on
public health as a result of widespread distribution of ciprofloxacin
(Cipro) into the hands of the general public. - Mod.MHJ

Anthrax in New York
-------------------
"The discovery of an anthrax case in New York City - coming on top of 3
anthrax exposures in Florida - has heightened concern in a nation that was
already jittery and waiting for the next terrorist act to occur. Top
officials at NBC announced yesterday that an employee had developed a
full-fledged case of anthrax several days after the network received
"suspicious mail." She is being treated with antibiotics and is said to be
doing well. Nevertheless, her case has multiplied the fears generated by an
episode at a Florida newspaper publisher where one editor died of anthrax
apparently inhaled at his workplace and 2 others who worked in the mail
room were exposed to the anthrax germ but have not become sick.
The pattern of these incidents seems to suggest an attempt to infect
journalists, though that has yet to be established. Amid what can only be
described as rising hysteria in the country, it is important to remember
that so far only 2 people have been diagnosed as ill with anthrax, and one
of them is expected to recover.
It is difficult to retain one's composure at a time when false leads, wild
Internet gossip and outright hoaxes - as well as genuine intelligence
warnings from the government - make it seem as if the nation is under
incessant attack. The Times learned firsthand yesterday what it feels like
to face these uncertainties, when a bioterrorism reporter received a letter
containing a white powdery substance. The police were called, the area was
cleared, the air was tested for chemicals and found clean, and the
substance itself, which smelled like talcum powder, was sent off for
testing. Though work resumed, no one will rest easy until the results are
in. Times workers discovered the short psychic distance between reasonable
caution and irrational fear, the difficulty in always distinguishing
between the remote possibility and the clear and present danger.
A logical assessment of the odds of harm helps. Should a person
inadvertently open a letter containing anthrax spores, he or she can
prevent the onset of disease by promptly seeking medical treatment.
Employers and individuals will need to be especially alert to packages and
letters that might conceivably have lethal substances in them. But it makes
little sense for people throughout the city to race to emergency rooms, as
many are, when the incidents are so few and so limited in the number of
exposures. Nor is there any need to stockpile antibiotics that are readily
available should the need arise, and which the government is poised to
distribute in mass quantities if a real anthrax outbreak should occur. Nor
does it make sense to buy a gas mask that would be useful only if someone
had advance notice that the spores would be in the air. Anthrax is not
contagious and does not spread from one person to another.
For now, the remarkable thing is how small these incidents were, and how
quickly contained. In that sense they are a cause for reassurance, not
panic."

Anyone needing advice as to what to look out for in suspicious mail
should check the following FBI site:
FBI Advice
<http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/conditions/10/12/nyc.anthrax/fbi.jpg>

Secondly, the basic advice if you should suspect a letter or parcel is
to put it down; call building security or the police; and go wash your
hands and face; then relax and get on with your life ... its probably a
hoax. Leave it to the experts.
[3
Hysteria and panic only aids the people who have sent out these
contaminated letters or are mailing hoaxes. So make it difficult for
them by staying calm.
[4
On top of everything else, this is the first biological threat that this
country has had in modern times. All the prior practice and games
playing beforehand are now being tested. Many of the actions taken have
been very successful. Yes, mistakes are being made but the risks posed
by the current series of events are really very small and readily
treatable. This is our time for really learning how to handle them.
Remember, one learns by mistakes. And if there is a next time, there
will be far, far fewer errors and thus, hopefully, even less of an
impact. - Mods.MPP/MHJ/PC/TG
