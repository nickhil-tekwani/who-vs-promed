More Anthrax Found in Florida Tabloid Bldg.
----------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been found throughout the headquarters of a tabloid publisher,
leading health officials to suspect it received more than one tainted
letter. Investigators said Thursday it was unlikely just one letter spread
anthrax spores to all 3 floors of the 68 000-square-foot American Media
building in Boca Raton.
"You still cannot rule out the theory that (the letter) was shared among
people in the building," said Tim O'Connor of the Palm Beach County Health
Department. But "there was evidence on 3 different floors. That would
indicate there's more than one letter."
Authorities believe the tainted mail at American Media was thrown away
before then. O'Connor said the spores could have been spread while
investigators searched for evidence. Anthrax spores have also been detected
at 6 county postal facilities, including those that received misdirected
mail sent to an old address of one of American Media's newspapers. The
Environmental Protection Agency scoured the American Media building for 3
weeks, collecting samples from desks, floors and air ducts. Partial results
of the testing showed spores in 32 places.
AMI has hired a microbiologist to devise a plan to clean up its
headquarters. It will ask employees whether they want to return.

CDC advises veterinarians to watch for anthrax
----------------------------
Government health officials said Wednesday they are urging veterinarians to
watch for anthrax symptoms in animals as an indication of a new wave of
bioterrorist attacks on humans. The idea is that a new attack of anthrax
might be spread in some other way besides the mail. If such an attack was
detected in a large number of animals first, health officials could rush
antibiotics to humans who might have been exposed.

CDC anthrax update (MMWR)
-----------------------------------------
Update: Investigation of Bioterrorism-Related Anthrax, 2001
This report updates the investigation of bioterrorism-related anthrax and
the provision of antimicrobial prophylaxis to exposed persons and
highlights CDC assistance to other countries investigating cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax. Since 7 Nov 2001, CDC and state and local
public health agencies have identified no new cases of bioterrorism-related
anthrax.
As of November 14, 22 cases of anthrax have met the CDC case definition
(1); 10 were confirmed inhalational anthrax, and 12 (7 confirmed and 5
suspected) were cutaneous anthrax. Investigation of a case of inhalational
anthrax in a hospital stock room worker aged 61 years in New York City
(NYC) found no evidence of anthrax contamination at the work site or home;
the source of exposure is unknown. Environmental clean-up of contaminated
facilities continues, and surveillance for new cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax is ongoing in Delaware (DE), District of
Columbia (DC), Florida (FL), Maryland (MD), New Jersey (NJ), NYC,
Pennsylvania (PA), Virginia (VA), and other states.
Use of Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
A 60-day course of antibiotics to prevent inhalational anthrax has been
recommended for persons potentially exposed to _Bacillus anthracis_
aerosols in FL, NJ, NYC, VA, and DC. These recommendations are for persons
at risk for inhalational anthrax by 1) the presence of an inhalational case
at a facility (e.g., media company in FL), 2) environmental specimens
positive for _B. anthracis_ in facilities along the path of a contaminated
letter in which aerosolization might have occurred (e.g., postal facilities
in NYC), and 3) exposure to an air space known to be contaminated with
aerosolized _B. anthracis_ from an opened letter (e.g., Senate office
building in DC). These persons should receive a full 60-day course of
antimicrobial prophylaxis. Specific recommendations by site include:
Boca Raton, FL---prophylaxis is recommended for employees and visitors who
spent more than 1 hour during August 1--October 6 in the American Media,
Inc., building.
New York City, NY---prophylaxis is recommended for all employees who worked
during October 9--26 on the second and third floors of the south section of
the Morgan Central Postal Facility in Manhattan.
Hamilton Township, NJ---prophylaxis is recommended for all employees and
business visitors (i.e., temporary postal workers, vendors, contractors,
and anyone in nonpublic work sites) who were in the U.S. Postal Service
Route 130 Processing and Distribution Center during September 18--October 18.
Washington, DC (Capitol Hill)---prophylaxis is recommended for persons who
were on the fifth and sixth floors of the southeast wing of the Senate Hart
Building on October 15, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Washington, DC---prophylaxis is recommended for all employees and business
visitors to the nonpublic mail room of the U.S. Postal Service Processing
and Distribution Center at 900 Brentwood Road during October 12--21.
Sterling, VA---prophylaxis is recommended for all mail room employees and
business visitors who were at the Department of State Annex 32 mail room
facility during October 12--22.
In addition, a 60-day course of antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended
for other workers with specified risks for inhalational anthrax. In some
areas, local health authorities facilitated access to a 60-day course of
antimicrobial prophylaxis for persons who handled mail in facilities from
which _B. anthracis_ was isolated but did not have exposures for which
antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended (2). These persons may choose or
may be directed by local health authorities to discontinue antimicrobial
prophylaxis before completing a 60-day course.
CDC Assistance to Other Countries
CDC has assisted authorities in other countries investigating cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax. During October 12--November 13, CDC received
111 requests from 66 countries. Of these, 47 (42 percent) requests were
laboratory related; 43 (39 percent) were general requests for bioterrorism
information; 13 (12 percent) were for environmental or occupational health
guidelines; and 8 (7 percent) were about developing bioterrorism
preparedness plans. The largest proportion of requests were from Central
and South America (26 percent). Of the 66 countries, 15 (23 percent)
received laboratory assistance, including testing or arrangements for
testing of suspected isolates at a CDC supported laboratory or a reference
laboratory in another country. In all, 42 (64 percent) countries received
telephone or email consultation regarding specific tests for suspected _B.
anthracis_ isolates.
CDC has confirmed 2 isolates from outside the United States as _B.
anthracis_. These isolates were recovered from the outer surface of letters
or packages sent in State Department pouches to the U.S. Embassy in Peru.
These items were processed at the U.S. State Department mail sorting
facility where a case of inhalational anthrax had occurred (1). No cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax have been confirmed in U.S. Embassy employees
or in persons from other countries. Requests for information regarding
bioterrorism-related issues outside the United States should be directed to
the International Team of CDC's Emergency Operations Center (telephone,
[770 488-7100, e-mail: eocinternational@cdc.gov).
[Byline: J Malecki, et al.
Editorial Note:
Since the previous report, all patients with bioterrorism-related anthrax
who were hospitalized have been discharged and continue to recover; no new
cases have been reported. The source of these bioterrorist attacks has not
been identified, and additional cases might occur. Public health
authorities, health-care providers, and laboratorians should remain
vigilant for cases of anthrax.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated to prevent inhalational anthrax
after a confirmed or suspected aerosol exposure. Persons recommended to
receive prophylaxis should complete the 60-day regimen. Public health
programs should work with health-care providers and patients to promote
completion of antimicrobial prophylaxis and to monitor the occurrence of
adverse events (1).
CDC continues to respond to inquiries about anthrax and bioterrorism. The
CDC Public Response Hotline was established to provide the public with
information about anthrax and other biologic and chemical agents. During
November 1--12, CDC received approximately 4400 calls through the hotline
and to the Emergency Operations Center. The hotline is available in English
(888-246-2675) and Spanish (888-246-2857). CDC also receives requests for
information by e-mail through the Health Alert Network(<healthalert@cdc.gov>),
MMWR <http://www.cdc/gov/mmwr/contact.html>), and other public health
communications systems.

related to anthrax and bioterrorism is available at
