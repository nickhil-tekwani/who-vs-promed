One reason why the BSE Inquiry threw out the theory of scrapie as the
source of BSE may have been the findings at the USDA of RC Cutlip et al
(1994; see abstract below). One wonders why the VLA [Veterinary
Laboratories Agency findings reported [see BSE update (18) May 2001
20010501.0846 appear to differ from these earlier findings. Also, if
scrapie is the cause of BSE, and BSE is the cause of vCJD, why shouldn't
scrapie cause vCJD?

Abstract:
"To determine if sheep scrapie agent(s) in the United States would induce a
disease in cattle resembling bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 18 newborn
calves were inoculated intracerebrally with a pooled suspension of brain
from 9 sheep with scrapie. Half of the calves were killed 1 year after
inoculation. All calves kept longer than 1 year became severely lethargic
and demonstrated clinical signs of motor neuron dysfunction that were
manifest as progressive stiffness, posterior paresis, general weakness, and
permanent recumbency. The incubation period was 14-18 months, and the
clinical course was 1-5 months. The brain from each calf was examined for
lesions and for protease-resistant prion protein. Lesions were subtle, but
a disease-specific isoform of the prion protein was present in the brain of
all calves. Neither signs nor lesions were characteristic of those for
bovine spongiform encephalopathy."

BSE trigger suspected to be African antelope
--------------------------------------------
A team of New Zealand scientists which has spent 5 years and more than $1.5
million testing theories about the origin of the "mad cow" disease [BSE in
Britain believes BSE was imported in an African antelope. The Massey
University scientists, led by epidemiologist Professor Roger Morris, are
preparing to start publishing scientific work underpinning the theory,
which supplants a widely-held belief that the disease originated from sheep
infected with a similar disease, scrapie, which were ground up for animal feed.
Prof Morris said he had investigated 35 different theories in detail, in a
bid to account for the cause of the epidemic. Later this year, a series of
scientific papers will examine the likelihood that a form of BSE occurs in
wild antelope, and that it spread into British cattle when an infected
animal from a wildlife park was rendered into meat and bone meal. The
disease probably spread through British cattle for about a decade before it
was fully recognized as a threat, but by then Britain had exported huge
quantities of meat and bone meal to other countries around the world, some
of which are now finding their own BSE cases. Experts say that while
pinpointing the origins of "mad cow" will not help the British control the
human form of the illness, it is important for heading off future outbreaks
elsewhere.
An independent committee commissioned by the British government--to which
Prof Morris gave evidence by a video link from New Zealand in 1999 -- last
year published a report that also downgraded the idea BSE originated from
scrapie. But that group offered a different conclusion: that it most likely
all started with a genetic mutation in one cow. BSE was recognized in
cattle in Britain in November 1986 by the British government's central
veterinary laboratory.
However, Prof Morris said it was likely that the antelope's brain and other
organs ended up in a batch of cattle feed given to about 1000 dairy cows in
the southwest of England between 1975 and 1977. Some of the infected
animals were moved to other areas of the country before being slaughtered
and recycled as cattle feed in 1981, spreading the disease. BSE is thought
to have an incubation period of about 5 years.
"My argument is that these prion diseases occur in predator-prey
combinations; you get scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer,
and BSE in antelopes," he told NZPA. "I think the evidence favours the
whole epidemic starting with a single animal that brought the disease into
the UK; it was most likely a single infected antelope among animals brought
in for a wildlife park. My theory on the African antelopes says that
there's a low rate of transmission from the antelope to their calves, and
the lions that eat the infected antelope develop the disease as well. So
what you've got is a low-level population regulator in both the antelope
populations and the lion population -- so it survives in the wildlife."
"That's my number-one hypothesis," he said.
Prof Morris said further work could be done on searching for BSE in
antelope in the wild, of proving that antelope brought directly from Africa
had gone to a safari park, died, and been rendered into meat and bone meal
used in the area where his tracing had shown the first cases occurred. "The
area of Britain where it started is the area where safari parks started in
the 1970s," he said. "I've actually got evidence that every step in the
sequence could have occurred. And I know that various African antelopes are
susceptible to the disease. The missing piece of information -- which is a
major challenge to get -- is to actually find the disease in the field in
Africa. But we don't know which (antelope) species it was, and in the wild
those that develop the disease get eaten by lions," he said. "We also know
that the lions get the disease."
It was impossible to prove that a specific antelope was infected when it
was rendered down into meat and bone meal, but he believed there was an
outside chance of being able to find the disease in antelope in the wild,
even though it was a low-incidence disease. "I've talked to people in
Africa about checking it out, and we're are going to make a try, even
though it is remarkably difficult".

[I must point out that the true originator of this hypothesis is Hotz de
Baar, a modest gentleman farmer in southern England, on BSE-L. As Potter
said many years ago, the strength of any hypothesis is its ability to be
tested; this may prove impossible for this hypothesis. However, Texas has
over many years been importing thousands of African game animals to stock
its many exotic game ranches and safari parks. These animals are little
worried by lions, cheetahs, hyenas, and such. So I have copied this posting
to Gary Svetlik, who is responsible, among his other USDA/APHIS duties in
Texas, for monitoring TSEs, for possible addition to his list of suspect
events including, of course, possible vCJD cases among the hunting alumni
of Texas A & M University. If this dubitable hypothesis acquires hard
evidence it will be out of Africa and possibly in places like College
Station, Texas. - Mod MHJ
