Nouvelle-Caledonie in the Pacific Ocean] have stepped up a campaign against
dengue fever after 9 new cases raised to 20 the total of confirmed cases.
The outbreak, in the capital Noumea and surrounding areas, has prompted
insecticide spraying at dawn and dusk. Teams of inspectors are visiting and
encouraging residents to clean up water-logged and bushy areas that

625 Cases of Dengue Fever and 2 Deaths Recorded in Johor in 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Johor Government has declared an all-out-war against the menace of
dengue fever, which had already caused 2 deaths in the first 18 days of the
year. There were 20 reported deaths caused by dengue fever in Johor
throughout last year [2002].
State Local Government Committee chairman Datuk Jimmy Low Boon Hong said
other than the 2 deaths, Johor also recorded 628 dengue cases up to 18 Jan
2002. "The figures are putting us in a state of alarm. This calls for an
all-out-war," he told reporters after inspecting Taman Universiti in Skudai
here today. Johor recorded a total 2249 dengue cases last year, which was an
increase from the 1600 cases in 2001.
Low said all relevant agencies will be involved in the war against dengue,
which covers all 9 districts in the State. He said the recently formed
dengue prevention task force comprises the Health Department, the State Fire
Services and Rescue Department, Non-Governmental Organisations and all local
authorities in the State. "We have mobilised prevention teams since early
this month to clean up areas identified as dengue prone." Low said 5 high
risk areas had been identified in Johor Baru, which recorded most of the
dengue cases in the State. The areas are Taman Perling, Taman Ungku Aminah,
Taman Sri Skudai, Taman Universiti and the squatter area in Kampung Teluk
Serdang.

In Ipoh [Perak State], State Health Committee Chairman Datuk Ho Cheng Wang
said that in the Kinta district alone, 65 cases of dengue fever had been
reported in the first 15 days of the year. "There have been 3 deaths in
Ipoh," he added.
All districts had been asked to set up special committees to fight the
dengue menace in their high-risk areas. "The district committees should
comprise officers from the local authority, health department, police, army
and Rela and Rukun Tetangga members. "They should carry out cleanliness
campaigns which target the cleaning-up of 1 or 2 of their high-risk areas,"
he added.
