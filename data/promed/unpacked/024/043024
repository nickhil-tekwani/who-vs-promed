11 live anthrax lots found at Dugway lab so far
-------------------
Nearly half of the anthrax lots that have been tested so far at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah have contained live bacteria, the Pentagon said Thursday, as testing continues on the remaining Pentagon samples. Col. Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman, said that 26 lots have been tested so far at Dugway. Of those, 11 have contained live anthrax.

In total, 91 lots have been tested from 3 military labs. The only positive samples have come from Dugway, he said.

The testing is part of a Pentagon review that was spurred by a civilian Maryland lab receiving live anthrax [in May 2015] in a sample that was supposed to have been killed by radiation. The Maryland lab contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is conducting its own investigation independent of the Defense Department.

The Pentagon investigation is testing every Defense Department anthrax sample to check for live bacteria as well as looking for how the radiation process, as well as a culture test to ensure the sample was dead, failed to catch the live bacteria.

Defense officials had previously estimated that there were more than 400 lots to test, but Col. Warren said Thursday that that number may not be correct.

A total of 68 labs in 19 states, 4 countries and the District of Columbia received potentially live anthrax samples. In Defense Department testing, the initial Maryland sample is still the only 1 that actually tested positive for live bacteria, Col. Warren said.

[Exactly how many Dugway samples have yet to be tested is unclear. But it is not unlikely that this hit rate of 44 percent will continue. In the meanwhile the US House of Representatives' House Armed Services Committee has asked to be briefed by the US Department of Defense. - Mod.MHJ
