Sleeping Sickness Claims 13 Lives In Angola
-----------------------------------------------------
21 Oct 1998
UIGE, Angola - Sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) has killed
13 people in the Angola province of Uige in the last quarter of 1998.
The Angolan News Agency (Angop) quoted the director of the 'Ango
Tryp' project, Patricia Rojas Bizzaros, as saying 558 cases were
diagnosed in zones around Kitexe, Uige, Ambuila and Bembe
municipalities, where the disease was endemic.
According to her, Ango-Tryp project specialists were currently
combating the disease in two phases, the first of which consists of
research while the second involves actual treatment of patients.
She also mentioned the work of mobile teams that were moving around
the endemic areas to treat patients and efforts to capture tse-tse
flies which are the vectors.
The Ango Tryp director regretted, however, that the hospital at
Kitexe was attacked by Jonas Savimbi's Unita combatants who stole
clinical and laboratory equipment, medicines, vehicles, beds and food
for patients.
