On 19 Apr 2009, an outbreak of anthrax was reported in a herd of 20
mixed British breed cattle, of which 3 had died suddenly with blood
extravasation from their mouths, vaginas, etc. _Bacillus anthracis_
was recovered by culture from a long bone of one animal. Human access
to the carcasses was strictly limited, and they were disposed of using
the standard "Tarpado Controlado" technique [The carcass is covered in
lime and a thick plastic tarpaulin put over the top and severely
anchored to prevent any access by foxes and scavenging birds. After 9
months, it is all removed, and the lime and bones taken away; see
ProMED-mail post 20070730.2445. - Mod.MHJ].

There has been a severe drought through the spring and summer into the
autumn, with above normal temperatures throughout the region.

The farm is located in Navarro county in the province of Buenos Aires.
