Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. As of late last week [week of 25 Jun 2018], the total outbreak cases stand at 404. Of this total, 280 required hospitalization and 1 person died.

This increase in cases has primarily been among injection and non-injection drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California. More than half the cases have been reported from Kanawha county (233), followed by Cabel county (73), Putnam county (54), and Wayne county with 13 cases.

Since 1 Jan 2017, Utah public health has identified 271 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.8 percent of total males are MSM (men who have sex with men); 3.0 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.7 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total of cases continues to increase, although at a much lower rate, and in numbers and fatalities has altogether surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak, but the total number has now been impressively surpassed by Kentucky.

The key to controlling these outbreaks revolves around changing the paradigm of HAV prevention. In addition to vaccination of critical cohorts such as food service workers, addressing the marginalized population of the homeless and providing appropriate care for drug users are useful interventions. - Mod.LL]
