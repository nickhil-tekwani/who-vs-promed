[1] _Citrus tristeza virus_, huanglongbing - Philippines (Kalinga)

There is a new hope for citrus growers of the famous Kalinga Oranges
commonly known as "gayunan" in this town after the National Economic
Development Authority (NEDA) and the local government unit (LGU) allotted
through a Memorandum of Agreement P 990 000 [24 535 USD] to revive the
industry.
The project intends to produce and distribute good quality, disease-free
gayunan seedlings through the procurement of certified disease-free
imported citrus seeds and asexual propagation or side-grafting which
hastens the propagation and distribution of budded seedlings. Major
activities would include construction of plastic and screen houses,
seedling propagation, establishment of foundation groves for budwoods and
rootstocks, and training on Citrus Production and Management for
farmer-producers to ensure the sustainability of the program.
Famous for its tastier, more juicy, and sweeter taste, the gayunan was a
major source of income of the people in the early 1960s, but the industry
started to decline in the early 1980s due to the damage brought by the
systemic diseases leaf mottling [citrus greening, huanglongbing] and the
_Citrus tristeza virus_, aside from poor orchard management and minimal
expansion of gayunan orchards because of the lack of planting materials.
The local government decided to devise methods and experiments to address
the crisis. Signed on 7 Dec 2007, the project is expected to be
accomplished within the year.

[2] Unspecified diseases - India (Mizoram)

The Mizoram government and an Israeli company has signed a memorandum of
understanding (MoU) which would enable orange growers to replace the
"disease-infected" orange variety and grow Israeli high-bred varieties,
Horticulture department officials said today [12 Jan 2008]. Mr Samuel
Rosanglura, horticulture director said that the state government signed the
MoU with Naan Dan Agriculture Products, Israel, for the Secondary High Tech
Green House Nursery for Citrus 2nd phase at an estimated cost of Rs 5.4
million [137 474 USD]. Earlier, the state government, with expertise from
Naan Dan company had grown 12 000 orange seedlings at Chite area.
Orange harvest failure hit the state, especially the western part, for the
past 3 years rendering the grower with almost nothing prompting the
government to look for alternatives. The Israeli orange trees are expected
to produce fruits after 3 years and are known to be free from orange
diseases prevalent in the state.

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) causes a range of
symptoms including stunting, dieback, yellowing, and stem pitting on a
number of citrus species. It is spread by several aphid species and can
also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. It appears to be
spreading wherever citrus is grown killing millions of trees every year
worldwide. Different strains of CTV may vary in the severity of symptoms
caused, and the tolerance of certain scion/rootstock combinations can no
longer be taken for granted. Careless introduction of severe strains such
as the "orange stem pitting" strain is a constant risk.
"Leaf mottling" is a term used commonly in the Philippines for
huanglongbing (citrus greening). In Asia, the disease is caused by the
fastidious bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, which occurs
throughout much of Asia and in parts of the Americas. Its vector is the
Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by
grafting and possibly seed transmitted. The disease is restricted to
_Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of the
vector. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting
leaves and fruits and leading to stunting and death of trees. Two other
strains of the pathogen -- _Ca._ L. africanus and _Ca._ L. americanus --
and their vectors exist in the respective areas. Citrus greening has not
been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.
No specific disease problems are being named for India. Besides CTV and
huanglongbing, another serious diseases of citrus present in South-East
Asia is citrus canker (caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pathovar _citri_). There are also over 30 citrus viruses and viroids which
can accumulate, especially in rootstocks, as well as a large number of
other diseases and disorders. A combination of various pathogens may have
contributed to the general decline of citrus crop health in India.
Disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock
and elimination of inoculum. The replanting programmes undertaken in the 2
countries are providing an opportunity for recovery, but they will only be
of long term benefit it they are linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and
monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially
into the orchards used as sources for propagating material. On the farms,
they will also need to be combined with elimination of infected trees to
reduce the chances of horizontal spread in the orchards.
