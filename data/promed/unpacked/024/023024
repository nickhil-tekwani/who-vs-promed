Encephalitis killed an 8-year-old Queen Creek girl, and state health
officials suspect mosquitoes are to blame. The child became ill Sept. 18
and died Sept. 23 at Desert Samaritan Medical Center in Mesa after being in
a coma for three days.
Both western equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses have
been isolated from mosquitoes in Arizona this year.
The family has refused to allow an autopsy, so the etiologic agent likely
will remain unknown.

[I would not have said that "mosquitoes are to blame". Mosquitoes do what
they have to do and sometimes transmit viruses that parasitize them. The
viruses may be responsible for the death but neither are they "to blame".
It's just the way things are. - Mod.CHC
