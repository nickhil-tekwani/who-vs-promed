Routine bacteriological and relevant biochemical tests were performed, and _S. gallinarum_ was diagnosed on [10 Dec 2020]. The affected farm has been quarantined, and farms in the area are subject to epidemiological surveillance with restrictions on bird movement and continuous surveillance by sampling. Disease presence has not been detected during investigations in the 10-km [6.2 mi] radius zone around the outbreak nor in farms epidemiologically linked to the affected farm; therefore, disease presence is restricted to the affected farm.

"Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S. Gallinarum_ biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterized by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses."

_Salmonella gallinarum_ poses a minimal zoonotic risk.
