Local wildlife officials are seeing the biggest die-off of raccoons in
at least a decade, the result of a cyclical distemper outbreak
sweeping the Portland area.
The epidemic does not represent a health hazard to humans, and
domestic pets are protected if they have been vaccinated. Even
the raccoon population, which has boomed in recent years, should
not be hurt seriously.
The epidemic illustrates the tension between urban wildlife and
humans, said Bob Sallinger, director of the Audubon Society
Wildlife Care Center in Northwest Portland.
People are disturbed to see wild animals dying in their back yards
but often don't realize their actions, even if well-intentioned, can
exacerbate the problem.
Feeding wild animals, especially mammals, gets them to
congregate in a small area, allowing disease to spread. In addition,
trapping animals and moving them away from urban areas can
spread disease, Sallinger said.
In a typical year, the Audubon Society sees 2 to 15 cases of
distemper in raccoons. This year, more than 100 animals have
been brought in, and things could get worse.
The epidemic began in the spring and tapered off during the
summer. However, the Audubon Society recently has been getting
about 2 calls a day. "We've seen it come back with a vengeance,"
Sallinger said.
Wildlife officials are concerned cold weather could stress the
animals and result in another wave of deaths. In the past several
weeks, Lake Oswego police have shot and killed 3 raccoons and
taken 2 of those to a local veterinary clinic, said Capt. Marc
Galloway. The clinic sent samples from the animals to Oregon
State University for testing to make sure the animals had not been
poisoned. The results from one of the raccoons shows it had
distemper. Tests on the other raccoon are not complete.
Distemper is an airborne virus that is always present in the wild but
results in only periodic epidemics. Sick animals first appear to have
a runny nose and watery eyes. As the disease progresses, the
animals become disoriented and stagger. As they approach death,
they can suffer convulsions.
Sallinger suggests keeping your distance from sick raccoons
because the animals will lash out if they feel threatened and some
with the disease have become aggressive. Officials suggest calling
the wildlife department if you see a sick raccoon, because most
police agencies will not respond to animal calls. However, Sallinger
warned overburdened and underbudgeted public agencies might
not respond right away.
Dead raccoons should be placed in a plastic bag and disposed of
in the garbage, said Tom Thornton, a district biologist for the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
All raccoons taken to the Audubon Society will be euthanized,
Sallinger said. That's because the distemper virus, which is almost
always fatal for wild animals, incubates for several weeks. In order
not to expose other wild animals to the disease, the wildlife care
center cannot house or take care of any raccoons.
