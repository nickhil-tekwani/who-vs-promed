[Below is an edited news report of a scientific seminar on "Nipah virus
encephalitis" held on Monday, 26 Jul 1999 at the Faculty of Medicine,
University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. - Mod. CYC
In Malaysian medical history, one lorry driver will stand out. From
his brain, scientists isolated a hitherto unknown virus which swept
through pig farms in 3 states leaving a massive trail of devastation.
That lorry driver, who died from viral encephalitis, was from
Kampung Baru Sungai Nipah, Negeri Sembilan.
The Nipah virus, named after his community, is the world's newest nasty
germ.
[Chief neurologist Professor Dr C.T. Tan of the University Hospital,
working with Dr Goh Khean Jin, was suspicous that they were
dealing with a new disease but had to wait for conclusive
investigations from virologists. In the meantime, they worked on
what they knew.
"The clinical picture was encephalitis, it sure looked like JE
[Japanese encephalitis," says Dr Tan. "What was different was
that the patients were adults. Only children get JE. We noted
unusual signs like jerking and twitching.
"The clinical manifestations were unpredictable. In some cases, the
patient had a mild headache in the morning but by evening needed
a ventilator. Eventually, about 30 per cent of patients died. That's
lethal."
WHAT'S NEW ABOUT NIPAH
Four people who recovered and went home have recently returned
with what appears to be a relapse, with quite severe symptoms. It is
not yet known exactly why they had a relapse. A relapse is not
necessarily brought about by a return of the virus. It could be a
purely clinical event because the human body is known to do this.
Another person -- she left her farm more than 3 months ago and
was not sick at all -- has now reported encephalitis. This is the first
case of a late onset of the disease.
Both events present new scientific challenges for clinicians who
are now investigating. It also suggests how dangerous the Nipah
virus may be.
The Nipah virus engages a double whammy on human beings. The
key event is the damage it does to blood vessels, particularly the
smaller blood vessels of the brain. "That damage sets off a chain
of events which lead to coma and death," says neuropathologist
Associate Professor Dr Wong Kum Thong who led the autopsies
at Universiti Hospital. "This virus is decidedly vicious, it moves very
fast. The only known thing that leaves a similar, though not exactly
the same trail of damage is the Hendra virus. Also, pathologists are
studying the intriguing black spots found on the brain."
Here is an account of what the Nipah virus does to humans:
- The virus enters the body and gets into the bloodstream. This
exact process is still being studied but what's clear is that, at some
point in the process, the virus multiplies prolifically and heads for
the brain.
- Once there, the virus penetrates cells of the inner wall of the blood
vessels, known as the endothelium. These cells start to fuse
together, forming giant cells which is abnormal. Soon, the giant
cells die.
- With the inner wall damaged, the virus attacks the outer wall by
simply "taking over" those cells. When those cells cannot cope any
more, the virus leaps out of the bloodstream and invades the brain
cells.
- While the blood vessel is being so brutally damaged, the body
begins reacting by trying to heal the "wound". It starts off a blood
clotting process -- called thrombosis -- hoping that the "punctured"
blood vessel will be sealed off. This is a normal bodily reaction.
- Technically, such clotting is an intelligent move. But the Nipah
virus, working in such huge numbers, is so pervasive that quickly,
there are tiny clots everywhere. These clots eventually become
blockages and, because the bloodstream is a closed system,
pressure starts to build. Downstream, the resulting lack of oxygen
causes the death of brain cells which those blood vessels are
supposed to supply. This means brain damage has begun. That's
the first part of the double whammy.
- Once out of the blood vessel, the virus invades cells of the brain. It
simply takes over those cells, throwing metabolic processes
haywire. The flushing systems of the cells fail, that's why
inflammation sets in.
Eventually, the virus hits cells of the nervous system -- called
neurons -- and disables all standard operating procedures of the
body.
WHAT WE'RE STILL STUDYING
- Which exact part of the double whammy causes death?
- Why the brain? Actually, viral damage was found in all vital organs
of autopsied patients -- to a lesser extent in the liver, to a greater
extent in the brain. Because the brain is the body's control centre,
damage done here is devastating. Tissue affinity -- or a certain
predilection -- always plays a role. Viruses, and many other germs,
are target-specific. This predilection can be seen in the way the
virus attacks small blood vessels. For some reason, it doesn't
target large arteries and veins. In one way, it's a blessing that the
virus goes for the human brain. Supposing it preferred the lungs,
then chances are humans would be coughing up the virus.
- What about the body's highly-rated immune response system?
This is one occasion when the immune system is too slow for a
fast working virus. Was it because this was man's first exposure to
the Nipah virus?
- Why some people got sick and others didn't although all were
from the high-risk group? This will be the epidemic's greatest
challenge. If those people had some kind of immunity, perhaps that
protection can be mimicked by way of a vaccine or other treatment.

have been confirmed by laboratory tests. We await further details -
