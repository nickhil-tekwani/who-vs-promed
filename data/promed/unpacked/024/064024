So far this year [2007], 99 people have become ill with hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS), the local Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial
Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human
Welfare] informed the correspondent of Regnum-Volga Inform. Human become
infected generally in the countryside after cleaning houses after the
winter, during work in the garden, and after visiting the forests.
Morbidity is registered in half of the regions of the republic, but the
most affected areas are Askubaevskij, Alekseevskij, Almeteevskij,
Bavlinskij, Baltansinskij, Zainskij, Lenigorskij, Mamadyshskij,
Musljumovskij, Pestrechinskij, Rybno-Slobodskij, Sabinskij, Tukajevskij,

The epidemiologists foresee that this year [2007] may be the peak morbidity
year for HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] for Udmurtia. The
peak comes every 3 years and is explained by biological rhythms of the main
transmitter -- the red vole. During the last peak, 1992 people got ill, the
senior expert of epidemiological surveillance at Rospotrebnadzor
[Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection
and Human Welfare], Nailya Bogdanova, informed Udm-Info.
Since the beginning of this year [2007], 86 cases of HFRS have been
registered, which is 1.9 times more than last year [2006]. Among the
infected individuals are 5 children under 14 years of age. Epidemiologists
say that meteorological conditions of the last winter resulted in increased
migration of rodents into living quarters. This is the cause of increased
morbidity in Ijevsk, where 35 cases were registered since the beginning of
this year [2007], while the same indicator for last year [2006] was only 7.
The number of registered cases of HFRS is increasing in Privoljsky federal
okrug, particularly in Tatarstan and in neighboring Udmurtia. This
territory harbors the most active natural nidi of HFRS, which is explained
by abundance of deciduous forest litter and mixed forests with understories.
In 2006, around 700 people contracted the disease in Tatarstan and since
the beginning of 2007, already 100 [have fallen ill]. The situation is
similar in Udmurtia, where 86 cases have been detected. During the first 8
months of 2006, 191 cases were registered in Udmurtia. The peak was in
August 2006, with 79 cases registered.

[It is necessary to mention that the peak of morbidity usually starts at
the end of summer and beginning of autumn, when rodents move closer to
human habitations due to the cold. Since the population of rodents is
maintained during the winter the situation is expected to get worse. - Mod.NP
The virus causing HFRS in these republics is not specified and ProMED-mail
would appreciate receiving further information about the specific virus or
viruses involved in these cases. The republic of Udmurtia is located in the
Privolzhsky federal okrug, in the Ural economic region, with an area of 42
100 sq km (16 255 sq mi) and a population of 1 639 000 people. It can be
located on the map at <http://russiatrek.org/rp_udmurtia.shtml>. - Mod.TY]
