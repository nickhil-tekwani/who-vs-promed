E.COLI: SAFE MEAT HANDLING
==========================

Subject: E.coli: safe meat handling

All meat sold at retail in the U.S. must bear a "safe handling" label which
warns against the risks of cross-contamination and also asks that beef be
cooked "until the juices run clear".
Research at Kansas State Univ. has shown that the red color may [be] absent
without clear kill of the E.coli O157:H7, but non-opaque juices are a better
indication than color.
The FDA has listed ground meat among foods to be avoided by severely
immuno-suppressed populations.
