Local Transmission of _Plasmodium vivax_ Malaria --- Virginia, 2002
-----------------------
Malaria transmission in the United States was largely eliminated during the
mid-20th century; however, sporadic cases of locally acquired
mosquito-transmitted malaria continue to occur. Since 1997, 4 separate
probable mosquito-transmitted malaria outbreaks have been reported to CDC,
including one from Virginia (1--3). This report describes the investigation
of 2 cases of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria that occurred in northern Virginia
in August 2002, and underscores the need for clinicians to consider the
possibility of malaria in patients with fever of unknown origin.
Case Reports
Case 1. On 23 Aug 2002, a person aged 19 years from northern Virginia
sought medical care at a family health clinic with a 4-day history of
fatigue, fever, and chills. The patient also complained of muscle aches and
sinus pain. A sinus infection was diagnosed, and the patient was prescribed
azithromycin and desloratadine. The patient returned to the clinic 4 days
later with additional symptoms, dizziness, and nausea.
On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 103.5 F (39.7 C)
and tachycardia. Laboratory results revealed pancytopenia (platelet count:
61,000/microL [normal: 130 000--400 000/microL], hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
[normal: 11.5--16.0 g/dL], and white blood cell count: 3300/microL [normal:
4000--11 000/microL]). The patient's therapy was changed to oral
levofloxacin. Malaria parasites were identified subsequently on a routine
complete blood count smear taken 4 days after the initial clinic visit. The
patient was contacted and administered chloroquine. A review of the initial
malaria smear by a local university hospital confirmed the diagnosis of _P.
vivax_ malaria. The patient completed a 3-day course of chloroquine therapy
and after a normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) test result was
placed on primaquine for 14 days. The patient had complete resolution of
symptoms.
Case 2. On 25 Aug 2002, a person aged 15 years from northern Virginia was
taken to a local emergency department for treatment of 2 weeks of headaches
and 4 days of fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and nose bleeds. On
physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 105.0 F (40.6 C),
tachycardia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. Laboratory values revealed
pancytopenia (platelet count: 48 000/microL, hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL, and
white blood cell count: 3200/microL). A malaria smear revealed Plasmodium
sp. parasites reported initially as non-falciparum. The patient was
admitted to the hospital and administered quinine and clindamycin. The
smear was confirmed subsequently as _P. vivax_ by the Virginia Department
of Health. The patient's physician contacted CDC for treatment
recommendations on 28 Aug 2002 because the patient had tinnitus, requiring
discontinuation of the quinine. The patient completed a 3-day course of
chloroquine therapy and was discharged with complete resolution of symptoms
on 31 Aug 2002. After a normal G6PD test result, the patient was placed on
primaquine for 14 days.
Epidemiologic Investigation
The 2 patients had no risk factors for malaria, including international
travel, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or needle sharing. The
patients lived approximately 0.5 miles apart; however, the 19-year-old
patient reported numerous visits to friends who lived directly across the
street from the 15-year-old patient. Residents in the neighborhood
surrounding the patients' homes were asked about recent febrile illnesses.
Medical records from 2 hospitals serving residents in the patients'
neighborhood also were reviewed, and charts of patients with a diagnosis of
fever of unknown origin were obtained. None of the patients' neighbors had
unexplained febrile illnesses. Of 224 hospital records available for
review, 21 documented fever with no underlying cause. One of the 21
patients had persistent symptoms; however, a malaria smear did not reveal
malaria parasites. No further cases of locally acquired malaria have been
reported in northern Virginia.
Washington Dulles International Airport is located <10 miles from the
patients' homes. The airport receives non-stop international flights from
countries in which _P. vivax_ malaria is endemic. Ill travelers are sent to
one of the hospitals included in the investigation's case-detection
activities. Physicians at 2 Army bases located nearby were contacted and
reported no known cases of malaria or fever of unknown origin in troops
returning from areas in which malaria is endemic.
Environmental and Entomologic Investigation
The patients' homes were visited. One home had several unscreened or poorly
screened windows; the other had well-screened windows and a porch. Within
the vicinity of both homes was a wooded area with a creek and ponds. As a
part of ongoing West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance activities, trapping for
anopheline mosquitoes within 10 miles of the patients' homes yielded
_Anopheles quadrimaculatus_ and _An. punctipennis_. Of approximately 870
anopheline mosquitoes tested, 5 pools (4-6 mosquitoes per pool) captured
within 2--6 miles of the patients' homes tested positive for _P. vivax_-210
circumsporozoite protein by using a field test (VecTest* [Medical Analysis
Systems, Inc., Camarillo, California]) on 25 and 27 Sep 2002 and 1,6, and
11 Oct 2002. No mosquito pool has tested positive repeatedly in
confirmatory testing by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR); however,
efforts to confirm the positive VecTest* mosquito pools are ongoing.
Editorial Note:
Despite malaria eradication certification in the United States in 1970
(4,5), 10 outbreaks involving 17 cases of probable locally acquired
mosquito-borne malaria transmission have occurred since 1992 (1). The 2
cases from northern Virginia represent the first cases of probable
mosquito-borne malaria transmission in the United States since 1999 (1,2)
and the second reported outbreak in Virginia (3). These outbreaks share
common features: 1) an initial case without known risk factors for malaria,
2) probable proximity to a person with malaria parasitemia, 3) presence of
competent mosquito vectors, and 4) environmental conditions conducive to
the maturation of the parasite in the mosquito. Approximately 1000--1500
cases of malaria in the United States are reported annually to CDC (6). The
majority are diagnosed in travelers from countries in which malaria is
endemic. The source of infection in the 2 northern Virginia residents was
probably the bite of an infective mosquito that had acquired the parasite
by biting a malaria-infected person in the general vicinity. Several
_Anopheles_ sp. mosquitoes native to the United States are competent
malaria vectors. The _An. quadrimaculatus_ and _An. punctipennis_
mosquitoes captured near the patients' homes have been implicated in
previous cases of locally acquired malaria (2,3). Numerous pools of these
vectors were tested by using VecTest*. Although this test is used commonly
in international settings (7), this is the first time the test has been
used in an investigation of mosquito-borne malaria in the United States.
The identification of 5 malaria-positive pools among approximately 870
tested mosquitoes is unexpectedly high and has not been observed previously
during an investigation of a malaria outbreak in the United States. Rapid
screening tests such as the VecTest* were not available previously.
However, because VecTest* is a new tool for the investigation of local
mosquito-borne malaria in the United States, its validity in this setting
is unknown, and results need to be confirmed by using PCR. Efforts are
under way to develop test-ing algorithms for screening mosquito pools by
using VecTest* and confirming results with PCR. This investigation
underscores the need for clinicians to consider the possibility of malaria
in patients with fever of unknown origin. Although a thorough travel
history and risk factor assessment should be a part of the evaluation of
febrile patients, the possibility of malaria in patients without
international travel, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or needle
sharing should be considered. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with effective
antimalarial drugs are the basis of patient case management and will reduce
the chances that an infected host will transmit the parasite. The same
precautions recommended for minimizing exposure to WNV should be followed
for reducing exposure to malaria-infected _Anopheles_ sp. mosquitoes,
including wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers, using insect
repellent containing N,N-diethylm-toluamide (DEET), and avoiding outdoor
activities during the late evening. Prompt reporting of patients with
malaria to local public health authorities assists in activating control
measures for these isolated cases of mosquito-borne malaria.
