AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS IN SOUTH AFRICA
Final report
See also: 28 May 1999, 30 April 1999, 9 April 1999
Follow-up report No. 3
Summary of a fax received on 8 July 1999 from Dr Emily Mogajane, Director,
Animal Production and Health, Pretoria:
End of previous report period: 20 May 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[20, 71, dated 28 May 1999).
End of this report period: 7 July 1999.
No more cases of African horse sickness (AHS) have been reported from the
Western Cape province since 17 May 1999. The outbreak is therefore
considered as ended.
A total of 34 cases occurred and 28 horses died. A correction to the
follow-up report No. 2 must be made, as only 3 horses were euthanised (not
4).
Total number of animals in the outbreak (correction):
susceptible 485
cases 34
deaths 28
destroyed 3
slaughtered 0
Three horses survived the infection. One of them was the first case
reported; the other two horses were from a single property. They were both
vaccinated against AHS more than two years previously. They began showing
clinical signs for AHS and recovered. On 29 March 1999, blood was taken from
these two horses and AHS virus serotype 7 was isolated.
Epidemiology
-------------------
The outbreak remained contained within the Stellenbosch district of the
Western Cape province. Under the terms of the Animal Diseases Act, Act 35 of
1984, the Western Cape province is a controlled area for AHS. This area is
divided into a free zone, a surveillance zone (buffer area) and a protection
zone. The outbreak occurred within the AHS surveillance zone, about 35 km
from the AHS free zone. Therefore, this outbreak has not affected the
declared AHS free zone.
Control
----------
A blanket vaccination campaign was instituted and completed in the districts
of Stellenbosch, Strand, Somerset West, Paarl and Wellington.
All quarantine measures previously reported (quarantine of horses in the
above-mentioned districts) were lifted on 28 June 1999. This is 95 days
after quarantine was instituted (26 March 1999) and 42 days after the last
AHS case (17 May 1999) occurred in the Western Cape province.
