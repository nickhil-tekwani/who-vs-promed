Raw milk, raw nonfat milk and raw cream produced by Claravale Farm of San Benito County is the subject of a statewide recall and quarantine order announced today, 23 Mar 2012, by California State Veterinarian Dr. Annette Whiteford. The quarantine order came following the confirmed detection of _Campylobacter_ bacteria in raw cream.

Consumers are strongly urged to dispose of any product remaining in their refrigerators with code dates of "MAR 27" and earlier, and retailers are to pull those products immediately from their shelves.

On 19 Mar 2012, Claravale Farm voluntarily ceased distribution of its products after the California Department of Food and Agriculture made a preliminary positive finding of _Campylobacter_ in raw cream. The stoppage of distribution included goat milk, as well. No illnesses have been definitively attributed to the products at this time. However, the California Department of Public Health is conducting an epidemiological investigation of reported clusters of campylobacterosis illness where consumption of raw milk products may have occurred.

[There is not yet either a clear epidemiological association between the human illnesses and the unpasteurized cream and other dairy products, nor genetic fingerprint evidence of identity between the human isolates and Campylobacter strains obtained from the possible vehicle. Despite these, it is more than likely that this is another outbreak of campylobacteriosis caused by unpasteurized milk or milk products. - Mod. LL
