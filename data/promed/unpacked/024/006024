While the moderator correctly points out that dogs usually do not become ill with plague and rarely transmit the disease to humans, dogs can serve as passive vectors for plague by bringing infected fleas into the home. Flea collars reduce, but do not eliminate the risk. CDC advises the use of flea control products for free-roaming dogs and cats in plague endemic areas and not allowing these animals to sleep in your bed.

[Dr Hull is correct. Fleas on dogs can serve as a vector bringing plague into the house.

Recently, a dog in Colorado did die of plague (ProMED-mail post 20140719.2621418) and people in the household were also infected with the pneumonic form of plague. It is believed the people got the plague from the dog and not the fleas, but I think it would difficult to prove that with fleas already present in the home.

This moderator wishes to thank Dr Hull for his comment. - Mod.TG
