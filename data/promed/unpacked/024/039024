White nose syndrome [WNS], a fungal disease that has decimated bat populations throughout the eastern United States and Canada, has been discovered for the 1st time in Rhode Island.

The Department of Environmental Management announced on [Thu 5 May 2016] that a tri-colored bat hibernating in Newport County this past winter [2015-2016] tested positive for the disease and that soil samples from 2 other locations in the county confirmed the presence of the fungus.

Rhode Island becomes the 29th state -- a list that includes all the other New England states -- to confirm the presence of white-nose syndrome, which has killed approximately 6 million bats over the past decade.

The syndrome was first documented in a cave in New York state in 2006 and was named for the white fungus -- _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ -- that appears on the muzzles, wings, and other parts of hibernating bats. The bats are awakened from their winter sleep by the damage the fungus causes and act in ways that aren't normal. They fly during the day when they should be at rest and eventually use up their fat stores and starve to death.

Seven species of bats that live mainly in the eastern part of the country are affected. In some places, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died from the syndrome, according to the US. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The fungus was found in swab samples collected in Rhode Island as part of a research study conducted by the US Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center, in Wisconsin. Although the bats that were tested showed no visible signs of the disease when samples were collected in February and again in March [2016], further testing confirmed that one bat was infected and 2 others were suspected of having the syndrome. Soil samples taken from 2 other locations found the presence of the fungus but no other infected bats.

White-nose syndrome is not a threat to humans or other animals.
