In response to your inquiry about West Nile Virus (WNV) in Israel:
1. There have been no new cases of WNV since November 20th.
2. Diagnosis was by clinical signs followed by virus isolation in
embryonated eggs, suckling mice and Vero cells. In the first two there was
mortality and in the third cytopathic changes. Immunoflorescence using a
panel of monoclonal antibodies obtained from the UK, South Africa and
Australia, identified the virus as WNV. Isolates were sent to the Pasteur
Institute ( Dr. Deubel) for molecular characterization.
3. The vaccine that is being used in Israel against WNV in geese, is an
attenuated [strain] of Turkey Meningo Encephalitis. This vaccine has been
in use in Israel for 24 years in turkeys. Safety tests were carried out in
geese. We have no experience with this vaccine in vertebrates other than
turkeys and geese.

[In West Nile virus, vaccine (02), Shlomo Lustig indicated he and his
coworkers were developing a West Nile virus vaccine from a strain
designated WN-25A. Given that we had asked which strain was being used in
Israel, I took his message and that of Eleanor Kellon (in West Nile virus,
vaccine) to indicate this was the strain being used in Israel to vaccinate
geese against WNV. Clearly that is not the case. Let's try to answer the
question asked, not an unasked question.
Thanks to Eli Berman for his response to our request for information.
Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus is a flavivirus, related to West
Nile virus (they are both flaviviruses) but distantly related. That ITM
virus is being used to protect geese against WNV is fascinating. Are there
data showing that ITMV protects against WNV infection or is it being used
because there is no WNV vaccine available? - Mod.CHC]
