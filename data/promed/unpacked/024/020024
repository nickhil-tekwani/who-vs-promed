The City Health Office (CHO) has recorded 141 cases of leptospirosis with 26 deaths since January this year [2022]. "We have a total of 26 deaths reported that gives a case fatality rate of 18 percent," Dr. Dulce Amor Miravite, CHO chief, said Friday [2 Dec 2022].

Miravite said most of the infected individuals are aged between 20 and 29, while 120, or [85%], of the 141 cases are males.

Miravite said 62 of the 141 cases were recorded after the 2-day downpour of Typhoon Paeng on 27-28 Oct [2022]. Dr. Elmeir Jade Apolinario, City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office chief, said earlier the flood affected 56 of this city's 98 barangays.

Leptospirosis is caused by the _Leptospira_ spirochete bacteria that is spread through rat urine. Its mode of transmission includes wading in contaminated floodwaters and ingesting contaminated food or water.

Miravite said most of the cases reported were in Barangay Tumaga, Pasonanca, Guiwan, Tetuan, Tugbungan, Santa Maria, Ayala, Talon-Talon, and Tulungatung.

Meanwhile, the local government has launched information sessions in different barangays amid the increasing cases of leptospirosis here.

[Zamboanga (pop. 977 234 residents in 2020) is a city in the Zamboanga Peninsula region of the Philippines at the western tip of Mindanao island; it is the commercial and industrial center of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboanga_City). A map showing the location of Zamboanga can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zamboanga,+Philippines.

On 6 Nov 2022, ProMED posted a report of a total of 20 cases of leptospirosis so far in 2022, with a case fatality rate of 50%; the report warned of more cases anticipated following Typhoon Paeng in late October 2022 (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Philippines (07): (ZC) increasing cases, fatal 20221107.8706602). The news article above now reports there are a total of 141 cases of leptospirosis (with a case fatality rate of 18%) so far in 2022, of which 62 cases were said to have been recorded after flooding brought on by Typhoon Paeng, implying 79 cases of leptospirosis occurred in Zamboanga City before Typhoon Paeng. We are not told the numbers of cases with a suspected vs laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. Perhaps this accounts for the discrepancy in numbers of cases. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to the urine of infected animals or to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - Tanzania: (LI) fatal, RFI 20220719.8704520.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that, when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). - Mod.ML
