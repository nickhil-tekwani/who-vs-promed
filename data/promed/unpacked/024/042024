Dog disease may be killing wolves; surviving pups at Yellowstone will
be tested for parvovirus
-----------------------------------------------
Most of the gray wolf pups born in Yellowstone National Park last
year [2005] have died, possibly because of a dog disease, a federal
wolf expert says.
Just 22 of the 69 pups born last year [2005] are still alive, said
Doug Smith, the park's wolf project leader. That's the biggest drop
in pup numbers since wolves were reintroduced into the park 11 years
ago. The greatest toll was seen on the park's northern range, where
only 8 of the 49 pups born last spring survived. "It's cause for
concern, a great deal of concern," Smith said.
During the next few weeks, he said, officials plan to catch
Yellowstone pups and take blood samples to see whether his suspicions
about parvovirus are true. The disease can cause extreme diarrhea and
dehydration and kill more vulnerable animals, such as young pups.
Though vaccinations are an option (many domestic dogs receive them),
Smith said it would be difficult in the park. "It requires 2
vaccinations to build up an immunity, and we'd have to catch every
wolf," he said.
If parvovirus is confirmed, there is little officials can do besides
monitor the population and hope exposed wolves build a natural
immunity to the disease, he said.
Terry Kreeger, supervisor of veterinary services for the Wyoming Game
and Fish Department, said that while parvovirus could have a
noticeable effect for years on wolf populations, he doesn't believe
it will be devastating.
It could, however, have implications for how wolves are managed,
Smith said. The gray wolf is federally protected, but Wyoming
officials are seeking more control over the predators amid complaints
that the growing wolf population poses a threat to wildlife,
livestock and pets.
The number of wolves in Yellowstone dropped last year [2005] from 171
to 118, said Doug Smith, Yellowstone Park's wolf project leader. The
largest single-year drop before that was 11, from 1998 to 1999, when
parvovirus also was suspected, he said.
