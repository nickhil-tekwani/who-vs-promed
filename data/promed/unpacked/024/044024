Health authorities are investigating the deaths of dozens of chickens
in Venezuela and suspect the cause to be Newcastle disease, a
government official said Monday.
One farm in the north-central state of Miranda was placed under
quarantine after some 30-40 chickens were found with symptoms of
Newcastle disease, said Jose Garcia, director of the Health
Ministry's epidemics department. He said most of those chickens died.
Newcastle disease is a common illness among birds that is not a
threat to humans. Garcia told The Associated Press that officials
have taken samples from chickens at the farms and people living in
the area. "Samples were taken from humans and animals to confirm what
this situation is about and to be able also to rule out or confirm
avian influenza," Garcia said.
"The Newcastle virus is common in the country and it usually develops
in caged birds on small farms that are not supplied with the right
vaccines."
No indications of bird flu have been detected in the country, a
government statement said.
