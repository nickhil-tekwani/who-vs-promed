More than 700 people have been poisoned after eating wild mushrooms in Iran, the country's emergency services said. At least 9 people have died, while dozens more remain in critical condition, [according to a] local media report.

"The latest emergency statistics show 721 people have been poisoned by poisonous mushrooms, of which 190 were hospitalized, 523 were cleared, and 9 died," Mojtaba Khalidi, an emergency services spokesman, told Iran's ISNA news agency.

At least 50 of the victims who were hospitalized across Iran's 8 provinces are in critical condition, with some requiring liver transplants to save their lives, the emergency services said.

The country's Ministry of Health attributed the incident to spring rain across the mountainous regions of the country, and issued a warning advising people to "avoid eating wild and unfamiliar mushrooms," and refrain from even touching them because "skin toxicity is present in some species of fungi."

Authorities advised the public not to buy mushrooms from street vendors. Those who experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or severe dizziness are advised to drink a lot of fluids and visit a health center immediately.

[There are multiple species of toxic mushrooms in the world. The photograph in the news article closely resembles a mushroom of the _Amanita_ spp. However, it should be noted that there is no way to know if the mushrooms in this photo are the mushrooms causing the problem.

"The fatality rate for amanitin poisoning is about 50 percent without prompt, knowledgeable medical treatment, but is about 10 percent in the US and Canada where good medical care is readily available. [Clearly other countries can offer similar care, yet there remain some which may not have the necessary capabilities to treat this toxin or offer organ transplants. - Mod.TG]. Amatoxins are doubly dangerous due to the fact that the symptoms are delayed for 6 to 24 hours after ingestion, by which time the toxins have been completely absorbed by the body and after the initial state of gastric distress, the patient may appear to recover about day 2 or day 3 and be sent home. Monitoring of liver enzyme function is critical in cases of delayed onset GI distress!

"Amanitins are a group of complex cyclic polypeptides which damage tissues by inhibiting RNA synthesis within each individual cell. Onset of symptoms manifests itself in 4 stages:
- 1st stage is a latency period of 6 to 24 hours after ingestion, in which the toxins are actively destroying the victim's kidneys and liver, but the victim experiences no discomfort;
- 2nd stage is a period of about 24 hours characterized by violent vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and severe abdominal cramps;
- 3rd stage is a period of 24 hours during which the victim appears to recover (if hospitalized, the patient is sometimes released!);
- 4th stage is a relapse, during which kidney and liver failure often occurs, leading to death. Patients may also "bleed out" and die due to the destruction of clotting factors in the blood. There may be more than one relapse. [Those surviving would need liver and/or kidney transplants. - Mod.TG]

"If you have any reason to suspect that someone has ingested an amanitin-containing mushroom, DON'T WAIT for symptoms to appear! There is no antidote for amanitin poisoning, and the best hope is to rush the person to the hospital where the toxins can be removed before being fully absorbed into the body.

"Seeking prompt medical treatment when amatoxin poisoning is suspected is critical. Since the symptoms (NOTE: in the most serious cases, severe diarrhea can begin in as little as 6 hours post ingestion) typically do not appear until 12 or more hours after ingestion of an amatoxin containing species, activated charcoal to remove the toxins from the GI tract is ineffective. In all but the most severe cases, aggressive IV fluid treatment can slowly flush the toxins from the system in the excreted urine. Liver enzymes levels and blood clotting factors must be closely monitored. In severe cases (as measured by liver enzyme levels and blood clotting factors) experimental use of IV silibinin and other measures may help enough that a liver transplant can be avoided. Use of penicillin is no longer considered effective. For a full review of treatment strategies see "Amatoxin Poisoning in North America 2015-2016" at http://namyco.org/docs/Amatoxin_Poisoning_2015-16.pdf"

This mushroom is known to cause liver failure, and as such some of the victims would likely need a liver transplant. This same mushroom can also make people seriously ill.

This is a large number of people needing a liver transplant. Hopefully people will heed the warnings about not eating roadside mushrooms, as they may be toxic and potentially deadly.
