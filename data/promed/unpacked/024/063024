There hasn't been a measles outbreak in Canada recently, and the country has gone more than a year without a single case of the disease.

Dr. Theresa Tam shared the news about this milestone on Twitter. She said that "Measles has also been self-isolating" since the COVID-19 pandemic started.

Even though there has been enhanced surveillance going on regularly in Canada, it has been a full year without any reported cases of the disease. Dr. Tam said that this is "good news."

Canada puts out weekly monitoring reports for measles, and the last reported case was in the week of 2-8 Feb 2020, which was also the only one reported that calendar year.

Flu activity was also down in 2020, with the season ending abruptly in mid-March 2020 because of measures taken to stop COVID-19. Then, in the fall of that year, activity related to the flu was "exceptionally low."

[2] UK: Flu, measles, mumps & rubella infections plummet

Outbreaks of flu, measles, mumps, and rubella have been almost non-existent in the UK since the outbreak of COVID-19, a batch of scientific data has confirmed.

Out of 685 243 samples tested by Public Health England, not a single case of influenza was detected in the 1st 7 weeks of 2021.

The imposition of social distancing, combined with the prevalence of face coverings and handwashing, have been credited with blocking the usual routes of transmission for influenza. The reduction in international travel and an increased uptake in the flu vaccine probably also had a major impact.

[3] Pakistan: 375 children treated

Supporting the Department of Health in responding to a measles outbreak, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is running a 30-bed isolation ward for treatment of measles patients in the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Chaman, District Qilla Abdullah.

MSF is fully managing the isolation ward through medical staff, medicines, personal protection equipment (PPE), water, power supply, sanitization, and health education.

Since the 1st week of January 2021, when MSF opened the isolation ward, a total of 125 patients have been treated successfully and 250 patients sent home on oral medications. MSF has also vaccinated 756 children for measles since then.

As there are cases of measles throughout the year in Chaman, MSF already supports the department of health and runs a 5-bed isolation unit inside its pediatric ward in the Qilla Abdullah DHQ hospital.

Its teams started receiving significant numbers of children with measles from the end of December 2020. There were over 1000 cases of measles reported in one month in the district Qilla Abdullah.

MSF medical focal point Dr. Mir Waiz said in a media briefing: "Our emergency response to the measles outbreak in Chaman is a part of MSF's commitment to supporting the Department of Health in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters and disease outbreaks. We have opened the extended ward for a period of 2 months; however, the treatment of the children with measles will continue in our regular activities. People must take cautionary measures, including isolating patients with measles and getting them treated as soon as possible to stop the outbreak."

Most patients recover from measles within 2-3 weeks, but in low-resource settings, up to 15 per cent of patients infected with measles die from one or more complications. Children, especially those under 5 and those who may have other immune-suppressing illnesses, such as severe malnutrition, make up most of those who die from the disease.

"As vaccination is the best protection against measles, we urge all parents to get their children vaccinated in order to stop the ongoing outbreak of measles and avoid any such emergency situation in the future. We supported the Department of Health's immunization programme to vaccinate 22 830 children for childhood diseases, including 2631 children for measles in 2020," added Mir Waiz.

MSF 1st started working in Pakistan in 1986 and now provides urgently needed quality medical care to people in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh provinces. MSF works in collaboration with the health authorities as well as federal, provincial, and local disaster management authorities in the country, and its activities in Pakistan are funded solely by private donations, with no institutional or government contributions.

"In the 2 decades before 2000, estimated coverage with the 1st measles-containing vaccine dose (MCV1) in Pakistan was 57% or less. The number of reported measles cases per year averaged approximately 29 000 during 1980-1989 and 3900 during 1990-1999.

What is added by this report?
Estimated MCV1 coverage increased from 57% to 76% during 2000-2017, and 2nd-dose coverage increased from 30% to 45% during 2009-2017. Approximately 232.5 million children were vaccinated with MCV during 2005-2018 vaccination campaigns. Despite these efforts, MCV coverage remained well below the recommended level of 95%, and measles incidence increased during 2010-2018.

What are the implications for public health practice?
To achieve measles elimination, efforts are needed to increase 2-dose vaccine coverage, reach communities not accessing immunization services, and increase measles surveillance sensitivity.

To advance progress toward measles elimination in Pakistan, there is a need to raise the visibility of measles elimination efforts, including the benefits of achieving measles elimination. Without jeopardizing the focused efforts to interrupt poliovirus transmission, transitioning the substantial polio infrastructure and resources should be carefully managed to support measles elimination and broader EMR vaccination goals."

This report was pre-COVID; consequently, the impact of COVID is not reflected in the numbers. If the measles vaccination campaign could piggyback on the polio immunization program, that would be highly efficient and effective. During COVID, the UAE-Pakistan Assistance Program campaign managed to reach out to some 16 million children and provided over 52 515 000 doses [of polio vaccine] since July 2020 (https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/uae-pap-administers-508-mn-doses-polio-vaccine-over-86-mn-children-pakistan-7-years). If measles vaccination could be given at the same time as polio, that would greatly facilitate measles control. - Mod.LK
