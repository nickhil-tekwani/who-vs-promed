A suggestion for conservation of [rabies] vaccine
-------------------------------------------------
It is painful to know that so many persons especially children are
dying for want of anti rabies vaccine in Indonesia.

I wish to request that Indonesian health authorities switch to the
intradermal (ID) method of administration of anti rabies vaccine [in
place of] intramuscular [IM] method as this would save vaccine to the
tune of 5 times and would end vaccine shortages.

As we all know the ID dose is 5 times less than the IM dose if the
vaccine is 1 ml, and 2.5 times if the vaccine vial contains 0.5 ml,
so 2.5 to 5 times more persons can be vaccinated by the ID method
than the IM method from a single vial. The same vaccine can be used
by both the ID or IM method, the only [difference being the lesser]
dose by the ID method.

I hope the Indonesian authorities will immediately shift to the WHO
approved ID method so that more people are able to get the vaccine
with the given limited stock. I volunteer to give more details as I
am running an intradermal clinic in this hill town of India [Shimla].

[ProMED-mail hopes that the Indonesia healthcare authorities will
take note of Dr Omesh Kumar Bharti's comment and act accordingly.

The WHO Guide for Rabies Pre- and Post-exposure Prophylaxis in Humans
is available at
<http://www.who.int/rabies/PEP_prophylaxis_guidelines_June10.pdf>.

The WHO guide on preventive immunizations against rabies is aimed to
ensure that effective and potent treatment is provided, even where
vaccines are in very short supply -- as is the case in many
developing countries. Alternatively, more economical vaccination
approaches have been successful in developing countries where funding
for vaccines and vaccine supplies are limited. Health staff must be
well trained in techniques and vaccines must be stored appropriately
for effectiveness.
