[The 1st new outbreak of FMDV type O occurred in Mongolia on 26 Aug 2010 in
the Sukhbaatar aimag (province), eastern Mongolia, reportedly affecting
sheep and/or goats. On 02 Sep 2010 it was reported in cattle in Dornod
aimag and on 7 Nov 2010 the virus spread to a 3rd province, Khentii,
similarly affecting cattle (see "Mongolia" in archived 20101119.4186].
According to the current follow-up report, the virus has now continued its
spread westwards, infecting 2 additional aimags: Tuv and Govi-Sumber, thus
currently circulating in 5 out of Mongolia's 21 aimags (see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mongolia_aimags_2007.png>).

It would be useful if the follow-up report included epidemiological
information on the situation of the disease spreading in spite of the mass
vaccination, explaining the reason for the application of stamping out
policy combined with mass vaccination. Information on the vaccine used
would help as well. Subscribers are referred to additional commentary on
the Mongolian FMD epizootic in archived 20101116.4155.

A genotyping report of 2010 isolates from Mongolia (batch
WRLFMD/2010/00033) is currently available online. It includes the
respective genotyping results of 8 strains collected from cattle in Sep
2010, of which 6 from the province Dornod and 2 from Sukhbaatar. All were
found to be FMDV-O, Topotype SEA, Strain Mya-98 (similar to 2010 strains
from Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, Japan and Russia). For each isolate,
10 "most Closely Related Viruses" and 10 "Most Closely Related Reference
Viruses" are tabled. The report includes also a dendogram (graphical
phylogeny reconstruction) comparing the 8 said isolates with other isolates
of similar strain and topotype. The report, dated 26 Oct 2010 (but
published, following confirmation, mid-November), is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-00033%20O%20Mongolia%202010.pdf>.
