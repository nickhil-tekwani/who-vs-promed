["Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is considered to be a disease caused by infection with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV, synonym: Egtved virus).

VHS is a disease of farmed rainbow trout, farmed turbot, farmed Japanese flounder as well as a broad range of wild freshwater and marine species caused by VHSV, a virus belonging to the genus _Novirhabdovirus, within the family _Rhabdoviridae_.

Diseased fish may display nonspecific clinical signs in the early stages of infection, including rapid onset of mortality (which can reach up to 100 percent in fry), lethargy, darkening of the skin, exophthalmia, anaemia (pale gills), haemorrhages at the base of the fins, gills, eyes and skin, and a distended abdomen due to oedema in the peritoneal cavity. In the chronic state of infection, affected fish do not in general exhibit external signs. VHS can also occur in a nervous form, characterized by severe abnormal swimming behavior, such as constant flashing and/or spiraling". http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_vhs.htm. - Mod.CRD
