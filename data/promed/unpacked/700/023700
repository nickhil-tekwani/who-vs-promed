[Human cases of avian (H5N1) influenza have continued to accumulate
in Egypt, but contrary to elsewhere there have been few fatalities. 4
deaths among the 39 confirmed cases were reported during 2009 (10.3
percent). In contrast 19 of the 20 cases of avian influenza (95
percent) reported in Indonesia during 2009 (95 percent) died. Overall
since the beginning of the outbreak in 2003, 282 of 467 confirmed
cases (60.4 percent) have died (see the WHO data available at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_12_30/en/index.html>).

It is likely the prompt treatment with Tamiflu has been an important
factor aiding the recovery of Egyptian patients, rather than
difference in the virulence of the pathogen, although this has yet to
be established. Contact with infected domestic fowl has been a common
factor in the acquisition of infection in Egypt.
