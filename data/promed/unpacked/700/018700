----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the spring of 2006, the main Syrian citrus-growing areas of
Lattakia and Tartous were surveyed to assess the presence of _Citrus
tristeza virus_ (CTV). 8 nurseries (approximately 130 plants per
nursery), 2 budwood source fields (approximately 230 trees per
field), and 19 groves (approximately 60 trees per grove) containing
the main citrus varieties were visually inspected and sampled for
serological assays. Infected samples were [found in] 2/8 nurseries,
2/2 budwood source fields, and 6/19 groves.

Stems and leaf petioles from nursery trees, and flower explants from
the groves, were collected and analyzed for CTV by direct tissue blot
immunoassay (DTBIA). Of 2653 samples tested, 89 (4 percent)
CTV-infected plants were detected. 5 citrus varieties were found
to be infected and Meyer lemon (_Citrus limon_ 'Meyer') had the
highest incidence at 16 percent. Numerous sweet orange varieties
(_Citrus sinensis_ L.) were found to be highly infected in the field,
but only the Washington navel sweet orange was found to be infected
in the nurseries. No clear CTV symptoms were observed during the
survey.

Samples that were positive for CTV by DTBIA were also positive by
biological indexing on Mexican lime (_C. aurantifolia_) [widely used
as a biological indicator species for CTV - Mod.DHA] and
immunocapture-reverse transcription-PCR [polymerase chain reaction].
Coat protein gene sequences obtained from 5 selected clones of a
Syrian CTV isolate showed more than 99 and 98 percent nucleotide
sequence identity to a Jordanian CTV isolate and the VT isolate
[seedling yellows, Israel], respectively. Almost all infected samples
induced moderate vein clearing symptoms when grafted to Mexican lime.
Symptoms of vein clearing, leaf cupping, stunting, and stem pitting
on Mexican lime were induced by graft transmission of CTV from one
Valencia sample from the Tartous area.

The viral inoculum is widely and randomly distributed in commercial
groves, especially in the southern Tartous area and in some
nurseries. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CTV in Syria.
However, CTV was reported from the neighboring citrus-growing
countries of Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan, and the severe seedling
yellows strain is present in this area, which poses a potential
threat to Syrian citriculture.

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered
to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses. It is killing
millions of trees every year worldwide and appears to be spreading
wherever citrus is grown. CTV causes severe leaf and bark symptoms,
such as yellowing and stem pitting, as well as dieback and stunting
on a number of citrus species. The virus is spread by several aphid
species and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means.
CTV has been included on the alert lists of the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Different strains of CTV may vary in severity, and symptoms also
depend on the citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination.
Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline,
stem pitting, and a mild type, and may occur singly or in
combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk
even in CTV-affected areas. Disease management includes clean
planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum, and vector
control. For more information on CTV please see previous ProMED-mail
posts and links listed below.
