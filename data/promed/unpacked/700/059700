INFECTION CONTROL - NEW YORK, USA (2)
=====================================
Date: Sat, 01 Jun 1996 06:29:01 -0400
From: holzman <holzmr01@MCRCR6.MED.NYU.EDU>

I represent the infection control team at Bellevue and myself as at least
one of the faculty at NYU Med School.
Most of the resistant bugs reported out of NNIS are present. Nothing new or
dramatic in recent months though.
