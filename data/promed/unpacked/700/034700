Scientists discover origin of a cancer in Tasmanian devils
----------------------------------------------------------
The Tasmanian devil, the spaniel-size marsupial found on the
Australian island of Tasmania, has been hurtling toward extinction in
recent years, the victim of a bizarre and mysterious facial cancer
that spreads like a plague.

Now Australian scientists say they have discovered how the cancer
originated. The finding, being reported Friday [1 Jan 2010] in the
journal Science [abstract reproduced below], sheds light on how
cancer cells can sometimes liberate themselves from the hosts where
they first emerged. On a more practical level, it also opens the door
to devising vaccines that could save the Tasmanian devils.

"It is a great paper," said Katherine Belov, a geneticist at the
University of Sydney who was not involved in the study. "Previously,
we were stumbling in the dark."

The cancer, devil's facial tumor disease, is transmitted when the
animals bite one another's faces during fights. It grows rapidly,
choking off the animal's mouth and spreading to other organs. The
disease has wiped out 60 percent of all Tasmanian devils since it was
first observed in 1996, and some ecologists predict that it could
obliterate the entire wild population within 35 years.

When the tumor disease was discovered, many scientists assumed that
it was caused by a rapidly spreading virus. Viruses cause 15 percent
of all cancers in humans and are also widespread in animals.

But subsequent studies failed to turn up a virus. Instead, Anne-Maree
Pearse and Kate Swift, of the Department of Primary Industries, Water
and Environment in Tasmania, discovered something strange about the
tumor cells. The chromosomes looked less like those in the animal's
normal cells and more like those in the tumors growing in other
Tasmanian devils.

In 2007, Dr Belov and her colleagues compared DNA from 26 sick and
healthy Tasmanian devils with DNA from the tumors. They found that
cancer cells from different animals shared distinctive genetic
markers not found in the animals themselves.

A team of Australian and American scientists has now followed up on
Dr Belov's study, using more powerful gene-sequencing technology to
take a closer look at a larger number of Tasmanian devils. To trace
the origin of the tumors, the scientists looked at individual cancer
cells, recording which genes were active. They found a set of genes
normally active only in a type of nerve cell known as Schwann cells.
They argue that a single Schwann cell in a single animal was the
progenitor of all the devil facial tumor disease cells.

"The lack of genetic variation suggests that the tumors are young,"
said a co-author of the study, Tony Pappenfuss, a bioinformatician at
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia.

Scientists have found only one other case in which cancer cells
naturally spread like parasites, a disease in dogs known as canine
transmissible venereal tumor. Comparisons of tumors collected from
dogs around the world indicate that they descend from a single
ancestral cell that existed several thousand years ago. Ever since,
the tumor cells have evolved to move among hosts and avoid their
immune systems.

Infectious cancer poses a puzzle for biologists. "It is somehow a new
organism," Dr Pappenfuss said. "I think of it as a parasite."

Dr Pappenfuss and his colleagues are now studying how the tumor cells
have evolved from Schwann cells into such successful parasites. Their
research may help in the development of a vaccine that could prime
Tasmanian devils to fight invading cancer cells.

The Tasmanian devil, a marsupial carnivore, is endangered because of
the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumor
disease (DFTD). This fatal cancer is clonally derived and is an
allograft transmitted between devils by biting. We performed a
large-scale genetic analysis of DFTD with microsatellite genotyping,
a mitochondrial genome analysis, and deep sequencing of the DFTD
transcriptome and microRNAs. These studies confirm that DFTD is a
monophyletic clonally transmissible tumor and suggest that the
disease is of Schwann cell origin. On the basis of these results, we
have generated a diagnostic marker for DFTD and identify a suite of
genes relevant to DFTD pathology and transmission. We provide a
genomic data set for the Tasmanian devil that is applicable to cancer
diagnosis, disease evolution, and conservation biology.]

[The transmissible agent causing canine transmissible venereal tumor
(CTVT) is thought to be the tumor cell itself. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate that CTVT most likely originated from a wolf or an East
Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. The CTVT
down-modulates MHC antigen expression, suggesting one route whereby a
somatic cell may evolve into a transmissible parasite (Murgia C,
Pritchard JK, Kim SY, Fassati A, Weiss RA: Clonal origin and
evolution of a transmissible cancer. Cell. 2006 Aug 11;
126(3):477-87, available at

[From 1996 until 2010 is already 14 years and thus 60 percent of the
population has vanished. At its present rate, it seems there are less
than the 35 years from 1996 before the fascinating creature, the
Tasmanian devil, will disappear from the earth. Let us hope this new
breakthrough of an oncogenic parasite discovery provides a rapid
vaccine for the protection of these animals. - Mod.TG]
