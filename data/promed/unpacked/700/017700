Decatur County Deer Confirmed Positive For Chronic Wasting Disease:
CWD contingency plan includes further sampling
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 white-tailed deer taken by hunters in Decatur County
have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), according to
the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP).

Dr. Ruby Mosher, KDWP's wildlife disease coordinator, said the
initial screening tests performed by Kansas State Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory have been confirmed by the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. All 3 deer were taken by hunters
along Sappa Creek in central Decatur County, north of Oberlin, KS,
which is in the northwest corner of the state.

Testing is still to be completed on approximately 2-3rds of the
samples collected by KDWP for testing. The samples from northwestern
Kansas are given priority since they are from deer that have a higher
known risk of being exposed to CWD than those in the rest of the
state. As results are returned over the next 6 to 8 weeks, regular
updates will be posted on the KDWP website here.

CWD has been detected twice previously in Kansas. The 1st case was in
2001 in a captive elk herd in Harper County. The other occurred
during the 2005 hunting season in a wild whitetail doe harvested in
Cheyenne County.

Last month [December 2007], the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission
reported a CWD-positive deer from an area just a few miles north of
Decatur County, in Red Willow County, Nebraska. Wildlife biologists
from Kansas and Nebraska plan to sample more deer in the vicinity in
February [2008] to help determine the prevalence of the disease in the area.

Tissue samples from more than 2200 deer taken by hunters during the
most recent Kansas hunting season have been submitted for lab
analysis. The 3 affected deer from Decatur County were among those
samples, and the hunters who shot those deer have been notified. KDWP
biologists have conducted annual sampling of hunter-harvested and
road-killed deer since 1996.

Although research is underway, there is currently no vaccine or other
biological method of preventing CWD. The only tool is to prevent the
spread of CWD to new areas, because once the infective particle (an
abnormal prion) is deposited into the environment -- either through
an infected carcass or from a live animal -- it may exist for a
decade or more, capable of infecting a healthy deer.

Despite the recent occurrences, the likelihood of finding CWD in a
wild deer harvested in Kansas is small. That small likelihood
decreases even more the farther from northwestern Kansas the deer
lived. In recent years, numerous cases of CWD have been documented in
neighboring areas of Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming.

While CWD is fatal to infected deer and elk, humans have never been
known to contract the disease. CWD is a member of the group of
diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
Other diseases in this group include scrapie in sheep and goats,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) in cattle,
and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people.

CWD is a progressive, fatal disease that results in small holes
developing in the brain, giving it a sponge-like appearance under the
microscope. Decreased brain function causes the animal to display
neurological symptoms such as depression, droopy head, staggering,
loss of appetite, and a lack of response to man. The continuing
deterioration of the brain leads to other symptoms such as weight
loss, drooling, and excessive thirst. Caution is advised because of
unknown factors associated with prion diseases, but no human health
risks have been discovered where CWD occurs.

The signs of CWD include loss of body weight, stumbling, holding the
head at an odd angle, circling, non-responsiveness to people, and
pneumonia. Any sick deer or elk should be reported it to the nearest
KDWP office or the Emporia Research Office, help protect the health
of the Kansas deer herd by taking the following steps to avoid
accidentally introducing CWD to a new area in Kansas:
-- do not transport deer carcasses far from the area where the deer
lived, especially from areas where CWD has been detected, such as
northwestern Kansas; and
-- if a carcass is transported, the hunter should make sure that
carcass waste is not dumped into the environment where local deer or
elk can come into contact with it. Carcass waste can be disposed of
by double-bagging it and taking it to a landfill.

The Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance maintains an online
clearinghouse of information about the disease
(<http://www.cwd-info.org>). More information is also available on
the KDWP website. Enter "CWD" in the search box at the KDWP website:

office (620/672-5911) for more information.
