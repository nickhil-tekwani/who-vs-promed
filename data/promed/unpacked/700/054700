----------------------------------------------------------------------
[I would like to respond to the comment made by Prof. Martin Hugh-Jones, regarding the topic "Antibiotic resistance - USA: vancomycin, crow"]

Thank you for your very important comment. You are right that the prevalence of VRE [vancomycin resistant enterococci] in crow feces in our study is not very high and we can be really glad about it. But it is important to note the differences between localities. In California we didn't find any VRE (from almost 200 samples), but in Massachusetts 13 crows (from 200) were colonized by VRE, and some of them with more than one isolate; so we obtained 19 different vanA-carrying enterococci from this sampling site. I believe that this is not just coincidence and normal genetic wobbling.

Is 3 per cent antibiotic resistance in any large collection from wildlife normal? From my experience in VRE research it is not. We sampled many sources (more than 2000 samples from wildlife in Europe) in which we didn't find any vanA-carrying VRE. Also, in a study in Canada (still unpublished) we found only one _E. faecium_ carrying vanA (from almost 450 samples of crow feces), so the prevalence was just 0.2 per cent. Similarly, Lanthier et al (2010, 2011) conducted 2 studies in North America, where they tested 1460 and 1558 enterococci strains (from wastewater, river, domesticated animals and wildlife) and none of them carried the vanA gene. Dr Zurek has not detected a single strain of vancomycin resistant _E. faecalis_ or _E. faecium_ from the food animal environment (swine, cattle, and bison) and associated insects in the USA over the past 10 years. And he analyzed hundreds of samples from different states (such as, Ahmad et al, 2011; Amachawadi et al, 2010; Anderson et al, 2008; Larson et al, 2008). So I think the vanA gene does not occur normally in wildlife. I agree with the fact that resistance to vancomycin can occur normally in some strains of _Enterococcus_ (_E. casseliflavus_, _E. gallinarum_, _E. flavescens_), but this is encoded by the vanC gene, carried on the chromosome and causing just low level resistance.

Further, it is not only about the vancomycin resistance in these strains, but also the multiresistance of the isolates to several other important antibiotics used for treatment of serious human infections. The isolates also carried very important virulence factors and belonged to clinically important sequence types previously found in pathogenic isolates from humans (Freitas et al, 2013; Klare et al, 2005; Lopez et al, 2012). That means that isolates like these are often responsible for serious nosocomial infections, and are found in hospitals. These observations, taken together, strongly suggest that the VRE we detected in crows comes from a human source.

[Veronika Oravcova raises some very interesting points. The great differentiator for us was penicillin, because many diagnostic labs use penicillin resistance to differentiate _Bacillus cereus_ from _B. anthracis_, and it was therefore a detection bias; this was why we found 3 per cent resistant in North America and 6 percent resistant elsewhere, especially in Asia. And few vets treat anthrax cases with penicillin if only because the patients are frequently presented dead.

Something I think one needs to keep in mind is that crows are mob-scavengers. So what you may sometimes be seeing is faeces from 10 crows out of say 13 that had been feeding at one place and 3/10 show up resistant. With antibiotics and drugs in US sewage and wastewater all too common, thus raising the potential for an area "downstream" of, say a hospital, being a hotspot for resistances; and reflect genetic selection. Thus, if these sites and others are available to crows for bathing and drinking, you then have a direct access and a raised probability of resistances (plural) emerging. Whereas roadkill-scavenging crow samples on country roads might be negative. You might think of getting the GPS co-ordinates for your samples and see if there is any spatial clustering pattern. It is important to map all possible samples, not just the positives. You may well be right in suspecting hospitals as resistance gene generators. But if you map your samples you could then set up selection criteria for sets distant from suspect generator sites, such as hospitals, clinics, feedlots, and then see what you find.

I think we have to appreciate that any mutations, random or otherwise, have to carry some immediate benefit or else they cannot compete and survive. My Russian colleagues, from their work on the Soviet Biopreparat biological weapons programs, found that generating specific resistant _B. anthracis_ strains was relatively straightforward. They got it up to some 10-12 antibiotic strains. The problem was that they were not stable and it was a job to maintain their viability. Are your strains stable or just recent emergents? - Mod.MHJ]
