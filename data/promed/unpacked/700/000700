A Correction
------------
With regard to the information contained in the Yahoo News report posted on
the ProMED website (see: Ebola, lab accident death - Russia (Siberia) (02)
20040525.1402), there is one significant error concerning the referral of
information to Russian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation
(WHO).
The report states that: "She [Natalia Skultetskaya, Press Secretary for the
Vector State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology] said the case
was reported immediately to both the Russian Health Ministry and the WHO".
In fact, we kept the Russian Ministry of Health informed about the
development of the situation daily from the day of the accident. And we had
hoped that the disease would not develop. WHO was informed on Mon 17 May
2004 after confirmation of the diagnosis.
I apologize for this mistake which is, probably, the result of
misinterpretation or mistaken translation of the information I presented.
