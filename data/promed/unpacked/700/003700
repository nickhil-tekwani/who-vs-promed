Yemen: Cholera outbreak situation report
----------------------------------------
Key figures
-----------
- As of 11 Jan 2017, 15 658 suspected cholera cases have been reported in 156 districts.
- A total of 180 out of 841 cases have tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_, serotype Ogawa.
- Overall, the epidemic curve shows a declining trend from week 51 [18 to 24 Dec 2016] onwards, while the attack rate remains high in some high risk districts.
- Health response is underway through 26 Diarrhea Treatment Centres (DTC) in 24 districts; while WASH [Water, Sanitation and Hygiene] partners are undertaking response in 29 districts.
- An additional USD 3 million is being allocated through the 2017 HPF [Humanitarian Pooled Fund] reserve allocation to address outstanding gaps.

Situation overview
------------------
- The cholera/acute watery diarrhea (AWD) epidemic curve shows a declining trend of incidences from week 51 onwards (18 to 24 Dec 2016). The downward trend is occurring in most affected districts, while in some the outbreak is stabilizing. Similarly, the case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6 percent has been declining steadily since week 41 of 2016 (9 to 15 Oct 2016), when it peaked at 8.6 percent.

- As of 11 Jan 2017, a total of 15 658 suspected cholera/AWD cases were reported from 157 districts in 15 governorates: Al Hudaydah (23 percent), Taiz (14.7 percent), Aden (10.2 percent), Ibb (9.5 percent), Al Bayda (8.9 percent), Al Dhale'e (8.2 percent), Hajjah (7.1 percent), Sana'a (6.7 percent), Lahj (5.2 percent), Raymah (3.7 percent), Amanat Al Asimah (1.6 percent), and 1.3 percent from Abyan, Dhamar, Amran, Al Jawf governorates. An estimated 34 percent of the total suspected cholera/AWD cases are children below five years of age. Cumulatively, 180 (21 percent) of the samples from 46 districts tested positive for _V. cholerae_, serotype Ogawa.

- A total of 99 deaths associated with cholera/AWD have been reported from Aden, Abyan, Al Bayda, Dhamar, Al Dhale'e, Al Hudaydah, Amanat Al Asimah, Hajjah, Ibb, Sana'a, and Taizz, of which 11 deaths in Aden, Amran, Hajjah, Raymah, Ibb and Sana'a have been confirmed by laboratory to be cholera. The cumulative cholera case fatality rate (CFR) as of 11 Jan is 0.6 percent.

- The attack rate as of 11 Jan 2017 is 6.7 per 10 000 of population compared to 6 per 10 000 of population as of 31 Dec 2016. The high risk districts based on the attack rate and number of cholera/AWD cases are Mukayras in Al Bayda (187 per 10 000); Al Hali in Al Hudaydah (96 per 10 000); Sa'fan in Sana'a (92 per 10 000); Al Mahabishah in Hajjah (90 per 10 000); and Al Husha in Al Dhale'e (55 per 10 000). The high attack rate indicates the need to scale up response in these priority districts.

- More than 20 months of conflict has caused the collapse of basic services and institutions. Only 45 percent of health facilities are functioning, and even these face severe shortages in medicines, equipment, and staff. The lack of capacity, coupled with predisposing conditions such as population displacement, overcrowding and inadequate sanitation have contributed to the occurrence and spread of the cholera/AWD outbreak.

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Numbers are no doubt underreported and are likely to continue to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward with importations across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely, as well as eastward to Oman.

Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), which can be seen on the map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4790713,126. - Mod.LL]
