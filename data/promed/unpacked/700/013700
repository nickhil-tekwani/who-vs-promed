A fungus is threatening midwife toads in Majorca because of captive breeding.

An international team of scientists, with Spanish participation, has
confirmed that the fungus that causes chytridiomycosis reached
Majorca through a reintroduction programme for threatened amphibians
bred in captivity in England, and which were "apparently" healthy.
Four populations are currently affected on the island, but only one
has developed the disease, causing the death so far of one 10th of
Balearic midwife toads.

[The amphibian chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_)
lives on the skin of frogs, making it difficult for them to breathe
through their skin or adjust their body temperatures. If frogs are
infected with the disease, the signs may include movement in their
legs, especially the hind ones, and anemia. Species that are
nocturnal or live in trees sit out in the open throughout the day;
they show little movement or do not react or blink at all if touched
by humans, and when turned over, they cannot return to their original
positions.

Majorca, the largest island of Spain, is in the Mediterranean sea.
Its location may be viewed at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorca>. - Mod.TG]
