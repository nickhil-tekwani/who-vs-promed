[The Nepal Vet Services commendably applied immediate stamping out, the outbreak thus resolved. For its location, please refer to the interactive map at the source URL above.

The "birds" species affected is not specified; avian influenza virus has been shown to be able to infect various species of birds. The affected population in the outbreak above is, reportedly, "a commercial layer farm rearing dual purpose breed of different age group"; most probably, chickens (_Gallus gallus domesticus_). - Mod.AS
