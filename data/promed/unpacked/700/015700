Scarlet fever infections in the UK have continued to rise to the highest levels for more than 30 years. Between 24 and 30 Mar [2014] alone, 883 cases were confirmed. A total of 5012 new cases have now been reported since the season began in September 2013, compared with an average of 1420 cases reported for the same period in the previous 10 years.

The increases in scarlet fever have been seen across the UK. Whilst most cases of scarlet fever are mild and will resolve within a week, continued vigilance by healthcare professionals remains essential due to uncommon but possible complications.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, head of streptococcal infection surveillance at Public Health England [PHE], said: "We are continuing to see increases in scarlet fever notifications across England and are working closely with healthcare professionals to try and understand the reasons behind these increases and do our best to reduce the impact of this infection. PHE urges people with symptoms of scarlet fever, which include a sore throat, headache and fever accompanied by a characteristic rash, to consult their GP. Scarlet fever should be treated with antibiotics to reduce risk of complications. Once children or adults are diagnosed with scarlet fever, we strongly advise them to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection."

Scarlet fever is mainly a childhood disease and is most common between the ages of 2 and 8 years. It was once a very dangerous infection but has now become much less serious. There is currently no vaccine for scarlet fever.

Ongoing surveillance of scarlet fever notifications indicates continuing high levels of notifications in England, with recent weekly totals higher than any on record (weekly level records held since 1982) [1,2]. GP sentinel (syndromic) surveillance is similarly reporting increases in GP consultations for pharyngitis/scarlet fever compared with the same period last year [2013] [3]. Increases in scarlet fever have been seen across the United Kingdom [4]. Routine laboratory reports and isolate referrals have not shown any elevation of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease incidence.

Investigations are under way in an attempt to identify the reasons for the unusual escalation in scarlet fever, including microbiological investigation of strains causing scarlet fever. Letters have been sent to GPs, A&E departments, paediatricians, microbiologists and infectious disease specialists to inform them of the current situation. Guidelines to assist local health protection staff in managing outbreaks of scarlet fever are currently being drafted. Due to rare but potentially severe complications associated with GAS infections, continued vigilance is still recommended.

Routine monitoring of surveillance data for England shows that the number of cases have continued to rise, with week 13 having the highest total weekly scarlet fever notifications (883) so far this season; bringing the seasonal total to 5012 (week 37 of 2013 to week 13 of 2014; figure 1).

The median age of scarlet fever cases this season remains at 4 years (range under one year to 77 years old) with a near equal split between males and females (49 per cent males) overall (figure 2). Rates of infection in children ranged from 4.8 per 100 000 population in 10-14 year olds to 17.0 in 1-4 year olds. The rate of infection remains low in adults, less than one per 100 000 in all adult age groups, with only 317 (7 per cent) notifications received for people aged 15 or over.

Analysis of scarlet fever notifications over the last century suggests cyclical patterns of incidence, with resurgences occurring on average every 4 years [6]. The last peak year for scarlet fever was 2008-2009, with invasive disease tending to mirror superficial manifestations of GAS infection in some but not all years [7].

Clinicians, microbiologists, and health protection teams should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients, as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with iGAS infection can be life-saving. Invasive disease isolates and those from suspected clusters or outbreaks should be submitted to the Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit at Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5HT.

Relevant guidelines are available on the PHE health protection website as follows:

[The outbreak of scarlet fever continues throughout the UK, with weekly case tallies spiking after week 9 (24 Feb 2014 to 2 Mar 2014) above any weekly total on record (see figure 1 at the source URL for the 2nd article above). The outbreak is occurring throughout the UK. We await results of the ongoing microbiological investigation of strains that are causing this outbreak.

Microbial strain typing is a useful adjunct to clinical epidemiology. Phenotypic typing systems examine expressed characteristics, such as the serologic M protein typing system developed by Dr Rebecca Lancefield in 1928, whereas genotypic systems examine chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Group A streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_) strains are now commonly classified on the basis of sequence variation in the 5' end of the _emm_ gene. The 5' ends of the _emm_ gene are highly heterogeneous and encode for the serotype specificity used for the M-typing system. For most M serotypes, there is a one-for-one relationship with a unique _emm_ sequence type (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/2/99-0209_article.htm).

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains to see whether there is commonality among the outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948, http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192, http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911).
