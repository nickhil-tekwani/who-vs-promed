Ethiopia fights African horse sickness, more than 2000 equines dead
-------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 2000 horses have died in Ethiopia in an outbreak of African
horse sickness (AHS) that has entered its 6th month. Dr Berhe
Gebreegziabher, in his latest report to the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) on 19 Sep 2008, said there were still 15
outbreaks unresolved. "It is not possible to declare this event
resolved until these individual outbreaks are resolved," he said of
the disease, which is carried by midges. Across 15 villages, a total
of 4000 cases have been reported, of which 2185 have died. The report
says about 46 500 horses, mules, and donkeys are susceptible in the
outbreak, which began late in March [2008].

In the village of Didu, with 5000 horses, mules, and donkeys, 500
animals have so far been affected by the disease, of which half died.
In the village of Adile, 215 of the 250 equines which came down with
AHS have died. Similar numbers have been recorded in other villages,
such as Saylem, with 300 deaths from 500 cases; and Gawata, with 200
deaths from 300 cases. Bita Genet had 222 deaths from 500 cases.

Authorities have vaccinated nearly 24 000 horses in a bid to control
the outbreak.

The cases are confined to the western region of the country.

Epidemiological investigation is continuing.

Dr Gebreegziabher said previous outbreaks of the disease in Ethiopia
were due to serotypes 9 and 6. "The current outbreak has affected
equines vaccinated against serotype 9," he said.

African horse sickness is endemic in Africa but has spread north into
parts of Europe [in the past; the most recent introduction was caused
by serotype 4, which spread into Portugal and Spain, 1987-1990. -
Mod.AS]

[AHS virus] is closely related to the bluetongue virus that affects
sheep and cattle, and is also in Europe. Both are transmitted by
_Culicoides_ species midges. In some outbreaks up to 90 percent of
horses die.

Authorities in Britain fear an AHS outbreak on its shores, which would
have huge economic consequences for equine-related industries. Plans
are in place for the slaughter of infected animals, destruction of
the carcasses, and the establishment of a protection zone of at least
100 km (62 mi) radius around infected premises. This, together with a
surveillance zone of at least a further 50 km (31 mi), would likely
remain in force for at least 12 months. The scale of the zone is
because virus movement over long distances by wind-borne infected
midges is possible.

[The newswire above missed the most significant fact concerning the
current Ethiopian AHS epizootic, namely the (surprising) identity of
its causative agent. As reported by OIE's reference laboratory for
AHS, in Onderstepoort, South Africa, AHSV serotype 2 was identified
in August 2008 in samples received from Ethiopia. The laboratory is
carrying out investigations to see if there is a relationship between
the Ethiopian virus strain and the 2007 isolates of AHSV-2 from West
Africa, namely Senegal and Nigeria. Results of these investigations
are anticipated with great interest and some concern (see ProMED-mail
20080916.2898).

According to Ethiopia's official, immediate notification to the OIE,
dated 19 Sep 2008 (including map; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7362>),
the animals affected in the 19 outbreaks observed in the south-west
of this East African country (not far from Sudan's border) are
horses, mules, and donkeys. Previous outbreaks of the disease in
Ethiopia were due to serotypes 9 and 6. The report further indicated
that the current outbreak has affected equines vaccinated against
serotype 9. It is noteworthy that vaccination in response to the
outbreaks, involving 7416 animals in 3 districts, has been carried
out with a monovalent serotype 9 live vaccine. The application of
this serotype (to protect against serotype 2) is in need of
clarification, because (some) cross protection is known to exist between AHSV
serotypes 1 and 2; 3 and 7; 5 and 8; 6 and 9 [but not between 9 & 2 - Mod.JW].

Before the identification of AHSV-2 in West Africa in 2007, only AHSV
serotypes 9 and 4 were known to circulate there, occasionally
spreading into countries surrounding the Mediterranean. The recent
spread of AHS-2 into West Africa, followed by its current detection
in the East, is of epidemiological significance. Such development
would have been missed if samples had not been sent to the reference
laboratory.

The last paragraph in the newswire above, dealing with UK's fears,
should be read in the context of concerns raised by the UK equine
industry regarding the risk of AHS (an orbivirus) introduction. This
is in view of the extensive and rapid spread of BTV-8 [another
orbivirus] in Europe, including the UK, in 2008, and the proven
capacity of endemic _Culicoides_ species as vectors of [that] orbivirus.

The following lectures, given during a conference on Emerging Equine
Diseases, jointly held by the Thoroughbred Breeders Association and
The Horse Trust at Tattersalls, Newmarket on 23 Jun 2008, addressed
