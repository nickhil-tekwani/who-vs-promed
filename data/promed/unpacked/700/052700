Children hospitalized after disease outbreak
----------------------------------------------
10 children in the Torres Strait have been hospitalized after an
outbreak of a disease that can lead to severe kidney failure and
death. Cases of acute nephritis are not uncommon in indigenous
communities in northern Australia. The last major outbreak of the
disease in north Queensland was in 1993 when 100 children were
hospitalized and 2 died.
Acute nephritis is caused when skin sores become infected with
streptococcal bacteria. The Tropical Public Health Unit (TPHU) says
so far 10 children from 3 different islands in the Torres Strait are
being treated at the Thursday Island Hospital.
A spokeswoman says health staff are now examining children between
the ages of 2 and 12, and those with skin sores are being given
penicillin.

[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) occurs when certain
(so-called nephritogenic) strains of Group A streptococcus infect
humans, usually children. Unlike poststreptococcal rheumatic fever,
which is almost always related to streptococcal sore throats, as
indicated in the posting, PSGN is usually related to streptococal
skin infections such as impetigo.
The mechanism of injury to the kidney is thought to be from immune
complexes preformed by the combination of specific antibodies against
streptococcal antigens, localizing on the glomerular capillary wall
(the glomerulus is the major filtering site in the kidney) and
activating the immunologic system. This activation can result in
significant kidney damage and high blood pressure which usually, but
not always, resolves.
Only a few strains of streptococci produce AGN. Studies performed
approximately 50 years ago led to the identification of the few
strains of group A streptococci that are nephritogenic. Because of
this, recurrent episodes are quite uncommon so that, unlike in
rheumatic fever, prophylactic antimicrobials are not used.
At least 2 antigens isolated from nephritogenic streptococci, zymogen
(a precursor of exotoxin B) and glyceraldehyde phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), have been identified and are believed to be
capable of initiating the immunologic response. These fractions have
a particular affinity for the glomerulus and have been demonstrated
to induce an antibody response. This leads to the activation of a
number of proinflammatory mediator pathways in both infiltrating and
resident glomerular cells. - Mod.LL]
