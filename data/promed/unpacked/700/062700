RABIES EXPOSURE, TREATMENT REFUSED: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who has any experience in
mechanisms to require someone who's had a reasonable exposure to rabies to
take rabies treatment. We have a situation of a man who was bitten by a
skunk on Sept. 16 while trying to get it out of a pen where it had just
bitten one of four dogs. This week the dog which was bitten by the skunk
tested positive for rabies, and the man is refusing treatment for either
the skunk bite or his contact with his rabid dog.
[My guess is either a court order or commit the individual for psychiatric
treatment as there seems to be no question of exposure. I just wonder
about who will pay the intensive care bill when the time comes since this
individual fought the recommendations of public health officials. Would
anyone care to provide us with a short answer to this question and a short
description of the limitations of public health officials in terms of
compliance. - Mod. PC]
