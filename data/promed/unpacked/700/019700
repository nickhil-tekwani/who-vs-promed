Man's death tied to Mad Cow Disease
------------------------------------
A Norwegian man who died last week at Aker Hospital in Oslo "most probably"
was suffering from the human form of mad cow disease or new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD or vCJD). Doctors believe he was infected
while traveling overseas. The doctors claim there are no grounds for panic
since mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE) has never
been detected in Norwegian meat. The chance of infection, they say, is very
low.
The man, thought to be Norway's first victim of the disease plaguing
Britain and France, was kept in isolation and the strongest
infection-control measures were put in place.
Doctors at Aker Hospital decline to reveal many details of the case but
it's believed the man was in his mid-50s and had been ill for at least
half-a-year. He traveled frequently abroad and may have eaten contaminated
meat while overseas.

French worries about BSE grew as schools in Paris banned beef from their
cafeterias and 3 cases of suspect variant Creutzfelt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD
or vCJD) surfaced in Brittany. An investigation is underway to determine if
these cases are nvCJD, which is linked to BSE.
Schools in 4 of the city's 20 districts have stopped serving beef until
further notice. It is uncertain how many other districts will follow suit.

Food agency urges mass screening of sheep for BSE
----------------------------------------------------
A mass screening campaign to determine whether BSE has spread to some of
Britain's 40 million sheep should be carried out with "great urgency", the
Food Standards Agency said. The agency said the presence of scrapie - a
strikingly similar brain disease [similar to BSE - in up to 10 000 sheep a
year could be "masking" the presence of the cattle plague. BSE has been
linked to the deaths of 81 people from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD). While BSE has been passed to sheep under laboratory
conditions it has never been found to have occurred naturally. But agency
experts are worried because so few tests have been carried out. "As a
matter of great urgency there is a need to develop and apply a rapid
screening method so large numbers of sheep can be tested," the agency said
in a review of BSE controls.
The agency supported a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
scheme to eliminate the BSE and scrapie family of disease from sheep
through selective breeding programs but expressed concern this would take
10 years or more to complete. It called for the project to be speeded up
and for contingency plans to protect the public and the industry in the
event of naturally occurring BSE being found in sheep.
The agency said sheep would have to be withdrawn totally from the market if
BSE was found in them because trials had shown the BSE agent penetrated
more parts of the [sheep body than it did in cattle. This would make the
precaution of removing and destroying specified high-risk materials
ineffective. The report also called for a total ban on feeding animal
products to farm animals.
The report urged tougher tests to determine the safety of sheep intestines
used in sausage casings and to find out whether the BSE agent could be
transmitted in milk. It also called for the use of more efficient tests to
find traces of BSE in mechanically recovered meat.
The spokesperson said consumers should be given clear information to enable
them to choose whether to eat British or foreign meat.
