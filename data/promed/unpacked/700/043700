Pursuant to ProMED post 20120221.1048240, we wish to add clarity to the current situation with regard to respiratory syncytial virus in the United States.

On 1 Feb 2012, the Black Canyon Infectious Disease Forecasting Station reported unusual activity of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in Delta County, Colorado. Infection (pneumonia) involving multiple members of the same family and multiple healthcare workers in the same pediatric clinic were noted. [1]

Cross-check with pediatric emergency and critical care physicians in other parts of the country indicated similar experiences. On 5 Feb 2012, we were notified of pediatricians testing all admissions for hMPV in Indiana [2], with additional reports received from Rhode Island, Chicago, and Dallas. [3]

On 18 Feb 2012, the Black Canyon Infectious Disease Forecasting Station issued a warning to our healthcare provider community for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) activity, with notation of sudden inundation of our medical infrastructure and older children (2-2.5 year olds) tending to be affected with higher than expected clinical severity. It was noted we were breaking 5-year records for the number of intubated transfers that had been done. We were concerned about possible overlap of prior/ongoing hMPV activity as a possible source of coinfection with RSV.

We discovered RSV coinfection was at least a partial cause of the unusual clinical severity. Again conferring with pediatric emergency and critical care colleagues nationwide revealed an apparent high rate of RSV coinfection with other pathogens such as hMPV, adenovirus, _H. influenzae_, _Moraxella_, and (rarely) influenza. [4]

For our hospital, it was noted this event, which remains ongoing, has caused more disruption than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It remains a curiosity why no vaccine exists yet for this important pathogen. [This is partly a consequence of difficulty in assessing attenuation in candidate vaccines intended for use in infants, the population at risk. - Mod.CP].

What facilitated rapid recognition of this unusual and unexpected infectious disease activity was the provision of comprehensive operational forecasts for nearly 100 infectious diseases by the Black Canyon Infectious Disease Forecasting Station, located in the Western Slope, Colorado. This station's capabilities were developed thanks to the collaborative efforts of local public health, human, veterinary, and wildlife health practitioners within a "One Health" model. This capability is the 1st National Weather Service-inspired operational infectious disease forecasting station in US history to our knowledge. Forecasts issued by the station are specific to the county in a manner similar to those issued for the local weather (and appear as a high-level public version in our local newspaper along with the weather). [5] Forecasts for hMPV and RSV activity were issued 60 days prior to these events, which directly contributed to rapid recognition of these clinical patterns and the subsequent prompting of dialog among other physicians nationwide.

The quick discovery of this pattern led to rapid changes in proactive clinical management in an effort to mitigate the need to transfer patients from our rural area to urban medical facilities already on transient near-diversion status. Rapid institution of strict isolation, "no visitor" policies, and antibiotic prophylaxis has thus far reduced the number of transfers to zero. This was also an overall cost reduction by mitigating the need for transfers. We certainly hope this remains the case.

Clearly, better understanding of the clinical significance of variation in circulating strains of RSV is needed, with specific emphasis on genetic factors that contribute to coinfection rates. As noted in the above references, we are certainly "at risk" thanks to the proliferation of molecular diagnostics in hospital laboratories, where prior ignorance was bliss; in a matter of a few short years, clinicians are actually discussing human metapneumovirus and paying attention to coinfection rates with RSV at the level of clinical care. Thus, it is difficult to ascertain how "different" these patterns are beyond comparison to internal hospital statistics.

Lastly, we note there was no warning provided by any state or federal public health organization. We were not provided warning via any disease surveillance-specific social media capability. Warning in this case was facilitated by use of an operational forecasting system coupled to astute clinicians functioning within a social network of trust.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to James Wilson on 2 counts. Firstly for his lucid account of the Black Canyon Infectious Disease Forecasting Station and its role in providing an operational forecasting system for the local and general community, exploiting the "One Health" philosophy.

Secondly, his surveillance activities have revealed that the clinical severity of the current seasonal outbreak of RSV infection in the USA may at least in part be a consequence of co-infection with other respiratory tract pathogens, of which the most important appears to be human metapneumovirus, and only rarely influenza virus. - Mod.CP
