Almost 90 cases of leishmaniasis have been registered in Georgia
since the beginning of 2007.
Shota Tzanava, the deputy chief of the National center for diseases
control and medical statistics reported that "in total this year
[2007], almost 90 cases of leishmaniasis have been registered in
Georgia, including 45 cases in Tbilisi [the capital of Georgia]. He
also noted that this year, when compared to last year [2006], the
numbers of leishmaniasis cases have increased, but they have not
reached epidemic levels.
174 cases of leishmaniasis were registered in Georgia in 2006,
including 103 cases in Tbilisi. According to the experts, the most
dangerous territories for leishmaniasis are the central districts of
Tbilisi: Vake, Vera and Mtatzminda.
The symptoms of leishmaniasis are anemia, fever, general weakness,
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

[Only one to 5 cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were recorded
annually before 1995, and it can only be speculated as to whether the
current increase is due to increased awareness and surveillance or
whether it is indeed a real increase in the numbers of cases.
Please refer to the moderator's note in the previous posting on VL in
Georgia from 30 May 2005 in which we referred to the records of the
National Center for Disease Control (Georgia)
<http://www.ncdc.ge/>.
However, the website is now only available in the Georgian language,
and the Epidemiology Bulletin, where the statistics were published,
is not available on-line after June 2004. The website of the Ministry
of Labor, Health and Social Affairs
<http://www.molhsa.ge/eng/index.php>
contains no statistical information, and the centralized information
system for infectious diseases (CISID) of the WHO European Region
<http://data.euro.who.int/cisid>
does not include data on leishmaniasis. - Mod.EP]
