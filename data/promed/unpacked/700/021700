[1] Haiti: PAHO report
Date: Fri 3 Jun 2011

report [edited]

The situation in Port-au-Prince continues to deteriorate. Most of the
contacted cholera treatment centers (CTCs) report that they are at
full capacity, and continue to receive new patients through the day.
There is no detailed tracking of the amount of patients seen. An
estimate of 1300 patients is currently admitted in CTCs and CTUs
[cholera treatment units] in Port-au-Prince operating at full
capacity. As of 29 May 2011, MSPP [Ministry of Public Health and
Population] reports 321 066 cases seen since the beginning of the
outbreak, including 5337 deaths.

CCCM [Camp Coordination and Camp Management] and PAHO/WHO will
develop a strategy on how to keep track of oral rehydration points
(ORP) in the camps given the small number of camp managers currently
working in the city. A system has been put in place with the team of
camp managers to alert PAHO/WHO directly whenever they note cholera or
other health related issues in the camps.

National authorities, partners, and PAHO/WHO remain vigilant to
coordinate prevention and response activities to mitigate the further
spread of the disease.

[2] Haiti: MSF report
Date: Fri 3 Jun 2011

The Haitian cholera epidemic is far from over. A sharp increase in
cases has been seen in the capital and outbreaks have been reported
elsewhere in the country.

Although the cholera epidemic in Haiti began to decline in February
2011, it has not yet ended. In MSF cholera treatment centers (CTCs) in
Port-au-Prince, teams have, in fact, seen an increase in cases since
mid-May 2011.

MSF had to reopen emergency CTCs to prevent existing treatment
centres in Carrefour, Delmas, Martissant, Cite Soleil, and Drouillard
from being overwhelmed.

"Since 29 May 2011, in one week, MSF has treated almost 2000 patients
in the capital, and we have also been asked to intervene in other
areas in the interior of the country," said MSF head of mission Romain
Gitenet. "Workload should be shared and coordinated in order to
increase cholera treatment capacity in Haiti. Too many public
facilities are still inadequate."

It is essential that the authorities and their humanitarian partners
mobilize to stop the spread of the disease by strengthening the
national surveillance system and treatment facilities. Immediate
improvements in hygiene, sanitation, and drinking water supply should
be a national priority, in order to protect the most vulnerable
people.

But for Gitenet, "vigilance is still the best protection. People must
be strict about their hygiene and drink treated water. As soon as
cholera symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea appear, it is vital to go
as quickly as possible to a treatment center. Cholera is treatable,
but without medical care it kills quickly."

[3] Haiti: Praecipio International report
Date: Sat 4 Jun 2011
From: James Wilson <jim.wilson@praecipiointernational.org> [edited]


The currently reported "2nd wave" of cholera in Haiti that appeared
with the seasonal rains is not associated with the same degree of
social disruption and anxiety observed during the 1st wave. This
observation has been echoed within the nearly 1000-member Haiti
Epidemic Advisory System (HEAS). The northern areas of the country are
much better prepared than during the 1st wave and thus are handling
cases there without any report of medical infrastructure inundation or
exceeding of local capacity.

We have heard reports of rural mountainous areas, particularly in the
south, reporting similar high mortality seen during the 1st round of
cholera. In Port au Prince, the current "hot spot" appears to be the
Carrefour area, where one CTC reported seeing up to 550 patients per
day. Medical response in this area is rapidly surging in response, in
a clear indication of well-tuned and sensitized awareness of
now-expected cholera. This is despite the dramatic decrease in
availability of funding and NGO presence in Haiti since the earthquake
[12 Jan 2010].

Our primary concern once again is for the rural, isolated mountainous
communities of Haiti. In some cases, entire family units reportedly
died due to lack of access to medical response during the first wave.


Local customs such as urination, defecation, and washing of the dead
in rivers likely facilitated the spread of cholera throughout these
communities and onward to the flood plains. Preliminary environmental
testing of some of these rivers was positive for cholera. Some of
these communities were found to be highly apprehensive of foreign
visitation, having been informed by local rumor that the "blans" were
deliberately seeding their water supply with poison and hence should
be killed on sight. â€¦ An observation reminiscent of WHO's experience
in Gabon during the Ebola outbreaks years past. Education will be an
important countermeasure for these communities.

Community resilience has grown in the face of cholera in Haiti,
however this does not obviate the need for continued international
attention and support.

http://www.allvoices.com//news/9236453-cholera-death-toll-reaches-30-in-dominican-republic


Nearly 30 people have died of cholera in the Dominican Republic and
at least another 5000 have been infected following the massive
outbreak in Haiti, which began in 2010, said Senen Caba, the head of
the Dominican Medical College.

However, the health ministry said in its latest toll that the number
of deaths is 23 while only 1288 have been infected.

Health minister Bautista Rojas told the press he expects a rise in
cases in the coming 3 to 4 weeks. He also confirmed that 2 new
laboratories have been installed for detecting the disease.
