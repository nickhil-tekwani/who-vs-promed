Red tide now easing in some Maine areas
---------------------------------------
Some York County clam diggers could be back on the flats by the weekend
[25-26 Jun 2005], as New England's largest red tide outbreak in 30 years
weakens in the western Gulf of Maine, officials said. But the bloom of
toxic algae appears to be strengthening in waters off eastern Maine and the
Bay of Fundy, where Canadian officials last Friday [17 Jun 2005] closed
shellfish beds along most of the New Brunswick coast.
The red tide now stretches from the Nova Scotia border to Cape Cod in
Massachusetts, although some areas around Penobscot Bay, the Jonesport
area, and the St Croix River have thus far escaped contamination. But those
"clean pockets" may disappear as the summer sun warms the cold waters Down
East, and the algae there gain toxicity, said Darcie Couture, director of
biotoxin monitoring for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "We kind
of got a preview in western Maine for what's coming for eastern Maine,"
Couture said. "The red tide we have gotten was so intense and bad in
western Maine there is no reason it won't become that bad in eastern Maine
when the water is warmed up."
Toxicity levels in Cape Cod Bay are declining, although shellfish harvested
there are still considered unsafe to eat, said Dave Whittaker, a senior
marine fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine
Fisheries. There also was a drop last week in a small stretch of waters
near Cape Porpoise in York County. If tests this Friday [24 Jun 2005] show
similar results, the state will reopen that area to shellfish harvesting,
Couture said.
Red tide taints shellfish such as clams and mussels, making them unsafe for
people and animals to eat, but poses no risk to people who consume fish,
lobsters, scallops and shrimp.
Toxicity levels remain high in Casco Bay, where algae feed on higher
nutrient levels fueled by pollution. Couture also noted that Casco Bay
doesn't flush out the nutrients as well as waters off York County.
