Wayanad [Kerala] Collector S Suhas has issued an alert notice after the presence of monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease] virus was detected in the forest regions of the district. Preventive measures will be intensified in the villages in forest boundaries. The virus was confirmed after the samples collected from deep forest were tested in the virology lab in Alappuzha.

The health department has directed to take immediate action to prevent spreading of the disease, as monkey fever is likely to spread in dry weather. Vaccine against monkey fever will be made available in the villages close to the forest. Awareness programmes will be intensified in the areas and tribal colonies, where monkey fever was reported in previous years. The Animal Husbandry department is assigned to make available the necessary medicines for domesticated animals.

In case monkeys are spotted dead or unconscious, people are directed to inform the KFD (Kyasanur Forest disease) cell in the collectorate immediately. (Phone number 0493 6204151, toll free number 1077).

The District Medical Officer informed that the villagers near the forest should be cautious against the monkey virus. Domestic animals and people have to keep away from the forest. Those who go inside the forest have to apply ointments to keep away ticks and they also have to take a bath in hot water after returning from the forest.

[Wayanad is a rural district in the north-east part of Kerala. A large area of the district is covered by forest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district).

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is transmitted through a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, particularly a sick or recently dead monkey. While goats, cows, and sheep can become infected with KFD through a tick bite, transmission of KFD from these animals to humans is extremely rare. No human-to-human transmission has been reported (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/pdf/factsheet.pdf).

Vaccination, tick control measures, and personal protective measures against tick bites and avoidance of contact with sick or dead monkeys are the key strategies to prevent KFD transmission. The above report does not clarify whether the samples were collected from monkeys to confirm KFD. - Mod.UBA
