Request for information: bulk milk samples and animal disease control
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In Israel, bulk milk samples are collected daily from all dairy farms. A sample from each shipment is routinely forwarded to a central laboratory of the Israeli Cattle Breeders Association, located in Caesarea (central Israel), for the following udder-health related tests:
1. SCC [somatic cell count]
2. Total solids (fat, protein, lactose, milk urea nitrogen) tests,
3. _Mycoplasma bovis_ PCR test,
4. _Streptococcus agalactiae_ PCR test,
5. _Staphylococcus aureus_ PCR test.

"Hachaklait", an Israeli NGO, NPO [non profit organization] for clinical veterinary services has been applying in the said certified laboratory several additional tests in bulk milk samples. These tests, performed upon request of owners or their practitioners, address the following disease agents: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), enzootic bovine leucosis virus (EBLV), and _Mycobacterium avium_ subsp. _paratuberculosis_ (Johne's disease).

We have considered applying tests for other pathogens in cattle, including causative agents of zoonotic diseases. For a decision to be made, some additional, current information from other parts of the world will be helpful.

We would much appreciate obtaining information on bovine milk bulk testing programs applied elsewhere. We would also wish to know about the status of such undertaking, namely if the relevant State national authorities officially recognize such tests as applicable for the implementation of disease surveillance and control measures in cattle.

[Some examples that come to mind:
In the Netherlands, bulk milk PCR testing was applied in 2012 to trace Schmallenberg virus infection (see ProMED-mail posting 20120828.1268617) and, since 2010, in bulk milk samples from goat farms within the official campaign to control Q fever (see ProMED-mail posting 20100217.0559).

Bluetongue virus infection was traced by PCR in bulk milk samples in Norway in 2009 and in Latvia in 2012 (see references listed below),

Brucellosis bulk milk ELISA is routinely used in various countries.

Subscribers able to address Dr Sharir's inquiry in relation to the mentioned and/or other diseases or to add details to the examples mentioned in the commentary above are encouraged to share their experience/information for the benefit of all. - Mod.AS
