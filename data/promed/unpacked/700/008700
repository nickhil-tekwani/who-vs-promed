Several hundred new Cases Of Sleeping Sickness Recorded
--------------------------------------------
Some 344 new cases of sleeping sickness have been recorded during the
third quarter of the year at Angotrip Health Centre, in Angola's
northern province of Uije, a source with that organisation announced
Thursday. The Physician of the Angotrip project, Kiala Gode,
regarded as "concerning" the spreading of the sickness in the region.
One person died during the mentioned period and 100 are having
medical care there, he said. Some 69 792 tsetse flies were captured
by 1531 traps set in the districts of Uije, Negage, Quitexe and
Mucaba, he revealed, adding that lack of appropriate medicines to
fight the disease is the problem facing the centre. Four out of 100
inhabitants of Uije, Negage, Songo plus Quitexe districts are
infected by the sickness.

[ProMED-mail has followed the report of trypanosomiasis (sleeping
sickness) from Angola since 1996. In 1997, it was estimated that
there was 6000 infected humans in the country and the Uije province
was heavily affected. After the recent peace agreement, the health
situation in areas that were previously inaccessible is now emerging.
The report confirms that trypanosomiasis is a huge problem in parts
of Angola. - Mod.EP]
