State health officials say a salmonella outbreak may be linked to eating pork. The Department of Health is investigating at least 56 cases of salmonellosis in 8 counties across Washington.

Here's more information from the Washington State Department of Health:

Disease investigators continue to explore several sources from farm to table, and are focused on an apparent link to pork consumption or
contamination from raw pork. Salmonellosis, the illness caused by infection with Salmonella, can cause severe and even bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. Serious bloodstream infections may also occur.

As of 23 Jul 2015, the 56 cases include residents of King (44), Snohomish (4), Mason (2), Thurston (2), Pierce (1), Grays Harbor (1), Yakima (1), and Clark (1) counties. 5 of the cases were hospitalized; no deaths have been reported. All were infected with the same strain of Salmonella. The disease investigation shows a potential exposure source for several cases was whole roasted pigs, cooked and served at private events. The source of contamination remains under investigation by state and local health officials and federal partners.

The outbreaks are a reminder of the importance of proper food care, handling, preparation, and cooking to prevent illness. State health
officials recommend these food safety strategies broadly, and specifically advise against eating raw or undercooked pork. Following food safety guidance can help prevent food-borne illness. Health officials warn consumers who handle and/or eat pork to cook the meat to a safe internal temperature, using a meat thermometer; whole cuts of pork should be cooked to 145 degrees. Meat thermometers should be placed in the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bone, fat, and cartilage. All meats and fish should be cooked to a safe internal temperature, using a food thermometer; guidance can be found on the Department of Health website.

Other food safety tips include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after preparing food, especially raw meats. To avoid
cross-contamination, don't place cooked food on a plate that previously held raw meat of any kind. It's also important to sanitize cutting boards, knives, and countertops that come into contact with raw meat by using a solution of bleach water (1 teaspoon bleach per gallon of water) or antibacterial cleaner.

[As reported by the Seattle Times (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/salmonella-tied-to-pork-sickens-56-in-eight-counties/), the outbreak strain is Salmonella I, 4, 5, 12:i: -. Regarding the organism's designation, as discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control), http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf,
_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL]
