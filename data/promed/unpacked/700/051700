The DuPage County Health Department closed a Lombard restaurant in connection with the investigation into 4 confirmed cases of _Escherichia coli_ infection in people admitted to a county hospital this week, officials said today [15 Jun 2013].

Jason Gerwig, a public information officer for the DuPage County Health Department, said his agency is looking at a Lombard restaurant as a possible source for the outbreak and said the restaurant had been temporarily closed at 5:00 pm on Fri 14 Jun 2013 as part of the investigation. He did not want to name the restaurant until he had received further confirmation that the 4 people with confirmed cases of _E. coli_ had been there, and he said he would not be able to get that confirmation until Mon 17 Jun 2013.

Gerwig said the total number of cases confirmed or under investigation is about 10. He said that it is "unusual" to have a cluster of cases like this, "which is why we are investigating." The 4 confirmed cases were all hospitalized at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, officials said on Fri 14 Jun 2013.

Melaney Arnold, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health, said her agency had confirmed that those 4 individuals had contracted the same strain of _E. coli_ and that the agency is continuing to study other, related reports of _E. coli_ in that area. She could not confirm how many other cases were involved or when the lab testing will be done.

Jim Silvestri, a spokesman for Good Samaritan, said on Fri 14 Jun 2013 that 8 people had come to the hospital feeling ill and that 4 had been admitted.

Gerwig did not have any numbers immediately regarding how many cases of _E. coli_ his department sees in a year. According to the Illinois Department of Health web site, there were 241 cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) in 2011, the last year that data were available.
