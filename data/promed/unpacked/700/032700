A Comment on Adenoviruses and Ocular disease
--------------------------------------------
[Professor Niklas Arnberg has sent the following comment to amend and
expand on the Moderator's comment to the post entitled "Conjunctivitis -
China (Hainan) 20040830.2418" concerning adenoviruses and ocular disease.
ProMED-mail welcomes Prof. Arnberg's assistance in keeping the record
straight. - Mod.CP]
To date, the adenovirus family includes 51 different human serotypes, and
these are divided into 6 species (A-F). However, whereas multiple serotypes
from different species have been described as causing cases or limited,
irregular outbreaks of ocular disease in humans, there are only a few
serotypes that regularly cause larger outbreaks or epidemics.
The 2 types of ocular disease that are commonly caused by adenoviruses are
pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) [as described in the Hainan outbreak] and
epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). PCF is usually caused by adenovirus
types 3 and 7 and the ocular symptoms are relatively mild, consisting of
conjunctivitis mainly. EKC on the other hand is usually caused by
adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37, and the ocular symptoms are more severe,
including keratitis and conjunctivitis. Other common ocular symptoms of EKC
are pain, photophobia, edema, and generation of pseudomembranes. The acute
phase of EKC is usually over within 2 weeks, but corneal opacities may
remain for months or even years.
An interesting observation is that the 3 serotypes that cause EKC (Ad8,
Ad19, and Ad37) use a cellular receptor (sialic acid) that is different
from the cellular receptors used by other adenoviruses (CAR or CD46). At
present, there are no licensed antivirals available to any of the adenoviruses.
