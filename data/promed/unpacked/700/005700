Asian longhorned tick suspected in cattle deaths in southeast Ohio
------------------------------------------------------------------
Concerns
--------
There are a lot of unknowns with the Asian longhorned tick [_Haemaphysalis longicornis_, ALT] as it is a true invasive. We do not know how far it will spread, and most importantly what diseases it will prove competent to vector, or transmit, to humans, companion animals and livestock.

One characteristic of this tick that causes me major worry is how it can reproduce. This tick species can reproduce via parthenogenesis meaning the female does not need a male in order to lay eggs. That means that one female can establish a colony. This tick was recently found on a Canada goose. Let that sink in. If it attaches and feeds on a Canada goose for a week knowing how far they can fly in a day.

Cattle deaths
-------------
The Asian longhorned tick gave a demonstration of its destructive potential in the summer of 2021. I [Timothy McDermott DVM] received an email from a recently retired Ohio State University Extension Agriculture and Natural Resources colleague of mine who grazes cattle in southeastern Ohio asking me to call him. He told me that when his neighbor did his morning herd check he found 3 dead cattle. They were covered in ticks in extraordinary numbers. I asked him to get some ticks submitted for identification and my colleague at OSU who first discovered ALT in Ohio, Risa Pesapane, confirmed them as ALT.

A subsequent visit by Risa and her team found the pasture contaminated with large numbers of ticks. The herd tested negative for disease, so the hypothesis is the ticks caused death through blood loss due to exsanguination. It must also be noted the cattle were mature animals, including a bull.

What does the producer need to do to mitigate potential problems from ALT? Make sure to practice good biosecurity and scouting. Check animals carefully for ticks. Manage the area around pastures by clearing brush and keeping weeds short. Work with your veterinarian if you think you have a problem with this tick.

[This tick was first reported in Ohio on 31 Jul 2020 by the the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) that announced that an exotic tick, known as the Asian longhorned tick [_Haemaphysalis longicornis_], has been found in Gallia County. ODA says the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the exotic tick. The tick was found on a stray dog originating from Gallia County, ODA said. The dog was later transported to a shelter in Canal Winchester, and the tick was identified on 28 May 2020 by the Ohio State University and sent to the federal lab for confirmation (see Invasive tick - USA (02): (OH) 20200802.7638301). It appears that this tick has now become established in Ohio as it has in several other states in the USA. As the above report indicates, the death of the 3 cattle due to exsanguination from the high humber of ALT is hypothetical. In the absence of a post-mortem examination with supporting laboratory support, one cannot be sure of ticks as the cause of death and that no other pathogens were involved.

A US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Pest alert issued in December 2021 (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/alert-asian-longhorned-tick.508.pdf) states, "To date, ALHT [in the USA] has been confirmed in the following States: Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

"ALHT has been found feeding on a number of hosts, including sheep, goats, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, chickens, black bears, foxes (red and grey), coyotes, groundhogs, striped skunks, white-tailed deer, elk, opossums, raccoons, Canada geese, barred owls, great horned owls, brown boobies, Peromyscus mice, and red-tailed hawks. The tick has also been found on people." - Mod.TY
