One might also begin to look at the resident squirrel
population in the DC mall area to see whether they are
indeed serving as reservoirs for _F. tularensis_. There
certainly is a large population of them, as any visitor can
attest, and this would be consistent with theories expressed
concerning tularemia bacillus presence in the environment --
that is, through carcasses decaying in the soil, airborne
dissemination of contaminated dust/dirt, and possible
presence short term in local water pools.
We have seen similar sampling and detection systems based on
sensitive PCR techniques show up positive in the past out
here in Utah, prior to the 2002 Olympic Games. These were
generally explained away, given the endemic nature of _F.
tularensis_ in the local rabbit population, the time of
year, and environmental climate changes (fall season is
cooler, cloudier with more humidity), etc.
For DC, however, we need to test the idea of indigenous host
reservoirs to address the question of source rather than to
just say that it is not associated with any terrorist
activity. The National Park Service can start by rounding
up some squirrels for testing.
