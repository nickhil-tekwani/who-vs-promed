I have been living in North Carolina for many years, and am currently
working on my Ph.D. in Toxicology. North Carolina has been a hotspot for
rabies for several years now, with a dramatic increase of cases starting
sometime around 1990. According to one source, the number of cases has
doubled each year, starting with 106 cases in 1993 and going up to 879
cases in 1997.
Apparently North Carolina has been unfortunate in that it is being affected
by three epizootics, coming from three different directions. A raccoon
rabies epizootic spread to N.C. from Florida, where it started in the
1950's. A second epizootic stared in West Virginia and has spread
throughout the Mid Atlantic states and south to the northeastern and north
central parts of North Carolina. The two epizootic episodes have merged and
this is presumably responsible for the large increase in rabies cases in
N.C. A third epizootic has spread into N.C. from Tennessee and southwestern
Virginia, but is not spreading quickly. It's point of origin is somewhere
in the northern mid-Western states.
I obtained much of this information from
<http://www.schs.state.nc.us/epi/rabies/history.html> An overview of the
rabies cases is available at
<http://www.schs.state.nc.us/epi/rabies/overview.html>.
I'm not sure what portion (if any) of this increase is due to increased
surveillance, increased human-wildlife contact, or both.
These cases will only continue to increase, and I will be very surprised if
the number of people that are exposed to rabies does not. There has been a
phenomenal urbanization of North Carolina, especially around the
Raleigh/Durham area and Charlotte, leading to increased displacement of
wildlife and increased human-wildlife encounters. I wonder if the
acceleration of the epidemic is in part due to a local overpopulation of
wildlife, where the animals are crowded into narrowing corridors of forest
and brush...leading to increased animal-to-animal spread.

but their statistics are only up to 1998 and are in tabular not graphical
format, which makes it very difficult to appreciate the spatial changes
with time. - MHJ
