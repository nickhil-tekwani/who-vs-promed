Description of affected population: all age categories and both sexes are

University farm are kept under an intensive system of management, while
those in the other 2 affected farms are given water from a communal spring.

University of Ibadan
Diagnostic tests used: preliminary examination
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Central laboratory of the National
Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom
Diagnostic tests used: advanced laboratory tests in progress
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: fomites (humans, vehicles,
feed, etc.). It is thought that the infection may have spread into the
country from Benin, which shares a border with the affected state. This was
the source of a previous introduction of the infection into Nigeria.
However, a detailed investigation is being carried out. Efforts are being
made to limit the spread of the infection in the country.
Control measures
A. Undertaken:
- partial stamping out;
- quarantine;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- regular radio broadcasts are being made to alert pig farmers and to
advise them on appropriate preventive measures.
B. To be undertaken:
- stamping out;
- movement control inside the country.

[This follow-up report increases transparency as well as our understanding
of the events. Nigerians have dealt with this disease before (see
references below). Let's hope it is stamped out in short order. ProMED
would appreciate receiving any ongoing details on this outbreak as the
disease is, hopefully, contained. - Mod.PC]
