North Cyprus tests dead birds for avian flu
-----------------------------------------------
2 suspected cases of avian flu were found on a farm in northern Cyprus, but
it was too early to say whether it was the deadly H5N1 strain, Turkish
Cypriot authorities said on Monday [23 Jan 2006].
Samples from a dead turkey and a chicken were taken from close to Incircli,
a village on the eastern part of the island, which is also known by the
Greek name Makrasykas. [Latitude 35.0750, Longitude 33.7667. Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CY/1/Makrasyka.html>].
"There were 2 birds, one a turkey and one a chicken, and 2 suspicious
deaths. Preliminary tests proved positive (for a form of bird flu)," said
Turkish Cypriot health minister Esref Vaiz.
"We have announced it to the public, and we are hiding nothing," he told
Reuters, adding that it would take about 2 days for conclusive results to
come from Turkey.
Poultry in the village was being slaughtered, and all traffic going into
the community was being disinfected, a Turkish Cypriot official said.
Cyprus lies just south of Turkey, where authorities say 4 people have died
from the H5N1 bird flu virus this month [January 2006]. The H5N1 virus has
killed at least 80 people in 6 countries since late 2003.
The island was partitioned in 1974; each side has separately taken
identical measures to ward off avian influenza.
