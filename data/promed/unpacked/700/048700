The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday [20
Dec 2005] handed over H5N1 human case isolates to the World Health
Organization (WHO). 2 strains of avian influenza virus isolated from human
infections in China were forwarded to Dr. Shigeru Omi, WHO Western Pacific
Regional Director, by Wang Yu, Director of the Chinese CDC, along with
relevant virus information on Chinese human cases. Offered to the
organization for further research, the strains will help trace the virus'
mutation and develop anti-[influenza virus] drugs. It is a major
contribution made by China to the global fight against the epidemic, said Omi.
Omi said good collaboration in the international community will be crucial
in dealing with the immense challenge posed by H5N1 avian influenza, and
China, as one of the centers of the global fight, can play an important
role in this regard.
Chinese experts will join in the WHO's research of these isolates. On his
visit to the Chinese National Influenza Center, also on Tuesday, Omi was
introduced to the monitoring, lab testing and control of human cases of
avian influenza. China has announced 6 human cases of bird flu since 16 Nov
2005, including at least 2 fatalities, according to the Ministry of Health.
Lab tests show that the genotype of H5N1 seen in human bird flu infections
in China are different from those observed in humans in Viet Nam,
indicating that the virus has mutated.

[This is an important and constructive initiative on the part of the
Chinese authorities in relation to the surveillance of H5N1 avian influenza
in East Asia. The observation that the genotypes of the H5N1 avian
influenza virus isolated from patients in China and Viet Nam are not
identical is not surprising, as all RNA viruses exhibit high mutation
rates. This observation by itself does not confirm that the virus is
evolving towards a form capable of person-to-person transmissibility. - Mod.CP]
