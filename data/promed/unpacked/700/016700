The 'rumour' is true. A government press statement has been released from
both Malaysia and Singapore. Nine abattoir workers in Singapore have come
down with some kind of meningoencephalitis and one has died. JE virus
infection is now being investigated. These workers had worked on live pigs
from Malaysia.
When official information is received it will be posted.

The Malaysian government has called in the army and police to destroy about
65 000 pigs as it steps up the fight to contain a deadly virus that has
claimed 47 lives. More than 1000 security personnel will visit [affected
farms in Negri Sembilan and use light arms to slaughter pigs which were
abandoned after hundreds of farmers and their families fled.
At least 32 people in Negri Sembilan have died of Japanese encephalitis
[and another 15 have died in Perak. All the victims lived on or near pig
farms.

Singapore authorities have suspended pig imports from farms north of Johor
state [southernmost state in peninsular Malaysia after two abattoir workers
here came down with suspected Japanese encephalitis (JE).
With immediate effect, only pigs from 28 Primary Production
Department-accredited farms in Johor will be allowed in the two Singapore
abattoirs, the deputy director, Dr Chua Sin Bin, said at a press conference.
The precautionary move to protect abattoir workers and those who work with
the livestock came after four abattoir workers were admitted to hospital
between March 13 and 16 and the worsening outbreak in Malaysia.
Dr Chew Suok Kai, director for epidemiology and disease control at the
Ministry of Health, said that the disease has been ruled out for two men,
who were found to be suffering from pneumonia and bacterial meningitis. The
other two are suspected of being infected with the virus, he said. They had
been admitted after complaining of fever, drowsiness and shivers -- the
symptoms of JE, said Dr Chew, adding that test results ruling out the viral
infection would only be known in a few days' time.
The four, all Singaporeans, worked at the Kim Chuan abattoir and had been
vaccinated only recently against the disease. No similar incidents were
reported at the the Jurong abattoir.
Singapore imports most of its live pigs from farms in Malaysia.
[The significance of the two suspected JE cases among abattoir workers
cannot be ascertained at present pending the availability of more
information, especially confirmation of the disease by laboratory test. It
is understood that the area around the abattoir is subject to stringent
mosquito control which includes fogging every week, spraying of insecticide
in and around the abattoir twice a day and Environment Ministry officers
checking for mosquito breeding. - Mod. CYC

[We have never heard of JE virus being acquired by abattoir workers from the
process of slaughtering. We suppose Hendra-like virus infection is also now
being investigated. We await the results with bated breath! - Mod.JW
