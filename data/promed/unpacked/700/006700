Cholera vibrio found near Zhukovsky, Moscow region
A cholera vibrio was found in the Moskva River in the area of the city of
Zhukovsky, the Moscow region. The vibrio is in an active form and is
dangerous for humans. Restrictions have been introduced in the territory.
The vibrio culture is called 0-139 Bengal, Tass learnt from the
epidemiological department of the Russian Health Ministry on Tuesday. The
vibrio was discovered in the water near the city's beach. Medics test for
cholera all patients admitted to hospitals with intestinal diseases. No
cases of cholera have yet been established.
Restrictive measures have also been introduced in nearby territories -- the
Kolomna, Ramenskoye and Voskresensk districts. Water samples are taken from
more areas in the Moskva River.
Russian experts say this is the first case in the current season when an
active cholera vibrio was found in the external environment. [I presume the
distinction between "active" and "nonhazardous" is intended to distinguish
cholera vibrios from non-cholera vibrios. - Mod.ES
A cholera vibrio has earlier been found in a reservoir in Kalmykia but in a
form nonhazardous for humans. Medics are usually concerned with the
situation in Daghestan. But cholera vibrios have not yet been found there.
The pilgrimage of Muslims to holy places has ended. In the previous years,
the pilgrimage often resulted in the bringing of cholera to the Russian
territory. This has not happened this year.

[It is noteworthy that there are no human cases of cholera reported as yet.
The isolation of the O139 strain is potentially sigificant as it could
signal the spread of this emerging strain toward Europe from Asia, perhaps
via Asian immigrants. The O139 strain was first identified in India and
Bangladesh during a 1992 outbreak of cholera. - Mods.JW/ES
