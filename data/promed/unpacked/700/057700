HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (5)
======================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Hantaviruses - Bosnia-Herzegovina (4)
Where is the Hanta lab work being done? Is Dobrova virus yet in the neut
screen? It may well be the local "Hantaan" causing the serious illness?
Do NATO peacekeepers have antiviral on hand to treat suspect cases?
Depending on kind and amount of true exposure to contaminated rodent
environments, this disease might rival land mines as cause of mortality
in '96.
