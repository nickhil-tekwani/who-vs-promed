Vaud: measles outbreak "unprecedented"
--------------------------------------
The Ecole Rudolf Steiner [in Crissier] near Lausanne [in the canton
Vaud] on Tuesday [3 Feb 2009] reported 17 cases of measles to the
cantonal doctor's office, bringing to 22 the number of cases reported
in 2 days, according to '24 Heures.' Dr Eric Masserrey, who heads the
office responsible for overseeing epidemics, called the outbreak
"unprecedented" as his team moved into action to control the spread
of the potentially deadly disease. A previously healthy 12-year-old
French girl died on 29 Jan 2009 of encephalitis, a complication
provoked by measles, at the University Hospitals (HUG) in Geneva.

[Switzerland has been affected by measles outbreaks more than other
European countries in recent years because of the relatively low
level of vaccinations and the presence of educational and religious
communities that decline vaccination. Students are allowed to attend
such schools in Switzerland if they have not been vaccinated, but if
they are found to have been exposed to measles virus infection they
will be told to stay home for 21 days. The same applies to adults and workers.

The outbreak described here indicates that anthroposophic communities
are an at-risk group, because many parents in these groups choose not
to vaccinate their children with the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella]
vaccine. Anthroposophy, based on the writings of the social
philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), combines human development
with an investigation of the divine spark found in all of nature.
Anthroposophical doctors emphasize nature-based therapies that
support the body's innate healing wisdom. Antibiotics, fever-reducing
agents, and vaccinations are used at one's own discretion only.
Although measles has been eliminated or is under control in several
EU countries, it remains a public health priority.
