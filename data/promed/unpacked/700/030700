[According to the tweet above, the pictures of charts presented by China CDC show the numbers of confirmed (and suspected cases) of the 2019-nCoV infection among healthcare workers in Wuhan, by health facility, through 18 Jan 2020.

Confirmed cases: 501
Suspected cases: 600

It would be nice to see a summary of this presentation, but one clear conclusion was that before 18 Jan 2020, there was significant person-to-person transmission ongoing in Wuhan, especially in the healthcare setting. This is a common observation, seen with the SARS-CoV and with the MERS-CoV, prior to the implementation of enhanced infection control, including respiratory precautions. More information on the 2019-nCoV and healthcare workers would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

[More information from knowledgeable sources on the epidemiology surrounding the positive cases would be appreciated. What were the selection criteria for testing? Were these individuals showing clinical illness? Were any of these individuals in the same room as the original Hong Kong passenger thought to have potentially contaminated the ship with the CoV? - Mod.MPP]

D. Wisconsin ex China
Date: Wed 5 Feb 2020

https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/020520.htm


The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), UW Hospital and Clinics, the local health department, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed the 1st case of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wisconsin. The case was confirmed at CDC. The immediate health risk to the general public for contracting this virus is low.

The patient is an adult with a history of travel to Beijing, China prior to becoming ill and was exposed to known cases while in China. The individual is isolated at home and is doing well. Out of respect for the privacy of the patient and their household, this is the only information that is available.

While the risk to the general public remains low, DHS, UW Hospital and Clinics, the local health department, and CDC are working together to prevent disease transmission by evaluating close contacts of the patient and health care personnel who cared for the patient.

"DHS is operating with an abundance of caution and is working very closely with the local health department and UW Hospital and Clinics to ensure that this patient and any close contacts are closely monitored," said state health officer Jeanne Ayers. "The risk of getting sick from 2019 novel coronavirus in Wisconsin is very low. We are responding aggressively to the situation and monitoring all developments. We are committed to keeping the public fully informed and will continue to provide updates as this situation unfolds."

"UW Health has taken precautions, including ongoing staff training and recently expanding our travel history questions," said UW Health medical director of infection control Dr Nasia Safdar. "Since initial treatment at University Hospital, the patient has been self-quarantined at home. We are coordinating with the CDC, DHS, and local health authorities."

Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, which may appear anywhere from 2 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus. Symptoms have ranged from a mild illness (like a common cold) to severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. We are encouraging travelers returning from China or contacts of patients with a confirmed case who become ill to let their health care providers know of their possible exposure before arriving at the health care facility.

The steps that all Wisconsin residents can take to help prevent the spread of this virus are the same as those used to protect against colds and flu: cover your coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, and stay home when you're sick. Influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses are common in Wisconsin at this time of year.

Updates on the 2019 novel coronavirus, including case counts, are available on the DHS Outbreaks and Investigations webpage [https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm] by 2 pm on weekdays.

There has been a 4th confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Queensland. The 37 year old man, a Chinese national from Wuhan (Hubei Province) is currently isolated in the Gold Coast University Hospital (GCUH). The man is a member of the same tour group travelling with the previously confirmed cases -- a 44 year old man, a 42 year old woman, and an 8 year old boy. All 4 people who have been confirmed to have novel coronavirus are stable.

The 5 others from the same tour group remain in isolation in GCUH.

Highlights
----------
- Belgium reported its 1st confirmed case of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.

- WHO and partners have developed a global strategic preparedness and response plan, which outlines the public health measures that the international community can provide to support all countries to prepare for and respond to the 2019 nCoV outbreak. The overall goal of the plan is to stop further transmission of 2019 nCoV within China and to other countries and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in all countries.

- WHO is working with the travel and tourism industry to discuss real and perceived risks experienced in the industry, measures put in place for customers and employees, and challenges faced regarding implementation of the Temporary Recommendations associated with the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In the coming days, WHO will work with the industry to identify solutions to these challenges, within the framework of the International Health Regulations (2005).

Technical focus: strategic preparedness and response plan and resource requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO and partners have developed a global strategic preparedness and response plan, which outlines the public health measures that the international community can provide support to all countries to prepare for and respond to the 2019 nCoV outbreak. The plan describes what we have learned so far about the virus and translates that knowledge into strategic action that can guide the efforts of all national and international partners when developing context-specific national and regional operational plans. The overall goal of the strategic preparedness and response plan is to stop further transmission of 2019 nCoV within China and to other countries and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in all countries.

The strategic objectives of the plan are to:
- limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China;
- identify, isolate, and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines;
- communicate critical risk and event information to all communities, and counter misinformation;
- minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

These objectives can be achieved by:
- rapidly establishing international coordination to deliver strategic, technical, and operational support through existing mechanisms and partnerships;
- scaling up country preparedness and response operations, including strengthening readiness to rapidly identify, diagnose and treat cases; identification and follow-up of contacts when feasible (with priority given to high-risk settings such as healthcare facilities); infection prevention and control in healthcare settings; implementation of health measures for travelers; and awareness raising in the population through risk communication and community engagement;
- accelerating priority research and innovation to support a clear and transparent global process to set research and innovation priorities to fast track and scale-up research, development, and the equitable availability of candidate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. This will build a common platform for standardized processes, protocols, and tools, to facilitate multidisciplinary and collaborative research integrated with the response. The total estimated resources required to be mobilized by the international community to implement priority public health measures in support of countries to prepare for and respond to 2019-nCoV for this plan is USD 675.5 million. The resource requirement for WHO as part of this plan is USD 61.5 million. The response requirement period is three months, from 1 Feb to 30 Apr 2020.

The full plan is available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/srp-04022020.pdf
