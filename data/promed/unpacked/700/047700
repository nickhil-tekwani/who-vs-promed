At least 900 people have arrived in PIMS hospital (Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences) complaining of cholera and diarrhea. Since the holy month of Ramadan has started, more than 900 patients affected by cholera, gastroenteritis and digestion problems have come to PIMS hospital. Over 600 children have been admitted to hospital due to dehydration and stomach problems.

According to doctors, precautionary measures are necessary to follow during Iftar and Sehri times; intake of water needs to be increased during Sehri and Iftar times, and Samosas and Pakoras made in Bazaars should be avoided, as they are fried in substandard oil.

[During the holy month of Ramadan, fasting is required between Sehri and Iftar times of the day. Substandard oils used for frying should not spread infectious agents as the heat should inactivate the pathogens. - Mod.LL

[2] Cholera - Nepal (Central Region)

Floodwater generally triggers waterborne disease like cholera, jaundice, typhoid and several others, but officials with the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of the Department of Health Services (DoHS) have been expecting massive flood, which they said that can be appropriate means to control the cholera epidemic. Officials hope that people will not drink stream water without proper treatment if massive flooding comes, and the ongoing epidemic could be contained.

"We are trying our best to control the epidemic, but it is still out of control," Dr Baburam Marasini, Director at EDCD, said, adding: "People may treat drinking water properly if massive flooding comes." He said that contaminated water is the main cause for the spread of diseases. People openly defecate at the source of the stream, which is located in Makwanpur district.

Two people died, and more than 1500 were infected from the cholera that spread in Gaidatar VDC of Rautahat over the last 3 months. Dr Marasini said that hundreds of people could have died if there were not proper treatment facilities. He said that the office cannot say when the epidemic will come under control.

"How could we say when cholera will come under control? Haiti's cholera outbreak has not fully come under control yet," he said, adding that people of the affected areas are still not getting safe drinking water, due to which people have been continuously getting infected with the disease.

Meanwhile, the District Health Office (DHO) of Rautahat has stopped collecting stool samples of infected people. "How can we know the status of the disease if the stool samples are not tested," asked Dr Subash Kumar Chaudhary of the District Hospital at Gaur.

Every day, over a dozen people have been visiting health camps for treatment. "Our entire efforts to control the epidemic have failed. We cannot provide safe drinking water to all," he added. He questioned higher officials on why the disease cannot be brought under control.

A winter study camp for matric pupils in Arendsnes near Brits was shut down following a diarrhea outbreak.

"The department regrets to inform parents and learners about the immediate closing of the winter study camp due to unhealthy conditions," said spokesman Brian Setswammung. "Pupils complained about diarrhoea, and we called in health authorities to investigate."

It was discovered that the food prepared for the pupils was below standard and unhygienic, he said. At least 393 pupils were at the camp. 15 were admitted to hospital on Fri 6 Jul 2014 and had since been discharged. A further investigation to determine how the food was procured and prepared was underway, Setswammung said.

[4] Cholera - Ghana (Accra)

Dr George Mensah, in-charge of the Accra Metropolitan Health Service, on Mon 7 Jul 2014 advised public health officers to ensure cholera does not spread in the metropolis by enforcing the laws on sanitation. He said that now that it was raining, daily environmental sanitation was necessary, adding that: "Your main focus should be on the food vendors by the gutters." Dr Mensah gave the advice when he met with all health officers in the 11 sub-metros in Accra to deliberate on the outbreak of cholera.

Dr Simpson Anim Boateng, Public Health Director of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, in an interview with the GNA, expressed happiness that Accra did not record any case of cholera last year [2013] because of the officers' hard work, though one case was recorded recently.
