Bolivia

Phytoplasmas, prokaryote plant pathogens, have been reported to cause peach
yellow leaf roll (PYLR) and peach red leaf (PRL) diseases. The PYLR
phytoplasma belongs to the 16SrX Apple proliferation group ('Ca.
Phytoplasma mali'); but PRL still has not been assigned to a sub-specific
lineage in 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris'.
Symptoms similar to PYLR disease were observed in a peach plantation at San
Isidro, Santa Cruz Province, Bolivia, during a survey in 2003. Older leaves
had symptoms of yellowing of the leaf margin and rolling, drying and
necrosis. Young leaves were tightly rolled and yellow, and proliferation of
shoots was evident along branches. Many trees were dead or dying.
Samples of young shoots and leaves were taken from affected and apparently
healthy trees and returned to Rothamsted. Total DNA was extracted and
indexed by nested PCR with generic phytoplasma rDNA primers P1/P7 and
R16F2n/R16R2.
PCR products were characterized by RFLP analysis using the restriction
endonucleases HaeIII, RsaI and AluI and direct sequencing. All samples from
affected trees gave a 1250 bp PCR product and identical RFLP profiles.
Sequence of phytoplasma rDNA (Accession No. AY 725212) was compared with
others in the GenBank database by using BLAST. The greatest similarity (98
percent) was with papaya dieback phytoplasma (Accession No. Y10095) from
Australia, a member of the 16SrXII Stolbur group ('Ca. Phytoplasma
australiense').
This is the 1st report of a peach yellow leaf roll-like disease in Bolivia
and the 1st record of the presence of a Stolbur group phytoplasma in peach.
These results contribute to the known diversity of phytoplasmas found in
peach and in Bolivian crops.

[PYLR was 1st described in 1948, occurring primarily in Butte, Placer,
Sutter, Yuba and San Juaquin and Stanislaus counties. It caused moderate
losses in the 1950s and 1960s, killing approximately 4800 trees, but the
incidence of PYLR increased dramatically in the late 1970s when a major
epidemic killed over 35 000 trees in 1979. The incidence of PYLR has
declined but continues to be a chronic problem in the northern California
counties of Yuba, Sutter, El Dorado and Placer.
Phytoplasmas are a group of prokaryotic, microscopic plant pathogens that
cause over 700 diseases of food, fiber and ornamental plants. They are
found mainly in the phloem sieve tubes of their plant hosts and in certain
sucking insects, which can act as vectors. They can also be spread by
grafting, by parasitic plants or by seed transmission. Detection of
phytoplasmas is by grafting to susceptible host plants, microscopy,
serology (ELISA), nucleic acid hybridization or DNA amplification using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Symptoms displayed by plants infected with
phytoplasmas include foliage yellowing, petal greening, shoot
proliferation, stunting, little leaf formation, necrosis and a decline of
vigor leading to death.
