Charities say they have pulled the bodies of 66 dead swans out of the water by Windsor Castle over the last 6 days.

Bird flu [avian influenza] is now thought to have wiped out 1/3 of the flock of royal swans on the River Thames.

There were previously around 200 of the protected birds on the 3-mile [4.8 km] stretch of river that winds around Windsor Castle from Romney Lock to Boveney Lock near Dorney, in Berkshire.

Wendy Hermon, from the Swan Support charity, said: 'I have been looking after the royal swans for 30 years beneath the Castle and I have never seen anything like this before.

'In 2018 avian flu killed more with about 70 swans lost, but that was over about a month. This time they are dying so fast they are literally dying right in front of your eyes.

'On Sunday [20 Nov 2022] I was recovering the bodies of 3 swans that had died by Romney Lock and saw a swan that looked unwell in the water but it did not look as if in real distress. But within 10 minutes it just rolled over and died right in front of me.'

She said the charity has 15 volunteers who are out on the riverbanks and on kayaks daily in protective gear.

They are being helped by Royal Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council to make sure the birds are taken away in bags and immediately incinerated.

'It is the speed that these swans are dying at that is frightening as they are literally dropping dead in the water all over the place and every day we are pulling them out,' Wendy added.

'There is nothing you can do as if you take them in for shelter and to treat them the influenza will kill all of the other birds so you just have to let nature run its cruel course.'

Signs are now being put up along the banks of the Thames warning visitors not to feed the swans and to stay away from the birds.

A Windsor Castle source said: 'Charles inherited the Queen's swans when his late mother passed. King Charles takes an enormous interest in the wildlife on all the royal estates and beyond and particularly so at Windsor as he is now the head ranger.

'He will be deeply upset about this major outbreak and the King's Swan Marker David Barber, who did the job for 30 years for the Queen, will be keeping the Palace informed.'

The late Queen was informed in February this year [2022] that 7 of her flock had died, and a further 26 had to be euthanised to stop the outbreak.

At the time, the Queen's swan warden Professor Christopher Perrins said: 'There is nothing you can do as taking in sick birds merely endangers all the others.

'The surge in infection rates is usually thought to be associated with the arrival of birds such as ducks and gulls from Europe and I am sure the Queen has been informed of the outbreak.'

[2] Cyprus (Famagusta): waterfowl

The Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, informs the public about the detection of avian influenza cases in Cyprus.

Avian influenza is a viral, contagious disease of birds caused by the influenza A virus. Healthy birds become infected either directly, through direct contact with other infected or sick birds, or indirectly through contaminated objects. Bird flu is usually carried from one country to another by migratory birds.

The cases were detected in 2 private collections of waterfowl in the Famagusta District and the premises where the disease manifested itself have been immediately placed under restriction.

From the 1st moment of diagnosis, owners of poultry farms and veterinarians have been informed and attention has been drawn to take strict biosecurity measures to prevent the risk of spreading the virus and protect the farms of organized poultry farming.

At the same time, the Veterinary Services are in contact with the Community Reference Laboratory, to send materials to determine the virulence of the virus that has been identified.

We inform the owners of domestic poultry that they must limit their birds to closed, covered areas to avoid direct and indirect contact with wild birds. This is especially true for communities adjacent to wetlands. In addition, it is strictly forbidden to keep poultry in the open, to provide food and water outdoors, and to avoid giving and making available food in a way that would encourage the opportunity for wild birds to feed on food left for domesticated birds. It is also prohibited to give poultry water from surface water reservoirs to which wild birds have access.

Any owner who observes increased morbidity and/or mortality of poultry which raises suspicion of an incident of the disease is obliged, based on the Animal Health Laws, to immediately inform the Provincial Veterinary Officer of the Province, to which he belongs, or the nearest Police Station.

Since October 2020, Europe has been experiencing the most severe avian influenza epidemic to date. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in its spread and maintenance. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, mallards, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMB]
