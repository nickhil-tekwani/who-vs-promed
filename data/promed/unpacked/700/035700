Foot and mouth disease [FMD] in cattle has been detected again in 2
settlements in the Khabarovsk and Amyr regions. Sergey Dankvert, the head
of the Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection Service, announced
today (20 Dec 2005): "As of today, FMD type "Asia - 1" has been diagnosed
in one of the private farmsteads of the village of Kuprijanovo in the
Mihajlovskiy district, Amur region". [Latitude 49.4667, Longitude 129.0167;
map at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/5/Kupriyanovo.html>. - Mod.AS].
Sergey Dankvert stated that the presence of FMD has also been confirmed on
one of the farms in the Vjazemskiy district of the Khabarovsk region
[kray]. It was specified that "there are 3 cowsheds on the land of the
given enterprise, but the disease has been detected only in one of them."
According to Sergey Dankvert, the background for the recurrence of FMD
outbreaks is "careless performance of animal vaccinations in the regions
adjacent to China". Experts have also suspected the possible involvement of
wildlife. [Which animals? - Mod.AS]
Sergey Dankvert said that joint investigation by Russian and Chinese
veterinaries into the reasons for the continued incidence of FMD in
boundary areas is expected in the near future.

[Russia notified the OIE about the occurrence of FMD, type Asia 1, in the
Far East -- adjacent to the Chinese border -- between June and September
2005. China sent a final notification on 16 Nov 2005,
stating: "Surveillance by the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's
Republic of China during the 6 months since the last case was stamped out
has shown no evidence of new cases in the 2 affected
areas". (see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_44.HTM#Sec7>) Obviously,
additional surveillance is needed; the envisaged cooperative action by the
2 sides is a most commendable development.- Mod.AS]
