Vietnam has detected 9 baby pigs infected with Foot and mouth disease [FMD]
in its northern border Lang Son province, local newspaper Labor reported
Friday.
The pigs, transported from another northern locality, were uncovered by
local veterinary and market management forces on Thursday when they were on
sales at a market in the town of Dong Dang in the province.
Now, FMD is still hitting 97 communes of the 12 localities of Dien Bien, Ha
Giang, Hanoi, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Gia Lai, Kon Tum,
Long An, Dong Thap and Can Tho, according to the Department of Animal
Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Over 3300 buffaloes, bulls and cows, and 1100 pigs in the 12 localities
have been affected.
Vietnam is intensifying control over cattle transport and trade in affected
areas, and surveillance of the disease and vaccination of healthy animals.

[Vietnam's last notifications to the OIE on FMD were sent on 20 and 24 May
2006, reporting the presence of FMDV serotype O in 32 provinces and of
serotype Asia-1 in one province (see 20060530.1510).
The current outbreak in pigs in the Lang Son province, on the Chinese
border, adds this province to the list. The reported involvement of pigs --
prolific disseminators of the virus -- does not bode well for imminent
control of the disease.
Vietnam has undertaken mass vaccinations against FMD, but it is not clear
if pigs are included among the vaccinees.
