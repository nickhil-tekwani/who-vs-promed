Venezuela: Extension of Activity
--------------------------------
Venezuelan health authorities have reported that, as of 31 Oct 2003
(epidemiological week 44), 40 cases of sylvan yellow fever have been
confirmed. During the past week, no new cases or deaths have been
registered. The confirmation of 2 new cases in the municipality of
Guanarito, state of Portuguesa, during epidemiological week 37, indicates a
broadening of the area of recent activity of the disease in the country.
To date, the municipalities registering outbreaks of sylvan yellow fever
are the following. (1) State of Zulia; municipalities of Jesus Maria
Semprun, Machiques, Rosario de Perija, Catatumbo, and Jesus E. Lossada, on
the border with Colombia and with a large volume of population movement.
(2) State of Tachira: municipalities of Uribante, Fernandez, Feo, and
Libertad. (3) State of Portuguesa: municipality of Guanarito.
The zoonosis division of the Environmental Health Directorate, reported
that this week, a vaccination team will travel to the municipalities of
Guanarito, Papelon, Santa Rosalia, and San Genaro de Boconoito in
Portuguesa state, with the purpose of intensifying the yellow fever
vaccination campaign in order to achieve the coverage appropriate for
high-risk areas.
The total of persons vaccinated in the country's high-risk areas with
confirmed cases is 566 252, with an estimated population of 507 894, that
is, a coverage of 119.49 [111.49] percent. On the other hand, the general
vaccination in the high-risk areas with no confirmed cases is 774 982, for
an estimated population of 1 003 864, a coverage of 77.20 percent.

[The apparent logical impossibility of there being more vaccinations than
people (in this case 566 252 vaccinated out of an estimated population of
507 894) is not an uncommon observation when using administrative figures
for calculating vaccination coverages. This results either from an
underestimate of the population or an overestimate of the number of doses
of vaccine administered. The latter occurs either by virtue of counting
doses distributed rather than administered (which would included "wasted
doses") or by administration to individuals who are not part of the
denominator, either by falling out of the age range (for childhood
vaccinations) or by coming from geographical areas other than those
included in the denominator. - Mod.MPP]
