NABLUS, West Bank -- Palestinian health officials were cited as saying that
more than 500 Palestinians from the Ain Beit al-Ma refugee camp in the West
Bank town of Nablus came down with diarrhea on Monday after eating spoiled
food.
United Nations Relief Works for Palestinian refugees Chief Medical Officer
Ibrahim al-Salqan was quoted as saying that, "Lab test results showed the
presence of _Shigella_ in foodstuff samples and a high percentage of
spoilage in food samples."
He said samples were taken from food stands in the refugee camp selling
popular chick-pea Arabic staples such as falafel and hummus.
