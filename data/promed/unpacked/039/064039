Highlights
- The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) continued to coordinate the response through its activated Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)
- 56 confirmed cases recorded since the onset of the outbreak
- 3 new States (Imo, Katsina and Nasarawa) recorded confirmed cases in the reporting week
- 13 new suspected cases reported in the reporting week
- NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja continued laboratory diagnosis of monkeypox with improved turn-around time
- There has been a decline in the number of new suspected cases reported over the last 4 weeks
- Since the onset of the outbreak, a total of 155 cases (suspected and confirmed) have been recorded from 21 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
- No death attributable to monkeypox has been recorded so far
- Epidemiologist deployed to 5 more States

Epidemiological summary
- 14 new confirmed cases were recorded in the reporting week from Benue (1), Cross River (3), Edo (1), FCT (2), Imo (2), Katsina (1), Nasarawa (1) and Rivers (3) states
- Out of a total of 155 suspected cases reported from 21 States and the FCT 56 cases have been confirmed in 13 States
- Clustering of cases was demonstrated in some instances, however no known evidence yet of epidemiological linkages across States
- Preliminary genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population
- The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 3:1
- The most affected age group is 21-40 years (Median Age = 30)
- No death recorded among cases so far

[The case count has increased from 42 confirmed cases in 10 states as of [Sun 19 Nov 2017] to 56 confirmed cases with 155 suspected and confirmed cases in 21 states and the Federal Capital Territory on [Thu 23 Nov 2017]. The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak is not mentioned. With no reported fatalities, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population, one wonders is there is a MPX epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area. Studies of prevalence of MPX in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
