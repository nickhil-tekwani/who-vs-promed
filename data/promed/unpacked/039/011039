The number of poultry, mostly chickens, that died of bird flu in
Purbalingga regency in the 1st half of 2008 has surpassed the 2007
total, the head of the local development planning agency said
Wednesday [6 Aug 2008].

"Some 58 000 poultry died of bird flu in 2007, while more than 60 000
died during the 1st 6 month of this year [2008]," Heni Ruslanto said.
"The poultry were confirmed to have died of bird flu."

Heni added people in the region had limited information about
preventive health measures and how to handle bird flu cases.
"Therefore, we are calling related institutes to pay attention to
this problem," he said.

Update), Issue 55 (revised) [edited]

HPAI H5N1 pathogenicity (including clades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 circulating
in the Red River basin and presumably imported from China, as well as
the clade 1 virus that has prevailed in the Mekong delta since early
2004) seems to be rising gradually.

According to Mary Pantin-Jackwood of the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) in Athens, Georgia, and associated colleagues from the Viet
Nam National Centre for Veterinary Diagnosis, this increase in
pathogenicity translates into a more severe respiratory tract
infection in ducks and an increase in cloacal virus titres.

However, despite higher virus pathogenicity, the avian influenza
disease situation appears, generally speaking, fairly well in check,
says Jan Slingenbergh, Senior Officer in FAO's Animal Production and
Health Service, reporting on his participation in an international
workshop on Avian Influenza Research to Policy from 16-18 Jun 2008 in Hanoi.

Slingenbergh said that longitudinal studies carried out by Joerg
Henning from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural
Research (ACIAR) in 4 different provinces of the Mekong Delta from
May to November 2007 suggest that seroprevalence rates in
unvaccinated chickens and ducks were between 5-20 percent but that
there were low levels of virus shedding (few PCR-positives) and no
HPAI outbreaks. Evidently, added Slingenbergh, vaccination offers
clinical protection in addition to containing virus spread.
Importantly, protective antibody titres developed rather late,
particularly in chickens, with titres taking up to 6 weeks to develop
from the time of vaccination.

Repeated vaccination in layer ducks appears very effective in
protecting them from HPAI: out of 152 outbreaks recorded during the
peak season (mid-November 2006 to mid-February 2007) in 66 communes
scattered across the Mekong Delta, only one single outbreak involved
layer ducks that had been vaccinated twice. Therefore, commented
Slingenbergh, continued vaccination in layer ducks appears to be critical.

With ducks the predominant poultry species in the Mekong Delta and
with 80 percent of these [being] layer ducks, the FAO expert believes
that HPAI in the southern part of Viet Nam is well in check. However,
he added, northern Viet Nam requires strengthening with measures
other than vaccination, and the cost of vaccination campaigns cannot
continue to be entirely supported by public funds only.
