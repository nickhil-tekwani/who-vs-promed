Mother Nature might have stepped in to slow down the mass migration of
Asian carp. Thousands of the carp have died mysteriously in the Illinois
River on a 110-mile stretch ranging from Starved Rock State Park in Utica
to Havana.
A biologist with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR) made
the gruesome discovery about 2 weeks ago when he went to the river to
collect live carp for a spawning study. He reportedly found numerous
carcasses weighing about 50 pounds apiece. A witness said a person could
walk across the river on the backs of the fish bodies.
"I was off and did not get to see them," said Steve Schultz, aquatics
nuisance species coordinator for the department. "We suspect a viral
infection, but will not know for sure for a couple of weeks."
It is important to find the cause because the virus could have an effect on
other fish in the river, Schultz said.
"We have ruled out a bacterial infection," he said.

[Hopefully some of the fish were submitted to a diagnostic laboratory and
there will be a follow-up regarding the results. It is unlikely this was
algae, or more than one species of fish would have been affected. There is
no indication if the die-off is continuing.
If this were a prank, such as someone fishing with dynamite, there would be
more than one species of fish. So this is a little odd.
We look forward to the authoritative report of the diagnosis.
Asian carp have been considered an invasive species and are known to grow
quite large and consume large amounts of food. There are currently 5 known
species of Asian carp in the US. These include grass carp
(_Ctenopharyngodon idella_), common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_), silver carp
(_Hypophthalmichthys molotrix_), bighead carp (_H. nobilis_), and black
carp (_Mylopharyngodon piceus_).
As the Asian carp are susceptible to Koi herpes, it is possible that this
sudden die-off may be from this DNA-virus belonging to the virus family
Herpesviridae. However, goldfish (_Carassius auratus_) and grass carp
(_Ctenopharyngodon idella_) are not susceptible to Koi herpes virus (KHV).
Although KHV may affect 82 percent of a population within 24-48 hours, the
environmental conditions must be correct for the virus to gain such a rapid
hold of this many fish. - Mod.TG]
