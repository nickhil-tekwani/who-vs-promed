Avian Influenza in Turkey Spreads toward Europe
-----------------------------------------------
At least 5 more Turks, including 2 small boys and an adult
hospitalized in Ankara, tested positive for H5N1 bird flu on Sunday
[8 Jan 2006], as the deadly virus continued to move westward towards
Europe. A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO)
headed to the worst-hit regions in Turkey's east to assess the
government's response and look for any signs of much-feared
human-to-human transmission of the virus.
2 patients in the eastern city of Van and the cases in Ankara were
victims of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, a health ministry official
told the Anatolia news agency, bringing to 9 the number of people to
have been infected.
2 of those people, 2 children from the same family in eastern Turkey,
died last week, becoming the 1st human fatalities from bird flu
outside Southeast Asia and China, where the disease has killed more
than 70 people since 2003.
The cases in Ankara, situated some 1000 km (620 miles) from the
eastern region where the other infections occurred, mark the further
westward spread of the disease. The 2 boys, aged 2 and 5, were
believed to have touched gloves used by their father to carry to the
authorities 2 wild ducks dead from avian influenza that the man found
earlier this week [1st week January 2006] outside their hometown of
Beypazari, near Ankara, their doctor Metin Dogan said.
"The boys are infected but show no signs of illness at the moment,"
he said. The 3rd patient, a 60-year-old man from an Ankara suburb,
was also in good condition despite contracting the virus after coming
in close contact with chickens he bred, his doctor, Mahmut Koc, said.
In Van, 4 people, including 2 other children, a 5-year-old boy and an
8-year-old girl confirmed as H5N1 carriers, were also undergoing
treatment. "What is encouraging is that [the children's] condition
has improved, and they are currently well," Huseyin Avni Sahin, the
chief physician at the hospital, said.
3 other children, all from the same family and aged between 11 and
15, died in the same hospital over the past week [1st week January
2006] after playing with sick chickens. 2 of them have been confirmed
to have contracted the H5N1 virus. The infected siblings, one of the
new H5N1 cases and most of the other patients undergoing treatment in
Van for bird flu were from the remote town of Dogubeyazit, near the
border with Iran.
Health minister Recep Akdag, who was accompanying the WHO team in the
east, said 12 people were considered as "highly probable" and 32
others as "probable" cases of bird flu. All of them were hospitalized in Van.
There is no indication so far to suggest that the disease is being
transmitted between humans, a possibility which scientists fear may
spark a deadly global pandemic, he said. As dozens of panicked people
rushed to hospitals across the country and the emergency culling of
fowl continued, the presence of the virus among wild birds or poultry
was also confirmed in 2 more regions in western Turkey.
The westernmost point where bird flu has been found since it
resurfaced in Turkey last month [December 2005] is the province of
Bursa, about 240 km (150 miles) from Istanbul. In October 2005, a 1st
outbreak in a region close to Bursa was successfully contained.
Neighboring Syria, meanwhile, announced it was clear of the virus,
with an official denying rumors that a man had died from the disease
near Syria's northern border with Turkey. "There is no case of bird
flu in Syria. All reports of deaths from this illness are rumors,"
said health ministry official Mahmoud Karim, adding that a man died
recently in the northwest of the country from "pulmonary illness."
Russia said on Sunday [8 Jan 2006] that it had been asked by the
World Health Organization to send health experts to Turkey. "At the
moment, we are looking at the request, and the most probable outcome
is that several specialists from the health agency responsible for
monitoring consumer products will leave for Turkey as soon as
possible," Gennady Onishchenko, the agency's head, told the ITAR-TASS
news agency.

Turkey: 3 Suspected Human Cases Near the Capital
-----------------------------------------------
2 children and an adult have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird
flu strain in Turkey's capital, Ankara, the city's governor, Kemal
Onal, has said. These results have not been confirmed by World Health
Organization labs, but are still likely to trigger panic, says the
BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Turkey. If confirmed, they will be Turkey's
1st cases outside the eastern region of Van, about 1000 km (620 miles) away.
A poultry cull is under way in Van to try to contain the virus
outbreak. Our correspondent says the 3 people who tested positive in
Ankara come from a town about one hour's drive from the city. It is
not clear how they could have contracted the disease, although there
were reports of ducks in the town having the virus, our correspondent
adds. The results will now be checked by scientists at the WHO
laboratory in London.
In the eastern town of Dogubeyazit, in Van, 3 children from the same
family died last week, at least 2 of them from the virulent H5N1 bird
flu strain that has killed more than 70 people in Southeast Asia.
Tests are still underway on the 3rd child to see whether she also
died from H5N1. All 3 children -- a 14-year-old boy and his 11 and
15-year-old sisters -- were living in close contact with poultry, and
there is still no evidence that the disease has begun to spread
between humans. Nonetheless, a local hospital has been besieged by
panicked residents seeking treatment for symptoms. 20 people remain
in the hospital in the city of Van under treatment for suspected bird flu.
A team of WHO doctors is in Turkey to help investigate the deaths and
look for any signs of transmission between humans. The WHO has
attempted to play down fears of the disease, as Turkish officials
sought to defend themselves from accusations that they were slow to
act. The cull of all winged animals was only half complete almost a
week after the 1st fatality, our correspondent said on Saturday [7
Jan 2006]. Officials say they have had difficulty persuading people
in the impoverished rural region to deliver all of their poultry up
for slaughter, whether the birds appear healthy or not.
Meanwhile, Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Sunday [8 Jan
2006] that the country's chief epidemiologist has told his countrymen
not to travel to Turkey -- a popular vacation destination for
Russians -- because of the bird flu outbreak. "I earnestly advise
Russian citizens to refrain from traveling to Turkey, especially to
the eastern province of Agri and the city of Dogubeyazit ... where
the situation is particularly alarming," Interfax quoted Gennady
Onishchenko as saying.

Human Avian Influenza Cases Spread West in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
3 Turks were reported to be infected with a deadly strain of bird flu
in the capital Ankara on Sunday [8 Jan 2006], a new step in the
westward march of the virus from its eastern Asian origins.
The 1st case of the virus jumping from birds to humans in western
Asia emerged in Turkey last Wednesday [4 Jan 2006]. 3 children in the
remote eastern Van region died of the highly potent H5N1 strain that
has killed 74 people in east Asia.
Ankara Governor Kemal Onal told the state-run Anatolian news agency
that 2 children, aged 5 and 2, and a 60-year-old adult had been
diagnosed with the infection in the capital, about 400 km (250 miles)
east of Istanbul, Turkey's densely populated largest city, and the
Mediterranean area.
The agency said a 5-year-old boy had also been admitted to the
hospital with suspected bird flu in Corum in central Turkey.
2 children have already tested positive for the H5N1 strain in Van,
about 800 km (500 miles) east of Ankara. The 2 infected children in
the hospital in Ankara were brought from nearby Beypazari after
contact with dead wild birds. Their parents tested negative for the
disease, doctors said. A separate family sent to hospital in Istanbul
on Friday [6 Jan 2006] displaying bird flu symptoms also tested negative.
It seems highly likely the children who died in Van region also
caught the virus directly from chickens. But world health authorities
worry that human exposure to the bird flu could lead to the emergence
of a mutation allowing easier transmission between humans, raising
the prospect of a global pandemic. A team of World Health
Organization doctors is in Turkey to help investigate the deaths and
look for any signs of transmission between humans. But harsh wintry
weather in the Van region is hampering their movements, the WHO said.
Moscow raised the prospect of economic damage to Turkey's vital
tourist industry, warning Russians against traveling to Turkey after
the human infections. Iran, which borders the Turkish region worst
affected by the outbreak, closed one of its border crossings, forcing
many Turks traveling there for this week's major Muslim holiday
marking the Feast of the Sacrifice, to return home, Anatolian said.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has appealed to Turks to help in a mass
cull aimed at stemming the advance of the virus and promised adequate
compensation to farmers and families who rely on poultry for their
living. But in the Dogubayazit district hit by the virus, local
people have accused the authorities of being slow to act. A Reuters
reporter saw chickens still walking on the streets and some escaping
as they were about to be carried in large bags to be buried alive in pits.
The father of the 3 dead children in eastern Turkey told Reuters they
had not known bird flu was still a threat, after authorities said
they had successfully suppressed an outbreak among poultry in the
west of the country. "Nobody warned us ... We thought the bird flu
had passed," he said, adding that it was the custom in rural Turkey
for families to kill and eat sick birds.
The virus spreads quickly among chickens, killing them in a day, and
the best way to control it is immediately to slaughter all poultry in
an affected area. This can be difficult in places where, as in
eastern Turkey, people keep small backyard flocks. Poverty also
greatly hampers the fight against the disease.

[Additional, possibly significant, information from these reports is
that: Although the number of independently confirmed cases is given
variously as 2 to 4, another 12 people are considered as "highly
probable" and 32 others as "probable" cases of bird flu; so far, the
parents of infected children have tested negative; and in the case of
2 of the Ankara patients, contact with gloves used to handle dead
wild ducks are the suspected source of the virus. - Mod.CP]
