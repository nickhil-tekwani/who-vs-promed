[1] J&J booster
Date: Mon 4 Oct 2021
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/us/politics/johnson-vaccine-booster-coronavirus.html


Johnson & Johnson is planning to ask federal regulators early this week to authorize a booster shot of its coronavirus vaccine, according to officials familiar with the company's plans. The firm is the last of the 3 federally authorized vaccine providers to call for extra injections, amid mounting evidence that at least the elderly and other high-risk groups need more protection.

Federal officials have become increasingly worried that the more than 15 million Americans who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine face too much risk of severe COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] on [Fri 1 Oct 2021] scheduled a meeting on [15 Oct 2021] of its expert advisory committee to discuss whether to grant emergency use authorization of a booster shot of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine.

That is part of a broader effort by the government to shore up the protection provided by all 3 vaccines. Regulators last month [September 2021] authorized a booster shot for many recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine and are contemplating doing the same this month for recipients of Moderna's.

The fact that the advisory committee meeting on Johnson & Johnson was scheduled even before the company filed an application to the FDA reflects a particular sense of urgency in the Biden administration to provide more protection to recipients of that vaccine. Although the federal government has emphasized for months that all 3 vaccines are highly effective, a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] found that Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine was only 71% effective against hospitalization from COVID-19, compared with 88% for Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine and 93% for Moderna's.

"Real-world data suggest that the 2-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine regimens provide more protection" than the single dose of Johnson & Johnson, the researchers said. Other research found that Johnson & Johnson recipients were more likely to have breakthrough infections or symptomatic COVID-19 than recipients of the other 2 vaccines.

Johnson & Johnson cites some studies with better results: A study of nearly 2 million people, funded by the company, estimated that the vaccine was 81% effective against hospitalization. Other research suggests that protection from Johnson & Johnson's vaccine does not wane over time like protection from Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine.

Nonetheless, Johnson & Johnson now appears to agree with federal officials that a single shot of its vaccine is not enough. Last month [September 2021], the company announced that a 2nd dose, given 2 months after the 1st, increased the vaccine's effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 by about 22 percentage points, to 94%. The firm also said 2 shots were 100% effective against severe disease, although that estimate was less conclusive.

"The data shows that there is a dramatic increase in efficacy when the boost is given at 2 months. And we believe that it's potentially even better when given later," said Dr Dan H Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who helped develop the vaccine. "I'm not a public health authority, but I would say it's scientifically reasonable for people who are desiring a higher level of efficacy to obtain a booster shot" between 2 -- 6 months after the 1st shot of the vaccine, he said.

At a meeting of a CDC advisory committee in September [2021], some independent experts questioned whether Johnson & Johnson recipients were being forgotten while the federal government moved to authorize a 3rd shot for Pfizer recipients. "To me, the biggest policy question out there is the Johnson & Johnson," Dr Helen Keipp Talbot, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said at the meeting last month [September 2021], where the committee weighed whether to recommend a 3rd shot for some Pfizer recipients. "I worry we're getting distracted by the question of boosters of Pfizer when we have bigger and more important things to do in the pandemic."

Dr Nirav D Shah, Maine's top health official and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said that after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine became available this spring, many states directed it to rural areas because it required only one injection and was easier to transport. "It is rural areas that are getting particularly hit right now" by the delta variant, Dr Shah said. "So I think there is good reason to offer J & J recipients a booster if the data support it."

[Johnson & Johnson confirmed the New York Times report. "The company pointed to its (21 Sep 2021) press release, saying that it has submitted data to the FDA and plans to submit it to other regulators, the World Health Organization and other vaccine advisory groups worldwide.

Johnson & Johnson also released data at that time showing that a 2nd shot of its vaccine given about 2 months after the 1st increased its effectiveness to 94% against moderate to severe forms of the disease https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/johnson-johnson-seek-fda-booster-shot-authorization-week-paper-says-n1280692. - Mod.LK]

[2] Portugal: total population immunized
Date: Fri 1 Oct 2021
Source: New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/world/europe/portugal-vaccination-rate.html


Portugal is among the most highly vaccinated countries in the world. Vice Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, who led the campaign, said there was a key to his success: keep politics out of it!

Portugal's health care system was on the verge of collapse. Hospitals in the capital, Lisbon, were overflowing and the authorities were asking people to treat themselves at home. In the last week of January [2021], nearly 2000 people died as the virus spread. The country's vaccine program was in a shambles, so the government turned to Gouveia e Melo, a former submarine squadron commander, to right the ship.

Eight months later, Portugal is among the world's leaders in vaccinations, with roughly 86% of its population of 10.3 million fully vaccinated. About 98% of all of those eligible for vaccines -- meaning anyone over 12 -- have been fully vaccinated, Admiral Gouveia e Melo said. "We believe we have reached the point of group protection and nearly herd immunity," he said. "Things look very good."

On [Friday 1 Oct 2021], Portugal ended nearly all of its coronavirus restrictions. There has been a sharp drop in new cases, to about 650 a day, and vanishingly few deaths. Many Western nations fortunate enough to have abundant vaccine supplies have seen inoculation rates plateau, with more than 20% of their populations still unprotected. So other governments are looking to Portugal for possible insights and are watching closely to see what happens when nearly every eligible person is protected.

False dawns in the coronavirus pandemic have been as common as new nightmare waves of infection. So Portugal could still see a setback as the delta variant continues to spread globally. There have been worrying signs from Israel and elsewhere that protection offered by vaccines can fade over time, and a worldwide debate is raging over who should be offered booster shots and when. Portugal may soon start offering boosters to older people and those deemed clinically vulnerable, Admiral Gouveia e Melo said, and he was confident they could all be reached by the end of December [2021].

But for the moment, as bars and nightclubs buzz with life, infections dwindle and deaths plummet, the country's vaccination drive has succeeded even after encountering many of the same hurdles that caused others to flounder.

The same flood of misinformation about vaccines has filled the social media accounts of the Portuguese. The country is run by a minority left-wing government, which reflects its political divisions. And, according to public opinion polls, there was widespread doubt about the vaccines when they first arrived. Admiral Gouveia e Melo has been credited with turning it around. With a background working on complicated logistical challenges in the military, he was named in February [2021] to lead the national vaccination task force.

The admiral made a point of wearing his combat uniform in his many public and television appearances as he sought to essentially draft the nation into one collective pandemic-fighting force. "The first thing is to make this thing a war," he said in an interview, recalling how he approached the job. "I use not only the language of war, but military language."

While politicians around the world have used similar martial rhetoric, he said it was critical to his success that he was widely seen as detached from politics. He quickly assembled a team of some 3 dozen people, led by elite military personnel -- including mathematicians, doctors, analysts and strategic experts from Portugal's Army, Air Force and Navy. Asked what other countries can do to bolster their own vaccination efforts, he did not hesitate to offer his best advice. "They need to find people who are not politicians," he said.

Before the pandemic, Portugal was fortunate to have a robust national vaccination program. It grew out of the country's devastating experience battling polio, which was still affecting the country after Admiral Gouveia e Melo was born in 1960. He recalls when the daughter of a family friend fell ill from the disease and the suffering that followed.

Manuela Ivone da Cunha, a Portuguese anthropologist who has studied anti-vaccination movements, said that "vaccine doubters and anti-vaxxers are in the minority in Portugal, and they are also less vocal" than they are in many other countries. Leonor Beleza, a former Portuguese health minister who is now the president of the Champalimaud medical foundation, said Portugal's rollout clearly benefited from the discipline stemming from the nomination of a military officer. "He formulated a communications policy about what was happening that gave credibility and trust," she said.

As the task force devised the most efficient system to safely stream the most people through inoculation centers, they used troops to build confidence in the system. People could see the vaccines were safe as soldier after soldier got shots. At the same time, the task force made a point of showing doctors and nurses getting their shots, as well, to drive home the message of vaccine safety. Admiral Gouveia e Melo said the consistency of the messaging was critical.

Still, as the campaign moved onto younger age groups over the summer -- with less than half of the public vaccinated -- there were signs that resistance was building. In a submarine, the admiral said, you are in a slow ship trying to catch faster ships. "You have to position yourself and be smart about how to do it," he said, "and seize the opportunity when it arrives." In July [2021], Admiral Gouveia e Melo seized such an opportunity. Protesters were blocking the entrance to a vaccination center in Lisbon, so he donned his combat uniform and went there with no security detail. "I went through these crazy people," he said. "They started to call me 'murderer, murderer.'"

As the television cameras rolled, the admiral calmly stood his ground. "I said the murderer is the virus," Gouveia e Melo recalled. The true killer, he said, would be people who live like it is the 13th century without any notion of reality. "I attempted to communicate in a very true and honest way about all doubts and problems," he said.

But not everybody welcomed his approach. "We don't really have a culture of questioning authorities," said Laura Sanches, a clinical psychologist who has criticized Portugal's mass vaccination rollout as too militaristic and called for it to exclude younger people. "And the way he always presented himself in camouflage army suits -- as if he was fighting a war -- together with the language used by the media and the politicians, has contributed to a feeling of fear that also makes us more prone to obey and not question," she said.

Still, the public messaging campaign -- including an aggressive television and media blitz -- made steady progress. "In the beginning, we had some 40% who were unsure," Gouveia e Melo said. Now, according to polls, he said, only 2.2% do not want the vaccine. As he stepped down from the task force this week, the admiral said he felt the country was on a good course. But, ever the submariner, he cautioned that vigilance would remain essential to ensuring that this war was won.

[Data from the General Directorate of Health [DGS] has revealed that there is only one municipality in Portugal that is considered to be at "extreme risk" from COVID-19 infections. Alcoutim, in the Algarve, and the country currently has only 2 at "very high risk", according to the latest epidemiological bulletin of the DGS.

The extreme risk of infection occurs when a municipality has a cumulative incidence of 14 days above 960 cases of infection per 100 000 inhabitants. The new report from the authorities reveals that the municipality of Alcoutim is now at this level with 1252 cases in the analysis referring to the cumulative incidence of 14 days between (16 and 29 Sep 2021). In the explanatory note of the data by municipality, it is stated that the cumulative incidence "corresponds to the quotient between the number of new confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to the moment of analysis and the estimated resident population".

At very high risk, that is, with an incidence of between 480 and 959.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, there are only 2 municipalities, 5 less than the previous week: Barrancos (801) and Vidigueira (566). Between 240 and 479.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 14 days, the bulletin reports the existence of 16 municipalities in these conditions, 3 less than in the last analysis.

According to the bulletin, between 120 and 239.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 14 days are in 53 municipalities, 25 less than in the previous week.

The list of municipalities with zero cases of infection in the period between (16 and 29 Sep 2021) and is growing. In this situation are 32 of the 308 municipalities, almost double compared to the previous report, which registered 17 municipalities without new cases.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the deadliest in US history, with more than 700 000 Americans succumbing, and counting. According to Johns Hopkins University, the United States has recorded 702 444 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began more than 18 months ago. The country has seen 43 799 517 COVID-19 cases in total.

Yesterday [Sun 3 Oct 2021] US officials reported 25 215 new COVID-19 cases and 237 deaths. The 7-day average of new daily cases is 106 725, with 1907 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week, new daily cases fell 9.6%, deaths fell 4.5%, and hospitalizations fell 11.2%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic]

Stressed hospitals in several states
------------------------------------
Though the summer surge caused by the delta (B1617. 2) variant seems to be officially dwindling, several states are still experiencing overcrowded hospitals.

North Dakota governor Doug Burgum and state health leaders warned late last week that hospital capacity in that state is reaching critical levels. "The pressure on hospitals and clinics in both our urban and rural areas is reaching critical levels, and we all need to do our part to avoid hospitalization and prevent further strain on these facilities and their staff as we work through this incredibly challenging time," Burgum said. North Dakota health officials are urging everyone to get flu shots as soon as possible, as well as COVID-19 vaccines.

And Alaska has now activated crisis standards of care for 20 healthcare facilities. State officials said oxygen supplies are limited, as well as medical staff.

Other US developments
---------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 55.9% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 64.8% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 2.9% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster shot.
