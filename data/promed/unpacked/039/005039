Food poisoning: 80 of marriage party taken ill
-----------------------------------------------
Over 80 members of a marriage party fell ill after consuming food
served at the marriage function on Sunday afternoon, 9 Apr 2006. Most
of the affected were from Bidar in Karnataka and came to the city to
attend the marriage. All of the affected were shifted to 2 hospitals,
where their condition is said to be stable.
Over 300 members attended the marriage and had their lunch at around
1:00 p.m. The invitees were served mutton biryani, kaddu ka kheer,
brinjal curry and other items. Within 30 minutes, 84 members
complained of vomiting and giddiness, and some of them fell
unconscious.
Police and relatives shifted all of them to Fever Hospital. 2
children were later shifted to Niloufer Hospital. While 42 of them
were admitted as inpatients, the others were treated as outpatients.
Doctors said the condition of all the affected was stable.
"The majority of the invitees came from Bidar to attend the marriage.
All of us had lunch at around 1:00 p.m., and within one hour, we
developed vomiting and giddiness," said an attendee from Bidar.
Police suspect contamination of the food might be the reason for the
incident. Police said the utensils used for preparing the food were
recently given a tin coating, which could also be the reason for the
food poisoning.

The very short latent period of this emesis-associated illness (less
than one hour) suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion.
A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually
caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic
container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The
illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care.
In addition to the emesis, other clues may include the liquid being
described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause
requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential
differences in the illnesses exist, including a longer incubation
period (several hours) for zinc, vomiting and diarrhea for tin, and
blue or green vomitus for copper. For more information regarding
these and other food-borne illnesses, the reader is referred to CDC's
2001 MMWR on the subject at
