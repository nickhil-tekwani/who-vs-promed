Legionellosis in Paris, France
Since early June 1998, 19 cases of legionellosis have been identified among
visitors to Paris. Ten of the cases were French nationals and 9 were
tourists from other European countries. All cases occurred between 6 June
and 3 July. Three patients died. Ten of the cases had visited the 9th
arrondissement (administrative area of Paris) while 7 had visited the
adjacent 2nd arrondissement. Specimens from 4 patients were sent to the
National Reference Centre for Legionellosis and found to be of identical type.
Investigations to identify the source of the outbreak are being carried out
but no results have been obtained to date. As a precautionary measure,
owners of cooling towers in the 2nd and 9th arrondissements have been
ordered to clean and disinfect their installations. No new cases have been
detected since 3 July 1998. Heightened surveillance and investigations to
identify the source continue.
