After reporting just under 70 000 cases of the viral infection, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in 2016, cases increased several times in 2017, according to data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan via the World Health Organization (WHO).

Last year [2017], officials reported 358 764 HFMD cases, the most since 2015, when more than 380 000 cases were reported.

HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate, and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers, and soles, which generally persist for 7-10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.

It is spread to others by close personal contact, coughing, or sneezing or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. It can be difficult to eradicate in schools, group living communities, and daycares. Although it is not serious for most people, the infection can cause significant pain while eating, walking, and writing.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus is the most common cause of HFMD.

[According to the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Situation update number 531 from WHO dated 16 Jan 2018, in their surveillance summary for HFMD in the Western Pacific region, "The number of HFMD cases reported in week 52 of 2017 [week of 29 Dec 2017] was 1312. As of 31 Dec 2017, there have been 358 764 HFMD cases reported in 2017, and this follows seasonal trends of the same period observed between 2010 and 2016 (Figure 2 -- HFMD cases reported weekly by sentinel sites 2010-2017, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_report_20180116.pdf)

While the seasonal trend is the same, the figure shows the significant increase observed in 2017, similar to the levels seen in 2015 and 2011. 2013 had slightly less activity than 2017. 2012, 2014, and 2016 were low years. Individual cases and outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) occur around the world. In countries with temperate climates, such as Japan, cases occur more often in the spring to fall. Studies are underway to determine why these outbreaks occur and why some people have severe disease. Development of treatments and vaccines to help prevent HFMD in the future is also ongoing (see [2] below). - Mod.LK

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the viruses known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease in humans. As it is closely related to poliovirus, EV71 has been the focus of much research.

Although hand-foot-mouth disease typically presents with mild symptoms of skin rash and fever, sometimes it can develop into a more severe, life-threatening condition.

These severe neurological complications can have serious effects, including brainstem encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary oedema, and cardiopulmonary failure. In some cases, infection of the nervous system by EV71 can cause long term neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

Since there are currently no effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents against EV71, there has been a keen interest in determining how EV71 achieves its neurological effects.

To determine the molecular mechanisms used in EV71 infection, researchers at the National University of Singapore analysed the proteins present in human cells infected with EV71.

Further analyses were conducted on proteins whose levels were found to change during infection with EV71. These included inactivating the genes encoding the target proteins prior to infection with EV71.

It appeared that the human protein prohibitin (PHB) was needed by EV71 in order to enter motor neuron cells. Prohibitin is associated with a vast array of functions, such as regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, mitochondrial protein folding, and as a cell-surface receptor.

The researchers demonstrated that prohibitin is present on the surface of motor neuron cells and used by the EV71 virus to gain access to motor neuron cells. Once inside the cell, EV71 uses mitochondrial prohibitin to obtain the energy required to replicate and cause further infection.

A current anti-cancer drug, rocaglamide, is known to inhibit the activity of prohibitin. The researchers therefore tested whether rocaglamide had any effect on the infection of neuronal cells with EV71.

Rocaglamide was found to significantly reduce levels of the virus in neuronal cells compared with untreated cells. In addition, administration of rocaglamide prolonged the life of mice infected with EV71 and reduced the amount of virus present in their spinal cord and brain compared with untreated, EV71-infected mice.

The researchers commented, "This study identifies prohibitin as the 1st host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 infection of the CNS. Prohibitin is a druggable target (targeted by rocaglamide) and as such, it is hoped that our work paves the way towards an effective treatment able to prevent the neurological complications associated with EV71 infections."

It is hoped that treatment with rocaglamide may help prevent or limit the neurological complications of EV71 infection.

This research also opens up the possibility of developing new treatments for EV71 infection that target prohibitin. Further studies are required to explore the potential of anti-prohibitin treatments in the management of EV71 infection.

[EV71 is one of several viruses that can cause HFMD. While the disease is usually mild, EV71 sometimes leads to neurological complications in young children. Because of this, EV71 has received increased attention as a cause of HFMD. This research has opened a door to find a means of preventing neurologic complications following infection with this virus. - Mod.LK]
