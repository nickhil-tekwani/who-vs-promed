No epidemic encephalitis outbreak in Gansu: official
--------------------------------------------------
The recent encephalitis outbreak among children in Tianshui, a city
in northwest China's Gansu Province, was neither epidemic
encephalitis nor encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis], but a sort
of viral encephalitis [pure speculation without laboratory
confirmation - Mod.RY], according to Wang Jian, director of the
city's disease control and prevention center.

At a press conference held Friday morning by the provincial health
authority, Wang said from 4 Mar to 23 Jun 2005, 2 hospitals in
Tianshui received 153 ill children aged between 1 and 13 with fevers
and headaches. 53 boys and 30 girls were diagnosed as having viral
encephalitis. Of the remaining 70 cases, 23 were suspected and 47
were ruled out as having encephalitis.

Currently, there are still 42 children under observation and medical
treatment, of whom 13 have been diagnosed as having viral
encephalitis, Wang said. The children are expected to leave the
hospital in the near future.

Earlier reports suggested the encephalitis breakout had something to
do with an encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] vaccine injection
in some kindergartens in Tianshui. But the Friday press conference
ruled out the possibility.

The cause of the breakout remains unknown, and blood samples have
been sent to the China Disease Control and Prevention Center in
Beijing for virus separation.

[This is an official statement from both provincial and city health
authorities. Essentially it says that there has been no epidemic
encephalitis outbreak in Gansu. Though no laboratory evidence was
offered, the officials suspect that the outbreak is attributable to
some sort of viral encephalitis, but nothing to do with Japanese
encephalitis.

Meanwhile, the following was brought to our attention by a usually
reliable source from China. A similar report from the ChinaNews in
Chinese, said, "The 150 children in Tianshui city had viral
encephalitis. An echovirus was the suspected pathogen. The disease
has no connection with the JE vaccine, though some of the sick
children had JE vaccination before the onset of the symptoms. Most
children recovered; only 6 remain in hospital."

This report mentions an echovirus for the first time, though again,
no laboratory evidence was offered. With their name derived from the
acronym Enteric Cytopathic Human Orphan, echoviruses are a group of
enteroviruses that commonly cause gastrointestinal infections and
skin rashes. More serious infections are seen less frequently.
Echoviruses cause a wide variety of conditions, including acute
gastroenteritis, viral pharyngitis, herpangina (mouth sores), croup,
upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, pericarditis, myocarditis,
aseptic meningitis and encephalitis.

The over 3-month-old outbreak of suspected viral encephalitis in
Gansu remains largely enigmatic. ProMED would appreciate further
information from colleagues familiar with the field. -Mod.RY]
