RABIES, BATS - USA (MULTISTATE) (04)

In most areas, only a small proportion of bats are actually rabid. In
Washington State, the prevalence of rabies in captured bats tested
following human exposure is about 10 percent.
Many state and local health jurisdictions don't have the resources to perform
bat removal. What most of us can provide are post-exposure recommendations
following contact with bats or other potentially rabid animals inside or
outside the home, and possibly, referral to local private companies that
specialize in "bat-proofing" of buildings.

[In the previous posting, ProMED-mail 20040909.25, the moderator said
the public health authorities should be contacted when bats get into
a home. Indeed, most public health authorities are not the one to
remove the bats, but they are the ones to advise about post-exposure
measures, and that may be more critical, as people can be bitten by
bats and not realize it. - Mod.TG]
[Strange as that may seem, they are many cases on record where the victim
could not remember being bitten, but the rabies strain recovered from the
victim was shown by lab tests to be a bat strain -- see ProMED Rabies, human -
USA: MMWR reports 20001218.2215. - Mod.JW]
