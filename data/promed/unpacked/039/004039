How diet pill chemical dinitrophenol (DNP) kills
-------------------------------------------------
On Sunday, 12 Apr 2015, a 21-year-old female took diet pills she'd bought over the internet. Later that day she was dead. Police said the tablets were believed to contain dinitrophenol, known as DNP -- a highly toxic industrial chemical. An inquest in Shrewsbury [England] concluded that the death of this woman was as a result of an accidental drugs overdose. Her mum told Newsbeat it's not a quick fix for losing a bit of weight but a "one-way trip."

The deceased, from Shrewsbury, was studying Families and Childhood Studies at Glyndwr University. "She was not overweight," said her mum. "She genuinely didn't understand how dangerous this stuff was. This drug wouldn't let her muscles stop ... it just kept saying, burn, burn. You know we're all distraught."

When victim started to feel unwell, she drove herself to hospital, walked into A&E, and told them calmly what she'd done. "At that point she was still fine, she looked okay," said [her mother], but not long after that "they realised the situation was just desperate." 'Two tablets would have been lethal, she took 8'.

Her mum has a degree in chemistry, and understands the dangers only too well. "This is a drug that speeds up your metabolism, it's not dissimilar to the explosive TNT. It makes your muscles burn faster, burn off energy, you know, release heat. Your heart races faster, your temperature goes up." Fiona says it's like running and wanting to stop but not being able to: "Your muscles must be crying with pain as they're forced to exercise."

There was nothing the doctors could do to get the drug out of her system; they tried desperately to cool her down, but couldn't. "They were going to have to let it run its course and just try and support her body as it deteriorated." Staff in A&E were so busy trying to save this woman that they weren't able to contact the woman's mother until after her death. "So she was on her own there was nobody with her," says [her mother]. [The mother] said her daughter was a "real outgoing character" and she'd been shopping in Chester with her sister the day before, and bought lots of new clothes. "She never intended to do this to herself."

An inquest has been opened and adjourned until [2 Jul 2015] in Shrewsbury.

[This was not an accidental death. This woman deliberately took those 8 diet pills. There seems to be the mindset that if a little does some good a lot will do a lot of good. Instructions are there for a reason. They should be followed. Sadly these were purchased over the internet, so getting to the real culprit may be difficult. These pills may be from China as they tend to be a large supplier of these pills. (Please see ProMED-mail posting 20150517.3368465.)

DNP is often found as bright yellow pills or capsules. Bright yellow DNP powder is produced as a pesticide at chemical factories in Turkey and China. It is then made into easy-to-swallow capsules by dealers who sell them online as weight-loss pills.

2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is reported to cause rapid loss of weight, but unfortunately is associated with an unacceptably high rate of significant adverse effects. DNP is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names as a weight loss/slimming aid. It causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation; the classic symptom complex associated with toxicity of phenol-based products such as DNP is a combination of hyperthermia [elevated body temperature], tachycardia [rapid heart rate], diaphoresis [perspiration] and tachypnoea [rapid breathing], eventually leading to death. Fatalities related to exposure to DNP have been reported since [1918 from occupational exposure]. To date, there have been 62 published deaths in the medical literature attributed to DNP.

This number is likely to climb, and the obsession with slim bodies, idolized in movies, places perceived pressures on some people to pursue any means to lose weight. However, this article and research into DNP's affects on the body show clearly that they include extreme heat, essentially cooking one's body from the inside out. While there is a boost in metabolic rate generally associated with weight loss, it is also a fatal fire raging on the inside of the body for which there is no treatment. Consuming small amounts over longer periods can lead to cataracts and skin lesions and can affect the heart, blood and nervous system.

Prior to access by unscrupulous businesses, DNP was outlawed in many countries because it caused death in unsuspecting dieters.
