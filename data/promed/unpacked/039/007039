The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish is investigating a fish die off at Quemado Lake, following reports earlier this week [week of 6 Aug 2018] that fish in the lake were dying.

The die-off affected multiple species including tiger muskies, goldfish, grass carp, crayfish, and fathead minnows and is being attributed to low oxygen levels.

"Due to recent weather patterns across the state, including drought and high temperatures, die-offs have also been noted in the Pecos River, Coyote Creek, Rancho Grande Ponds, and areas around Elephant Butte," said Eric Frey, sportfish program manager.

Fish that are caught using legal fishing equipment are safe to consume, however, it is not recommended to collect and consume fish that are dead or dying.

The department will continue to evaluate waters statewide and will stock fish in waters that remain healthy for the fish. Waters that have been affected by die offs will be restocked when water conditions are suitable.

[The most common cause of fish die-offs as the one described above is reduced oxygen in the water, which in turn may be caused by several factors that might interact among them, such as drought, algae bloom, or an increase in water temperature. According to the text, the most likely origin of this episode is a combination of climatic and limnological factors. - Mod.PMB
