[Items 2, 3, and 4 include new data, added since the previous update of 1 Feb 2019; references omitted. The next update is expected 15 Feb 2019].

The following includes mainly new data, added since 11 Jan 2019. For the included Chinese references*, please refer to the source URL. - Mod.AS]

1. Overview
China: Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Yunnan, Hunan and Guizhou, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Guangdong and Gansu provinces, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing municipalities, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions.

Mongolia: Bulgan, Darkhan-Uul, Dundgovi, Orkhon, Selenge, Tuv provinces and Ulaanbaatar.

2.Situation update

China:

Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning province on 3 Aug 2018, 105 ASF outbreaks detected in 25 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities. More than 950 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

[Since the previous update, 1 Feb 2019, one new] ASF outbreak occurred on one farm with 4600 pigs in Hunan province, Yongzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone, Yongzhou City.

Mongolia:

Since the Mongolia Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry reported the 1st ASF outbreak on 15 Jan 2019, 10 ASF outbreaks were reported in 6 provinces (aimags); the virus was also detected in meat/meat product in Ulaanbaatar City.

No new ASF outbreaks reported during this period [1-8 Feb 2019].

3. [New] actions taken by China
A. On 29 Jan 2019, MARA released the 2019 edition of the ASF Epidemic Emergency Implementation Plan. The latest version has

1) clarified diagnosis and reporting procedures;
2) increased the outbreak classification from 3 levels to 4 levels (I: highly important, II: significant, III: relatively larger, and IV: general), specified corresponding response measures according to different levels, and strictly restricted the transportation of pig products from high-risk areas to low-risk areas;
3) optimized emergency response measures and conditions to lift movement control, and to restart production; and
4) increased technical requirements for the sampling, diagnosis, disinfection, and destruction. In terms of emergency measures, there are 5 adjustments: 1) disposal measures during transport; 2) conditions to cull (instead of culling all pigs in the epidemic zone, test all farms in the zone using a virological test, and cull only farms tested positive); 3) optimization of conditions to lift movement restriction (use of sentinel pigs can shorten the period from 42 days to 30 days); 4) conditions to restart a slaughterhouse (can restart after 48 hours if all conditions are met); and 5) conditions to restart production at a farm (use of sentinel pigs can shorten the period from 6 months to 45 days).

B. Dried pork produced in Jiangsu province and another with unknown origin confiscated at Songshan Airport, Taiwan province, tested positive for ASF virus. The gene sequence was 100% matching with the ASF virus in other parts of China.

[On top of the information in the above excerpts, additional ASF-related information from China and Mongolia, including FAO's recommendations regarding other countries of the region, national considerations, interregional collaboration and solidarity, and a summary of FAO's actions so far, is included. There is also a table presenting a list of affected cities in each infected province since 3 Aug 2018, a figure illustrating the number of ASF-reported villages by region and onset month, and a map presenting the 103 outbreaks since the start of the event.

Mongolia submitted its 2nd follow-up report on 29 Jan 2019; it is available, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29337. This referred to the ASF virus circulation in the aimags Selenge and Darkhan-Uul.

OIE's summary of the Mongolian event, as of 27 Jan 2019, is as follows:
Total outbreaks = 10 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / not available / 561 / 561 / 757 / 0

In view of its extensive spread, it was suspected that the actual introduction of the ASF virus into Mongolia could have taken place at an undefined time prior to its detection. In March 2017, the virus was identified in Russia's oblast Irkutsk, adjacent to Mongolia's northern aimag Selenge, which is currently known to be infected (see archive no. 20170328.4929925). - Mod.AS
