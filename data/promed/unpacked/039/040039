The Virginia Department of Health does not know and may never know
from which body of water a Virginia child contracted a deadly
infection from an amoeba.

"In all likelihood, we're never going to pinpoint exactly where this
amoeba was acquired," said Dr. Keri Hall, the state epidemiologist.

Her department received results from an autopsy Friday [12 Aug 2011]
that confirmed the cause of death as primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis, which is caused by _Naegleria fowleri_. She said
the amoebas, which swim up the nose and enter the brain, live in
freshwater bodies around the world.

Hall's department has not tested area lakes, ponds and rivers where
the patient spent time at a fishing camp the week before his death.
Her department will "probably" do testing at various ponds and lakes
in the region, but she said she doesn't know when the tests will be
conducted and doesn't expect the sampling to be "particularly
helpful."

The amoebas are particularly prevalent in shallow, still water during
warm weather. But since the patient died, temperatures have dropped,
and the amoeba population likely has fallen off as a result, Hall
said.

The patient attended a camp run by the Richmond-based Virginia Fishing
Adventures the week before he died and had been dunked the 1st day of
camp. She believes that's when he took in the fatal, contaminated
water.

The amoeba swims up the nose, through the sinuses and into the space
around the brain, causing meningoencephalitis -- inflammation of the
brain and its lining -- in a day to 2 weeks, said Dr. Michael Edmond,
epidemiologist for VCU Medical Center and chief of infectious
diseases.

He said the Virginia Department of Health asked him not to release the
names of the water bodies where the patient and other campers went
fishing. He said the agency did not suggest that he take his campers
fishing in other locations the rest of the summer.

"The health department has told us they feel comfortable with us going
back to all the places where we've been," Clarkson said.

However, he said he has made some changes in the way the camps
operate, including spending more time fishing in the James River
rather than in ponds, where amoebas are more likely to multiply. He
has also warned campers to hold their noses if they go underwater and
to try not to swallow fresh water.

Edmond said stagnant waters such as ponds and lakes pose more risks
than moving waters. "Personally, I wouldn't swim in a pond, no matter
what," he said. "The water isn't clean."

Though this is the 1st case of an amoeba death in Virginia since 1969,
more than 100 people have died from amoebas in the U.S. since 1962.

Last week, a 16-year-old Florida girl died of an infection that
officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
confirmed was the same deadly amoeba. Meningoencephalitis causes brain
swelling and is often fatal.

A 16-year-old girl in Brevard County Florida, near Orlando, has died
from an infection with the _Naegleria fowleri_ amoeba that is commonly
found in warm freshwater, including lakes, rivers, and ponds.
_Naegleria_ usually isn't found in well-maintained swimming pools or
hot tubs.

The teen likely got the infection while swimming in the St. Johns
River with her family.

Although these infections are very often deadly, they are fortunately
very rare. There are only about 2 to 3 cases a year in the United
States. This is the time of year when _Naegleria fowleri_ infections,
which cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), most commonly
occur, from July to September. And they are also most likely to occur
in southern states.

Water isn't usually tested for this amoeba parasite because testing
takes several weeks, _Naegleria_ is commonly found in freshwater, and
the numbers of amoebas in water can vary over time. Parents should
therefore understand that there is a very low risk of these infections
when swimming in freshwater. They should try to avoid warm freshwater
when the water temperature is high and the water level is low; avoid
stirring up the sediment when in shallow, warm freshwater, since that
is where the amoebas are thought to live; consider holding your nose
shut or using nose clips when in warm freshwater, at least when
jumping into the water, since amoeba infect people by 1st entering
their noses.

Again, remember that this is a rare infection, and you should keep the
risk in perspective with other things that are much more high risk.
When entering the water, there is a much higher risk of drowning, and
that likely isn't keeping you out of the water, although your kids are
hopefully wearing a lifejacket if they can't swim well or are on a
boat or jet ski, etc.

[Infections with free-living amoeba like _Naegleria fowleri_ occur
sporadically, and the 2 cases are not related. We agree with the
health authorities in Virginia that testing of lakes and ponds for
free living amoebas may not be "particularly helpful." Indeed, most
lakes and ponds will be expected to have these amoebas. Infections in
humans are very rare, most probably due to the fact that most
free-living amoebas do not grow well at a temperature of 37 C.

ProMED chose to post these latest reports and thanks readers for
submitting other links to reports of the 2 cases. - Mod.EP]

[As there are usually just 2 or 3 reported cases in a year, the
occurrence of 2 cases in a short period of time has one wonder if
there might be an increase this year [2011] possibly related to the
prolonged heat waves experienced throughout the USA, with temperatures
in some areas greater than 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) sustained
for 3 or more weeks.
