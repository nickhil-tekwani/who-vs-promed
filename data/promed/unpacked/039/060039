The connections between the death of a 2-year-old boy and the violent illness suffered by 3 other children earlier this month weren't at first apparent. But on Fri 28 Jun 2019, public health officials zeroed in on the common denominator: all 4 tested positive for _E.coli_ bacteria and all 4 had visited animals at the San Diego County Fair.

The discovery prompted the closure of all animal exhibits Sat 29 Jun 2019, a safety measure that will remain in effect through the remainder of the fair's 2019 run set to end 4 Jul 2019. While the cluster of cases has not yet been definitively linked to fair animals, in part because testing is not yet complete, the decision to shut down the public livestock exhibits, including the popular petting zoo, seemed prudent. The livestock auction, which took place in a different area and does not allow the public to have direct contact with animals, went forward as scheduled Sat 29 Jun 2019.

"We have taken this step to restrict access to animals at the fair in an abundance of caution," Dr Eric McDonald, a county public health official, said at a news conference. "We may find, as the investigation develops, as we develop genetic fingerprints of these organisms, that these cases are not related, that these just happened to be cases that occurred during the summer when it's more common for these types of cases to occur."

A 2-year-old visited the Del Mar Fairgrounds on 15 Jun 2019, became ill on 19 Jun 2019, and died 5 days after becoming ill. McDonald said the boy suffered from a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome which affects about one in 10 of those with _E. coli_ infections. The dangerous complication occurs when infection causes damage and inflammation in the kidneys, and can lead to organ failure. Though the syndrome can happen to anyone, it's more common in young children.

Authorities on Sat 29 Jun 2019, provided additional details about the other children who were sickened:
- a 13-year-old girl who visited the fair on 8 Jun 2019 and had symptoms appear 10 Jun 2019;
- an 11-year-old girl also present on 8 Jun 2019 with symptoms showing on 12 Jun 2019;
- a 9-year-old boy who visited on 13 Jun 2019 and started showing symptoms on 16 Jun 2019.

The county's recommendation to shut down the animal exhibits, including its sprawling livestock exhibits which fill row after row of barns, came Fri 28 Jun 2019, nearly 4 days after the boy's death. With symptoms showing up from 10 Jun 2019 through 16 Jun 2019, some have questioned why the action was not taken sooner.

McDonald explained that determining the sources of outbreaks don't often happen quickly. It takes time for symptoms to turn into doctor's visits and for those visits to result in testing to indicate that _E. coli_ is or may be present. It's only after the public health department is notified of possible infections that public health nurses can begin interviewing subjects and their families, gathering enough facts to determine whether people with similar conditions visited the same places, ate the same food or share some other critical commonality, said McDonald, medical director of the public health department's Epidemiology and Immunization Services.

"It really did not come together as a picture until late yesterday [28 Jun 2019]," McDonald said, adding that, in one case, it was only after a 3rd interview that public health investigators learned that one of the 4 had indeed visited the animal areas of the fair.

Investigators have begun to rule out food poisoning. McDonald and Dr Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, confirmed Sat 29 Jun 2019, that a full list of everything eaten by all 4 children was obtained and informed the basis of a food investigation by environmental health inspectors. "We had a detailed list of all of the foods that were consumed by all 4 of these patients, and our colleagues and environmental health looked at the food preparations for every single place where a food item was reported to us," McDonald said. "There were no deficiencies found in any of those locations."

Environmental health inspectors, he added, make daily rounds of fair food vendors to make sure that they're following safety recommendations.

Of the 4 cases in which _E. coli_ infection has been confirmed, 2 are of the O157 type responsible for causing a wide range of food-based outbreaks in recent years. About 40 percent of the estimated 265 000 US _E. coli_ cases each year are of the O157 strain, which is known for its ability to cause severe kidney damage, especially in children.

Though fair-related _E coli_ deaths are rare, they're not unheard of. In 2016, a 2-year-old Indiana boy died of a similar infection after visiting the petting zoo at the Indiana State Fair, though investigators were unable to definitively link the outcome to animal exposure. In 2015, a 20-month-old boy died of an _E. coli_ infection after visiting a fair petting zoo in Maine. In 2013 the family of a 2-year-old boy sued a county fair after he died following a petting zoo visit in North Carolina.

Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said there is robust evidence that animal encounters in petting zoos and county fairs are a growing source of _E. coli_ infection. The big challenge, he noted, is that animals are the object of so much human affection. What may seem to be an innocuous hug around the neck of a young calf or goat can put people into direct contact with portions of an animal that have been reclining in areas where animal droppings are present. "For sure, cases like the one in San Diego are tragic reminders of the importance of hand washing but also of the shared responsibility that petting zoos and parents share," he said.

To prevent against infection at petting zoos, researchers recommend regular sanitation of animal cages and hand-washing stations nearby staffed with attendants to encourage visitors to comply. A fair official said such steps were in place on all of the dates when the four children visited.

Osterholm said that parents don't necessarily need to run away from petting zoos, but caution is extremely important. That means making sure that kids and adults who are petting animals are not subsequently touching their faces or putting their hands in their mouths until their hands are washed. "I don't think they need to run away or avoid, but I do think they need to be vigilant when they're in these situations," Osterholm said.

All 4 local cases are expected of being a type of _E. coli_ bacterium that produces Shiga toxin, a substance that can cause more severe symptoms. These infections -- known as STEC [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli EHEC] -- cause severe abdominal cramps, watery or bloody diarrhea, and vomiting with or without a fever.

The incubation period for the bacteria is between 1 and 10 days with most cases declaring themselves in somewhere between 2 and 4 days.

[Most of the deaths associated with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are related to central nervous system complications.

It is not yet clear if a petting zoo or other livestock exposure is significant here rather than a foodborne exposure. Petting zoos, however, at fairs are well recognized to be a venue for transmission of this potentially lethal toxin-producing pathogen.

The CDC (http://www.drfreemd.com/Medline/nimal_exhibits.htm) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer [2015]. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill."

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
Use hand-washing stations.
- find out where hand-washing stations are located;
- always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking;
- running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- keep food and drinks out of animal areas;
- do not share your food with animals;
- do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- children younger than 5 years old need supervision;
- never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals;
- hand washing should be supervised." - Mod.LL
