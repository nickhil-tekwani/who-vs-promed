Rabies heads fatal disease list again in November
-------------------------------------------------
Rabies killed more people in China than any other infectious disease for
the 6th consecutive month in November [2006], the Ministry of Health said
yesterday [11 Dec 2006]. There were 270 deaths caused by rabies last month
[November 2006] out of 743 deaths due to infectious disease on the Chinese
mainland, according to the Ministry of Health. In all, 354 people were
reportedly bitten by rabid animals, the Ministry said.
Rabies has topped the list of the most deadly infectious disease since June
2006; before that, tuberculosis was number one. In November 2006,
tuberculosis was the 2nd-ranked killer, followed by AIDS and hepatitis B,
Ministry figures showed.
China ranks 2nd in the world after India in the number of reported cases of
[human] rabies, sources said. Every year, more than 50 000 people around
the world die of the disease, most of them from developing countries.

Beijing vaccinates 550 000 registered dogs against rabies
---------------------------------------------------------
All the 550 323 registered dogs in Beijing have received anti-rabies
inoculations, the Municipal Agriculture Bureau said on Monday [11 Dec
2006]. Liu Yaqing, vice-director of the Bureau, said 319 anti-rabies
inoculation stations had been opened in the capital to offer free
inoculations for all registered dogs.
Deng Xiaohong, another Bureau vice-director, said Beijing had recorded 12
[human?] rabies cases by 15 Nov 2006. Eleven cases involved non-Beijing
residents who came to seek medical help in the city. The only case
involving a Beijinger was bitten by a dog which had been brought to the
city from outside.
This means the vaccination of dogs has paid off, said Deng. Deng said that
more than 118 000 people had received anti-rabies inoculations in Beijing
after being bitten or scratched by dogs or cats by mid-November 2006, up 22
per cent on the previous year.
Deng said Beijing had also set up 45 anti-rabies clinics to provide 24 hour
medical assistance to those bitten by dogs. Experts believe, however, that
there are around one million dogs in the city, which means the city
authorities' job is only half done. Police in Beijing have implemented a
"one-dog policy" -- one family is only allowed one dog -- and banned
dangerous dogs or dogs taller than 35 cm, such as Dobermans, Saint
Bernards, and Great Danes.
Rabies accounted for 326, or 46 per cent of all fatalities caused by
infectious diseases reported on the Chinese mainland in October 2006,
according to the Ministry of Health.

Cities move to curtail dog problems
-----------------------------------
For Beijingers, a fluffy friend is just a phone call away. Dog lovers in
the capital can now call to make an appointment and go to a special dog
shelter to choose one. Stray and illegal dogs picked up during the campaign
to curb irresponsible dog ownership, which has caused rabies, are now in
the shelter in Qiliqu Town, Changping District on the north side, about 40
minutes drive from the city's center. The 3 hectare shelter operated by the
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau was put into operation in 1998. It
has more than 600 stray, abandoned or confiscated dogs, said Huang Zhimin,
section chief of the Social Administration General Force of the bureau.
The shelter provides quarantine, treatment and adoption services, Huang
said. With 4 buildings for large dogs, 8 rows of kennels for small ones, a
quarantine zone, an isolation zone and an adoption zone, the center is
capable of holding more than 1000 dogs, Huang said. Since October 2006,
about 200 from the shelter have been adopted by local citizens. The center
also has a hospital and a dog cafeteria, while professional pet attendants
and training experts ensure the dogs are treated well. "Nutritious food is
specially prepared every day, and they are given healthy portions," Huang said.
As well as ensuring that illegal dogs are treated well and are healthy, the
center also serves as a base for adoption. Qualified citizens are invited
to call the center's hotline for dog adoption, 6973-8604, on Tuesdays and
Fridays. Adoptive owners can obtain all certificates from the police
service stations in the shelter. They should have a house and the
certificates from the local community.
The city's number of registered dogs rose to 550 523 in 2005, according to
Yu Hongyuan, deputy-director of the Public Security Bureau. The bureau has
found more than 29 000 unregistered dogs and 1698 households that have more
than one dog and closed 77 illegal dog breeding locations. Another 36 000
dogs were registered since the campaign was launched in October 2006. "We
want to raise public awareness of raising a dog in a civilized way," Yu said.
Liu Yaqing, deputy-director of the Beijing Municipal Agriculture Bureau,
said they provide free vaccine for registered dogs. A series of rabies
deaths this year [2006] has caused a huge public outcry for strengthened
dog oversight, culminating in a few mass destructions and confiscations in
the country. Deng Xiaohong, deputy-director of the Beijing Municipal Health
Bureau, said no rabies cases were reported from 1993 to 2004. But 12 people
died of rabies in Beijing from January to 15 Nov 2006, 11 of whom were
bitten by dogs from outside Beijing. Deng attributed the sudden jump of
deaths this year [2006] to the sharp increase of unvaccinated dogs
nationwide and the large migration of people to Beijing. Deng said that 118
000 people were hospitalized up to 15 Nov 2006, a year-on-year increase of
22 per cent. Most of the people bitten were aged 17 and under, and 70 per
cent of the people bitten were relatives of the dog owners. Haidian,
Chaoyang and Fengtai districts rank the 1st 3 places that dog injuries
occur. Deng said the bureau has 45 rabies clinics that are open round the
clock for any dog injury emergencies and is planning to set up more. The
hotline for dog bites in Beijing is 12320.
Meanwhile, some animal care associations shared a different view about the
recent campaign against dog raising, especially a regulation that says
large dogs (over 35cm tall) are not allowed in certain restrictive areas,
such as the crowded city center. "We hope they don't limit by the size of
the dog but by the breed," said Jill Robinson, founder and chief executive
officer of the Animals Asia Foundation. Robinson said that the Foundation
would provide 50 000 muzzles to the Public Security Bureau to reduce the
number of dog bites. "But 1st, they have to grant amnesty to these dogs,"
she said.
Tang Yunli, deputy-director of the Social Administration General Force of
the bureau, said dogs that are too large to be adopted will be sent to
units that need guard dogs or kept in the shelter until they die. Grace Ge
Gabriel, Asia regional director of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, said she hoped the Beijing municipal government will revise the
regulation. "We hope to focus on raising the quality of dog owners, not
simply taking the dogs away," she said. "Tough measures should be taken
against the illegal dog breeding locations and individuals who profit from
dog selling."
Establishing shelters is just part of the national campaign to promote more
civilized dog ownership. More Chinese are keeping pets as the standard of
living improves, but the lack of enforceable dog ownership regulations and
the negligence of dog owners have led to a sharp rise in dog-related
injuries, the Ministry of Health said. Rabies has become the biggest killer
among the 23 most infectious diseases, including AIDS and hepatitis B, for
6 straight months till November 2006 in China, the Ministry said in a
report issued yesterday [11 Dec 2006]. In late October 2006, Beijing began
enforcing its dog ownership regulations, aimed at registering all domestic
dogs and ensuring their inoculation. As part of the campaign, police also
made house calls to establish the dogs' registration and confiscate
unregistered animals. The Public Security Bureau has also strengthened the
implementation of the dog-control measures, targeting such prominent
problems as keeping vicious or unlicensed dogs and one household owning
more than one dog. Any dog owners who no longer want to keep their pets may
drop them off at the local police station. According to a recent briefing
by the city's Public Security Bureau, measures have worked well enough that
the city has now asked residential commissions to take over dog ownership
regulation.
Several such commissions have been set up by residents to regulate dog
ownership through peer education, according to the Bureau. "Instead of
forcible confiscation of the illegal dogs, now volunteers who raise their
dogs in a civilized way are encouraged to influence those living around
them and achieve a nice living environment for all residents," the Beijing
News quoted a Municipal Public Security Bureau official, whom it did not
name, as saying.
This model of peer education has also been adopted in Shanghai. In the
Ruinan Xinyuan residential area there, residents have initiated campaigns
to promote a civilized way of dog-raising. The measures proposed include
cleaning dog waste on the streets, getting rabies shots for the dogs,
training dogs and not bringing them to public areas. In addition, about 65
000 of Shanghai's 500 000 dogs have also been implanted with digital chips,
which will also prevent the spread of rabies, according to the Municipal
Public Security Bureau. The chips contain an ID number that can be used to
access information, including the dog's breed, sex, color, owner's address,
and a photo. Beijing and Harbin are also considering chip implantation
programs. Wei Haitao, head of Beijing's veterinarians' association, said
the chips, implanted in each dog's ear, neck or thigh, will contain the
pet's picture, name, breed, registration information and inoculation
record, plus the name, address, and phone number of its owner.
Efforts to curb dog-related diseases have also been staged in South China's
Guangdong Province. The health bureau in Guangzhou, Guangdong's capital,
have encouraged owners of both registered and unregistered dogs to
vaccinate them by offering subsidies. Because of high registration and
management fees (as high as 16 000 yuan, or USD 2044), only 1000 dogs of
Guangzhou's 50 000 are registered, according to the local newspaper New
Express. The city also planned to give an electronic ID collar to every dog
in order to track its health information, said Chen Zhong, dean of the
city's Animal Disease Prevention Institute.
Earlier in September 2006, the city ordered the killing of all the
rabies-carrying dogs. Nationwide, the campaigns targeting illegal dogs have
won praise from the public. Some people emphasize that the fundamental
solution to dog-related diseases lies in raising the awareness of all
owners. "Irresponsible dog-raising has not only disturbed neighborhoods but
also neglected the rights of the pets," said Yang Qing, a volunteer of a
dog protection association in Beijing. "Only when every pet-owner has a
higher awareness of pet protection can the problem be solved fundamentally."

[These reports paint a more favorable account of pet ownership in China
(and Beijing in particular) than some past reports. It is likely that the
measures presently being implemented in Beijing and elsewhere are a
response to the imminence of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing in 2008. - Mod.CP]
