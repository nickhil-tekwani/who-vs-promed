[Myxomatosis is a viral disease commonly observed in European wild rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). In case of high prevalence among rabbits, hares can also become infected by myxoma virus. The virus is a natural pathogen of the South American rabbit (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), where it causes a relatively localized fibroma. The myxoma virus is an example of a virus that has jumped to other species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Hares (_Lepus_ spp.) are in the same family as rabbits (Leporidae), and can be infected by myxoma virus. The virus is transmitted via blood-feeding arthropods or by close contact between hares and infected rabbits or their excretions. In hares myxomatosis follows a prolonged course with multiple firm subcutaneous nodular masses at the head, back and limbs. - Mod.PMB
