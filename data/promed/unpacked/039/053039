In response to the message on a case of cholera imported to Germany from
Tunisia, we would like to report on a second case imported to Denmark from
the same country.
In mid-October 1996 an 18-year-old Danish female student returned from a
one-week trip to Tunisia with a dual infection caused by _V. cholerae_ O1,
biotype el tor, serotype ogawa and _Campylobacter_. She [travelled with
her high-school class and on return to Denmark at least 10 people developed
watery diarrhoea. No _V. cholerae_ was diagnosed from her fellow
travellers. However, _Campylobacter_ was isolated from the stools of two
other students. The symptoms did not differ between the three culture
positive students and the vibrio-positive girl was recovering spontaneously
by the time the bacterium was identified. The class had stayed for two
nights in the cities of Matmata and Nefta in the Southern part of Tunisia
and the rest of the week in the city of Hammamet at the Mediterranean
coast. There was no suspicion to any specific drink or food item as the
vehicle for the _V. cholerae_ infection.
The Danish cholera isolate was of the same O-type, biotype and serotype as
the German isolate. This may indicate that _V. cholera_ O1, biotype el
tor, serotype ogawa is present in Tunisia and causes infection at least
sporadically.

Each of the three cases of imported cholera registered by Israel during the
1980's originated, as in this case, from a North African country (Egypt)
which is officially "cholera free." Indeed, an outbreak involving over 100
cases occurred in the area between Israel and Egypt (the Gaza strip) as
recently as 1994. The following background information on cholera in North
Africa was abstracted from the GIDEON software program:
Tunisia: No cases of cholera have been reported from Tunisia for almost two
decades. Unlike other North African countries, Tunisia does not border
countries with recent cholera activity (Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad).
Algeria: 700 cases were reported in 1988 (3/100,000 population); 69 (none
fatal) in 1992; 118 (4 fatal) in 1994.
Libya: 22 cases (2 fatal) were reported in an expatriate community in
Ejdabia City during October 1995.
Morocco: In September 1992, an outbreak of 30 cases (2 fatal) was reported
from Meknes. Six cases (0 fatal) were reported from Tetouan during October
1994.
[This isn't the first, or unfortunately, the last time that an organism
that didn't exist in a particular country or region was implicated as the
cause of disease. -Mod. PC
