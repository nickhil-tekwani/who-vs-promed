Plague - Congo DR
------------------
From 27 Mar 2022 to 31 Jul 2022, i.e., 127 days of the epidemic, the health zone of Rethy, located in Djugu territory, Ituri province, DR Congo, continues to report plague cases. A total of 537 suspected cases of plague have been reported, representing an attack rate of 0.21% with 7 deaths (case fatality rate 1.3%).

So far, the most affected health area is Lokpa with 43.2% of cases, followed by Uketha with 6%, and Rassia with 3.4%. During the month of July 2022, there has been an extension of human cases in villages close to the Lokpa health area: 4 new villages in the Uketha health area in the south, 4 new villages in Kpandroma in the west, 1 village in the Terrali health area in the north, and 1 pulmonary case has been notified far away in Libi. With the return of the heavy rains, we fear that a more serious spread, which constitutes a real threat to the trading center of Kpandroma, where there is overcrowding with displaced people and trucks that come to supply the town of Bunia to live, would constitute an export channel to the provincial capital.

The bubonic form remains dominant, with 533 cases (99.2%) and 4 pulmonary cases, 3 of which were notified only in July 2022. The high location of the buboes (axilla, cervical, sub-maxilla) in 59.3% of the patients points to contamination during sleep. The average age of the patients is 17 years. The most affected sex is female 54.6% against male 45.4%.

In these days, the rains are abundant in the region, the populations note a pullulation of rodents and free fleas in their homes, the habitants are obliged to remain in their households, and this increases the risk of catching the plague.

[ProMED thanks Drs Adroba and Laudisoit for their continued contributions regarding _Yersinia pestis_ infections in Congo DR.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
