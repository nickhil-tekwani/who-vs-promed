Indonesia investigates possible bird flu deaths on Bali island
--------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia was investigating the deaths of dozens of backyard chickens on
the resort island of Bali Wednesday [26 Oct 2005] amid fears they may have
had bird flu, officials and residents said.
"It's too early to say if this is bird flu," said Ida Bagus Raka, the chief
of Bali provincial animal husbandry agency, after visiting Padang Sambian,
a village on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Denpasar.
Though villagers say more than 25 previously healthy birds have dropped
dead in the last 5 days, Raka said it is possible they had Newcastle
Disease, which is not dangerous to humans.
Samples have been sent to a lab for testing, he said. It was not
immediately clear when the results would come back.
Residents in Padang Sambian said their backyard chickens suddenly started
falling sick last week, turning blue and frothing at the beak before dying.
"We don't know what the cause is, but we're afraid," said Ni Komang
Santini, who has lost 8 of her 9 chickens. The same thing happened to
several of her neighbors' flocks, she said.
The H5N1 strain of the bird flu has killed or forced the slaughter of
millions of birds in Indonesia since 2003, including 600 000 chickens on
Bali last year.
It has also jumped to humans killing 4 people in the sprawling archipelago
since June, although none of them on the resort island.

[Results of the current laboratory tests from Bali are anticipated.
According to Indonesia's official reports to the OIE, the last outbreak of
clinical HPAI in avians occurred in Indonesia on 4 May 2005, in the village
Ujung Padang, Sumatra Utara (Follow-up report No 9 of 27 Jun 2005; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_64.HTM#Sec5>). Though human cases
have been reported later, only serological findings from asymptomatic
avians have been reported in the last available follow-up report No 10,
dated 2 Aug 2005 (<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_59.HTM#Sec2>).
In view of the appearance of cases in humans, it is conceivable that cases
in avians do occur but remain undetected, underlining the need for enhanced
surveillance and reporting. - Mod. AS].

[2] UK, HPAI in imported quarantined captive birds

Britain says probably had two birds with avian flu
-----------------------------------------------------
Britain said on Wednesday [26 Oct 2005] it probably had 2 birds, not just
one, with the H5N1 bird flu virus in quarantine last week.
Authorities announced on Sunday [23 Oct 2005] that avian influenza was
found in a parrot held in quarantine and that its tissue sample had been
mixed with that of another bird in the testing process, making it possible
but uncertain whether the 2nd bird had also been infected. "We now consider
the virus was found in samples taken from 2 birds ... which had died on 16
Oct 2005," Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Margaret Beckett
told parliament. The birds were among 2 batches of exotic birds from
Suriname and Taiwan kept together and experts are working on the hypothesis
that the virus came from Taiwan and was transferred during quarantine.
Other birds had died in the quarantine area before 16 Oct 2005, and 32 of
those were kept for analysis in a freezer.
"Initial tests, which have not yet been validated, indentified that H5 is
present in some of these birds," Beckett said.
"The quarantine system succeeded in providing the protection that it is in
place to deliver," she said. "It ... means that our disease-free status on
avian flu remains unaffected."
The European Union on Tuesday banned imports of captive live birds from
other countries to strengthen its fight against bird flu after the British
parrot case came to light.

[The news about 32 birds which apparently died in the quarantine station
before 16 Oct and are still kept, untested, in the freezer -- if accurate
-- is rather puzzling; an explanation would help. - Mod. AS].

EU officially bans imports of captive live birds

Avian influenza: EU bans imports of captive live birds from third countries
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Member States today endorsed a draft Commission decision to ban imports
from third countries of captive live birds other than poultry for
commercial purposes, at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH). These measures, which follow the
detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a bird held in quarantine
in the UK last week, aim to strengthen further the EU's defences against
avian influenza. The ban covers captive live birds other than poultry
imported for commercial purposes. A separate decision regulates the
movement of birds accompanying their owners which will be subject to
certain conditions.
The ban on commercial imports of captive live birds and the regulation of
movements from third countries of birds accompanying their owners (pet
birds) will be effective immediately following adoption by the Commission
expected in the next few days. Certain derogations from the ban are
provided within today's decisions. Birds will be allowed to be moved
between approved zoos and similar institutions. Hatching eggs of
non-poultry birds can be imported for use in authorised hatcheries if their
shells are decontaminated upon arrival, or if they are being sent to zoos.
Concerning the movement of birds accompanying their owners, Member States
can allow no more than 5 birds accompanying their owners to enter from
third countries on condition that they have undergone a 30-day quarantine
in approved third countries, otherwise they must be subject to 30 days
quarantine in the Member State of destination. As an alternative to
quarantine, such birds may be admitted if they have been vaccinated against
avian influenza, or have tested negative for avian influenza during a 10
day isolation period before movement. The movement of birds accompanying
their owners is not restricted for Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein,
Andorra, Iceland, Greenland, Faeroe Islands and San Marino.
The decisions taken today will apply until 30 Nov 2005, before which time
SCFCAH will review the situation.
