[As mentioned above, as of today 28 Sep 2014, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 753, including 318 deaths (case fatality rate - 42.2 percent). Since 1 Sep 2014 there have been a total of 11 new laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 2 deaths. Of note, of the 11 newly confirmed cases this month (September 2014), 5 (45.5 percent) were reported from Taif, 2 of whom were healthcare workers, suggesting there may be nosocomial transmission occurring in Taif.

Interestingly, Taif is located in Makkah province, approximately 100 km (62 mi) southeast of Mecca.(Makkah). The city is located on the slopes of the Sarawat Mountains at an altitude of 1879 meters (6165 feet) and is the summer residence of the Saudi Government leaving the heat of Riyadh. The city is located in an agrcultrual area known for its grapes, pomegranate, figs, roses and honey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta'if). Of additional interest is that 4 of the 11 cases reported in September (2014) were from Riyadh. Given the information that Taif serves as the cool weather alternative for the Saudi Government, one can't help but wonder if the apparent clustering of cases in Taif (5) and Riyadh (4) since the beginning of September (2014), might well be epidemiologically related.

In addition to the newly confirmed MERS-CoV case reported today (28 Sep 2014), there was an announcement of a recovered case yesterday (27 Sep 2014) -- a 39 year old expat male from Riyadh, who had been reported as a newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 16 Sep 2014.
