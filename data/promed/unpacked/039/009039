FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN BOTSWANA: Confirmation of diagnosis
(follow-up report No. 3)
See also: 31 Jan 2003, 24 Jan 2003, 17 Jan 2003, 10 Jan 2003, 24 May
2002, 12 Apr 2002, 22 Mar 2002, 8 Mar 2002, 15 Feb 2002.
Information received on 3 Feb 2003 from Dr Micus Chiwasanee
Chimbombi, Director of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of
Agriculture, Gaborone:
End of previous report period: 24 Jan 2003 (see Disease Information,
16 [5], 30, dated 31 Jan 2003). End of this report period: 3 Feb
2003.
Diagnosis:
Since the foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus could not be isolated,
characterisation could not be done, and hence available serological
and clinical information forms the basis of this confirmation.
Titration results indicate an FMD SAT 1 virus, in both bovine and
kudu serum samples.
Epidemiology:
There have been no more cases since the last outbreak. The outbreak
is under control, and almost all cattle in the infected zone have
been destroyed (see table below).
Summary of destruction figures from the infected zone (updated data)
crush / bovines / swine
Matopi / 1043 / -
Tsiteng / 1112 / -
Strauss (Mokata) / 300 / 58
Annah BlackbeardFarm / 246 / -
Maswikiti / 371 / -
Old Blackbeard Farm / 301 / -
Strauss (Shashe) / 226 / -
Total / 3 599 / 58
The confirmation of SAT 1 as a cause of the current outbreak
underscores the fact that the current outbreak is not a continuation
of the 2002 outbreak, but rather an independent and entirely new
outbreak. Additionally, it is the same serotype affecting cattle and
the kudu.
Control measures during reporting period:
a. Area demarcation: see Follow-up report No. 1.
b. Biosecurity: see Follow-up report No. 1.
c. Quarantine and movement restrictions: see Follow-up report No. 1.
The area remains blockaded to prevent any incursion by animals from
the surveillance zone.
d. Stamping out: the mopping-up exercise, using ground teams and
aerial surveys, continues.
To date, 3599 cattle have been destroyed and we estimate that there
are fewer than 200 cattle still to be destroyed.
e. Surveillance:
In cattle: Surveillance (clinical and serological) is continuing in
the surveillance zone and the rest of the country. In the
surveillance zone, preliminary clinical and serological results
indicate no evidence of the disease. The second round of clinical
surveillance and serological sampling is complete, with 23 509 of the
estimated 40 000 cattle having been inspected and serum samples
collected from them. There were no lesions or other clinical signs
suggestive of FMD. The third round of inspection will be in 2 weeks'
time.
Clinical inspections and sero-sampling from a statistically-derived
sample size of animals in the rest of Veterinary Disease Control Zone
Nos. 6 and 7 as well as country-wide will commence soon to confirm
the absence of FMD in the national herd.
In small stock: In the infected zone FMD surveillance will start on 5
Feb 2003. All flocks will be inspected and sero-sampled. In the
surveillance zone, FMD surveillance in small stock will start
mid-February 2003.
In pigs: Pigs in the surveillance zone will be inspected in mid-February 2003.
In wildlife: The FMD survey in resident cloven-hoofed wildlife
species (kudu [_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_] and impala [_Aepyceros
melampus_]) to establish the extent of the disease is continuing. A
sizeable number of animals have been captured, inspected, and sampled
for FMD. This area has a relatively small number of wildlife compared
to other areas country-wide. Clinical findings did not reveal any
signs of FMD.
