India: outbreak of hepatitis A and hepatitis E in Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh)
-----------------------------------------------
After health authorities in Hyderabad declared the outbreak of jaundice in
parts of the old city area as an epidemic, officials are on overdrive to
repair leaking water and sewer pipelines. But efforts at speedy control of
the outbreak have been hampered by reluctance of people to access
government medical facilities at hand, and, instead, approach practitioners
of local medicine. This trend is worrying health department officials, who
say dependence on practitioners of local medicine is hampering efforts to
control the outbreak.
Over the past week [4th week March 2005], more than 100 cases have been
reported from just one small area of the old city. The patients have been
diagnosed with hepatitis A and E. Government doctors are now going door to
door in that one locality to educate people on preventing and curing
jaundice and also appealing to residents to report any suspected case. "We
are carrying out an extensive health education program," said Dr. T V
Venkateswarlu, Assistant Director, Medical and Health. 3 more medical camps
have been set up in the affected areas, and every evening, the government
issues a bulletin on how the battle against jaundice is proceeding. For the
past few days, the number of patients has been steadily increasing, though
now the government says the numbers have begun to come down.

[Hepatitis A and hepatitis E are caused by unrelated enteric viruses.
Outbreaks of infection by these viruses are indicative of defects in the
domestic water supply or of sewage contamination of the environment. Both
viruses cause non-persistent infections which rapidly resolve. Hepatitis E
is the more serious infection, the virus appears to be more prevalent in
India than elsewhere. Also women in late stages of pregnancy are at greater
risk of serious infection outcomes than the rest of the population. A
reliable and effective live hepatitis A virus vaccine is now available for
control of infection. However, improvements in social infrastructure are
the surest and least expensive option. - Mod.CP]
