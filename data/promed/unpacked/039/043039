The Alabama Department of Public Health continues to investigate a foodborne outbreak that has affected at least 67 out of 100 or more people who ate a meal on 6 Jul 2013 after a funeral at Eastern Star Baptist Church in York. Five people are confirmed to have _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Heidelberg by the Alabama Bureau of Clinical Laboratories. Additional environmental and clinical samples will be tested at the CDC.

The preliminary investigative findings suggest the illness was caused by cross contamination during meal preparation. Several people continue to be hospitalized, some in serious condition. The ongoing investigation has resulted in hospitalizations in at least 10 states, and all states have been notified.

Public Health's investigation began after a report from a local hospital that several people had been seeking emergency room care with symptoms of fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. "If you attended this event and are ill, please contact your physician," advised Dr. Mary McIntyre, Assistant State Health Officer for Disease Control and Prevention.
