State capital Patna has reported its 1st of the total 7 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne flaviviral encephalitis, in the state so far this year [2021], said officials aware of the development. One child has already died of the infection this year.

A one-and-a-half-year girl from Mamrakhabad Imli village of Pandarak block in Patna on Wednesday [8 Sep 2021] was found JE positive following her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test report from ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences. The girl's blood serum sample had tested positive in August [2021]. She has since been discharged from Patna's Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), said health officials, requesting anonymity.

The new case comes close on the heels of an 11-year-old JE-positive boy getting admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital in Muzaffarpur recently on 5 Sep [2021]. The condition of the boy, who hails from Bettiah in West Champaran district, was said to be critical.

Prior to these 2 recent cases, Bihar, where the disease mostly affects children up to 15 years of age, reported one JE case in January, 3 in July, and 2 in August this year [2021]. In the last 5 years, the state has reported a total of 419 JE cases and 78 deaths. It reported 135 JE cases and 27 deaths in 2019, the highest since 2016, when 100 children were infected, of which 25 died, as per government data.

Officials monitoring the case said they were taking steps to prevent further spread of infection. "We have issued instructions to respective districts for malathion (an insecticide) fogging in areas where JE cases have been detected. Fogging will be done in around 500 dwellings near the infected house," said an official. The official added, "We have also asked the districts for house-to-house case detection survey, and to also check for immunisation of children."

The prevention of JE is based largely on 2 interventions -- mosquito control and immunisation. Immunisation of children has been completed in 35 of the 38 districts. In the remaining 3 districts of Khagaria, Begusarai and Kaimur, immunisation was initiated at the end of August [2021]. The JE vaccination has been included in the routine immunisation programme of the government, said officials, requesting anonymity.

The Bihar government has been struggling to declare JE a notifiable disease despite it being a disease of public health importance because of its epidemic potential and high fatality rate. Government sources said the file concerned to make JE and dengue a notifiable disease has been shuttling from one desk to another for the last 3 years. When contacted, Bihar's director-in-chief, disease control, Dr. Naveen Chandra Prasad, was not certain about it. "I will find out from my office and let you know. Right now, I am out on an inspection," he said on Thursday [9 Sep 2021].

JE patients present vivid signs of acute encephalitic syndrome. The 1st signs of infection appear after an incubation period between 6 and 14 days. It usually begins with onset of fever above 38 C [100.4 F], chills, muscle pain, and meningitis-type headaches accompanied by vomiting.

Around 20% to 30% fatality has been reported in cases with signs of acute cerebral edema or severe respiratory distress from pulmonary edema. Recovery usually leaves serious behavioural and neurological disorders, epileptic seizures, and severe mental retardation in children.

Most government medical colleges are already facing capacity constraint in the wake of an early spike in viral fever cases among children. Any outbreak would put the state health system under further stress.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Bihar state, and cases occur there annually. Although there are fewer cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and JE in Bihar state this year [2021] than in previous years, these cases continue to occur in that state. The widespread immunization program in 35 of the 38 districts doubtless has played a role in JE case reduction. Making JE a reportable disease would help with accurate surveillance because JE cases are admitted to a variety of private and public hospitals in the state. - Mod.TY
