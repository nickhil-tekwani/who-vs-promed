[It is difficult to know the number of cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections among those reported just as encephalitis or as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). A 22 Sep 2015 report indicated that there were 10 834 AES cases in 2014. That report describes AES as, "a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins" (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/india-had-over-10000-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-cases-in-2014_1800724.html). Previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES. Prevention and control of AES will be difficult until there is a clear indication of the etiologies involved in these cases.
