With 21 new cases recorded in the past week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [19 Aug 2019] reported that 2019 measles totals [have risen] to 1203, in 30 states. The number of people who have been hospitalized this year (2019) due to measles in the USA remains at 124, with 64 people having reported complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

CDC is currently tracking 6 outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases) in Texas, California, and Washington state, and 3 separate outbreaks among [religious] communities in New York state. More than 75% of the cases this year (2019) are linked to outbreaks in New York state and New York City, CDC said.

The largest outbreak is in the Orthodox Jewish community of Brooklyn and Queens. As of 12 Aug 2019, the New York City Department of Health (NYC Health) [has] confirmed 653 since September 2018. That outbreak, like most that have occurred in the USA this year (2019), has been linked to infected travelers from Ukraine and Israel. A large measles outbreak in the Philippines has also been behind some US infections.

In other measles news, the World Health Organization (WHO) stripped the UK of its measles-free status, just 2 years after the country earned the designation. Public Health England (PHE) said today (19 Aug 2019) that WHO had determined that measles transmission was re-established throughout the UK after 2018 saw 991 confirmed cases in England and Wales -- double the number of cases recorded in 2017. The same strain of measles virus was also detected in 2017 and 2018, which connotes established virus transmission, PHE said.

"While coverage of the 1st dose in the UK has reached the WHO target of 95% for children aged 5, coverage of the 2nd dose is at 87.4%," PHE said in a blog post. Coverage must be at 95% for both doses, as measles is highly infectious, and even one infected person can start an outbreak among vulnerable populations. PHE cited concurrent outbreaks in European countries, and the risk posed by unvaccinated travelers, as the main reason for the UK resurgence.

The UK's National Health Service (NHS) began routine measles immunization in 1968, and public trust in the NHS's vaccine program is at an all-time high, PHE said. Still, the NHS is mandating checks on vaccination status, including checking on the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine status of [children aged] 10 and 11 years at general practitioner appointments. "Losing the elimination status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. It provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the potential risks posed by measles, the importance of vaccination and timely reporting of suspected cases to limit further spread," PHE said.

Last week, WHO announced that the first 6 months of 2019 had produced more measles cases than any year since 2006. "There have been almost 3 times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year (2018)," WHO said at the time. "This follows successive yearly increases since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide."

Countries reporting the most measles activity are Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Madagascar.

From DG Alerts/WHO (https://dgalerts.docguide.com/measles-who-3-fold-increase-global-cases-year-year?nl_ref=newsletter&pk_campaign=newsletter&nl_eventid=30533):
... In the first 6 months of 2019, reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006, with outbreaks straining healthcare systems, and leading to serious illness, disability, and deaths in many parts of the world. There have been almost 3 times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year (2018).

This follows successive yearly increases since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide.

For the period of 1 Jan through 31 Jul 2019, 182 countries reported 364 808 measles cases to WHO. For this same period last year (2018), 129 239 measles cases were reported from 181 countries. For the current 2019 period, the WHO African Region has recorded a 900% (that is, a 10-fold) increase; the European Region, a 120% increase (more than 2-fold); the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 50% (1.5-fold increase); the Western Pacific Region, 230% (a 3-fold increase); and the South East Asia Region and the Region of the Americas each saw a 15% fall in reported cases. - Mod.LK]

Measles cases in 2019
---------------------
From 1 Jan to 15 Aug 2019, 1203 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states (note: case count is preliminary and subject to change). This is an increase of 21 cases from the previous week. This is the greatest number of cases reported in the USA since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.

- Measles can cause serious complications. As of 15 Aug 2019, 124 of the people who got measles this year (2019) were hospitalized, and 64 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.
- The majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against measles.
- More than 75% of the cases this year (2019) are linked to outbreaks in New York and New York City. Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in US communities where groups of people are unvaccinated.
- All measles cases this year (2019) have been caused by measles wild-type D8 or B3.

[3] UK: measles elimination status
Date: Tue 20 Aug 2019

The UK's measles-free status was terminated after the same strain -- B3 Dublin -- was detected for more than 12 months in 2017 and 2018, officials said. Currently, several large measles outbreaks are occurring in countries across Europe, driven by gaps in vaccine coverage. Nearly 83 000 cases of measles were reported in Europe in 2018, according to WHO.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) outlined several actions that are needed to bolster efforts to regain elimination status, including:

- ensuring that England's National Health Service urges general practitioners to promote catch-up vaccination in unvaccinated adolescents and young adults;
- strengthening the role of local immunization coordinators to target hard-to-reach families;
- addressing parents' concerns about vaccines by tailoring advice on NHS.uk to address vaccine misinformation;
- calling a summit of social media companies about their role in promoting vaccine information; and
- requiring that DHSC works with [Public] Health England and NHS England to deliver a comprehensive strategy to address measles.

"It's easy to forget how devastating measles can be precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing it in the 1st place," British health secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement. "With this strategy, the whole health system will come together to renew focus on vaccinations -- especially for our children -- and this time we will eliminate measles for good."

The UK's struggles to prevent measles mirrors developments in other countries where vaccine coverage is waning -- including the USA. CDC has warned that the USA may lose the measles-free status it achieved in 2000 if outbreaks in densely populated urban areas like New York City and Rockland County, New York, continue. As of 12 Aug 2019, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has reported 653 confirmed cases since September 2018.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ukraine-measles-update-new-tetanus-case-in-lviv-65971/


The Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine reported an additional 203 measles cases this past week: 138 adults and 65 children. Most of the new cases were reported in the Kyiv, Odessa, Chernivtsi and Kharkiv areas.

Since the beginning of the year (2019), 57 301 people became ill with measles -- 27 039 adults and 30 262 children -- and 18 people died from measles complications.

The Ministry of Health of Ukraine together with the Ministry of Education remind that unvaccinated children will not be able to attend kindergartens and schools with other students, except for those children who have medical contraindications for vaccination.
