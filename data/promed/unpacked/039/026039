UK Troops in Afghanistan Contract Mystery Illness
-------------------------------------------------
Eighteen British soldiers serving in Afghanistan have been struck
down with a mystery fever. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has
confirmed that two are "seriously ill". One of them has been flown
back to Britain and another to Germany. All the sick are military
medical personnel working at 34 Field
Hospital in Bagram which has now been closed -- except to treat cases of the
unidentified fever. All the 350 troops who staff the hospital have been
confined to either their quarters or the hospital. A German field hospital
is now providing back-up for other medical treatment for the marines taking
part in the ongoing Operation Snipe.
It was initially thought the disease was meningitis but tests have
ruled that "unlikely". Paul Adams, the BBC's defence correspondent in
Bagram says some theories have suggested it could be enteric fever -
which is related to typhoid. The MoD has "categorically" confirmed
the illness was not the result of a bio-terrorist attack.
A spokesman said: "The exact nature of the illness is not yet known
and medical tests continue to [establish] the cause. "However the
illness appears to be contagious and as a precaution 34 Field
Hospital has been closed to all but similar cases. "It will be
reopened for normal medical cover as soon as possible."
Brigadier Roger Lane, commander of the troops, said soldiers first
started reporting symptoms 3 days ago, including fever, diarrhoea and
vomiting. He said the area around 34 Field Hospital had been isolated
and military police were deployed to prevent trespassers. Lieutenant
Colonel Ben Curry, with the troops in Bagram, told the BBC: "Clearly,
this is a serious situation and we are taking steps to prevent any
further spread."
Shadow Defence Secretary Bernard Jenkin is calling on the government
to hold an inquiry into the outbreak. Mr Jenkin is also urging the
government to look into allegations British troops are ill-equipped
to work in Afghanistan. He said he had seen UK soldiers in Kabul
using trench-based latrines and showering "under plastic bags in
tents" while those of other nationalities had permanent toilets in
prefab buildings.
About 1700 troops are currently deployed at Bagram. British marines
have been involved in two military operations in eastern Afghanistan
since arriving in the country last month.

[An apparently severe febrile illness striking over 5% of medical
personnel at a single field hospital in Afghanistan is indeed
alarming. There is little in this report to suggest the etiology of
the illness. The symptoms of fever, diarrhea, and vomiting are not
specific nor is it clear what initially prompted consideration of
meningitis. Failure to isolate a causative agent after 3 days makes
a typical bacterial pathogen less likely. Possibilities include
rickettsial or viral pathogens or a toxin exposure among many others.
Enteric fever, mentioned as a possibility in the news story, does not
typically present with prominent GI manifestations. ProMED-mail will
post further developments in this story as they become available. We
would especially welcome any information from those with first hand
knowledge of the situation. - Mod.LM]
