Health officials and experts said on Friday [19 Feb 2021]. 31 people have died in an outbreak of plague that erupted in northeastern Congo DR 3 months ago, "We have more than 520 cases... of which more than 31 have been fatal," Patrick Karamura, health minister in Ituri province, where plague is endemic, told AFP. The cases are the bubonic form of the disease, except for 5 cases of pneumonic plague and 2 of septicaemic plague, he said.

Anne Laudisoit, an epidemiologist with a New York-based NGO called Ecohealth Alliance, said the cases had surfaced between [15 Nov 2020] and [13 Dec 2020] in Biringi, in Ituri's Aru Territory. The average age of patients was 13, but this varied between 3 months and 73 years, she said. The WHO issued an alert in July 2020 of a plague outbreak in Rethy, also in Ituri.

Plague has persisted in the province since it was first confirmed there in 1926. A long-feared disease with biblical connotations, but treatable today with antimicrobials, the plague is caused by a bacterium called _Yersinia pestis_.

Laudisoit, who is in the area with a team of researchers, said an early sign of the latest outbreak came with the mass death of rats. Germ-carrying fleas which live in the rats' fur then look for other hosts in proximity, which are humans. The bacterium is then transmitted through flea bites.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. - Mod.LL
