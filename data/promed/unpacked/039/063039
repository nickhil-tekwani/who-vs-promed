Partial results of the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture canola plant disease survey have been released with higher numbers for sclerotinia and blackleg. 250 fields were sampled. The statistics are from 131 fields from which samples have been analyzed.

78 percent of the 131 fields had at least trace levels of blackleg. 17 percent of surveyed plants in infected fields had symptoms of blackleg.

70 percent of fields surveyed had trace levels of sclerotina. In those fields, 21 percent of plants had disease symptoms. Sclerotina levels have been rising since 2017, but are below the wet year in 2016.

[Sclerotinia
-----------
Sclerotinia (also called stem rot, white mould) of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; osr, "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties) is caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. The fungus is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts worldwide, including many crop species. It causes white fungal growth on aerial plant parts which leads to rotting, wilting and death of plants. On oilseed rape, infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem lesions showing a typical bleached appearance develop.

The pathogen is primarily soil borne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia for up to 10 years and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means and wind borne spores. It is thought that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of a field as well as weather conditions.

Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimize inoculum) and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soil borne fungal pathogens.

Blackleg
--------
Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker, leaf spot) caused by the fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. It can also affect other species in the Brassicaceae family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds), which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on osr may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods; stem cankers lead to premature ripening or collapse (lodging) of the crop. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may also occur.

The fungus is seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides.

Osr cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available and are placed into groups according to which resistance genes they carry (see link below). However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.
