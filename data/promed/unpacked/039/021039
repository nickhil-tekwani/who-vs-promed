[Excerpts from] statement on the 1st meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, the Emergency Committee, while noting that the conditions for a PHEIC are not currently met, issued Public Health Advice as follows:
- Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners remain engaged in a vigorous response - without this, the situation is likely to deteriorate significantly. This response should be supported by the entire international community.
- Global solidarity among the scientific community is critical and international data should be shared freely and regularly.
- It is particularly important there should be no international travel or trade restrictions.
- Neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance.
- During the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders and national and international staff should prioritised.
- Exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance; however, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value.
- Robust risk communication (with real-time data), social mobilisation, and community engagement are needed for a well-coordinated response and so that those affected understand what protection measures are being recommended;
- If the outbreak expands significantly, or if there is international spread, the Emergency Committee will be reconvened.

[2] Vaccination update
Date: Fri 18 May 2018

The World Health Organization (WHO) today [Fri 18 May 2018] said the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) does not, at this time, constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

"At this point, it's not cost beneficial to declare an international state of emergency," said Robert Steffen, MD, the WHO's chairman of the emergency committee that made the decision. Steffen made the announcement on the heels of an International Health Regulations meeting held earlier today in Geneva.

Steffen was joined by WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus PhD, and Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of the emergency response program, in a media briefing.

Jeremy Farrar, MD, director of the UK-based Welcome Trust, said in a statement posted on Twitter today [Fri 18 May 2018], "The decision by WHO not to call a public health emergency of international concern is the right one for the time being. The response by the DRC authorities and the WHO has been swift and decisive."

"However," he added "we can't predict how the outbreak will progress, and the WHO must keep the situation under frequent review and not hesitate to declare a PHEIC if the situation shows signs of deteriorating."

The WHO emergency committee met 9 times during the 2014--2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which involved more than 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths.

Tedros recalled what he saw on the ground in DRC just days after the 1st cases were confirmed by health officials.

"We were really encouraged by what we have seen, and how coordinated the response has been," said Tedros.

As of today [Fri 18 May 2018], the DRC has reported 45 cases of Ebola, including 25 deaths. The 1st cases, 2 patients in the remote health zone Bikoro, were recorded 10 days ago, on [Tue 8 May 2018]. Of the 45 cases, 3 involve healthcare workers (including one fatal case), and 14 have been confirmed through laboratory testing.

Both Tedros and Steffen emphasized how remote Bikoro, the epicenter of the outbreak is, describing it as reachable only by motorcycle. They estimated it will take several hours to move the vaccine from Kinshasa, where 7000 doses are being held in cold-storage, to contacts of patients.

The director-general confirmed that ring vacation with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV will begin in 2 days. Salama explained that, for each case, 100 to 150 contacts will be offered the vaccine, which means the 1st phase of vaccination could include as many as 8000 - 10 000 people.
"The vaccination will take a matter of days, 1 -- 2 weeks," Salama said. "The contacts have to be tracked down."

All cases but 3 have been in remote, rural areas, but a recent case in Mbandaka, a city of nearly 1.2 million people is a "worrisome" development, said Tedros. The 2 other cases reported in that city were in rural travelers who had been to a funeral of a sick relative.

The Congo River, which runs through Mbandaka, has been called a highway that connects thousands of people thought the DRC and neighboring countries. If more cases are found in Mbandaka, they could constitute a bigger threat to international spread.

Salama also addressed the issue of ZMapp, an experimental anti-Ebola infusion given to prevent the disease after exposure. The DRC has requested use of the drug, and Salama said the WHO will likely approve its use in the next several days, but doubted the feasibility of widely distributing it in Bikoro because of the technology required for infusions.

Salama said the WHO has designated USD9 million so far to outbreak efforts and estimated a total of USD26 million will be spent in the DRC in the coming weeks.

Public Health England announced today [Fri 18 May 2018] that a UK Public Health Rapid Support Team is en route to the DRC to assist in outbreak efforts.

The team, made up of epidemiologists and other scientists, expects to be in the DRC for 6 weeks.

The Journal for Infectious Diseases published an 11-article supplement on the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine Against Ebola (STRIVE), detailing lessons learned about Merck's VSV-EBOV during the 2014 -- 2016 West African Ebola epidemic. Writing in a commentary on the issue, Anne Schuchat, MD, of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the supplement was "a figurative manual of operations for how to build an airplane while flying it through a storm." The vaccine ended up being a safe "airplane," she said, as documented by data on 8000 vaccine recipients.

[3] Vaccination of UN staff

World Health Organization and other United Nations staff going to the Democratic Republic of Congo as emergency responders to an Ebola outbreak are being offered an unlicensed vaccine as protection before they go.

The WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response Peter Salama told Reuters several staff had already signed up for immunization with the VSV-EBOV vaccine. The shot, developed by Merck, has not yet been fully licensed but has proven safe and effective in trials.

"For the 1st time, we are offering vaccination to all international responders - and we'll be doing that in Geneva and in Kinshasa," Salama said on [Thu 17 May 2018] in a telephone interview.

He said the 1st shots would be given in Geneva on [Fri 18 May 2018].

"I haven't got the latest on how many people have signed up yet, but I anticipate that a lot of people will get vaccinated."

The health ministry has said vaccinations for local health workers and contacts of people who have had Ebola can start by early next week.

[One can only hope that precious doses of the vaccine are not being given to individuals who are not on the frontline fighting Ebola. It certainly is important for international responders to be vaccinated.]

The WHO is exploring whether experimental therapies might be used in the outbreak, with Salama revealing that the DRC government has been asked if it would permit emergency use of ZMapp, a treatment of monoclonal antibodies. Approval may be given, he said, but Salama cautioned that it would be difficult to use ZMapp at Bikoro, the epicenter of the outbreak, given the state of the medical infrastructure there. ZMapp must be given by infusion.

[Excellent summary that is recommended reading. The excerpt on ZMapp is included here to clarify it is therapeutic to be used after infection; it is not a vaccine. - MM]

A total of 11 cases of the Ebola virus were confirmed in northwest Congo on [Fri 18 May 2018], including 2 more in the bustling river port of Mbandaka, where health officials say a growing outbreak could see an "explosive increase.

The WHO has put Congo's 9 bordering countries on high alert, and the International Organization for Migration is aiding the Congolese government in deploying teams of epidemiologists and other medical staff to 16 border crossings. Both organizations are arms of the United Nations. Doctors Without Borders, known internationally by its French acronym MSF, and Alima, another nongovernmental organization, are among others leading ground efforts to contain the outbreak.

At a news conference on [Fri 18 May 2018], WHO officials said the good news is that the number of Ebola cases is not increasing dramatically.

Congolese health officials now say there have been 45 suspected cases reported in their country since April [2018]. And 25 people have died. Laboratory testing of patient blood samples, however, has been progressing slowly; 14 of the cases have been confirmed as Ebola.

Doctors Without Borders is setting up isolation wards and Ebola treatment centers both near the epicenter of the outbreak and in the port city of Mbandaka.

The Red Cross is recruiting local volunteers to collect and safely bury the dead.

"We have now 20 volunteers trained on how to do these burials," says Karsten Voigt, operations manager for the International Federation of the Red Cross in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"It's a very difficult task because you have to follow all the security protocols -- when you put on your protective gear, when you take it off, the way you handle the body. It is also psychologically demanding because you deal with families who, of course, are in distress."

The Red Cross is also setting up sanitation teams to disinfect houses, clinics and other places that may have been exposed to the virus.

Getting supplies to the area is extremely difficult, says Voigt. It took him 11 hours in a 4-wheel drive vehicle to cover roughly 75 miles from the nearest airstrip to the village of Bikoro.

"It is a very difficult road through the bush. It's a dirt track. The bridges have collapsed," he says. "It's very difficult to reach."
Once you get to Bikoro, he says, there are other villages accessible only on foot.

To help with the logistical challenges of moving supplies, the U.N. World Food Programme has started flying Russian-made helicopters back and forth from Mbandaka to Bikoro. The WFP has also set up what it's calling an air-bridge for cargo planes between the Congolese capital of Kinshasa and Mbandaka. So far the WFP has moved in 5 tons of personal protective equipment for health workers, tents, body bags and other gear to try to get control of this outbreak before it spreads further.

Dr. Robert Steffen, head of WHO's International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the outbreak, says the local and international response to the outbreak has been swift and robust. International medical teams have already been identified and are on standby to send into the region if the outbreak spreads.

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/despite-spread-port-city-congo-ebola-outbreak-isn-t-international-emergency-yet-who


Peter Salama, who heads WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said 2 shipments of the vaccine have already arrived in the DRC and as many as 10 000 people will be targeted to receive it, starting [Mon 21 May 2018]. Vaccine teams will offer shots to people who have come in contact with cases, their contacts, and so-called front-line responders, including medical staff, transport teams, and burial workers.

WHO says it needs USD 26 million to mount a response over the next 3 months; USD 9.3 million has already been committed from its own funds, governments, and nonprofits. Jeremy Farrar, who heads the Wellcome Trust in London -- which has promised to provide one-third of that initial commitment -- says the "swift and decisive" response and the small number of cases leads him to support the decision not to declare a PHEIC. "It is a fine judgment call and has to be kept under review," Farrar tells Science Insider. "Any suggestion of a deterioration and a PHEIC should be called."

Farrar stresses that a PHEIC has upsides and downsides. "PHEIC declarations do heighten awareness, engagement, and can free up funds, but there are some negative consequences," he says. "Often borders are closed, flights are stopped, trade comes to a standstill -- all of which can have negative consequences for the epidemic and the ability to bring it under control."

Robert Steffen [who heads the IHR Emergency Committee] told reporters that the current situation does not call for any restrictions on travel or trade but that departing passengers at DRC airports and in the ports of Mbandaka should be screened for fever. The DRC is surrounded by 9 countries; all should strengthen their surveillance and preparedness, Steffen said. "If the outbreak expands significantly or if there is international spread, the emergency committee will be reconvened and will reconsider its fundamental decision," he said.

[8] Life in the Ebola zone
Date: Fri 18 May 2018
Source: BBC [edited]
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44164027


An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization has said.

It said there was a "strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control". ...

Life in the Ebola zone
One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: "I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?'"

"They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear," he added.

Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes.

Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency.

It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever.

"But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed," said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port.

Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. ...

He said the disease could have been taken there by people who attended the funeral of an Ebola victim in Bikoro, south of Mbandaka, before travelling to the city.

[There has been no discussion of how this outbreak began in the DR Congo. Apparently there was a funeral in Bikoro where subsequently 7 of the 11 participants died. But how did the index case become infected? Ebola can be introduced into the human population through contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals, especially bush meat or wild animal meat. This covers any animal that is killed for consumption and can include among others bats, non-human primates, antelope and porcupines. Bushmeat is generally bought from markets after it has already been cooked, so it is those hunting or preparing the raw meat that are at highest risk. - Mod LK
