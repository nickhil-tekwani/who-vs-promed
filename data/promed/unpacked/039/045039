[This response addresses the following passage in the above posting:
"2) Situation Assessment: Decoy ducks are used as captive birds to
lure wild birds to a shooting area for hunting. They are kept
tethered when they are taken out to water and have little direct
contact with wild birds."]

Direct contact is not the problem when decoy ducks and geese are
implicated in disease transmission. The problem is that the decoy
birds defecate in the same water that wild birds land in, swim in,
and feed in, and tend to be moved around among multiple lakes,
rivers, streams, ponds, etc., so whatever viruses they carry are
moved around too, just as wild birds move viruses around.

Decoy birds are often raised and handled in proximity to other
domestic fowl. Unlike in the current French situation, a decoy
breeding operation is sometimes just a few pens off to the side of a
much larger complex raising ducks or geese for the pot. The 1st one I
ever saw, 30 years ago, was about 50 feet from about 5000 domestic
ducks, with only a wire fence and a driveway between them.

The U.S. hasn't had much direct experience with issues involving
decoy birds, since the use of decoy birds was federally prohibited in
1936, but the non-migratory giant Canada geese that are now a
nuisance throughout the northern half of the Lower 48 states are
descended from the hybrids of Canada and domestic geese that were
raised as decoys before the ban.

When the ban came into effect, the feds confiscated flocks of decoy
geese and, in cooperation with state game programs, bred them for
"reintroduction" to regions where migratory geese had been shot to
scarcity. This effort peaked in the 1960s and 1970s and continued in
some states into the early 1990s.

I don't have any record on file that anyone ever considered the
possibility that the reintroduced geese might become a disease vector
linking wild and domestic bird populations until after concern about
H5N1 developed in recent years.
