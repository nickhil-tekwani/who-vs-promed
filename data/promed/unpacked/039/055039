The health secretary in Hidalgo has issued an epidemiological alert
because of a canine rabies outbreak occurring in Tizayuca
Municipality, in the southern area of the state, where an intensive
vaccination campaign is currently taking place, including every
household.

This situation was initially reported by a citizen in the El Cid
community, who said he had seen a dog behaving aggressively. This
animal attacked 5 other dogs, 2 of which died. Because of the dog's
behavior and its described signs, it was concluded that the animal had
rabies. Shortly thereafter, Dr Fernando Vargas, national vice-Ddrector
for rabies and zoonoses prevention, arrived in the area. He will
coordinate prevention and alert measures that have already begun.

Ms Ana Maria Tavares, health subsecretary, explained that this
outbreak is a consequence of a case reported in Tecamac, in Mexico
State, 11 km [6.8 miles] away from Tizayuca. She pointed out that an
animal affected with rabies was localized [identified? captured? -
Mod.SH] there on the very same day of the report in Tizayuca.

Ms Tavares explained that the affected dog in Hidalgo was not
localized, but they think the animal must be dead, since an infected
animal may only live for 4 days. She pointed out that household visits
have been carried out in the affected municipality: 417 people have
been informed about the current situation and 368 dogs have been
immunized. She added that the national rabies vaccination campaign
ended last March [2011] and 700 thousand doses had been administered.

During visits in the area the case of 2 people who were attacked by
their pet was reported, pointing out that the involved animal had
exhibited strange behavior, compatible with rabies. Consequently, as a
preventive measure, 2 post-exposure prophylactic courses were
administered to the affected people. Ms Tavares recalled that since
1997 there had been no reports of human rabies in Hidalgo state; the
last one was a case in Tezontepec de Aldama municipality.

Ms Tavares said that, with respect to the case in Tizayuca, garbage
accumulation on the streets had led to 2 outbreaks of canine rabies,
the 1st one in 2009, and the current outbreak.

[While the behavior the animal in the beginning of the article may be
suspicious of rabies, it is unclear from this article if the animal
was ever tested for rabies. It is unclear if the missing and presumed
dead animal mentioned later is the same one.

Regular vaccination helps build a barrier between wildlife,
unvaccinated pets, and public health. Hopefully the vaccination
campaign started last year will either continue or be revived with
efforts to achieve a 100 per cent vaccination rate among domestic
pets. - Mod.TG
