[We probably have no idea of the amount of infection being transported
around the world daily. One measure is the reports of importations posted
in national publications. I started to list the ones from the UK
Communicable Disease Report in March, but haven't been able to keep it up.
Would anyone like to volunteer to do this for ProMED-mail on a monthly
basis, plus delve into the text on the website to find and list which
countries these are being reported from? This request does not restrict
you to a UK website. - Mod.JW]
