The United Nations said [Tue 29 Mar 2016], 61 people have died of meningitis in Niger since January [2016], despite mass vaccinations to prevent a possible epidemic.

"From [4 Jan to 13 Mar 2016], 736 cases of meningitis have been recorded in Niger," OCHA [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] said. These cases included 61 deaths. 35 percent of the total cases involved children aged between 5 and 14, it said.

The UN, along with medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has launched mass vaccination programmes in the affected areas, including the capital Niamey.

The World Health Organization (WHO) had warned in December [2015] of a risk of fresh meningitis outbreaks in 2016 in Africa, particularly in Niger and Nigeria, which were both badly hit last year.

The risk was deemed to be especially high in parts of Niger affected by the epidemic in 2015, where the vaccination of people was only partially completed. Between January and June last year [2015], health authorities recorded 573 deaths and over 8500 cases.

[Historically, the usual pathogen causing most bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt, which includes Niger, has been serogroup A _Neisseria meningitidis_ (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, the epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed after preventive vaccination of the population with conjugate meningitis A vaccine -- MenAfrivac (R) -- was introduced in 2010. Serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species, including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus pneumoniae_ (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.

Identifying the specific microbial causes of a bacterial meningitis outbreak is critically important, because vaccines used to control an outbreak must cover the organism causing the outbreak. ProMED-mail reported in August 2015 that, because a serious serogroup C outbreak in Niger had occurred in 2015 (see ProMED-mail posts below), an outbreak due to serogroup C meningococcal meningitis might return in 2016 (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (05): serogroup C, fatal, vaccine shortage 20150802.3552463).

Presumably, the current outbreak in Niger may be this return of serogroup C, but we are not told in the news report above the bacterial etiology of this particular outbreak. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources on the etiology of the current bacterial meningitis outbreak in Niger. - Mod.ML
