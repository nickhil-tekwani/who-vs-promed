[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible, although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established. PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South East Asia.

The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterized by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes, particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form.

PPR must be confirmed by laboratory methods, as bluetongue, foot and mouth disease and other erosive or vesicular conditions, as well as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, can cause clinically similar disease (extracted from OIE Terrestrial Manual Chapter 3.7.9 Peste des Petits Ruminants [Infection with Peste des Petits Ruminants] https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.09_PPR.pdf).

PPR has severe negative socioeconomic impacts (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/distribution/) on the income of livestock farmers and, in particular, the livelihoods and food security of the most vulnerable rural communities, notably of women.

The OIE and the FAO, in their joint strategy (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/gsce/) for control and eradication of PPR, have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030.
