Tick-borne diseases continue to climb in Maine, particularly anaplasmosis; the state has seen 39 more cases [of anaplasmosis] this year as of [30 Sep 2014] than in all of 2013, according to the Maine CDC. Health officials say there have been 133 cases of [this] bacterial disease in the 1st 9 months of 2014, while 94 cases were reported in all of 2013.

Other tick-borne diseases are also on the rise in Maine. The number of cases of the parasitic disease, babesiosis, is now at 33 cases and the number of Lyme disease infections is near 1000 and is expected to rise further as Lyme reporting is passive and may require a couple of months to get all cases counted.

[Since the last ProMED-mail post on anaplasmosis in the US state of Maine in August 2014 (Anaplasmosis - USA: (ME) increased incidence 20140805.2661101), the number of cases of anaplasmosis has increased by 53 cases, from 80 to now 133 in the 1st 9 months of 2014, compared to 94 cases in all of 2013.

The increased incidence of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) in Maine can be due to a true increase in the number of cases of HGA as the primary vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of HGA may contribute to the increases in cases. - Mod.ML
