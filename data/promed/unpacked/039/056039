[The following information was obtained from The Center for food security & Public Health, Iowa State University, Fact Sheet on "Ovine and Caprine Brucellosis; _Brucella melitensis_," http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf:

"Caprine and ovine brucellosis, caused by the zoonotic bacterium _Brucella melitensis_, is an economically important cause of abortion in small ruminants. This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.

_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.

Asymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.

Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis."

To date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven. See ProMED-mail posts 20150806.3562337 and 20150801.3548663. - Mod.CRD
