Re: Equine encephalosis - Israel: 2008 & Equine encephalosis - Israel (02): OIE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In reply to the post on Equine encephalosis virus [EEV] in Israel the
following may be of interest:

The OIE reference laboratories for AHSV [African horse sickness
virus) and BTV (Bluetongue virus] at the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute have developed an indirect ELISA for the detection of EEV
antibodies based on recombinant EEV VP7. As part of a "fit for
purpose" validation, sera from South Africa, England and the
Netherlands were tested. The ELISA has been shown to work well and we
also tested 25 AHSV diagnostic samples from Ethiopia for EEV
antibodies. All were positive except one and all gave high percentage
positive values (PP values). The results were confirmed by the serum
neutralization test (SNT). All positive sera contained significant
titers of neutralizing antibodies against one or more EEV serotypes.
The negative sample was negative by SNT. In total the serotypes
included Cascara (1 sample), Gamil (17), Kaalplaas (17), Kyalami (1),
Potchefstroom (21) and Northrand (1). Also of interest was a group of
40 Kruger National Park rhino of which 19 tested positive by indirect ELISA

In addition to the development of the EEV ELISA we have sequenced the
complete genomes of all 7 EEV reference strains namely Bryanston,
Cascara, Gamil, Kaalplaas, Kyalami, Potchefstroom and Northrand in
collaboration with the group of Prof Peter Mertens in Pirbright.
Based on the nucleic acid sequences, a RT-PCR was developed. It has
been used as a routine diagnostic PCR for the past 3 years and has
proven to work well. We have also sequenced several EEV field strains
to improve the nucleic acid diagnostic test. Some of the field
strains were from an outbreak of EEV in the Western Cape Province
approximately 2 years ago in which more than 20 horses died (see
ProMED-mail post number 20070509.1495)

We would welcome any collaboration on EEV and will serotype viruses
and sequence the genomes thereof. Access to the Israeli field isolate
of EEV would be highly appreciated.

[We willingly post the above commendable call for international
collaboration on the emerging EEV issue.

The discovery of serological positive animals in Ethiopia (against 6
out of the 7 reference strains of EEV) is a significant example on
the importance of such collaboration. It will be interesting to note
if the Onderstepoort reference laboratory has tested, during the
years, samples from other countries, and -- in case affirmative --
what were the results. - Mod.AS]
