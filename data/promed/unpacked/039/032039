["Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenza A virus_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts. Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations.

"While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."
