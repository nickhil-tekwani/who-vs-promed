Jeanene Fowler with the Maricopa Department of Health confirmed that the number of cases related to an outbreak of [_E. coli_ O157 caused] "bloody diarrhea" linked to a Federico's Mexican Restaurant in Litchfield Park has affected 22 more people, bringing the total number of cases to 74.

Fowler said the increased number doesn't necessarily mean "new" cases are popping up, but that investigators are continuing to complete their interviews with those believed to be exposed to the bacterium. The Maricopa Department of Health also said 23 people remain hospitalized.

Fowler also said all 74 cases involve individuals who ate at the Federico's Mexican Restaurant located at 13132 W Camelback Road in Litchfield Park, Arizona between 18 Jul 2013 and 30 Jul 2013. Fowler said it will take time to determine if more individuals are connected to the outbreak or not. The specific source of the outbreak remains under investigation.

[As it is stated in the posting, the newly reported cases are not likely to be newly developed cases as the incubation period of the illness is no more than 10 days, usually 3-4 days. The numbers increase related to bacteriologic confirmation of the infection and then subsequent formal reporting.

No information has yet come forth regarding the vehicle of transmission. In some past outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in Mexican restaurants, it was difficult to identify the exact food stuff responsible, as items such as lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are often served in the same dishes. Both tomatoes and lettuce are common vehicles for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and the contamination can occur anywhere from the field to the kitchen.

One noteworthy point regarding this outbreak is that only one restaurant in this chain was affected by EHEC. If the ingredients used were obtained from a central location supplying many restaurants in the chain, the contamination must have occurred directly at the targeted facility. - Mod.LL
