Plague has apparently now spread to eastern Fall River County where
it has decimated prairie dog populations and made that area much less
attractive for the reintroduction of endangered black-footed ferrets,
wildlife officials say.
However, plague still has not been found in Conata Basin near
Badlands National Park, site of the most successful black-footed
ferret reintroduction in the country so far.
Plague 1st was confirmed in western South Dakota almost 3 years ago,
when a rancher found a sick prairie dog in extreme southwestern
Custer County and took it in for testing. Before that case, plague
had not been confirmed in South Dakota for decades, although plague
had wiped out prairie dog towns in eastern Wyoming.
Plague in prairie dogs and other animals (known as sylvatic plague)
generally does not pose a widespread threat to humans, although
people can get the disease.
However, the appearance of plague has wildlife officials worried
about the already established ferret population in Conata Basin.
After the Custer County case, plague killed thousands of prairie dogs
in a huge complex north of Oglala on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation 2 years ago.
Since then, plague has spread on the reservation, with smaller
outbreaks east of Oglala to the Wolf Creek community northeast of
Pine Ridge, west near the Prairie Wind Casino, and about 15 miles
north just below Cuny Table and Red Shirt Table, according to Trudy
Ecoffey, senior biologist with the Oglala Sioux Tribe Parks and
Recreation Department.
Ecoffey said she thought last fall that the plague would spread
faster. But it hasn't moved far this summer [2007], she said.
Although plague showed up northeast of Pine Ridge, it skipped other
prairie dog towns between Oglala and Pine Ridge, she said.
Ecoffey said she estimates plague has affected 30 000 acres of
prairie dogs. She said pockets of prairie dogs have begun showing up
again at the huge complex just north of Oglala.
Now, plague is suspected of spreading west, where it has killed
sizeable numbers of prairie dogs in eastern Fall River County on the
Buffalo Gap National Grassland, east of Smithwick, according to Fall
River District Ranger Mike McNeill.
The die-offs are in the heart of an area targeted for a ferret
reintroduction, he said.
Although no prairie dogs have been tested and confirmed with plague,
they have disappeared from large colonies in the area. McNeill said
plague is the most reasonable explanation.
Of 900-1200 acres in the area occupied by prairie dogs a year or 2
ago east of Smithwick, only about 450-500 acres have prairie dogs
now, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Scott
Larson of Pierre.
The die-off makes the area much less attractive as a site to
reintroduce black-footed ferrets, Larson said. "It becomes a lower
priority at this time."
But Larson wouldn't rule out the Smithwick area for a future ferret
reintroduction. "We probably have better sites now than Smithwick. It
might look entirely different in 5 years."
Ferrets can get plague by eating prairie dogs that have died of the
disease or may get it from fleas that carry the organism, as prairie
dogs do. Prairie dogs make up about 90 percent of the ferrets' diet.
Ferrets reintroduced elsewhere in the country have died from eating
plague-infected prairie dogs, Larson said.
FWS officials have said plague in prairie dog towns has hampered
black-footed ferret reintroductions in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado and Utah.
Officials also said ferrets can get plague from one flea bite.
Wildlife officials continue to worry about plague harming the
estimated 250 black-footed ferrets now roaming Conata Basin just
south of Badlands National Park's North Unit.
Conata Basin is about 40 miles northeast of the big Oglala complex
hit hard by plague in 2005. With plague now approaching Cuny Table,
it is about 25 miles from Conata Basin.
At Conata Basin, the government has spent years and millions of
dollars to establish a population of black-footed ferrets, which were
once thought to be extinct.
To protect the project, FWS crews have been dusting prairie dog
burrows in Conata Basin with an insecticide that kills fleas, the
primary carriers of plague.
This year [2007], they will dust about 1600 acres of at least 26 000
acres occupied by prairie dogs, Larson said. But the dusting is being
done in an area known to be occupied by ferrets.
The dusting by itself won't keep the plague out of Conata Basin,
Larson said. "We're hoping to hang on to a few ferret-occupied areas
in case it comes in."
Now in its 3rd year, the dusting appears to be reducing the number of
fleas, according to David Jachowski, an FWS biologist with the
national Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado who is
helping with the dusting. "We see fewer fleas on prairie dogs," Jachowski said.
Crews dusted 7000 acres 2 years ago. They spray an insecticide powder
into the prairie dog burrows, where it gets onto the prairie dogs'
hides and kills fleas.
Crews sprayed more than 300 000 burrows in 2005, according to Micah
Reuber, a biologist with FWS, based in Wall.
Ironically, the FWS crews dusting for plague to prevent prairie dogs
and ferrets from getting plague are working in areas not far from
places where state crews have poisoned prairie dogs in recent years
to keep them from spreading onto nearby private rangeland.
Ranchers have complained prairie dogs damaged vegetation on their
private ground and on parts of the national grassland they lease for grazing.
The Nebraska National Forest, which administers the Buffalo Gap
National Grassland, is considering expanding the poisoning to kill
prairie dogs in the interior of Conata Basin beyond the
public-private boundaries.
Most of the poisoning alternatives being considered are aimed at
capping prairie dog acres on the national grasslands.
Environmental groups say the poisoning, particularly if expanded into
the grasslands interior, poses a threat to the ferrets and other
species, such as the burrowing owl, that depend on prairie dogs.
They argue that ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in the world,
occupy just 6 10ths of one percent of the national grasslands and
that some of the poisoning alternatives would reduce that percentage
even lower. Livestock are allowed to graze on approximately 99
percent of the national grasslands.
Art Smith, wildlife-damage-management program administrator for the
South Dakota Game, Fish & Parks Department, said none of the areas
being dusted for fleas in order to protect prairie dogs are areas
being poisoned to kill prairie dogs.
"In some areas, (the prairie dog) needs to be controlled," Smith
said. "In other areas, it needs to be protected."
Meanwhile, Larson said, the annual ferret population survey in Conata
Basin has just begun.
"They're finding decent numbers," he said. Last year's [2006] survey
counted about 245 ferrets, he said.
But if plague gets into Conata Basin and threatens the ferrets,
federal officials might move the ferrets elsewhere.
So far, it appears the plague has been confined to the Pine Ridge
Reservation and a little way into Fall River County.
Ecoffey, who is monitoring the plague's spread on the Pine Ridge
Reservation, said the disease eventually may reach Conata Basin, home
of the endangered ferrets. "If it's here to stay, there's no reason
to say it won't," she said.

Prairie dogs are often sensitive sentinels for plague. A photo of a
prairie dog may be seen at

Black-tailed prairie dogs (_Cynomys ludovicianus_) are numerous in
the Western and areas of the Southwestern United States.
The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when
infected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels
(_Spermophilus variegatus_) are closely related to California ground
squirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their
principal flea (_Diamanus montanus_) is an aggressive parasite and
will readily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs
can also contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected
fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a
direct source of infection.
