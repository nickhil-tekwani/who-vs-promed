[2] Official press release: National sanitary and food safety veterinary authority (ANSVSA), Romania
Date: Mon 25 Aug 2014

On 8 Aug 2014, a case of bluetongue was diagnosed in Romania. On 21 Aug 2014, Buzau cattle owners requested veterinary assistance because of diseased animals.

After examination, the veterinarian found oral lesions [and lesions on] breast and feet, clinical signs attributable to bluetongue, and blood samples were sent for laboratory analysis to the DSVSA Buzau.

Following serological examination, it was found that the samples were positive for bluetongue [virus].

Subsequent sampling was called for by other owners of cattle in the area because their animals were showing similar clinical signs in different locations.

DSVSA Buzau sent a team of specialists to the area, who collected blood samples from these animals, and the samples analyzed were positive also for bluetongue [virus].

Blood samples were sent to the National Reference Laboratory, Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health (IDSA). These samples, analyzed by IDSA on 22 Aug 2014, had positive results for bluetongue [virus].

ANSVSA notified the States of the European Union and members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) about the occurrence of this disease in Romania. Also, ANSVSA called on the Bluetongue National Group of Experts to determine measures to be taken to limit the spread of disease in susceptible livestock.

This disease does not affect humans but causes economic damage.

Bluetongue is caused by a virus of the genus _Orbivirus_, which is transmitted by the bite of hematophagous insect species of the genus _Culicoides_, not by direct contact between animals. The disease affects ruminants and is seasonal. Mortality is variable, depending on the situation; morbidity can sometimes get to 100 percent.

From the literature, it appears that a haematophagous insect can travel up to 2 km per day, and, in certain weather conditions (winds prevailing in a certain direction and period, "favorable" conditions), insects can be borne by the wind for much greater distances, up to 200 km per day. In Europe at present, the disease is confined to several areas in the south: the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica, some areas of Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Bulgaria.

Economic losses due to disease eradication costs include compensation for animals killed, expenses pertaining to eradicating the disease (personnel, materials, equipment, etc.), expenses for clearing territory and exterminating and disinfecting activities.

Since this disease began to evolve in the neighboring countries, ANSVSA is alert and has taken several steps:

- A National Group of Experts convened a Bluetongue Meeting to determine the measures to be taken to protect herds of ruminants in Romania.

- To inform all concerned about the risk that bluetongue presents, ANSVSA posted on its website a risk analysis, which can be found at: http://www.ansvsa.ro/?p=756.

- DSVSA organized information meetings and training for farmers breeding cattle, sheep and goats.

[According to both reports, the disease in Romania has been observed, recorded, and laboratory confirmed in cattle, in contrast to recent reports on bluetongue epizootics in Greece, Bulgaria, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, and Turkey, where the disease has been affecting almost exclusively sheep and where the serotype has been found to be BTV-4. Traditionally, this serotype has long been known to cause clinical disease primarily in sheep, while in cattle, a species readily infected by the same vector, the infection remained subclinical in the vast majority of cases.

The (1969-2014) list of BTV-4 isolates in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright includes details on the species of the affected, sampled animals and other data, e.g. date and country of origin; see at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-4.htm#BUL2014/14.

The result of serotyping of the BT virus circulating in Romania is anticipated with great interest. - Mods.AS/CRD
