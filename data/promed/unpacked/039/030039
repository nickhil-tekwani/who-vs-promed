Danish COVID tally could be twice as high as registered, blood donor data suggests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of adult Danes infected with COVID-19 may be double the official tally, Danish scientists said on Thursday [4 Feb 2022], after releasing data suggesting one third of the adult population has been infected in the past 3 months.

By screening blood donations for certain antibodies, Danish scientists say they have come closer to determining how many people are actually infected, following the emergence of the more infectious omicron variant.

The preliminary research, conducted by the Nordic country's top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut (SSI), was based on analysis of 4722 blood donations collected in mid-January [2022].

The blood was analysed to see whether it contained antibodies against the virus' so-called nucleocapsid protein.

This type of antibody is only created when the body encounters the real coronavirus. It would not figure in blood samples from persons who had never been infected, even though they have developed antibodies from vaccines.

"The results indicate that... the proportion of infected people who have not tested positive makes up between a third and a half of all infections," SSI director Henrik Ullum said in a statement.

That means that for every 100 coronavirus infections registered, another 100 infections could go unreported.

According to official numbers, 1.2 million infections have been registered since [1 Nov 2021], around a fifth of the population. But that number includes children's infections and reinfections.

SSI's preliminary findings, which it says are subject to some uncertainty, could help authorities better predict the trajectory of the epidemic and shed light on population immunity, it said.

[2] Carnosic acid (rosemary)
Date: Tue 1 Feb 2022

https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2022/20220201-lipton-rosemary-covid19.html


A team co-led by scientists at Scripps Research has found evidence that a compound contained in the medicinal and culinary herb rosemary could be a 2-pronged weapon against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The scientists, in experiments described in a paper published 6 Jan 2022 in the journal Antioxidants, found that the compound, carnosic acid, can block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 outer "spike" protein and the receptor protein, ACE2, which the virus uses to gain entry to cells.

The team also presented evidence, and reviewed evidence from prior studies, that carnosic acid has a separate effect in inhibiting a powerful inflammatory pathway -- a pathway that is active in severe COVID-19 as well as in other diseases including Alzheimer's.

"We think that carnosic acid, or some optimized derivative, is worth investigating as a potentially cheap, safe, and effective treatment for COVID-19 and some other inflammation-related disorders," says study senior author Stuart Lipton, MD, PhD, Professor and Step Family Foundation Endowed Chair in the Department of Molecular Medicine and founding co-director of the Neurodegeneration New Medicines Center at Scripps Research.

In a 2016 study, Lipton and colleagues showed that carnosic acid activates an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant signaling cascade called the Nrf2 pathway, and found evidence that it reduces Alzheimer's-like signs in mouse models of that disease, which is known to feature brain inflammation.

For the new study, Lipton, along with Chang-ki Oh, PhD, and Dorit Trudler, PhD, respectively a staff scientist and postdoctoral fellow in the Lipton lab, and first author Takumi Satoh, PhD, of the Tokyo University of Technology, described their further studies of this anti-inflammatory effect on the immune cells that drive inflammation in COVID-19 and Alzheimer's. The researchers also reviewed evidence from other investigators' studies indicating that carnosic acid inhibits inflammation in other disease models. They proposed that this effect could be beneficial against the inflammation observed in COVID-19 and in some cases of the post-COVID syndrome known as long COVID, whose reported symptoms include cognitive difficulties often described as "brain fog."

Additionally, the scientists described a COVID-19 infection-blocking experiment conducted by Oh. Using a standard infectivity assay, he showed that carnosic acid can directly block SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect cells, with progressively greater infection-blocking activity at higher doses.

While the research is preliminary, the researchers propose that carnosic acid has this antiviral effect, despite being a safe and relatively unreactive compound, because it is converted to its active form by the inflammation and oxidation found at sites of infection. In that active form, they suggest, the compound modifies the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 -- making the receptor impregnable to the virus and thereby blocking infection.

"Carnosic acid represents a 'pathologically activated therapeutic' in preclinical models of disease -- inactive and innocuous in its normal state, but converted to an active form where it needs to be active," Lipton says.

Lipton and his colleagues are now working with Scripps Research chemists, including Phil Baran and Ben Cravatt, professors in the Department of Chemistry, to synthesize and test more potent derivatives of carnosic acid with improved drug characteristics for potential use in inflammation-related disorders.

Lipton and Satoh hold patents for the use of carnosic acid derivatives for degenerative diseases.

[...Because CA has been shown to not only act systemically but also to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain parenchyma to exert neuroprotective effects, we discuss the evidence that CA or rosemary extracts containing CA may represent an effective countermeasure against both acute and chronic pathological events initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other chronic neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD.

COVID severity doesn't depend on trimester of pregnancy, research shows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The severity of COVID-19 does not change based on pregnancy trimester, finds research presented today [3 Feb 2022] at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's (SMFM's) virtual annual meeting.

According to an abstract published [1 Jan 2022] in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology (AJOG), the research team studied the outcomes of 1092 pregnant COVID-19 patients who delivered at a Dallas hospital from 18 Mar 2020-31 May 2021.

Among them, 66 (6%) women were diagnosed in their 1st trimester, while 309 (28%) tested positive in their 2nd trimester, and 716 (66%) were diagnosed in their 3rd trimester. The groups had similar demographic characteristics; 87% were Hispanic.

Of patients hospitalized within 14 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis, 2 (15%) in their 1st trimester, 16 (47%) in their 2nd trimester, and 24 (5%) in their 3rd trimester were admitted for treatment of COVID-19.

Across trimesters, 90.9% of women had no or mild COVID-19 symptoms, and 10.1% who were initially asymptomatic developed moderate, severe, or critical symptoms. Of patients who were initially asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, 2 of 62 (3.2%) 1st-, 15/295 (5.1%) 2nd-, and 36/689 (5.2%) 3rd-trimester patients later developed moderate, severe, or critical illness.

"Regardless of what trimester they are in, pregnant people are at risk of developing severe COVID illness," lead author Rachel Schell, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said in an SMFM news release.

The authors noted that previous studies have shown that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are at elevated risk for hospitalization, ventilation, and death relative to their uninfected peers.

Senior author Emily Adhikari, MD, also of the University of Texas, said that the findings are helpful for clinicians counseling pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19. "There is no reason to be hesitant to get vaccinated because you are early in your pregnancy," she said. "You're still at risk of getting really sick from COVID in your first trimester."

Noting that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, SMFM, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Conclusion: Moderate, severe, or critical illness develops in almost 10% of pregnant patients. The frequency of COVID-19 disease progression in pregnancy does not differ by trimester of diagnosis.

Strokes most likely to occur within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis in seniors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among older adults, the risk of stroke is highest within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, and a new scoring system could help predict the risk of stroke, according to preliminary research presented at the International Stroke Conference 2022 this week.

The research was based on examining the health records of 37 379 Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 1 Apr 2020 and 28 Feb 2021 and were hospitalized for stroke from 1 Jan 2019 through 28 Feb 2021. Strokes occurring 7 days before diagnosis or 28 days after served as the control period.

The average age of patients was 80 years old, 57% were women, and more than 75% were white.

Stroke risk was greatest within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and was 10 times higher than the control group. The lowest stroke risk occurred after 15 to 28 days, when the risk of stroke was still 9% higher than during the control period.

"These findings can inform diagnosis, treatment and care of stroke among patients with COVID-19," Quanhe Yang, PhD, lead study author and senior scientist in the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a press release on the findings. "Further studies are needed to clarify the age-dependent risk of stroke associated with COVID-19."

What the omicron wave is revealing about human immunity
-------------------------------------------------------
[The following is excerpted by Mary Marshall.]

"We are just at the beginning of a wave of discovery," says John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. What emerges will be crucial not only for fighting COVID-19, but for understanding some of the most fundamental features of immune memory. ...

... it's much harder for the virus to find a way around the T-cell response. That's because T cells in one individual recognize different parts of the virus than do T cells in another individual. So a virus could mutate to escape one person's T-cell response, but not another's. "Escape is meaningless at the population level," Crotty says. Also, T cells can see parts of the virus (or the spike protein) that antibodies can't, including pieces that are less likely to mutate.

Several studies have found that people who had been vaccinated or had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 had about the same T-cell response to omicron as they did to the delta variant, despite the large number of mutations (8,9). Observations of omicron's spread also suggest that this is so. A T-cell response is possibly also helping to drive the phenomenon known as 'decoupling'. In areas with higher immunity because of past infections or vaccination, the number of cases of omicron has risen quickly, but the number of hospitalizations and deaths has increased much more slowly.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB3WORLD7_1644027969.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 51 countries: Brazil (286 050), France (274 352), the USA (268 122), Germany (240 218), India (155 023), Russia (155 768), Italy (112 956), Turkey (107 530), Japan (103 038), the UK (92 633), Netherlands (82 871), Belgium (83 455), Spain (74 368), Israel (58 677), Poland (54 475), Portugal (50 447), Czech Republic (43 450), Argentina (42 437), Denmark (41 712), Mexico (41 115), Ukraine (39 620), Austria (38 135), Iran (37 395), Chile (36 729), Switzerland (36 568), Sweden (36 541), Australia (32 189), Romania (32 671), South Korea (27 442), Indonesia (27 197), Georgia (23 664), Peru (22 542), Norway (21 804), Jordan (19 123), Slovakia (19 032), Hungary (17 894), Greece (17 662), Slovenia (16 860), Serbia (15 623), Columbia (13 568), Kazakhstan (14 304), Lithuania (12 607), Canada (12 557), Tunisia (12 276), Costa Rica (12 385), Pakistan (12 250), Bangladesh (11 596), Panama (11 291), Uruguay (10 618), Latvia (10 610), and Uruguay (10 015) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases.

A global total of 12 600 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 1 Feb 2022 to late 2 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 90 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 4.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 21.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 5.6% increase in daily reported cases and a 29.5% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3.22 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 388.52 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.73 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
