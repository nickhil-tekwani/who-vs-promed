Researchers are urging intensive surveillance and implementation of effective control and prevention strategies against West Nile virus [WNV] in Egypt, after testing for its seroprevalence among 930 horses.

The researchers, writing in the journal Scientific Reports [see citation below] found that 156 of the animals, or 16.8%, were serologically positive for the mosquito-borne virus, showing that they carried antibodies against the virus.

Abdelfattah Selim and his fellow researchers concentrated their study on the 5 governorates in the Nile delta region of Egypt with the greatest horse populations.

The 930 horses were randomly selected, with several tests used to confirm the seropositive status of the animals and to avoid cross-reaction with similar viruses.

They found that the highest seroprevalence rate was among horses age 15 or over, at 26.4%, while those of mixed breed had a seroprevalence of 21.5%.

Stallions were more likely than mares to be seropositive. Arabian horses were also more likely to carry antibodies against the virus.

Discussing their findings, the researchers said the virus is known to have been circulating in Egypt since 1951. They said more studies involving larger sample sizes and a broader geographical area are required to verify the associations found in this study.

"Our findings," they said, "indicate that intensive surveillance and implementation of effective control and prevention of WNV infection are urgently required."

The full study team comprised Abdelfattah Selim, Ameer Megahed, and Sahar Kandeel, with Benha University in Egpyt; and Abdulaziz Alouffi and Mashal Almutairi, with King Saud University in Saudi Arabia.

"A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 on 930 horses, which were distributed over 5 governorates in the Nile delta of Egypt. The horses, which were randomly selected, were serologically tested through use of an ID screen West Nile competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-WNV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT; gold standard) to confirm the seropositive status of animals and to avoid cross reaction with other flaviviruses. Four variables (geographical location, breed, sex, and age) were considered in the risk analysis. Univariable and stepwise forward multivariable logistic regression methods were used for risk-factor analysis. The odds ratio (OR) was used as an approximate measure of relative risk. A total of 156 (16.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.4-19.2; P less than 0.001) serum samples were found to be serologically positive for WNV. The highest seroprevalence rate was detected in horses of age greater than or equal to 15 years (68.1%; 95% CI 49.8-72.4), stallions (26.4%; 95% CI 22.7-30.4), and those of mixed breed (21.5%; 95% CI 17.7-27.5). Horses older than 15 years were found to be at increased risk of WNV infection with OR = 4.3 (95% CI 3.0-6.2, P less thanÃ¢ÂÂ0.001) compared with horses aged under 2.5 years. Also, when all the risk factors were considered, stallions were more likely than mares to be WNV seropositive (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.7, P less than 0.001), and of the breeds, mixed-breed (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.8, P = 0.005) and Arabian horses (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.8, P = 0.005) were more likely to be seropositive. Geographical location seemed to have no impact on the seroprevalence of exposure to WNV among these horses. Due to these findings, we strongly recommend intensive surveillance and implementation of effective control and prevention strategies against WNV, especially in stallion, mixed-breed horses with ages greater than or equal to 15 years."

In the paper's discussion, the authors address the relatively low prevalence of exposure to WNV among Egypt's delta horses, as observed in their serosurvey, compared to results reported from countries that surround Egypt, namely Israel (39%), Jordan (24.9%), Algeria (26.8%), Morocco (31.1%), and Turkey (31.6%). They suggest that the low level of seroprevalence in this study, might be because "there are few horse farms in Egypt and therefore most of the horses that were investigated in this study were individually raised," decreasing the chances of exposure of the horses to the virus.

In this respect, the following data, included in a report from Israel [see reference below], may be of relevance:

"An increase in seroprevalence was observed, from 39% (113/290) in 1997 to 66.1% (547/827) in 2002 and 85.5% (153/179) in 2013, with persistent significantly higher seroprevalence in horses situated along the Great Rift Valley (GRV) area, the major birds' migration route in Israel. Demographic risk factors included age and breed of the horse. Significantly lower spring precipitation was observed during years with increased human incidence rate that occurred between 1997-2007. Hence, we suggest referring to Israel as 2 WNV distinct epidemiological regions: an endemic region along the birds' migration route (GRV) and the rest of the country, which perhaps suffers from cyclic epidemics. In addition, weather conditions, such as periods of spring drought, might be associated with the transition from endemic state to epidemic state of WNV."

Egypt and Israel share the Red Sea flyway (map at http://datazone.birdlife.org/birdlife-is-working-to-mainstream-soaring-bird-conservation-along-the-rift-valley/red-sea-flyway; click to zoom in). It will be interesting to note if WNV epidemiology in Egypt may also include endemic and cyclic epidemics components.

Studies on WNV virus infection in Egypt, addressing humans, sentinel chicken flocks, and mosquitoes, were performed in 5 sites of the country, including the Nile delta, during the period 1999-2002. The test results, obtained in the NAMRU-3 laboratories (at that time in Cairo), led the authors to conclude that "the study demonstrates that WNV was actively circulating during the study period in different areas in Egypt and causing febrile illness in a considerable proportion of individuals in the study sites."

[West Nile virus is carried by mosquitoes, which are most active at dawn, and again at dusk. Keeping horses in a barn with fans during those most vulnerable times is helpful in preventing the disease. Using insect or mosquito spray specifically labeled for horses is another method of reducing the risk of this disease transmission.

Once a horse has been bitten by one or more mosquitoes carrying the virus, clinical signs may not be observed for 5-15 days. The most common sign of infection with WNV in horses includes incoordination, stumbling, one or more limbs seeming weak, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and death. Death may be the 1st clinical sign observed. These clinical signs may appear in combination, or as a single sign. Each affected horse may develop different signs. A few horses do not seem to have any discernible signs, except death.

While treatment of an affected horse is extremely important to recovery, there are no specific antibody treatments to attack this virus. Rather, veterinary supportive therapy is necessary. Anticonvulsants and fluids may be needed. Some horses may need hospitalization to recover. The virus affects each animal differently, based on age and overall health of the animal. This variety in severity of clinical signs necessitates a veterinarian involvement.

Recovery time is dependent upon the overall health of the horse, the age of the horse, and timeliness of treatments. Depending on how rapidly the treatment is administered, improvement is often seen approximately 5-7 days from the time the clinical signs first appeared. Approximately 20-30% of affected horses will exhibit severe neurological signs, possibly including seizures for several weeks. Often there is fever associated with the disease, and certainly if the animal develops seizures. The fever must be treated.

Approximately 1/3 of affected horses will die. While the rest will survive, approximately 17% of those "recovered" horses may relapse, or perhaps experience an incomplete recovery. Owners should be patient with their animals as this disease takes a serious toll on the health and stamina of an affected animal. Return to work or training could be delayed significantly.

Ensure the horse receives sufficient fluids, which may need to be intravenous, especially if the horse is unable to drink on its own. Feeding may also need to be intravenous or perhaps via a stomach tube if the animal is not eating.

Affected horses may go down and be unable to rise. In such cases, use of a sling to raise the horse 2-4 times daily is necessary to maintain circulation and prevent pressure point sores. Protection for the legs and head may be necessary, especially if the horse develops seizures.

Other problems that could result from infection with WNV include joint and tendon infections, sheath infections, pneumonia, and diarrhea as secondary events.

It is easy to see why preventing the disease with vaccines and mosquito control is preferable to your animal having this disease. Many countries have a WNV vaccine, often in combination with other diseases such as tetanus, equine encephalopathies, and rabies.

If your county has vaccines, please use them to protect your animal. - Mod.TG
