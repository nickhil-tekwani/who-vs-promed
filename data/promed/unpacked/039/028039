Equine infectious anemia, Hungary
---------------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 5 Jul 2022
Confirmed: 5 Jul 2022
Reported: 7 Jul 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Last occurrence: 30 Jun 2021
Causal agent: equine infectious anaemia virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: Csomor, Godollo, Pest
Started: 5 Jul 2022
Ended: ongoing
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 31 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments
The horse did not show any clinical signs. Two serological tests have been carried out with a 3-week interval, and the infected horse was 2 times seropositive. According to the Hungarian legislation it had to be killed for epidemiological reason. All the other horses which have been kept at the same place, were tested at the same times and were seronegative. The surveillance is continuing.

Domestic control measures applied: control of vectors, selective killing and disposal, screening, quarantine, disinfection, movement control

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Veterinary Diagnostic Directorate of the National Food Chain Safety Office (national laboratory) / Equidae / Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 5 Jul 2022 / Positive

["Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family Retroviridae, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae. Other members of the genus Lentivirus include: bovine immunodeficiency virus; caprine arthritis encephalitis virus; feline immunodeficiency virus; human immunodeficiency virus 1; human immunodeficiency virus 2; simian immunodeficiency virus and maedi/visna virus. Although EIA may be suspected on the basis of clinical signs and pathological lesions, confirmation of infection requires further serological and molecular-based testing. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result. Although antibody levels fluctuate, EIA infection generates a persistent antibody response. All equids older than 12 months, which test seropositive are identified as virus carriers. In young equids less than 12 months of age, positive serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; therefore, the EIA status may have to rely solely on molecular techniques. As virus reservoirs, infected equids are a transmission risk to other equids. The virus is primarily blood-borne. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature and infection is often spread via iatrogenic routes".
