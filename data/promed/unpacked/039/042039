[This outbreak is following an unusual course in the sense that there are
long gaps in time between reported outbreaks. The outbreaks also are quite
far apart geographically. The first reported outbreak occurred almost a
year ago in the Vratsa region in the north west of the country. The next
outbreak in January 2006 was located in Blagoevgrad region in the south
west of the country. The April 2006 outbreak was in the easternmost part of
the country, very close to the Black Sea -- and now this outbreak is
squarely in the southern central portion of the country. - Mod.PC]
