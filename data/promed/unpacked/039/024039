People living on, fishing in, or swimming in the waters of Rice Lake
or the Trent River [Ontario] are being asked to be on the lookout for
dead carp. Even one dead carp should be reported to the Ministry of
Natural Resources (MNR), says spokesperson J.J. Beechie.
Take precautions when handling such carcasses including wearing
gloves, using a shovel and double-bagging for disposal, he says. As
in all cases of handling dead wildlife, follow these measures, and
disinfect items used to touch them.
Officials still don't know what is killing the carp, and further
testing is being carried out, Mr. Beechie continued.
It may be a month before a federal lab has results, and then again,
the reason for the fish die-off that appears to be moving through the
Trent-Severn Waterway may never be known. "We may never get an answer
about what it is," Mr. Beechie said.
A massive number of dead fish were 1st spotted on Lake Scugog in the
Trent-Severn Waterway in early June [2007] by the ministry's fish
assessment unit checking on the health of the lake. Thousands of carp
eventually floated onto shore showing "obvious signs of trauma" and
blood red-coloured scales with some white, blotchy marks, he said.
By 26 Jun 2007, dead carp where being found in the Sturgeon River and
Sturgeon Lake near Lindsay, the connecting waterways running
northeast from Lake Scugog.
On 9 Jul 2007, the tri-lake region of the Kawarthas north of
Peterborough was also reporting dead carp in Buckhorn, Pigeon, and
Chemong lakes, but so far not in the quantities that died in Lake Scugog.
While the ministry's fish assessment unit discovered the fish problem
that surfaced in Lake Scugog, "we do look to the public to help us
monitor any fish disease or fish kill," Mr. Beechie said. "Call if
you even see one (dead carp)," he says.
A series of single sightings could indicate changes that should be
followed up. Carp look like large goldfish with large scales.
"Because we don't yet know what it is (that is killing the carp) it's
hard to say whether this will move to Rice Lake (or other parts of
the system)," Mr. Beechie said.
With this mystery still unsolved, the ministry advises when moving
boats, fish bait, boating, or swimming equipment, or even wet bathing
suits, from one lake to another, to clean and/or empty the items of
water. This is already standard procedure in trying to limit the
spread of invasive species.
Initially the death of so many carp was suspected to be due to
disease and/or a secondary infection, but this wasn't confirmed.
There are no other large species-specific fish kills evident in the
Trent-Severn Waterway at this time.
Anyone who has seen a dead carp is asked to notify the Ministry of
Natural Resources at 1-800-667-1940.

[It is strange that only carp are involved. As carp are the only
species reportedly involved, it could be spring carp mortality
syndrome (SCMS). Although, I would not necessarily classify this as
spring, the weather patterns this year (2007) have been slightly out
of what is perceived as normal. A specific pathogen has not been
identified to be associated with SCMS.
Other possibilities include the virus spring viremia of carp, which
has, according to this article been ruled out. Spring viremia of carp
is caused by _Rhabdovirus carpio_, a bullet-shaped RNA virus. The
disease has been reported in common carp (or koi) (_Cyprinus
carpio_), grass carp (_Ctenopharyngodon idella_), bighead carp
(_Aristichthys nobilis_), silver carp (_Hypophthalmichthys
molitrix_), and Crucian carp (_Carassius carassiu_), a close relative
of the goldfish. Recent evidence suggests that common goldfish (_C.
auratus_) are also susceptible.
There was a massive fish kill affecting exclusively common carp
_Cyprinus carpio carpio_ in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada,
during the summer of 2001. Although lymphocytic encephalitis was
induced experimentally, it was not proven to be the cause.
It is likely, given the length of time and the obvious extent of this
die-off, that disease and toxin testing have already been done. We
look forward to laboratory results.
