[As noted previously, the cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly and are occurring in several localities. In less than 3 weeks the number of deaths has increased to 30, with 3 today [18 Jul 2022]. The number of JE cases has risen to 183. Interestingly, none of these 183 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome, as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). - Mod.TY
