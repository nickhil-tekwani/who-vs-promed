BSE - EUROPE
============
In the 8th June issue of the Veterinary Record, page 575, there
are two letters of interest and relevance to the recognition of
BSE in Europe.
[1] B.E.C. Schreuder (DLO-Institute for Animal Science & Health,
Lelystad, The Netherlands) and O.C. Straub (Tubingen, Germany)
provide a short preview of their joint study with John Wilesmith
(CVL, MAFF, UK) on the European importation of pure-bred British
breeding stock during 1985-1990 and using the annual BSE incidence
rates available for separate birth cohorts. This provided an import
related risk index for each country. While the results are to be
submitted for publication shortly, "it is evident that not many
countries (in Europe) can maintain that they have never had BSE."
During 1985-1990 Great Britain exported 57,900 pure-bred breeding
stock at an age that would allow for infection during calfhood and
early adolescence. According to their calculations, these animals
would have domonstrated 1668 cases of BSE had they remained in
Great Britain. "Only a proportion of these cases have been reported.
These results clearly indicate that BSE cannot be considered a
British problem alone and that a European approach is required."
Meanwhile, we must await their full report with patience. It should
be noted that their predicted number of cases does not include
cases following upon the consumption of imported British feed.

[2] John O. Broberg (MRCVS, Weston, Stafford) compared the yield
of cases in relation to slaughter compensation ... [admittedly it
is not complete but] ... and noted that Britain (159,122 cases) and
Switzerland (206 cases) have compulsory slaughter of _individual_
affected animals with full compensation. France (13 cases), Italy
(2 cases) and Denmark (1 case) have whole herd slaughter with a
range of compensation from "generous" (France), to 70% (Italy), to
market value (Denmark). He then goes on to discuss a concerned
farmer's reaction to the potential for a life's work being destroyed.
compared to sending a single sick animal with abnormal behaviour to
the knacker or to slaughter.
To quote Broberg further ... "Britain's adoption of individual slaughter
and compensation has kept the disease out in the open. This meant it
can be studied properly and lessons learnt." ..."The same types of
cattle feed have been used all over the Continent so it is very difficult
to believe that there have been so few cases in the rest of Europe. Indeed
I wonder if the veterinary officers of other countries in Europe are naive
enough to believe their own figures or if they are simply satisfied to
adopt the political view that if a disease is not reported it cannot exist."
