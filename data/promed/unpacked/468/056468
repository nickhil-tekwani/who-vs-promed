[1] California Pistachio Recall
Date: Mon 30 Mar 2009
Source: FDA [edited]
<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2009/NEW01982.html>


The FDA and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) are
investigating _Salmonella_ contamination in pistachio products sold
by Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc, California. The company has
stopped all distribution of processed pistachios and will issue a
voluntary recall involving approximately 1 million pounds of its
products. Because the pistachios were used as ingredients in a
variety of foods, it is likely this recall will impact many products.
In addition, the investigation at the company is ongoing and may lead
to additional pistachio product recalls.

The contamination involves multiple strains of Salmonella. It is not
yet known whether any of the Salmonella strains found in the
pistachio products are linked to an outbreak. The FDA is conducting
genetic testing of the samples to pursue all links. FDA is working
closely with the pistachio industry and recommends that consumers
avoid eating pistachio products until further information is
available about the scope of affected products.

The FDA will provide a searchable database of affected products at
<http://www.fda.gov/pistachios/> and will continue to update the public.

The FDA 1st learned of the problem on Tue 24 Mar 2009, when it was
informed by Kraft Foods that its Back To Nature Trail Mix was found
to be contaminated with Salmonella. Kraft had identified the source
of the contamination to be pistachios from Setton and conducted a recall.

[There are apparently a small number of cases that are associated
with ingestion of pistachios but no information is yet available
regarding any genetic link between the infection and these nuts.
Despite the lack of a clear association, the size of the recall has
precipitated ProMED posting. - Mod.LL]

[2] Pistachio Recall
Date: Mon 30 Mar 2009

Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella, Inc. announced that it is
voluntarily recalling from nationwide distribution specific lots of
bulk roasted shelled pistachios and 2000-pound, 1700-pound,
1800-pound and 1000-pound tote bags of roasted in-shell pistachios
sold to wholesale customers due to potential contamination with _Salmonella_.

This voluntary recall affects certain bulk roasted in-shell and
roasted shelled pistachios shipped on or after 1 Sep 2008. The bulk
product was distributed throughout the USA. The company is
voluntarily taking this precautionary measure after learning that a
small amount of roasted shelled pistachios processed by Setton
Pistachio and received by a commercial customer in late 2008 recently
tested positive for _Salmonella_. This voluntary recall is not in any
way related to the recent recalls associated with peanuts or peanut butter.

The company is asking those firms who received bulk product and have
further processed, repackaged, or distributed the affected products
to recall those products and contact the FDA.

In addition, the company is voluntarily recalling the following
retail product: Setton Farms brand roasted salted shelled pistachios
in 9-ounce film bags, UPC Code: 034325020252 with a "Best Before"
date between 6 Jan 2010 and 19 Jan 2010. This product was distributed
in the following states: SC, GA, FL, NC, VA, TN, KY. Consumers should
not consume this product and should return what they may have to the
place of purchase for a full refund.

[If the nuts were adequately roasted, the contamination must have
occurred after this. Apparently, a number of serotypes of _S.
enterica_ have been found in the nuts. - Mod.LL]

[3] Pistachio Recall

This week, 2 million pounds of pistachios were recalled because of
concerns about contamination. Pistachios were a surprise because they
historically have not been considered vulnerable to bacterial
contamination, says Richard Matoian of the Western Pistachio
Association in Fresno.

The repeated outbreaks and recalls may bring about a new day in the
oversight of nut production. For the peanut industry, "This is a
wake-up call," says Emory Murphy, the Georgia Peanut Commission's
assistant executive director.

"There's enormous public pressure placed on food processors and
manufacturers to ensure farm-to-fork integrity," says Arvin Maskin, a
product-liability lawyer at Weil Gotshal and Manges in New York. Even
consumer advocates who say food producers have avoided making safety
a priority are seeing a change. "I think that resistance is crumbling
in the wake of repeated recalls, which have cost them so much money
and so much in the way of consumer confidence," says Sarah Klein, a
staff attorney at the Center for Science in the Public Interest
(CSPI) in Washington, DC.

Requiring everyone along the production process to make sure the
ingredients they're using are safe seems to work. It's how the
pistachio contamination was discovered. A small Skokie, IL, firm
called the Georgia Nut Co. bought pistachios from Setton Pistachio of
Terra Bella, CA, and then, as part of its routine food-safety
efforts, had them tested for salmonella.

"We have a pretty rigorous product-testing regime," spokesman Joshua
Robbins says. The test came back positive for _Salmonella_, and the
company issued a recall on 25 Mar 2009 for the nuts it had sent to a
small number of Chicago-area stores. It also informed Kraft Foods,
for which it produced and packaged Nantucket Blend Trail Mix under
the Back to Nature Foods label. Kraft issued a recall for the trail
mix, which contains pistachios, the same day.

Kraft has also recalled all Planters products containing pistachios,
and Frito-Lay has recalled its in-shell pistachios. The Kroger
supermarket chain of Cincinnati has recalled its Private Selection
Shelled Pistachios.

Setton Pistachio sold its pistachios in 1000- and 2000-pound
containers to about 30 wholesalers. FDA officials say they expect the
pistachio recall to become larger as makers of pistachio-containing
products such as ice cream, candy and trail mix realize that their
foods contain Setton pistachios.

Pistachios have 3 distinct processing steps that have historically
made them a very low-risk product when it came to bacterial
contamination, says Matoian of the Western Pistachio Association.
1st, pistachios are harvested by large machines that shake the tree,
dropping the nuts into hoppers. Nuts that fall on the ground where
they might be contaminated are not harvested, he says. Then they're
brought to a processing facility where they're husked and washed,
generally in a very diluted chlorine bath to both clean them and kill
contaminants. From there, they go through an initial drying process
at 160 degrees to 200 degrees for 4 to 6 hours, Matoian says. After
that, they're cooled and stored until they're roasted at 250 degrees
to 350 degrees for 15 minutes to a few hours, depending on the processor.

While it's not yet known how Setton's nuts were tainted, company
officials say they believe the processed nuts may have come in
contact with raw pistachios that carried the bacteria.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Loblaw Brands Ltd. are
warning the public not to consume certain President's Choice brand
Premium Nut Collections and White Chocolate Cranberry Pistachio Bark.
The nationally distributed products contain pistachios recently
recalled in the USA by Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella, Inc., due to
salmonella contamination.

A day earlier, it was announced Frito Lay Canada was voluntarily
pulling Munchies brand pistachios from the marketplace. In either
case, no associated illnesses have been reported.

[6] Philippines Recall

<http://mb.com.ph/articles/201090/pistachios-recalled>


The Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) on Wed 1 Apr 2009 ordered a
recall on pistachio products sourced from manufacturer Setton
Pistachio in California following an earlier recall by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) due to salmonella contamination. "We
are recalling all pistachio brands imported from the USA," said BFAD
director Leticia Barbara Gutierrez.

She said inspectors have already collected samples of the products
and are now testing them. Gutierrez said she asked the importers to
pull out their pistachio products via a product recall order. She
said they intended to serve the recall order on Wed 1 Apr 2009,
although importers have already been informed of the BFAD action by
phone. There are 4 licensed pistachio importers in the country who
are sourcing their products from the USA.
