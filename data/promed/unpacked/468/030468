Korea Bans Poultry Import From New York
-----------------------------------------------
South Korea has halted the import of poultry products from New York State,
after the United States reported a suspicious case of bird flu in the
region, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said on Tuesday [14 Jun 2005].
The U.S. Agriculture Department informed the World Organization for Animal
Health on 10 Jun 2005 of the outbreak of a low-pathogenic bird flu (H7N2)
case on a duck farm in Sullivan, New York, the ministry said.
The virus is known as the H7N2 strain, but it can develop into a
high-pathogenic one and infect humans, the ministry said, adding the U.S.
farm authorities are conducting further tests.
"We've suspended quarantine procedures for poultry from New York," a
ministry official said. "The meat infected by low-pathogenic [bird flu] is
normally not subject to the halt of global trade, but we have to think
about the worst-case scenario. The virus can develop into a highly
dangerous one."
The country's quarantine halt is limited only to poultry from the State of
New York, and it will be lifted once the influenza is confirmed to be
low-pathogenic.
South Korea banned imports of U.S. poultry in February last year [2004?],
citing dangers of avian influenza infection, but reopened the market last
month [May 2005]. There have been no reported poultry imports from the U.S.
since the resumption.
In December 2004, South Korea reported the outbreak of a bird flu case in
Kwangju, halting exports of poultry. Trade resumed after the H5N2-strain
infection was found later to be a low-pathogenic one.
