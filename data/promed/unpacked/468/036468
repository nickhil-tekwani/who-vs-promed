A virus's virus
---------------
Researchers have discovered the 1st virus to infect another virus,
according to a study appearing tomorrow in Nature. The new virus was
found living inside a new strain of the viral giant, mimivirus. "This
is one parasite living on another parasite, which is really
fascinating," Michael Rossman, microbiologist at Purdue University,
who was not involved in the study, told The Scientist.

Didier Raoult and colleagues at the Universitee de la Mediterranee in
Marseilles, France, discovered mimivirus in 2003 from a water-cooling
tower in the UK [see ProMED-mail reference below]. It primarily
infects amoeba, although antibodies have been found to the virus in
some human pneumonia cases. It measures in diameter about 400
nanometers (nm), while medium-sized viruses such as adenovirus and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) measure closer to 100-200 nm.

In this study, Raoult's team found a new strain of mimivirus in water
from a cooling tower in Paris. This new strain was even larger than
[the UK] mimivirus, so the researchers named it mamavirus. To their
surprise, while examining the new strain by electron microscopy they
saw a smaller virus attached to mamavirus. This small virus comprises
only 20 genes (mimivirus has more than 900 protein-coding genes) and
the researchers named it Sputnik.

The team quickly set to work to see what effect Sputnik was having on
the mamavirus. They found that Sputnik infects the replication
machinery in mamavirus and causes it to produce deformed viral
structures and abnormal capsids, where viral genetic information is
stored. It had a similar effect on mimivirus. Because Sputnik's
behavior so closely resembles what bacteriophage do to bacteria, the
researchers called the new type of virus a virophage, and suspect it
may represent a new virus family.

The researchers found that Sputnik's genes shared homology with genes
from all 3 domains of life: archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. Some of
the genes were homologous to novel sequences that scientists
previously detected in a metagenomic study of ocean water. This
supports the idea that Sputnik is part of a larger family of viruses,
Bernard La Scola, researcher at the Universite de la Mediterranee
(University of the Mediterranean) and 1st author on the paper, told
The Scientist.

The size of a virus may dictate whether it can be infected by smaller
viruses such as Sputnik, he added. For this reason, viruses that
affect humans -- like HIV and influenza -- are likely too small to be
infected by Sputnik-like viruses, said Rossman.

La Scola added he is sure that there are other giant viruses yet to
be identified in the world, but they won't necessarily be infected by
smaller viruses. "We need to be lucky to find another Sputnik."

677 (2008) DOI: 10.1038/454677a]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The discovery of a giant virus that falls ill through infection by
another virus (1) is fuelling the debate about whether viruses are
alive. "There's no doubt this is a living organism," says Jean-Michel
Claverie, a virologist at the CNRS UPR [Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique-unites propres de recherche/National Center
for Scientific Research-intramural labs] laboratories in Marseilles,
part of France's basic-research agency. "The fact that it can get
sick makes it more alive."

Giant viruses have been captivating virologists since 2003, when a
team led by Claverie and Didier Raoult at CNRS UMR [unites mixtes de
recherche/joint labs], also in Marseilles, reported the discovery of
the 1st monster (2). The virus had been isolated more than a decade
earlier in amoebae from a cooling tower in Bradford, UK, but was
initially mistaken for a bacterium because of its size, and was
relegated to the freezer.

Closer inspection showed the microbe to be a huge virus with, as
later work revealed, a genome harbouring more than 900 protein-coding
genes (3) -- at least 3 times more than that of the biggest
previously known viruses and bigger than that of some bacteria. It
was named _Acanthamoeba polyphaga_ mimivirus (for mimicking microbe)
[see the ICTV database at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/00.110.0.01.htm> -
Mod.CP], and is thought to be part of a much larger [virus] family.
"It was the cause of great excitement in virology," says Eugene
Koonin at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in
Bethesda, Maryland. "It crossed the imaginary boundary between
viruses and cellular organisms."

Now Raoult, Koonin, and their colleagues report the isolation of a
new strain of giant virus from a cooling tower in Paris, which they
have named mamavirus because it seemed slightly larger than
mimivirus. Their electron microscopy studies also revealed a 2nd,
small virus closely associated with mamavirus that has earned the
name Sputnik, after the 1st man-made satellite.

With just 21 genes, Sputnik is tiny compared with its mama -- but
insidious. When the giant mamavirus infects an amoeba, it uses its
large array of genes to build a 'viral factory', a hub where new
viral particles are made. Sputnik infects this viral factory and
seems to hijack its machinery in order to replicate. The team found
that cells co-infected with Sputnik produce fewer and often deformed
mamavirus particles, making the virus less infective. This suggests
that Sputnik is effectively a viral parasite that sickens its host --
seemingly the 1st such example.

The team suggests that Sputnik is a 'virophage', much like the
bacteriophage viruses that infect and sicken bacteria. "It infects
this factory like a phage infects a bacterium," Koonin says. "It's
doing what every parasite can -- exploiting its host for its own replication."

Sputnik's genome reveals further insight into its biology. Although
13 of its genes show little similarity to any other known genes, 3
are closely related to mimivirus and mamavirus genes, perhaps
cannibalized by the tiny virus as it packaged up particles sometime
in its history. This suggests that the satellite virus could perform
horizontal gene transfer between viruses -- paralleling the way that
bacteriophages ferry genes between bacteria.

The findings may have global implications, according to some
virologists. A metagenomic study of ocean water (4) has revealed an
abundance of genetic sequences closely related to giant viruses,
leading to a suspicion that they are a common parasite of plankton.
These viruses had been missed for many years, Claverie says, because
the filters used to remove bacteria screened out giant viruses as
well. Raoult's team also found genes related to Sputnik's in an
ocean-sampling data set, so this could be the 1st of a new, common
family of viruses. "It suggests there are other representatives of
this viral family out there in the environment," Koonin says.

By regulating the growth and death of plankton, giant viruses -- and
satellite viruses such as Sputnik -- could be having major effects on
ocean nutrient cycles and climate. "These viruses could be major
players in global systems," says Curtis Suttle, an expert in marine
viruses at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.

"I think ultimately we will find a huge number of novel viruses in
the ocean and other places," Suttle says -- 70 percent of viral genes
identified in ocean surveys have never been seen before. "It
emphasizes how little is known about these organisms -- and I use
that term deliberately."

[The identification of the 'Sputnik' virophage, a 21-gene parasite of
another 800-gene virus, opens up a new dimension in the study of
living organisms. The Sputnik virus, a not yet fully characterised
virus, infects and damages its host -- members of a unique family of
giant viruses classified in the family _Mimiviridae_, so far only
found in aquatic amoebae. Perhaps the greatest relevance of the
satellite virus may be a potential to facilitate horizontal gene
transfer between viruses -- paralleling the way that bacteriophages
ferry genes between bacteria. - Mod.CP]
