The [Philippines] Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday [17 Sep 2013] confirmed that a Filipina nurse has died from the deadly coronavirus in Saudi Arabia.

"Our embassy in Riyadh confirmed that a 41-year-old Filipina staff nurse at a hospital in Riyadh died last [29 Aug 2013] and based on a medical report obtained, the deceased tested positive for the coronavirus before her death," said DFA spokesperson Assistant Secretary Raul Hernandez.

Hernandez said the [nurse] was admitted to the hospital on [12 Aug 2013] after a fishbone got stuck in her throat. She was discharged 2 days later.

However, after 5 days, Hernandez said she suffered fever and coughing. She developed respiratory distress and was put on a ventilator on [22 Aug 2013]. "2 days later, she was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and had to be transferred to the hospital's ICU," he said.

The DFA is now coordinating with the nurse's family and the Department of Health for the repatriation of her remains.

Hernandez said that another Filipino has recovered after being infected by the virus while confined at the hospital.

"The patient was brought by her employer to the hospital for dialysis and was infected during her confinement. She is now recovering.

Hernandez urged all Filipinos in Riyadh to follow measures being undertaken by local health authorities to prevent the spread of the virus.

"They should also immediately seek medical attention if they feel any of the disease's symptoms which include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and even diarrhea," Hernandez said.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia last year [2012]. The MERS-CoV has been reported in people in the Gulf, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and Britain.

WHO has been informed of an additional 18 new laboratory-confirmed cases including 3 deaths with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The patients are reported from Hafar Al-Batin, Medina, and Riyadh. Their ages range from 3 to 75 years old. These cases were announced by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia on [1, 5, 8, 10, and 11 Sep 2013].

Additionally, in Qatar, a previously laboratory-confirmed patient with MERS-CoV died on [6 Sep 2013].

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 58 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[The WHO global update above confirms additional cases and deaths from Saudi Arabia and a death of a previously reported case in Qatar. In the absence of specific demographic details, it is difficult to attempt to reconcile the global tallies. This moderator suspects that the summary does not include the newly reported cases and deaths included in the MOH update in section [1] above (3 cases including 2 deaths).

As previously mentioned, maintaining accurate, up-to-date tallies based on a variety of reports coming out at different times and containing a variety of types of information on the cases being reported, is a significant challenge. - Mod.MPP]
