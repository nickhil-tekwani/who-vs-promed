Between 29 Jan and 7 Feb 2019, in total 52 carcasses were found positive for African swine fever (ASF). Most animals, which were all found within the kernel zone in the southern Belgian province Luxembourg, had died of the virus according to the latest report to the OIE [follow-up rep no. 21 at http://tinyurl.com/y4nbq5q2; map included].

Worryingly, however, 2 cases of ASF were found in wild boar that were shot close to the village of Orsinfaing. These animals were killed about 3.5 km [about 2 mi] north of the latest known ASF location, and close to the border of the kernel zone.

In addition, local media report a positive case of ASF found in wild boar near Mussy-la-Ville, which is at 2 km [about 1.25 mi] of the French border, more towards Longwy. This case, however, has not been shared by the OIE yet.

The 1st outbreak of ASF was reported in September 2018 near the village Etalle. So far, the virus has not been found in domestic pigs.

Arrests made due to ASF
-----------------------
Meanwhile, the Belgian authorities in Luxembourg province have arrested 2 men in the context of the African swine fever outbreaks in Belgium. The arrest followed the interviewing of 4 of them last [Wed 6 Feb 2019]. In the context of the investigating authorities, officially no further statements have been made about the arrests.

It has been confirmed that 1 of these 4 persons interviewed is a forestry ranger, employed by the Public Service of Wallonia (SPW). The Walloon public service has confirmed this. According to Belgian press agency Belga, that person was working for the Walloon Department of Nature and Forests (DNF).

In the absence of further publicly shared information, local media have started digging and speculating what this all may mean. Most conclude that the arrested men are members of the Brussels high society and have been taken into custody on the suspicion of having smuggled ASF-infected wild boar into Belgium from Eastern Europe -- perhaps even already in spring 2018. In addition, the men would not have reported the discovery of infected carcasses soon enough. Some media even mention names, families, and connections.

In the meantime, Denis Ducarme, Belgium's federal minister for agriculture, has indicated that the pig sector in his country is now 'in crisis' due to African swine fever. Even though not a single domestic pig has been infected, the presence of the virus has affected pork prices: These have dropped by 20% since September [2018].

Having acknowledged the crisis, the minister can apply several policy measures in the next year, like temporary tax alleviation or even exemption. In addition, the minister decided to relax the rules for pig transport.

Germany: fear for ASF outbreaks
-------------------------------
So far, no outbreaks of ASF have been reported from Germany, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a topic of conversation. On the contrary, the Germans also have a plan ready in case an outbreak will occur. The Germans' main approach assumes a German outbreak will also take place in wild boar and centres around informing hunters and members of the public.

Main message: ASF is not a zoonosis, that is, humans cannot contract the virus. The next message is the economic importance of pig production for the country, as 150 000 people are (in)directly employed through the swine business in Germany.

In case an outbreak will occur in Germany, the approach will follow the example as in the Czech Republic -- a combination of leaving the infected kernel zone alone and intensified hunting in the zone around it [see comment].

Last but not least -- the directorate-general on Health and Food Safety (DG-Sante) of the European Commission would ideally like to introduce new legislation that will compel all pig farms within the EU to have a fence surrounding their premises.

Differences of opinion between various member states within the EU, however, are the only reason why there aren't any regulations yet, according to Francesco Berlingieri, DG-Sante, at a symposium on ASF, held in Germany recently.

[The Belgian ASF event summary, as presented in OIE's WAHIS archive, follows.
Date of start of the event: 9 Sep 2018
Outbreak summary, as of 11 Feb 2019:
Total outbreaks = 292 (submitted)
Species / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / 457 / 444 / 13 / 0

The only European country which has been able, so far, to declare its ASF event resolved since the start of the current ASF panzootic (Georgia, 2007; references in "see also") has been the Czech Republic (20181009.6080594).

The Czech event summary, as presented in OIE's WAHIS archive, follows.
Date of start of the event: 21 Jun 2017
Date event resolved: 19 Apr 2018

Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks = 221 (submitted)
Species / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / 221 / 203 / 18 / 0

During the entire Czech event, in Zlinsky province, the country's domestic swine population remained free of infection. The measures applied to control and eradicate ASF from wild boar were described in a presentation, available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180919_pres_asf_cze.pdf. - Mod.AS
