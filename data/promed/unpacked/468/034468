FISH KILL - CANADA (PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND)

Fish are dying by the thousands in rivers on Prince Edward Island and the
blame is being put on pesticides used on potato fields.
Cloudy red water flows down the Westmoreland River, along with 1,500 dead
brook trout. This is one of the largest, and most recent, fish kills on
Prince Edward Island. More than 3,000 fish have died in rivers here this
month.
Daryl Guignon is a biologist. He's appalled by what he's seen. "Not only
are the fish dead," he says, "so are the aquatic insects. You turn over a
rock, everything is dead. Even the worms in the bottom of the stream are
dead."
Environment officials believe a heavy thunderstorm caused pesticide runoff
from nearby farm fields. Potatoes are the largest crop on PEI and one in
which pesticides are used.
Fish kills are not unusual on PEI or any other province where pesticides
are used in any heavy concentration. What is unusual is the number of them,
so close together - seven so far this summer. That problem may be
alleviated next year, when new provincial laws prevent farmers from working
land close to rivers. The province also plans to ask the federal government
for tighter controls on pesticides. It wants more research into making less
toxic chemicals, and finding organic alternatives.
