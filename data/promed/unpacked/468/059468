Single Case of Bovine Tuberculosis Discovered in Nebraska
-------------------------
The Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) Bureau of Animal Industry in
conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Veterinary Services is aggressively investigating a slaughter positive
bovine tuberculosis (TB) case that was recently discovered in Nebraska.
�The case was found in an older cow that was diagnosed by a USDA inspector
at the time of slaughter,� said Deputy State Veterinarian Del Wilmot.
�There is no danger to the public, as the carcass did not enter the human
food supply.�
NDA has begun an aggressive epidemiological investigation. NDA and USDA
veterinarians are currently in the process of testing 2 probable source
herds, which are under quarantine. Final test results will not be known for
several weeks.
Information on Bovine Tuberculosis can be found on the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) web site at:

[Currently, Nebraska is classified as "tuberculosis free" by the
USDA. According to the USAD regulations they are allowed 2 cases before
losing their disease free status. The epidemiologic investigation is only
beginning. The possibilities of finding another case are certainly present.
