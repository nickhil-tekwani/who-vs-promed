Infection with polio virus reported in Minnesota infant; Child has no
symptoms of paralytic disease; officials say general public is not at risk
-----------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is investigating a reported case
of infection with the virus that causes polio in an infant from central
Minnesota.
The infant, who had previously been diagnosed with immune system problems,
does not have symptoms of the paralytic illness that can sometimes result
from a polio infection. The infant is currently hospitalized. Further
information regarding the infant cannot be released due to state and
federal data practices laws.
Health Department officials emphasize that only people who have had direct
contact with the infant -- including un-immunized health care providers and
family members -- are at any risk of illness in connection with this case.
At this time, no additional cases of infection with the polio virus have
been reported in connection with the infant. The general public is at no
risk from this case.
This is the 1st case of polio infection reported in the U.S. since 2000,
when use of live-virus oral polio vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. All
polio vaccinations in the U.S. are now done with an injected, killed-virus
vaccine [Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) - Mod.MPP].
Before use of the live virus vaccine [oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), which
used a live attenuated poliovirus - Mod.MPP] was discontinued, it caused
about 8 cases of paralytic polio a year in the U.S., on average. The last
case of naturally occurring polio [naturally occurring here refers to
infection with the wild poliovirus and not a vaccine derived virus -
Mod.MPP] in the U.S. was reported in 1979. [The last outbreak associated
with wild poliovirus in the USA was among a religious group that does not
accept vaccinations due to religious beliefs. The "itinerary" of the wild
poliovirus involved in that outbreak probably began in Kuwait, as the virus
identified was genetically similar to a strain of poliovirus that was in
circulation in Kuwait in 1977. It then went to the Netherlands, where it
circulated among a religious group that shunned vaccinations (and still
shuns vaccines today), in which there were approximately 80 cases; it then
traveled to Canada and circulated among Canadian members of this same
religious group, resulting in 11 cases, and then traveled to a different
religious group in the USA and resulted in 15 cases. - Mod.MPP]
Naturally-occurring polio is considered to be eradicated in the western
hemisphere.
MDH officials say the virus strain found in the Minnesota infant appears to
be a variant of the strain used in the oral vaccine, which is still used in
some parts of the world.
"The Minnesota Department of Health is working with local and national
officials to ensure the safety of the general public and to investigate
this case," said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dianne Mandernach. "It is
important to note that there is no risk to the general public."
"However, the polio virus can cause a very serious form of illness, and it
was a major public health concern before the 1st polio vaccines were
introduced in the 1950s. We know many people still have vivid memories of
that era, so we wanted to reassure everyone that this event does not signal
a resurgence of polio."
"Only unvaccinated people who have had direct contact with the infant are
at risk, and we are following up directly with them to make sure their
immunizations are up to date," added Kris Ehresmann, who heads the
Immunization, Tuberculosis and Immigrant Health Section at MDH. "If you
don't hear from a public health or health care official, you're not at risk."
Officials say it is unknown at this time how the infant became infected,
but the virus is transmitted through direct contact with the stool or oral
secretions of an infected person. MDH officials are working with the
federal Centers for Disease Control to investigate the case.
Although members of the general public are not at risk, MDH officials say
this unusual case should serve as a reminder to make sure that all of your
immunizations are current and that children receive immunizations as
recommended.
"It's always a good idea to check with your physician or health care
provider to be certain all of your vaccinations are current," Ehresmann
said. "Make sure you're protected, and make sure your children are protected."
An estimated 93 percent of Minnesota's population has had the full primary
series of 3 polio shots, which are usually administered in infancy.

Infant found to have polio; risk to general public is nil, state health
officials say
-----------------------------------------------
Minnesota health officials said Saturday [1 Oct 2005] they are
investigating the 1st case of polio reported in the state since 2000 but
dismissed the potential for an outbreak of the crippling disease.
The case involves an infant from central Minnesota who already was
hospitalized with a weakened immune system when the infection was
discovered, the Minnesota Health Department said. The agency stressed that
there is no risk to the general public.
Only people who have not been vaccinated and who had direct contact with
the infant would be at risk, because the disease is transmitted through
stools or oral secretions, said Health Department spokesman Buddy Ferguson.
The vast majority of Minnesotans -- approximately 93 percent -- have been
vaccinated, most as infants.
"If you didn't have that kind of contact, you're not at risk," Ferguson
said. "We're talking about health care workers who might have cared for the
infant. We're talking about family members. We are going to be contacting
people in those groups individually."
In the vast majority of cases, polio has no symptoms, but it can cause sore
throats, vomiting, abdominal pain and flu-like symptoms, according to the
Centers for Disease Control. In less than 2 percent of cases, the virus
causes minor stiffness in the neck, back or legs, and in less than one
percent of cases, it attacks the central nervous system and results in
permanent paralysis, muscular atrophy and even death. The disease usually
affects young children.
Before the 1960s, the disease left hundreds of thousands of victims
paralyzed across the United States. Outbreaks created panic. Many people
became afraid of large public gatherings. In 1946, the Minnesota State Fair
was canceled, as state health officials were recording as many as 50 new
cases a day.
Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research
and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the most recent case has
been managed well by state officials. "This is not a public health
situation of any concern," he said.
Health officials would not name the child, give an age or even which town
or hospital the infant is in, citing state and federal privacy laws.
The infant apparently contracted polio from someone infected with a mutated
form of the polio strain used in oral vaccines, officials said. Even though
the child is infected with the virus, he did not show any signs of
paralysis, health officials said.
The United States stopped using polio vaccines that contain weakened
strains of the live virus in 2000. The live-virus vaccine still can cause
polio, and about 8 people in the U.S. developed the disease annually before
the country switched to using vaccine without the live virus. The last
reported polio case in the U.S. occurred the final year that the live
vaccine was in use.
Live-virus vaccine remains in use elsewhere in the world, in part because
it helps expand protection in areas where not everyone receives the
vaccine, Osterholm said. In essence, health officials rely on poor hygiene
and inadequate sanitation in these areas to expose more people to the
weakened form of the virus and thus give them protection.
At times, the weakened virus reverts to an infectious strain, which
apparently is what happened to the infant in Minnesota, Osterholm said.
Polio ceased to be a major threat in the United States decades ago and
largely has been eliminated in the Western Hemisphere since Dr. Jonas Salk
developed the 1st vaccine in 1955. Yet the disease remains a serious health
threat in the developing world and retains a terrifying reputation in the
United States. By one estimate, polio paralyzed 254 000 Americans, many of
them children. Vaccination gradually eliminated U.S. outbreaks. In 1960,
there were 2525 paralytic polio cases in the country, but by 1965, the
number had dropped to 61, according to the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
The last U.S. outbreak -- and naturally occurring cases -- occurred in
1979, when Amish in several Midwestern states contracted the disease from a
strain of the virus brought in from the Netherlands, according to the CDC.
The last reported case of polio in Minnesota was caused by a vaccine in 1992.
In parts of Africa and Asia, however, polio remains a threat. In Indonesia,
for instance, more than 230 children younger than 5 have been infected this
year [2005].

[More information on the epidemiology of the infection in the above
mentioned infant (including the exact age) would be appreciated. From the
information presently available, it appears as though the poliovirus
identified in this infant is genetically related to the viruses used in the
preparation of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). OPV has been associated
with rare cases of vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in
individuals who have directly received the vaccine and in those who have
had contact with recently vaccinated individuals. In addition, there have
been reports of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis associated with
circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) where there has been a
reversion to neurovirulence of the involved circulating vaccine derived virus.
With respect to the former situation (VAPPs), during the period 1980-1994,
of 133 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis reported in the USA, 125
(94 percent) were associated with administration of OPV (annual mean: 8
VAPP cases) (6 were imported cases and 2 were indeterminate without a
poliovirus isolation, and no history of direct or indirect contact with the
OPV). Of the 125 VAPP cases, 49 (39 percent) were among immunologically
normal recipients of OPV, 46 (37 percent) among immunologically normal
contacts of OPV recipients (including 6 cases among persons from whom
vaccine-like poliovirus was isolated but who had no history of direct
contact with vaccinees), and 30 (24 percent) among immunologically
compromised OPV recipients or contacts of OPV recipients.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045949.htm>
Since the USA changed vaccination policy to use IPV rather than OPV, there
have been no further cases of VAPP reported in the USA. (see ref. below).
(Please note that the above case is not VAPP, as the article mentions there
is infection with the poliovirus, but there is no paralytic disease).
Information that would be of interest is the age of the involved case, and
possible contacts with known recent OPV recipients, either through travel
of this case to countries where OPV is currently used or through known
contact with recent OPV recipients visiting from countries where OPV is
used. Other information on the investigation that is of interest is
environmental sampling of sewage in the geographical area where the case
originated to know whether there is evidence of cVDPV in the general area.
As the above articles clearly state, if one has been adequately vaccinated,
the risk of paralytic disease from contact with a cVDPV is very low, and
with a 93 percent vaccination coverage rate with IPV in Minnesota, unless
the virus "enters" a pocket of susceptibles, the risk of further cases
associated with this event is low. However, there are concerns about
chronic infection of an immune-compromised host with resultant
neurovirulence reversion of the virus and potential spread of VDPV in the
community. Nevertheless, we are all very interested to learn more about the
epidemiologic findings and the possible source of infection of this
immune-compromised child with a VDPV.
