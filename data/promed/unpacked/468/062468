World AIDS Day is December 1, and Montana is celebrating a few of its heroes in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases [STD]. 2 medical professionals received awards on the capital rotunda this week: Dr. Raymond Geyer of the Great Falls Clinic and Missoula's Win Lewis, PA-C, of Partnership Health.

According to Montana DPHHS [Department of Public Health & Human Services] HIV/STD Prevention Coordinator Judy Nielson, the HIV infection rate for Montana has been stable, but that isn't the case for 1 particular STD. "We get an average of approximately 20 to 24 new HIV infections identified per year, but the STD front is not quite as rosy," Nielson said. "Gonorrhea is troubling us with double the number of cases in each of the last 3 years... we are calling it an epidemic."

720 Montanans have been infected with gonorrhea this year [2015]. That is a startling increase considering that just 3 years ago, the infection rate was less than 200 people per year. One cause for concern in the past few years has been the rapid rate of gonorrhea increase in areas around Montana's reservations.

[Gonorrhea incidence rates in the United States as a whole decreased to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2009, the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. Between 2009 and 2012, the gonorrhea rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012. In 2013, the gonorrhea rate decreased slightly to 105.3 cases per 100 000 population, but increased to 110.7 in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/gonorrhea.htm).

For the U.S. as a whole, the increase in gonorrhea incidence rate during 2013-2014 was observed primarily among men, increasing 10.5 percent in men and decreasing 0.4 percent in women (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/gonorrhea.htm). During 2010-2014, the rate among men increased 27.9 percent, while the rate among women decreased 4.1 percent. The increase among men compared with a decrease among women suggests that transmission may be increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM), but other factors may also be at play, such as increased screening for _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites, or changes in reporting practices that resulted in increased case ascertainment in men. However, trends in gonorrhea rates among MSM over time cannot be assessed because most jurisdictions do not routinely report the sex of sex partners.

The northwestern U.S. state of Montana had an estimated population of 1 million people in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana#Native_American_population). The incidence of gonorrhea in Montana increased 4-fold in 3 years, from 10.7 in 2012, to 22.1 in 2013, to 42.8 per 100 000 population in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/tables/14.htm). Unlike the country as a whole, the incidence of gonorrhea in Montana in men and women both increased about 4-fold, from 9.9 in 2012 to 41.6 in men (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/tables/16.htm) and from 11.6 in 2012 to 43.7 in 2014 in women (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/tables/15.htm).

Montana has 7 Indian reservations and about 66 000 people of American Indian heritage, of which approximately 63 percent live off the reservations, concentrated in the larger Montana cities, with the largest concentration in the city of Great Falls. The gonorrhea rate among American Indians/Alaska Natives in 2010 was 105.7 cases per 100 000 population, which was 4.6 times the rate among whites. The disparity between gonorrhea rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives and whites was larger among women (5.0 times) than among men (3.9 times) (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/healthdisparities/AmericanIndians.html). In 2010, the disparity in gonorrhea rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives was higher in the West and Midwest than in the Northeast or South.
