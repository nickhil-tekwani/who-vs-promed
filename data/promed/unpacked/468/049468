Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 6 Jul 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [24 Jun and 3 Jul 2017], the national IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, and 2 deaths among previously reported cases.

Details of the cases
MERS-CoV cases reported between [24 Jun and 3 Jul 2017].

Globally, 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 712 related deaths have been reported to WHO.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has identified and is following contacts of the newly reported cases, is investigating the source of infection of each case and has reinforced infection, prevention, and control measures in hospitals where cases have been identified.

Update on previously reported Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) clusters in Riyadh
The follow-up period of contacts identified during the investigations of 3 MERS clusters previously reported from Riyadh in the Disease Outbreak News published on 13 Jun 2017 , 19 Jun 2017, and 28 Jun 2017 ended on 30 Jun 2017. No further cases were identified in these clusters.

[With the ending of the nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, MERS-CoV transmission seems to be slowing down to sporadic cases, classified as primary cases, some with history of contact with camels, others without well defined histories of known high risk exposures. The prior case in the Lebanese healthcare worker with no known contact with confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals in the healthcare setting, and no known contact with individuals with respiratory illnesses deserves further attention as he may well serve as a clue to all of the "primary" cases with previously unidentified high risk exposures. The question that constantly recurs to me (and I've mentioned before) is "Why Saudi Arabia?". Other countries in the region have had sporadic cases, yet Saudi Arabia reported cases account for 1672 out of 2040 cases (82 percent) reported to WHO as of 3 Jul 2017.

Of note, case no.1 was not reported through the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website as yet (and will most likely be reported when the outcome is known).
