Kazakhstan: Seven contract brucellosis, one anthrax
------------------------------------------------------
Seven people have contracted brucellosis in a settlement in Kzyl-Orda Region
of (southern) Kazakhstan and furthermore, a woman was found to have come
down with malignant anthrax in Zhambyl Region, Interfax-Kazakhstan learnt at
the Agency for Emergency Situations (AES) of Kazakhstan on Thursday (7 Oct
1999).
According to AES data, the brucellosis and anthrax were contracted after
meat of a diseased animal was consumed. AES officials said the anthrax case
was complicated by the fact that the diseased animal's meat and skin had
been sold at a local market.
So far, Regional public health station staff have traced 10 people involved
in the purchase of the meat who are now carrying anthrax bacilli. The buyers
of the meat have been admitted to hospital and are undergoing medical
examination.

[It would be interesting to know which _Brucella_ species was involved in
this outbreak as all behave slightly differently. It is unusual to have
brucellar exposure from consuming 'meat' but in no way impossible; the
organism is more usually found in lymphatic tissues and marrow. The
commonest human exposures are occupational (eg when slaughtering or from
delivering a calf or kid from an infected animal) or through consuming
infected milk. _B. abortus_ is rarely fatal while _B. melitensis_ infections
carry a significant risk of death (30%-40% in some areas). Cows can be
infected with _B. melitensis_, though exposure may be more common through
infected goat milk
being added to bovine milk. Being a Muslim country we can rule out _B. suis_
[from pigs.
There is nothing to stop a chronically infected brucellar cow from coming
down with anthrax. - MHJ
