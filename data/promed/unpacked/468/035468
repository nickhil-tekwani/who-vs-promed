In a paper appearing in the July Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, scientists report a new fungus that they believe is responsible
for the epidemic among frogs and toads of a wide variety of declining
species in rain forests in Australia, and Central and South America.
Dr. Joyce Longcore, University of Maine at Orono, and colleagues at the
U.S. National Zoo have grown a pure culture of the suspect fungus and are
conducting a final experiment to see if it is the prime factor in the
die-offs.
The researchers believe that the fungus, which grows in the skin of the
frogs, produces multiple layers of skin, thereby preventing absorption of
oxygen, kills by suffocation. However, they are also investigating the
probability that other factors, such as chemical contamination, may have
made the amphibians more susceptible. And they do not believe the fungus is
behind the deformities in Minnesota frogs.

"Now, for the first time, they've found a culprit -- a newly discovered
fungus they believe is causing the deaths in Panama.
PETER DOSCHEK, PARASITOLOGIST, KINGSTON UNIVERSITY, ENGLAND: It's a new
species, probably a new genus, and it's a completely strange specimen.
These fungi normally live on the bottom of ponds or lakes, where they act
as degraders of vegetable matter. And sometimes -- some species infect
insects and other groups as parasites. But this is the first time this
group of fungus has ever been found to be a parasite of vertebrates. So,
it's completely novel.
LOSURE (interviewer): Doschek says scientists have found the fungus not
only in dead frogs from Panama, but also from Australia, indicating the
same disease has arisen at the same time on two different continents. The
Australian findings, along with the research of Litz and other American
scientists, will be published jointly next month in the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences. Doschek, one of the paper's authors, says
it's not clear why what appears to be a frog epidemic has surfaced now.
DOSCHEK: The thing to remember is that these amphibians are in pristine
habitat. These are very remote, mountainous tropical rain forests where
there's very little human contact. So something's happened to cause this
organism, this pathogen, to become an epidemic disease.
LOSURE: Many researchers suspect frogs are succumbing now because they are
being physically stressed by worldwide environmental problems, like
pollution, global warming, or higher-than-normal levels of ultraviolet
light from the Earth's thinning ozone layer.
This summer, Litz and other researchers have returned to Panama. They'll be
studying the site where the dead frogs were first found, and also another
site where the disease has not yet hit and the streams are still full of
frogs. The researchers will be taking air and water samples and testing for
pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants that could be carried in
by the winds and rain. They'll study frog populations to see which species
are the most susceptible to the disease wave that appears to be sweeping
through the mountains of Panama.
