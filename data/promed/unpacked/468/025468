WHO BUDGET
===========
According to press reports this week, WHO had at the end of the year
(through 31 December 1995) received only 56.3% of member country
assessments meant to cover the (1995) general budget of about $400 million.
WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima noted in a speech that the
agency understood financial limitations on member states, "but
uncertainty in funding, when it becomes chronic, defeats any effort
at planning and management", and will likely result in a reduced
level of program delivery.
In contast to the current situation, over 80% of the 1994 member nation
assessments were paid by 31 December 1994.
Among the largest overdue balances are those of the U.S. ($104 million),
Russia ($27 million) and the other former Soviet states (lesser amounts).
The WHO Executive Board convened January 15 to discuss agency reforms,
budget issues, and control of communicable and emerging
infectious diseases; the session will end January 24.
