CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_]
serotype Newport infections linked to the consumption of raw alfalfa
sprouts. Investigators are using DNA analysis of bacteria obtained
through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may be
part of this outbreak.

As of 11:00 PM EDT on 2 Jun 2010, a total of 35 individuals infected
with a matching strain of _S._ Newport have been reported from 11
states since 1 Mar 2010. The number of ill people identified in each
state with this strain is as follows: AZ (2), CA (17), CO (1), ID
(5), IL (1), MO (1), NM (1), NV (2), OR (2), PA (1), and WI (2).
Among those for whom information is available about when symptoms
started, illnesses began between 1 Mar 2010, 2010 and 16 May 2010.
Case-patients range in age from less than 1 to 75 years old, and the
median age is 36 years. 66 percent of patients are female. Among the
30 patients with available hospitalization information, 7 (23
percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of many local, state, and federal
public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies have linked this
outbreak to eating raw alfalfa sprouts. Interviews of case-patients
found that most reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts before becoming
ill. Some case-patients reported eating sprouts at restaurants;
others purchased sprouts at grocery stores. The initial investigation
traced the implicated raw alfalfa sprouts to a single sprout
processor in California. Investigations are currently ongoing at the
sprout processor.

Recall information
------------------
On 21 May 2010, JH Caldwell and Sons Inc. of Maywood, California,
recalled several brands of alfalfa sprouts distributed to wholesale
distributors, restaurants, delicatessens, and grocery stores.
