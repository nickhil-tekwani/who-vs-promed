New EEE cases suspected in Concord, Manchester
----------------------
2 new suspected cases of Eastern equine encephalitis were announced
yesterday by the state Department of Health and Human Services, bringing to
4 the number of human cases of the potentially-deadly mosquito-borne virus
in New Hampshire.
2 men, one from Manchester and the other from Concord, were hospitalized
over the weekend, said John A. Stephen, DHHS commissioner.
He said that although the Manchester man was released late yesterday
afternoon, the DHHS still considers both cases �preliminary positive,�
pending lab results due Friday.
Stephen announced the 2 additional cases yesterday afternoon � a day after
laboratory tests confirmed that a Londonderry woman and a 4-year-old
Goffstown boy were infected with EEE, a rare brain-inflaming disease known
to be fatal in severe cases, killing about 1/3 of those afflicted,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
The 2 confirmed cases are the first human cases contracted in New Hampshire.
According to the CDC, there have been a total of 200 confirmed cases in the
U.S. since 1964, with an average of 4 confirmed cases each year nationally.
6 cases of Eastern equine encephalitis were reported nationwide in 2004 --
4 of them occurred in Massachusetts, with 3 of them resulting in death.
�Yes, it is unusual for our state to be looking at 4 possible cases in one
year,� Stephen said. �Obviously, we�ve been tracking cases for a number of
years. But it�s not unusual if you consider last year there were 4 cases
confirmed in Massachusetts.�
�If anything, I would say it�s unexpected, in terms of the New England
region,� Stephen said.
In light of trends in New Hampshire over the last few years involving West
Nile Virus and EEE, the DHHS has adopted a consistent mantra for the public
at large.
�Prevention, prevention prevention. We know in 100 percent of cases,
prevention works,� Stephen said. �We want to make sure the public gets that
message, and is aware that it�s a serious disease.�
Symptoms of the disease range from a mild flu to lethargy, mental confusion
and coma. The public should err on the side of caution when seeking
treatment for flu-like illness, officials said.
Using insect repellent containing DEET, wearing protective clothing and
eliminating standing water where mosquitoes can breed are the best way to
avoid infection, Stephen said.
EEE tends to occur in cycles, with transmission most often detected in
swampy, lower-populated areas along the Eastern Seaboard. States with the
most confirmed cases historically have been Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Florida and Georgia -- where one confirmed EEE death was reported in early
August [2005] by the Georgia health department.
However, with possible outbreaks in urban settings the health department is
recommending both Manchester and Concord pursue spraying to kill adult
mosquitoes.
In Manchester, the plan to spray mosquito-killing insecticide in city parks
may be delayed until mid-week, said Fred Rusczek, the city�s public health
director.
�We have everything in place to spray, but before we spray we have to give
48 hours� notification to the (state) Pesticide Control Board, which we
will do Monday,� Rusczek said.
Weather is another limiting factor.
Rusczek said rain is forecast for early in the week, which could put the
spraying off until Thursday or Friday. The chemical permethrin is dispersed
as a mist in the evening hours. It kills adult mosquitoes on contact, but
is ineffective in rainy or windy conditions.
Spraying will be done only in the city�s parks and playgrounds.
�Our goal is to kill the adult biting mosquitoes in areas where there are
large numbers of people congregating � the youth sport fields and some of
the heavier-use parks -- as a way of reducing the risk by reducing the
exposure to mosquitoes that potentially carry either EEE or West Nile
Virus,� Rusczek said.
3 weeks ago, Concord health officer Eugene Blake said the city had applied
for and was waiting to receive a spraying permit.
While EEE in humans is still considered rare, deputy state epidemiologist
Dr. Elizabeth Talbot said yesterday that, at this stage in the
investigation, all people who have outdoor exposure to mosquitoes in the
Manchester and Concord areas are at risk.
�You don�t need to live on a swamp,� Talbot said. �And at the same time,
we�re trying to balance the message by saying there�s no reason for panic.
We don�t expect it to become an outbreak of epidemic proportions.�
Health officials said based on previous activity, mosquitoes will likely
remain active through September -- which means the potential for more
confirmed human cases.
�We will not be surprised to see additional human cases in the next 4
weeks,� Talbot said. �This is an emerging infection in New Hampshire. Last
year we had bird, horse and mosquitoes with triple-E for the first time.
Humans and horses are incidental hosts.�
She said it�s important for the public to understand that EEE within the
horse population doesn�t increase the risk for human contraction of the
disease.
�Triple E in horses has heightened our awareness of the existence of
triple-E, but it in no way contributes to human infection,� Talbot said. �A
widespread equine vaccine campaign would not likely impact the incidence of
human disease.�

State health officials have detected a dead bird in the city that has been
confirmed to have been infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and
there is concern that the disease is spreading.
A press release from the Department of Health and Human Services indicates
that a deceased bird in Franklin and 2 others in Canterbury and Hooksett
have tested positively for the disease at the state public health laboratory.
"Obviously, we are concerned, because we are now seeing that this virus is
spreading over a larger geographic area," said Health and Human Service
Commissioner John Stephen.
According to the Health and Human Service website, eastern equine
encephalitis is a rare but serious viral disease -- that is also caused by
a virus transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito -- with more severe
symptoms than for West Nile virus.
EEE is an arbovirus -- short for arthropod-borne -- meaning it is spread by
insects. Birds are the source of infection for mosquitoes, which can
sometimes transmit the infection to horses, other animals, and, in rare
cases, to humans.
This year [2005], the state has seen 2 suspected cases of EEE in humans,
and the state anticipates confirmation of samples of these individuals by
today [27 Aug 2005].
Infection can cause a range of illnesses. Most people have no symptoms;
others get only a mild flu-like illness with fever, headache, and sore
throat. For people with infection of the central nervous system, a sudden
high fever (103 to 106 degrees), severe headache, and stiff neck can be
followed quickly by seizures and coma. About 1/3rd of these patients die
from the disease.
Officials remain steadfast that the best way to react to the spread of the
disease is prevention.
"Eastern equine [encephalitis] is preventable if people take common sense
prevention measures. I hope everyone takes appropriate actions, including
removing standing water, wearing long sleeves and pants in high mosquito
areas and using effective mosquito repellant," said Stephen.
The Department of Health and Human Services has listed prevention methods
for stopping mosquito-borne illnesses on its website at
<http://www.dhhs.nh.go>. Information can also be found on their toll-free
hotline for West Nile Virus available from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at
1-866-273-6453.
The department is currently testing mosquitoes from around the state for
both EEE and West Nile virus and is also working with medical providers and
local health officials so they can identify symptoms early.

[Birds are usually sentinels for this disease. Health departments have
sometimes used chickens to monitor for this disease. Emus are very
sensitive to the disease. If birds are being found with this disease, horse
owners are advised to vaccinate. In addition to vaccination, horse owners
should use a recommended equine spray to help control flies and mosquitoes
on the animals.
Vaccines for horses are usually in combination: West Nile virus, western
equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis. There are also combination vaccines that do not have the
Venezuelan portion. - Mod.TG]
[EEE virus is closely related to Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis
viruses belonging to the family _Togaviridae_, genus _Alphavirus_. The EEE
transmission cycle involves mainly birds and mosquitoes. EEE virus can be
transmitted to humans, an innocent host, by an infected mosquito. Although
EEE human cases are relatively rare (4 cases per year, mainly in the
eastern half of the US), if it occurs, it can result in neurological
illness and even death (a case fatality rate of 35 percent, which is
generally more severe than West Nile virus infection). EEE virus can infect
several mosquito species. Among them, _Culiseta melanura_ is the most
significant vector. A dead bird, a natural sentinel animal, has been
proven to have been infected with EEE virus. This means that EEE virus
infection is active in the region. - Mod.RY]
