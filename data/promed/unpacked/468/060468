The Municipal Health Service in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (GGD Amsterdam),
has reported an outbreak of legionellosis. Since 6 Jul 2006 there are 23
confirmed cases identified; of whom one has died. The age of cases varies
between 32 and 81 years. First day of symptoms ranges from 27 Jun to 9
Jul 2006, peaking on 1 Jul 2006. Most patients (19) are inhabitants of
Amsterdam city center, 4 are from elsewhere in the country but are employed
in Amsterdam city center. Several possible sources are identified, samples
are taken and possible sources are put out of action (e.g. cooling towers,
fountains).
We would like to be informed about legionellosis patients if they have
visited Amsterdam in their incubation period, from 8 Jun to 11 Jul
2006. Information on possible cases can be sent to <lci@rivm.nl>.
