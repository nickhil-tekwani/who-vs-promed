[The "clinically suspected" identification of Lumpy skin disease (LSD) in Lebanon is not surprising. In fact, it has been anticipated since July 2012, when the disease was detected in northern Israel (Golan) in cattle grazing on the Lebanese border. Since then the disease has spread further in Israel in south-western direction; see OIE's Israel LSD map of 24 Jul 2012 at http://tinyurl.com/b4m59q6 and the accumulated cluster as of 29 Dec 2012 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012810_20121231_112645.pdf (go to the bottom of the report).

Lebanon in particular is prone to penetration of exotic animal diseases, since it is highly dependent upon imports of live cattle for the local meat markets. According to the most recent available FAO statistics from Lebanon, a total of 287 705 live cattle have been imported during 2010 from 25 countries: 20 in Europe, 3 in South America, 1 in Oceania and 1 in Africa. The major exporters were France (70 316 head), Uruguay (42 167), Spain (39 004), Brazil (35 998) and Colombia (31 465). A considerable proportion of the imported live cattle were probably transported through the Suez canal. LSD has become endemic in Egypt since its initial penetration in 1988, leading to annual vaccinations covering the entire cattle population. During 2011, 2 272 393 animals were reportedly vaccinated; during Jan-Jun 2012 (most recent available information), 992 483 animals were vaccinated. During their passage through the Suez Canal, transported susceptible cattle may -- potentially -- be exposed to vectors of aboviruses. On top of the possible penetration of disease to Lebanon by animals in officially-permitted consignments, illegal movement of livestock in the Middle East is a long-known and rather common phenomenon.

In the past, consignments of cattle from Sudan and the Horn of Africa found their official and unofficial routes to Middle East countries. The current political unrest in the region adds to the plausibility of such illegal movements, with wider international implications. For example, smuggling of Syrian cattle to Lebanon and to Turkey (respectively) are described in media sources http://www.agrifeeds.org/node/75958 and http://tinyurl.com/c7rtzjp.

Though there should be no doubt about the circulation of LSDV in Lebanon (and most probably also in Syria), laboratory confirmation by a local or regional reference laboratory deserves to follow the reported clinical observations.
