On 14 Sep 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for Portugal notified WHO of a confirmed human case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The patient is a 71-year-old male from the town of Almancil (Loule municipality) - Algarve Region, Portugal with no recent history of travel. On 20 Jul [2015], he was hospitalized with neurological symptoms. Following a full recovery, on 4 Aug [2015] the patient was discharged from hospital.

Seroconversion (IgM and IgG) was confirmed in 2 separate samples on 7 and 19 Aug [2015]. Real-time PCR was negative in the 1st sample. Neutralization tests were positive for WNV on samples collected on 14 Sep [2015].

Even though the presence of WNV is known in Portugal, where 3 previous probable human cases were reported (2 in 2004 and 1 in 2010), this is the 1st laboratory-confirmed human case that fully meets the European Union case definition for WNV.

Public health response

Regional and local health authorities performed the necessary epidemiological, serological and clinical investigations. The Directorate-General for Food and Veterinary [services] at the local and regional levels performed the epidemiological, serological and clinical investigations in the animals of the area.

On 3 Sep [2015], Portuguese national authorities informed the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of 3 foci of WNV infection in equines in the municipalities of Faro and Loule - Algarve region.

The Portuguese National authorities also implemented the following preventive measures:
- issued a national-level press release for the general public and health professionals;
- took actions aimed at ensuring safety of blood, blood components and transplantations;
- delivered a blood alert notification;
- set up mosquito control actions.

Background

West Nile virus is a member of the flavivirus genus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family Flaviviridae. The virus is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. WNV is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can all be infected. Infection with the virus can cause neurological disease and death in people. Vaccines are available for use in horses but not yet available for people.

[This was reported on 3 Sep 2015 as a suspicious human case along with 3 equine outbreaks in the same general area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150904.3624767). The above report confirms the human case as a WNV infection.

Sporadic equine and human WNV infections occur in Europe, including Portugal. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), updated 3 Sep 2015, noted that 41 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the European Union. 36 cases have been reported in neighboring countries since the beginning of the 2015 transmission season. The last ProMED-mail reported and confirmed case in Portugal was in an equine animal in 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20101028.3910).
