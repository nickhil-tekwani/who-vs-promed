E. coli Fears Spur Beef Recall in Upper Midwest
-----------------------------------------------
The parent company of the Cub Foods grocery store chain expanded a ground
beef recall Saturday [2 Dec 2000 after 21 people were sickened by _E.
coli_ bacteria. Michael Wright, CEO of Eden Prairie-based Supervalu, said
ground beef contaminated with _E. coli_ had been traced to Green Bay, WI,
meatpacker American Foods Group Inc.
Cub Foods announced Friday that it was removing all fresh ground beef from
its Minnesota stores and 2 Wisconsin stores after investigators with the
Minnesota Department of Health linked its ground beef to 17 _E. coli_
infections.
Supervalu expanded the recall on Saturday to include other Supervalu stores
in Minnesota as well as Cub Foods stores in Chicago and Indianapolis after
health officials reported 4 new Minnesota cases, including a 2-year-old who
had developed a potentially fatal kidney infection [perhaps this represents
hemolytic-uremic syndrome rather than a "kidney infection" - Man. Ed. DS
from _E. coli_ poisoning [infection.
Other stores involved in the recall include County Markets, Kowalski's and
Jerry's, all of which get ground beef from Supervalu.

[The Minnesota Department of Health website

cases _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates have been identified, all with the same
genetic fingerprint (presumably by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
analysis). - Mod.ES
