More than 2000 people sickened by salmonellosis in Spain
-----------------------------------------------
More than 2000 people were infected in different areas of Spain after
eating precooked chicken contaminated with _Salmonella_, 41 of whom
are still in the hospital, the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de
Sanidad y Consumo) reported last Sat 6 Aug 2005.
The National Surveillance Services (Red Nacional de Vigilancia
Epidemiologica, RNVE) has registered 2055 cases, mostly presenting
mild gastroenteritis.
"As [of] today [7 Aug 2005], 41 people remain in the hospital, and
since last Tue 2 Aug 2005, [a] few more cases have been detected,"
the Ministry of Health has said.
National and regional authorities have advised the public not to eat
precooked chicken of the "Pimpollo" and "Pollo Asado SADA" brands, no
matter their production or expiration date.

[The numbers have increased substantially since last week (final week
July 2005). This may well have been a product of the epidemiological
investigation rather than newly occurring cases. The serotype of _S.
enterica_ remains to be disclosed. - Mod.LL]
