South Nassau Communities Hospital [Nassau County on Long Island] is sending out 4247 letters to patients recommending they be tested for hepatitis B and C and HIV because of the risk of infection from an insulin pen. In the letter dated 22 Feb 2014, the Oceanside hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen reservoir, not the pen's single-use disposable needle, which could have been used with more than one patient.

An insulin pen for those with diabetes is a pre-filled syringe meant to be used to dispense insulin in a single patient. Because of potential backflow of a patient's blood into the pen cartridge after injection, using a pen on multiple patients may expose them to blood-borne infections.

Hospital spokesman Damian Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen reservoir on more than one patient, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so. "Once that was said, we then followed through with a report to the state Department of Health," Becker said. The hospital said risk of infection is "extremely low."

"Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. While the testing is voluntary, it is recommended," the hospital said.

Becker said Tuesday [11 Mar 2014], the hospital, which is sending the letters out in phases, has received about 200 phone calls so far. The last letters should be received by 17 Mar 2014, Becker said. It will take patients about 2 weeks to receive test results, he said.

The hospital said it has since banned the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials.

The state Department of Health said that in 2013, 3 health facilities reported potential insulin pen re-use: 2 state-regulated facilities and the Veterans Administration's medical center in Buffalo.

In May 2008, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, NY notified 840 patients that nurses may have been using insulin pens on multiple patients. In 2009, following reports of improper use of insulin pens in hospitals, the FDA issued an alert reminding health care workers that insulin pens are meant for use on a single patient only. In 2012, CDC said that "in spite of this alert, there have been continuing reports of patients placed at risk through inappropriate reuse and sharing of insulin pens," and it put out a clinical reminder on their proper use.

In 2013, the VA issued an alert systemwide following the report of insulin pen misuse at its Buffalo hospital. Of 395 patients tested, 12 were found with hepatitis B and 6 with hepatitis C [although there was no direct evidence that the insulin pen exposure was the source of the infections. - Mod.LL]

[Despite multiple potential episodes and warnings from both the FDA and CDC, nosocomial episodes such as this one on Long Island seem to continue to occur. Hopefully, no blood-borne viruses will have been transmitted. - Mod.LL
