2000/046 Begomoviruses of solanaceous crops: Additions to the EPPO Alert List
The overall importance of diseases caused by geminiviridae transmitted by
_Bemisia tabaci_ to solanaceous crops is obvious as severe crop losses are
reported from many parts of the world, but it is still very difficult to
assess the relative importance of the various pathogens involved. In many
instances, the emergence of these diseases is associated with the evolution
of _B. tabaci_ populations, and in particular with the spread of the B
biotype (also referred to as _B. argentifolii_). Although the significance
of some begomoviruses is clearly visible, e.g. tomato mottle (EPPO A1
quarantine pest) and tomato yellow leaf curl (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), for
the majority of other begomovirus species the situation remains extremely
complex. Various reasons can be given: similarity of symptoms, partial
characterization of virus species (mainly on molecular characteristics),
relationships among many begomovirus species still unknown, apparently very
limited geographical distribution for some species, occurrence of mixed
infections, epidemiological situation still evolving (linked to _B. tabaci_
populations, cultivated or wild host plants). The EPPO Secretariat has
tried to gather some information on best characterized begomoviruses of
solanaceous crops, acknowledging that for many of them data is lacking, in
particular on economic importance. Many of these viruses were briefly
mentioned in the data sheet on tomato mottle begomovirus in the 2nd edition
of Quarantine Pests for Europe. They are here given individual treatment as
entries in the EPPO Alert List.
2000/046A - Chino del tomate begomovirus
Why: Chino del tomate begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of tomato and capsicum in the Americas.
Where: Symptoms of Chino del tomate have been observed in cultivated tomato
fields in Sinaloa, Mexico, since the 1970s (Brown & Nelson, 1988). The
virus was later found in other Mexican states: Chiapas, Morelos and
Tamaulipas. Recently, it was also found in glasshouse tomatoes in Sonora
(Idris et al., 1999). Its presence is also reported in Texas, USA
(internet). Chino del tomate begomovirus is sometimes found in mixed
infection with pepper huasteco and Texas pepper begomovirus.
Distribution: Mexico (Chiapas, Morelos, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamaulipas), USA
(Texas).
On which plants: Capsicum (_Capsicum annuum_) and tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_). The weed _Malva parviflora_ (Malvaceae) is also mentioned as
a natural host plant.
Damage: It was reported that in the west coast of Sinaloa, the disease
could affect 100% of the tomato plants in the field (Brown & Nelson, 1988).
Symptoms are characterized by curling, rolling of leaves, thickening of
veins, yellow mosaic, stunting, reduction of fruit set.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_. Not transmitted by seed or
by contact between plants.
Note: Tomato leaf crumple which was described in Sinaloa, Mexico, by
Paplomatas et al. (1994) is now considered as a strain of Chino del tomate
begomovirus (Torres-Pacheco et al., 1996).
Pathway: Infected tomato and capsicum plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where Chino del tomate begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. Disease significance appears to be rather high on
tomato crops, symptoms are sometimes reported to be severe (no data for
capsicum?). The vector is present in many parts of the EPPO region.
