Less than a week after Bareilly [Uttar Pradesh state, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)] reported the deadly foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), which killed more than a dozen heads of cattle, 26 bovines in Pinahat area of Agra [Uttar Pradesh] are suspected to have died of the disease.

The matter which was reported from Toda village near the Chambal river, 55 km from the city, has sent the district administration into a tizzy. "We have dispatched a team of doctors to the village and will take further action after they submit the prima facie report regarding the cause of cattle death," said chief veterinary officer Ajay Sinha, talking to TOI.

Farmers who lost their cattle in a span of 2 days claimed that their animals had died due to FMDV infection. "My cattle wouldn't had died if the veterinary doctor of the administration had given vaccine to them. Before they died, all the cattle were showing similar symptoms -- mouth swelling, excessive [salivation], sore mouth, and others. In the village a total 26 cattle have died in the last 2 days," said [a local resident], who lost 6 buffalos. "This year [2016] our village lost cattle worth nearly Rs [1 300 000; USD 19 200] in total, but no one is here to pay heed to our problems," added the farmer, who has lost Rs 480 000 [USD 7090] worth of buffalos. [Some] other farmers also reported their cattle had displayed similar symptoms before dying.

It is important to mention that last year [2015] as well, a farmer lost a dozen cattle in the same village. "We have collected the samples of dead cattle and will send them to IVRI at Bareilly for further probe," a veterinary doctor said. "For the next 2-3 days we are going to stay in the village and observe the remaining cattle. Meanwhile, we have vaccinated the cattle as a preventive measure," he added.

[The Indian Veterinary Research Institute or IVRI, established in 1889, is located in Izatnagar, Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh state. It is India's premier advanced research facility in the field of veterinary medicine and allied branches (official website at http://www.ivri.nic.in/).

The mentioned mortality figures will gain meaning if the ages and breeds of the victims, as well as the denominators (size of the susceptible population and its age distribution) are given. FMD may cause high mortality in juvenile animals; mortality in adult animals rarely exceeds 5 percent. Most economical losses are caused by the severely affected productivity and reproduction, extended rehabilitation of infected animals, and the impact of quarantine and other zoo-sanitary measures, including restrictions on animal movements and trade in animal products, exports. - Mod.AS

[2] India (Uttar Pradesh): IVRI, Bareilly, vaccine-related infection suspected

The chief veterinary officer (CVO) has now written to the district magistrate asking him to stop the IVRI team from visiting dairies in the city and surrounding villages as he fears the team will spread the dreaded FMD virus (FMDV) in Bareilly district. CVO Dr SK Verma said, "Scientists at IVRI regularly vaccinate cattle at the dairy situated in their campus. Even after IVRI vaccinated the bovines, the dreaded FMDV was found there, which means the virus is potent. If IVRI continues to visit dairies in the city and surrounding villages, they will end up spreading the virus in other parts of the district." He added that he has written to district magistrate Gaurav Dayal and requested him to ask the IVRI team to not move outside the campus as IVRI is infected with FMDV. "I had called an emergency meeting of veterinary doctors and directed them to give me daily status reports of FMDV in the district. We have not yet found any animal who has symptoms of the virus. After we came to know that IVRI has claimed that cattle in 2 dairies located in Sadar locality have shown symptoms of FMDV, I sent our team to verify it. However, we found that no cattle showed symptoms of the virus while one cow has taken ill due to a leg fracture," said Verma. He added that they ran the vaccination exercise in October last year [2015] and will restart it from 15 Feb 2016. According to IVRI, at least 4 animals each in 5 dairies showed symptoms of FMDV when its team collected samples.

Joint director of Centre for Animal Disease, Research, and Diagnosis (CADRAD) at IVRI, Dr VK Gupta said, "The work of collecting samples from dairies in the city and surrounding villages was finished on [Thu 14 Jan 2016]. We will send samples to our branch based in Mukhteshwar for confirmation on whether the bovines are suffering from FMDV or not. We will also attach a letter along with the samples to provide a report soon." In IVRI, 9 calves have died and a few others have been infected with FMDV. "The situation is all under control at IVRI now," said Gupta. In 2009, FMDV had affected a large number of cattle at IVRI, killing many.

FMDV is a severe and contagious viral disease infecting livestock. It is fatal to young animals. Infected livestock develop high fever and blisters in their mouth and hooves. Due to the blisters, the animals stop eating thus affecting their milk production.

Hoof disease in cattle has taken an epidemic turn in different areas of Badarganj Upazila [sub district] of the district recently, much to the worry of the cattle owners and farmers. More than 100 cattle died owing to infectious hoof-disease, locally known as Khura Rog [foot and mouth disease] in the upazila during last 17 days, while the authority concerned seems to be indifferent to the matter, it is alleged.

Sources said the disease first attacked a few cows under the upazila. But subsequently it spread into many areas and took a serious turn.

A number of cattle owners complained though they informed the livestock officials of the matter but they are yet to take any measure in this regard. Due to lack of preventive and curative measures the sick cattle are awaiting their deaths, they alleged [see commentary to item 1 above].

High temperature, drooling of saliva, blister in tongue, and unable to take solid food are main symptoms of the disease, cattle owners alleged. [A farmer] from Shahpur village said 2 of his cows worth over Tk 0.2 million [USD 2544] died of the disease last week.

There are several additional media reports addressing FMD outbreaks in various parts of the Indian subcontinent (for example, http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cattle-hit-by-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-faridkot-villages/179065.html).

The FMD situation in India, including quality of the vaccines, their matching of circulating strains, and vaccination coverage are of particular interest -- locally and beyond. During the recent 3 years, 2 FMD strains from the Indian subcontinent (India, Bhutan, Bangladesh) have spread into the Middle East and Northern Africa (the Maghreb), causing serious losses and threatening Europe. These are FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d (Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco) and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran). Their respective genotyping results, including their relationship to FMDV strains from the Indian subcontinent, are available on the website of the World reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) as follows:

1. FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d:

2. FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII:

Information on the strains currently circulating in India and Bangladesh, and on the vaccines applied -- particularly their matching rates with the circulating strains -- has been requested and is repeated. - Mod.AS]
