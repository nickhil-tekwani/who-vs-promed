re: Undiagnosed deaths - India (Uttar Pradesh) (02): Jap. enceph.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
My colleague in the SOS Delhi office, Dr George Fernandes, has confirmed
the following information:
Further to the previous update regarding Sitapur, we have 20 confirmed
deaths that occurred between June 2004 and the last reported case on 17 Sep
2004. The most affected area was Garghappa Village, which comes under the
purview of the Primary Health Care center of Rampur. All cases were
patients below the age of 15 years, belonging to the lower socioeconomic
group. The symptoms were vomiting, high fever, and diarrhea. The doctors
from the nearby towns diagnosed 7 cases of falciparium malaria, 5 cases of
vivax malaria, and the rest were undiagnosed.
The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) has not visited this
area. As per the NICD, it is very difficult to rule out Japanese
encephalitis (JE) as the cause of illness, as there are a lack of
diagnostic facilities for JE. No further investigations are being carried
out by the NICD. This information was provided by Dr Shaukat Kamal,
assistant director, NICD, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Irene Lai for initiating an
investigation of this ongoing outbreak of "undiagnosed deaths" in Uttar
Pradesh. Of note, the symptom complex originally described in the newswires
in our 1st posting (see reference below) were: fever, "shivering", followed
by dysentery and vomiting. Uttar Pradesh is a low endemic area for malaria,
which means that there will be little immunity in the local population.
Detection of malaria parasites is the only positive finding reported so
far, but Japanese encephalitis and typhoid fever remain possible
alternative diagnoses. - Mods.MPP/EP]
