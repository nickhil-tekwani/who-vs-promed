Six under-5 year old children have died following an outbreak of measles and whooping cough in Suletankarkar Local Government Area of Jigawa state [Nigeria], Daily Trust learned yesterday, 13 Mar 2016. It was gathered that Maizare village where the 6 deaths occurred was the worst hit among the 6 villages affected by the outbreak of the 2 child killer diseases. Speaking to Daily Trust on phone, the Suletankarkar LGA Head of Department for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Mohammed Maisamari, confirmed the outbreak of the 2 diseases.

He said, "Maizare is the only village amongst the villages that recorded the death of 6 children. So far 249 under-5 children have been treated as a result of contracting measles or whooping cough (pertussis) in 6 of the affected villages. In Maizare, 139 children have been treated, in Lula 24, in Dadin Duniya 26, Mallam Kadir 10, in Suletankarkar and Fulanin Danladi 25 children have been treated in each of the villages."

Among other measures taken against the outbreak, which he said had since been brought under control, was to further educate the rural dwellers on the need for routine immunizations.

[It is likely that much of the illnesses and deaths are related to measles, rather than pertussis, but this is not entirely clear.

The outbreak has been confirmed from EpiCore members communicating outside of the platform. Exact wording: "Outbreak confirmed, and still ongoing. Measles outbreak also in Yobe, Jakuska LGA, over 100 cases." - Mod.LL
