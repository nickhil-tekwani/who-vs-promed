The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC] announced today [Mon 1 Jun 2020] that a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is occurring in Wangata health zone, Mbandaka, in Equateur province. The announcement comes as a long, difficult and complex Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC is in its final phase, while the country also battles COVID-19 and the world's largest measles outbreak.

Initial information from the Ministry of Health is that 6 Ebola cases have so far been detected in Wangata, of which 4 have died and 2 are alive and under care. A total of 3 of these 6 cases have been confirmed with laboratory testing. It is likely more people will be identified with the disease as surveillance activities increase.

"This is a reminder that COVID-19 is not the only health threat people face," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Although much of our attention is on the pandemic, WHO is continuing to monitor and respond to many other health emergencies."

This is the DRC's 11th outbreak of Ebola since the virus was 1st discovered in the country in 1976. The city of Mbandaka and its surrounding area were the site of DRC's 9th Ebola outbreak, which took place from May to July 2018.

"It's happening at a challenging time, but WHO has worked over the last 2 years with health authorities, Africa CDC and other partners to strengthen national capacity to respond to outbreaks," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. "To reinforce local leadership, WHO plans to send a team to support scaling up the response. Given the proximity of this new outbreak to busy transport routes and vulnerable neighbouring countries we must act quickly."

WHO is already on the ground in Mbandaka supporting the response to this outbreak, as part of capacity built during the 2018 outbreak. The team supported the collection and testing of samples, and reference to the national laboratory for confirmation. Contact tracing is underway. Work is ongoing to send additional supplies from North Kivu and from Kinshasa to support the government-led response. A further 25 people are expected to arrive in Mbandaka tomorrow [Tue 2 Jun 2020]. WHO is also working to ensure that essential health services are provided to communities despite these emergency events.

The DRC's 10th outbreak of Ebola, in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces, is in its final stages. On [14 May 2020], the Ministry of Health began the 42-day countdown to the declaration of the end of that outbreak.

New outbreaks of Ebola are expected in the DRC given the existence of the virus in an animal reservoir in many parts of the country.

[This new outbreak comes at a difficult time with ongoing COVID cases being detected, and a very high incidence of measles in the DRC. The countdown to declare the DRC Ebola -free was restarted on 14 May 2020, and now will have to restart. With the help of contact tracing and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, one hopes the country will be able to stop the spread of the virus quickly.

So far, there are no details about the origin of the latest outbreak. The event in 2018 began in 2 remote, heavily forested regions at the same time and featured health worker infections, a factor known to fuel the spread of the virus.
