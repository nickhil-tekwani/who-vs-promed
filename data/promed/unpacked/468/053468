During the past decade, 2016 saw the most _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases in Florida topping out at 46. That record didn't last long as state health officials have reported 48 cases in 2017 to date. Counties reporting the most cases include Collier with 5, Hillsborough and Lee counties with 4 each and Brevard, Citrus, Escambia, Pinellas and Sumter counties with 3 each. In addition, 11 fatalities have been reported this year.

Below is a breakdown of cases in Florida since 2008:

Year / Cases / Deaths
2008 / 16 / 6
2009 / 24 / 7
2010 / 32 / 10
2011 / 35 / 13
2012 / 26 / 9
2013 / 41 / 12
2014 / 32 / 7
2015 / 4 14
2016 / 46 / 10

_Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacterium. Ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. _V. vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers.

Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, Vibrio vulnificus infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease.

The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. Bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
