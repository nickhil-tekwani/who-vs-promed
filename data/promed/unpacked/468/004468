A Manhattan neighborhood is now the site of a legionnaires' disease cluster. The New York City Health Department is investigating cases in an area of central Harlem, where 9 people have already ended up in the hospital since [1 Aug 2021] in the ZIP codes of 10037 (which stretches along Lenox Avenue from W 130th Street to W 145th Street, and west [?east] to the [Harlem] river) and 10039 (which stretches west from Jackie Robinson Park from W 145th Street to W 155th Street to the [Harlem] river, as well as the public housing complexes right above).

All of 9 of those who have come down with the condition have been hospitalized, and 7 of them are over 50 years old -- the most vulnerable age group. As of Wednesday [18 Aug 2021], there had been no deaths associated with the cluster.

Legionnaires is not contagious, but it does spread around communities because people get sick by breathing in water vapor [contaminated] with _Legionella_ bacteria. Health officials are inspecting water towers in the area to find the source of the cluster. It can be treated with antibiotics when caught early on.

Those who live in the neighborhoods impacted are told to look out for symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, and cough. Because those symptoms are similar to those of COVID, and due to the ongoing spread of the virus, the Health Department recommends that those seeking care should be tested for COVID and evaluated for legionnaires' disease.

The news of another health scare was alarming to residents, who seemed both concerned and fed up with having another thing to worry about.

[The news report above describes a cluster of 9 cases of legionnaires' disease since 1 Aug 2021 in the New York City borough of Manhattan, zip codes 10037 and 10039. A map of Manhattan showing the location of these zip codes can be found at https://www.zipdatamaps.com/10037 and https://www.zipdatamaps.com/10039.

At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or a common-source outbreak. The investigation into finding a common source for these 9 people is proceeding, but genotyping the clinical isolates would help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation.

Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria; but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of _Legionella_ bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).
