The number of people sickened with _E. coli_ after eating at a southeast Edmonton restaurant has climbed to 19, including 2 who have developed symptoms serious enough to be admitted to hospital, Alberta Health Services [AHS] said on [Thu 5 Apr 2018]. That is a jump of 13 cases from a week ago, when the health authority announced the discovery of the 1st cluster of infections among people who ate at Mama Nita's Binalot restaurant. It is believed at least some of those new cases are among restaurant staff.

Patrons were infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7, which can produce diarrhea that may be bloody. While most infections clear up on their own in 10 days or so, in a small proportion of cases the bacterium can cause severe complications such as kidney failure. Public health officials are warning anyone who has dined at Mama Nita's since [15 Mar 2018] to see a doctor if they have symptoms, and mention they may have been exposed to _E. coli_.

The sick patrons all ate at the restaurant within the same general time frame, but were not part of the same group and did not have the same meals, AHS has said. The health authority has been working with Mama Nita's for more than a week, but has yet to pinpoint the source of the infection.

_E. coli_ infections are typically caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with human or animal feces, or by direct contact with infected people or animals. Symptoms can occur up to 10 days after eating contaminated food. Improperly cooked beef and pork are common culprits for such infections, although fresh produce can also sometimes carry the bug. In addition to testing food stocks at the restaurant, Mama Nita's staff have been asked to submit stool samples to determine if a worker has been carrying the bacterium.

[It is not necessarily the case that a restaurant food worker is the source as they eat the same food as the guests. ProMED awaits more information regarding new cases and a possible specific food reservoir. - Mod.LL
