[Genotyping the strains isolated from the now 18 patients will help establish if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

Washington Heights is a mainly residential neighborhood in the northern portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan, in the US state of New York; Washington Heights extends from West 115th Street to the south and the neighborhood of Inwood to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan).
