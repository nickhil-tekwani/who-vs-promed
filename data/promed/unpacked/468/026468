7 children have died of measles in the city as of 8 Aug 2014, and there has been a spike in confirmed cases of the disease, a health official said on Thursday [28 Aug 2014].

Armi Capili, head for immunization of the City Health Office attributed the rise in measles cases to the failure of many mothers to have their children immunised. She said in Thursday's [28 Aug 2014] iSpeak media forum at City Hall that the office has so far received 1228 reports of suspected measles cases as of Wednesday [27 Aug 2014], but only 120 have been confirmed.

According to Department of Health regional unit head for health education and promotion Divene Hilario, the total regional prevalence of the disease in 2013 was only 129. In 2012, there were only 4 confirmed cases in Davao City, which Capili attributed to an intensified immunization campaign in 2011. In 2013, the number rose to 50.

Hilario said in a phone call Thursday [28 Aug 2014] that there seemed to be a miscommunication with mothers regarding immunization against measles. "The problem is that some parents do not take their children back to the health centers after the prescribed 9 months for a 2nd shot," she said. The CHO appealed to parents to take their children below 5 years old for free vaccination the whole month of September 2014 amid reports of a disturbing spike in cases of measles in the city. Capili said the department will be spearheading a massive immunization program for measles, rubella, and polio from 1-30 Sep 2014 at health centers and other vaccination points even if they have been immunized in the past.

As of 8 Aug 2014, the CHO said most reports of suspected measles cases came from Talomo North (201), Talomo South (133) and Buhangin (116). Capili said immunization coverage was highest in Barangays A, C, D, as well as Buhangin, Agdao, Bunawan, Baguio, Calinan and Tugbok. She said immunization coverage for the city is at 54 percent so far. In 2013, the figure was 75 percent, and in 2012, 91 percent.

But the City Investment Plan for Health said the ideal immunization coverage for all diseases including measles should be at least 95 percent. Culas said the World Health Organization considers one case to be an epidemic already.

2 possible new cases of measles have been detected in the Mackay Region. A measles alert was issued on Friday [22 Aug 2014] after it was found that a guest at a pre-wedding party and wedding in the Whitsundays was infectious. The man attended other public places while infectious, and Public Health is still working to contact others who may have been exposed.

Public Health physician Dr Steven Donohue said one of the possible new cases also attended the wedding. Laboratory tests for this person are being done, but results are not expected before tomorrow [26 Aug 2014]. The other suspected case is yet to be tested but also had contact with the 1st infected person. Dr Donohue said public staff had now contacted more than 100 people to advise them that they have been exposed to measles.

"A significant amount of MMR vaccine was flown into Mackay on Friday [22 Aug 2014] night and distributed to after-hours medical clinics as well as the Proserpine Hospital," he said. Anyone who has symptoms of measles should telephone their GP immediately and advise them about their concern.

A measles alert has been issued for people visiting the following areas:
- Fri 15 Aug 2014: Montes Reef Resort Hydeaway Bay, all day;
- Fri 15 Aug and Sat 16 Aug 2014: Cape Gloucester Beach Resort Hydeaway Bay all day; attended a wedding;
- Sun 17 Aug 2014: La Tabella Trattoria, Airlie Beach around 11:00 am.

[The Whitsundays Islands are a collection of continental islands of various sizes off the central coast of Queensland, Australia visited by large numbers of tourists.

The decline in reports of measles virus infections during the past 7 days probably reflects the media's concern with ebolavirus events in West Africa rather than a real decline in the number and spread of measles outbreaks. - Mod.CP
