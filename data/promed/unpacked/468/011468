Viet Nam: another human case of avian influenza confirmed
---------------------------------------------------------
Tests indicated that an 18 year old woman is infected with the A(H5N1)
strain of avian influenza, and if further tests confirm the finding today,
she will become the country's 4th human case of bird flu detected since
mid-December 2004, said Dr Klaus Stohr, the World Health Organization's top
influenza expert. The 3 other cases have been fatal, including that of a 16
year old girl who died on Sun 9 Jan 2005 after having been critically ill
for 3 weeks. Further human cases suspected to have bird flu are under
investigation.

Viet Nam: death of suspected avian influenza victim
---------------------------------------------------
Vietnam is testing samples from 2 more suspected bird flu cases, one of
whom has died, as the country grapples to control [the virus] that has
killed dozens [at least 24 - Mod.CP] and ravaged the region's poultry industry.
An 18 year old woman from Hau Giang province in the Mekong Delta died on
Mon 10 Jan 2005, said hospital official Le Van Dieu in southern Can Tho
city. The woman displayed high fever and coughing, symptoms similar to
those caused by bird flu. If confirmed, this would take the death toll to
24 since outbreaks of the H5N1 strain were 1st reported in December 2003 in
the Mekong delta, and would become the 4th person to die from the illness
in less than 2 weeks. A 16 year old girl who battled bird flu for more than
2 weeks died on Sat 8 Jan 2004.
State media stated that the latest victim had eaten meat from sick chickens
in December 2004, after which she became ill. "We are having her samples
tested," Dieu told Reuters, referring to the woman hospitalised in Can Tho
city. Officials at Ho Chi Minh City's Pasteur Institute, which was
conducting the tests on the woman's samples, could not be reached for
comment. The 3 deaths since December 30 were from southern Vietnam. The
H5N1 virus also killed 12 people in Thailand during 2004, but no new cases
have been reported there since November 2004.
The Nguoi Lao Dong (Labourer) newspaper said doctors in Ho Chi Minh City
were testing samples from a 2nd person, a 15 year old girl, whose elder
sister was confirmed by health officials on Monday to have been infected by
the H5N1 virus.
WHO has warned Vietnam it may face new bird flu cases this month as poultry
is moved around the country ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year
celebrations. Market inspectors have tightened quarantine checks on poultry
at the city and all markets in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest
population centre with nearly 10 million people, and the capital Hanoi to
the north. In the past 6 weeks, more than 108 000 poultry had been either
slaughtered or had died of bird flu in Viet Nam, mostly in the south, the
Agriculture Ministry said. During 2004, the epidemic wiped out 17 per cent
of Vietnam's poultry stock of 250 million.

Viet Nam: total of suspected human cases of avian influenza reaches 14
----------------------------------------------------------------------
14 people in 7 of Viet Nam's southern provinces have been hospitalized
since Mon 10 Jan 2005 [as suspected cases of avian influenza] a local
health official told Xinhua.
Of the cases, 4 have been confirmed to have contracted avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection. One bird flu patient from the southern Tien Giang
province is in a serious health condition, and 3 others from the southern
provinces of Tay Ninh, Tra Vinh and Dong Thap died, said an official of the
Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City on Tue 11 Jan 2005.
"Hospitals treating the suspected cases are actively conducting tests to
determine whether they have contracted H5N1 virus infection," the official
said, asking for anonymity.
The spread of the virus is favoured by cooler temperatures and an increase
in the movement of [commercial] fowl ahead of the Lunar New Year, which
falls in February 2005. To deal with the situation, Vietnam is taking
urgent anti-avian influenza measures, such as tightening management over
transport and trading of poultry, conducting closer surveillance on the
current situation of fowl flocks nationwide, and intensifying propaganda on
the disease via mass media.
According to the Department of Animal Health, since December 2004 the
relapse of avian influenza has been seen in 13 [provinces] across the
country, killing or leading to the forced culling of nearly 100 000 fowl.
In late March 2004, Viet Nam declared an end to [the outbreak of] avian
influenza that killed 17 per cent of its poultry population and claimed at
least 21 human lives since the previous outbreak starting in December 2003.
A total of 43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled, causing
a total loss of 1.3 trillion Vietnamese dong (USD 82.8 million) to the
local poultry industry.

[As of Fri 7 Jan 2005, WHO listed the cumulative number of confirmed human
cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam since 28 Jan
2004 as 30, 22 of whom have died
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_01_07/en/>.
The above 3 reports -- making allowance for double counting -- raise the
death toll in Viet Nam to 24. The 4 fatal human avian influenza cases who
have died since 30 Dec 2004 are a 6 year old boy (died 30 Dec 2004), a 9
year old boy (died 4 Jan 2005), a 16 year old girl (died 8 Jan 2005), and
an 18 year old woman (died 10 Jan 2005). The 15 year old sister of the
latter is an additional suspected case. In addition the Vietnamese
authorities are investigating 9 or 10 further suspected cases located in 6
or 7 of the southern provinces of Viet Nam (the precise number is difficult
to determine because the cases and the provinces have not been identified).
