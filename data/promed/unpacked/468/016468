Beef Recall Includes Arizona: Beef Linked to E. coli Outbreak
-------------------------------------
A Minnesota beef company is voluntarily recalling approximately 117 500
pounds of beef trim products used to make ground beef, due to possible
contamination with Escherichia coli [E. coli] O157:H7, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's [USDA] Food Safety and Inspection Service announced. The
recall includes Arizona. The recall comes after an E. coli outbreak that
has sickened 7 residents in Minnesota, who purchased and ate ground beef
from local stores there.
While those stores have already removed any potentially contaminated beef
from their shelves, today's [12 May 2007] move greatly expands the scope
of the recall. The trim was produced on 27 Mar 2007, and shipped to
distributors and retail outlets in Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.
Because these products later became ground beef sold under many different
retail brand names, consumers have been advised to check with their local
retailer to determine whether they may have purchased any of the products
subject to recall. The USDA didn't provide further identification of where
precisely the questionable beef might have gone, and warned, "Because
these products later became ground beef sold under many different retail
brand names, consumers should check with their local retailer to determine
whether they may have purchased any of the products subject to recall."
E. coli 0157:H7 is a potentially deadly strain of bacterium. Symptoms of
E. coli include stomach cramps that may be severe and diarrhea that may
turn bloody within one to 3 days. E. coli can sometimes lead to
complications including kidney failure. The USDA urges all consumers to
thoroughly cook their beef, because high temperatures kill the bacteria.

[Ground beef is a frequent source of E. coli O157 and in this case has
caused illness in at least 7 people, probably many more. While the beef is
being recalled, it appears that it has already widely entered the food
chain and it would be nearly impossible for a consumer to identify
potentially contaminated ground beef.
As noted earlier by ProMED (Archive number 20070424.1334): Hints to
prevent this illness related to ground beef can be found at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm#What%20can%20be%20done%20to%20prevent%20the%20infection>,
and include:
1. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are
killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough
cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into
several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least
160 deg F (71 deg C). Persons who cook ground beef without using a
thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef
patties that are still pink in the middle.
2. If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product
in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for
a new bun and a clean plate, too.
3. Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat
separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with
hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers
or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat
thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking. -
