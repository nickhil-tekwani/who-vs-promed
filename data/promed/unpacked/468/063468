A flesh-eating disease that causes painless open wounds across parts of the body is spreading rapidly across Victoria. At least 266 cases of Buruli ulcer (also known as Bairnsdale ulcer) have been reported across the state this year [2022], with an increase in cases linked to several suburbs in greater Geelong.

The skin infection, which is most common in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia, often begins with swelling or a painless nodule usually on the arms or legs and eventually develops into an open ulcer. The disease has been found in parts of metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, including Brunswick West, Essendon, Frankston, Phillip Island and the Mornington peninsula region.

Last year [2021], there were 227 reported cases and the year prior [2020] there were 165. Health authorities say the disease is spreading geographically across Victoria and is no longer restricted to specific coastal locations.

People aged 60 and up are most at risk; however, the disease can occur at any age. It is not transmissible from person to person.

[The news report says that Buruli ulcer has been spreading in the suburbs of the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia and the 2 peninsulas on either side of Melbourne. The Bellarine Peninsula, on the west, and Mornington Peninsula, on the east, surround Port Phillip Bay, on which Melbourne is located. A narrow inlet into Port Phillip Bay, called the Rip, 3.5 km (2.1 mi) wide, separates the outmost tips of the 2 peninsulas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rip). The Mornington Peninsula is primarily a local tourist region, with small towns on its western shorelines that are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula).

Most of the Bellarine Peninsula is a part of the city of Greater Geelong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula). Melbourne, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne). A map of local governmental areas in and around Melbourne can be found at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Australia_Victoria_Melbourne_Metro_Area_LGA_names.svg.

Brunswick West is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, 6 km (3.7 mi) north of Melbourne's Central Business district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_West,_Victoria). Essendon is a suburb in Melbourne, 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of Melbourne's Central Business District (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon,_Victoria). Frankston is a suburb of Melbourne, 41 km (25 mi) southeast of Melbourne's Central Business District, just north of the Mornington Peninsula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston,_Victoria). Phillip Island is 125 km (78 mi) south-southeast of Melbourne, located just east of the Mornington Peninsula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island).

Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries, usually with tropical and subtropical climates (Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas have a temperate climate). Pictures of Buruli ulcers and a map of Australia that indicates hot spots where the incidence of Buruli ulcer has been reported to be increasing can be found at https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1643576/zombie-flesh-eating-bug-is-spreading-across-australia-as-insect-bites-lead-to-volcanic-wounds-and-amputations/.
