African swine fever (ASF) is advancing further west in Germany. On 13 Oct 2021, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut [FLI] confirmed a case in a hunted wild boar in Saxony (district of Meissen). The wild boar was killed on the weekend [9-10 Oct 2021] east of the A13, not far from the Radeburg junction, 10 km [6.2 mi] north of Dresden. The epidemic is located more than 100 km [62 mi] west of the German-Polish border. It is only 100 km to Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt.

This is the 1st time that Saxony has had an ASF case in wild boars outside the Görlitz district. So far, ASF has been identified in over 500 wild boars there. From the current case near Radeburg to the exclusion zone in the Görlitz district (endangered area), it is almost 55 kilometers [34 mi] (for maps, please refer to the commentary below).

In Saxony, the ASF crisis team is now meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs. Among other things, a decision will be made on the delimitation of the restriction zones to be set up. Details are not yet available. Saxony extended the obligation to examine all shot healthy wild boars since the end of September [2021]. Earlier, such measure was restricted to the districts of Görlitz and Bautzen. At present, this measure is obligatory also in the districts of Meissen, Saxon Switzerland-Eastern Ore Mountains, and on the territory of the state capital Dresden [all 3 presented in Saxon's administrative map referred to in the commentary].

With the latest case, the total number of ASF cases identified in Brandenburg and Saxony for a year has risen to 2500. Fortunately, there have only been 3 cases in domestic pig herds so far. With the added Meissen district, a total of 8 districts are now affected. In the past 14 days alone, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute confirmed 69 ASF cases in wild boars.

[The significant westward leap of ASF in Germany is of concern, threatening western and northern Europe's domestic pig industry. The case in Meissen, confirmed on 13 Oct 2021, as well as previous cases closer to the Polish border in the east, are included in the FLI's table, at http://tinyurl.com/j3cj79e6. FLI's map presenting the said cases is available at https://tsis.fli.de/Reports/Info_SO.aspx?ts=011&guid=8cec5070-469d-44fa-bcbd-5fa2f24718c4.

A map of the German Saxony State is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony#/media/File:Landkreise_Sachsen_2012.svg. Its most eastern district, Gorlitz, bordering Poland, has been infected since 30 Oct 2020 (see 20201102.7910014).

The detection of this case has become feasible due to the recent introduction of obligatory testing of all hunted wild boars in Meissen (and 2 other districts). Hopefully, no undetected cases had occurred in these districts earlier. - Mod.AS
