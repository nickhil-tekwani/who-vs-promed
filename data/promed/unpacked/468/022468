A mystery disease has killed over 70 camels in northeastern Kenya, locals told Anadolu Agency on Friday [5 Jun 2020]. Most of the unexplained deaths have occurred in Mandera County, inhabited mostly by nomadic pastoralists.

[AB], a herder who has lost 20 camels in just a week, says the community is facing a dire situation and needs help immediately.

"So many of our camels have died mysteriously, especially here in Mandera. Most of these cases are in Banissa and Ramu areas, where the rains have been favorable and there is plenty of pasture," he told Anadolu Agency. "We don't know where this disease has come from, and we need livestock specialists to come and help us find a cure. We want Kenyans to know that this disease, if not controlled, will lead to hunger and poverty. Many more people have lost their camels too but are yet to report the deaths."

Mandera, which borders Somalia and Ethiopia, has a vibrant livestock business, with traders coming from across the border to buy camels that are sold for no less than USD 800 each.

Speaking to Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation earlier this week, Shamsi Mohamud, the county's chief livestock officer, said lab tests have so far been inconclusive. She said the tests have been conducted for 7 diseases, including parainfluenza and _Trypanosoma_.

"We have received 3 test results from Kabete Veterinary Laboratory, and all of them were negative. We are waiting for 4 more and hope they will help us ascertain the exact cause," she said.

Another official, Claudio Sortum, the county's head of veterinary services, said the infected camels showed symptoms of parainfluenza, such as difficulty in breathing and movement.

"Until we get the final test results, we continue to suspect parainfluenza as the cause of the reported deaths," Sortum told the paper.

[Mandera County is a county in the former North Eastern Province of Kenya. The county is bordered by Ethiopia to the north, by Somalia to the east, and by Kenya's Wajir County to the southwest.

Results of epidemiological and laboratory investigation of the event are requested. On top of parasitological and bacterial diseases, such as anthrax, pasteurellosis, and enterotoxaemia (caused by enterotoxins produced by strains of _Clostridium perfringens_), camel morbidity and mortality may be due, in this region, to various viral and other causative agents, including peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and Rift Valley fever (RVF).

On 15 May 2020, FAO-IGAD published a joint statement on the increasing risk for RVF in eastern Africa. According to the detailed statement, which includes a map, during the past months, rainfall was persistently above average in most of the countries in eastern Africa. The risk of RVF occurrence in the region is stated to be high both in animals and humans in the next coming months, either due to the favorable environmental conditions and/or through animal movement. The statement called for urgent readiness to any potential RVF outbreak, in particular through One Health coordination (see https://rr-africa.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fao-igad-rvf-statement.pdf). - Mod.AS
