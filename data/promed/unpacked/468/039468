87 persons have so far lost their lives out of 855 cases of Lassa [haemorrhagic] fever reported across the country, just as medical practitioners warned that the deadly disease, which is on a rampage in Africa, is worse than the dreaded acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Making this disclosure in Benin City, the former Vice-Chancellor of Ambrose Alli University and Medical Laboratory Scientist, Prof. Dennis Agbonlahor, urged both federal and state government to take the issue of Lassa [haemorrhagic] fever more seriously, even [more] than HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS. According to him: "the virus which primary carrier are the rodents genus has between 1969 when it was first confirmed to be in Lassa (a north eastern community in today's Borno state) and May this year, had claimed 86 000 lives in Nigeria alone.

Every year, Lassa fever is reported to affect about 300 000 to 500 000 people resulting in over 5000 deaths across the west African countries of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Prof. Agbonlahor expressed concern that measures being taken by the state and federal governments were grossly inadequate, noting that attentions had been more focused on the western world, propelled by emphasis on diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and others, whereas Lassa [haemorrhagic] fever, which has so far proven to be an African mass killer disease, has been neglected.

[Lassa haemorrhagic fever is a viral illness that is spread by rodents, predominantly the "multimammate mouse/rat" _Mastomys natalensis_. People get the disease through direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine. Lassa fever may also spread though person-to-person contact. The symptoms include fever, pain behind the chest, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the mouth or nose. People with Lassa fever may also experience hearing loss, tremors, swelling of the face and eyelids, and swelling of the brain. Pregnant women with Lassa fever often have bleeding from the genitals and miscarriage and may die from the illness.

Lassa fever is seen in West Africa. Cases have been documented in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. However, the rats that spread Lassa fever also live in other countries in Africa, and there is the potential for further spread of the disease. The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. These numbers are estimates because cases are not investigated everywhere. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 10 per cent to 16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region. Lassa fever can occur all year long, but most cases occur from January to May.

Because airborne transmission is possible and mortality can be high under certain conditions, Lassa virus has been classified as a category A bioterrorism agent. Early diagnosis is difficult due to insidious non-specific onset and to the great genetic divergence of the virus that makes RT-PCR assays unreliable. The lack of proper diagnostic tools promotes nosocomial infection and diminishes the efficacy of treatment. (See: Leparc-Goffart I, Emonet SF. Med Trop (Mars). 2011 Dec;71(6):541-5).
