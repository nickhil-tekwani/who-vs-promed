Dutch dioxin scare spreads to France and Spain
----------------------------------------------
France and Spain were hit on Tuesday [9 Nov 2004] by a dioxin contamination
scare that has forced the closure of almost 200 Dutch farms, after the
cancer-causing toxin was found in animal feed. The European Commission and
officials in the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium, where contamination was
previously found, have ruled out serious risk to public health, but farms
have been shut pending the outcome of tests.
The Dutch agriculture ministry said in a statement that 2 cows from one of
the contaminated Dutch farms were exported to Spain. It also said that
German-made clay, which is used for sorting potatoes for animal feed, and
which has been found to be contaminated with dioxin, has shown up in France
as well as in Belgium, where it was known to have been exported. But, the
French farm ministry said it had not yet been made aware of any spread of
the dioxin scare to France, either by the European Commission or the Dutch
government. "The most urgent question which we are working on is to know
whether some animals have left the Netherlands for France," a ministry
spokesman said. "At this stage we still don't have an answer to that."
Officials said last week [1st week of November 2004] that contaminated
animal feed, made of potato peelings, had been bought by hundreds of Dutch
cattle, pig, sheep, and goat farms and shipped to Germany and Belgium.
The dioxin outbreak has led to the temporary closure of a total of 197
Dutch farms, 8 farms in Belgium and 4 in Germany. Authorities are still
examining the feed, the animals, and any impact on the food chain, such as
on meat and milk. The results of 8 samples of pork from some of the
affected Dutch farms proved negative on Tuesday [9 Nov 2004], but
authorities said all farms involved will remain closed until all necessary
tests are completed.
Earlier Dutch results have shown contaminated milk at only 2 of the farms.
The contaminated animal feed found last week [1st week of November 2004]
was from the Dutch factories of privately held Canadian potato chip maker
McCain, which has halted feed sales. "New research has shown high
concentrations of dioxin in peels from another Dutch potato company. This
has led to closure of another 76 livestock farms (on Tuesday [9 Nov 2004]),
which had bought contaminated feed," the Dutch farm ministry said. It added
that contaminated German clay was purchased by a total of 10 Dutch
companies and also sold to Belgium and France. The ministry refused to name
the companies.
The ministry revised once again the number of farms it closed in the
Netherlands last week [1st week of November 2004] to 121, from 162, saying
it had miscalculated the total because of the type of animals they had.
