The people of Osun State now live in fear over the outbreak of cholera
that has claimed 8 lives in the state. Nigerian Tribune investigations
revealed that the epidemic, which has affected some parts of the state
in the past few days, has sent dangerous signals to the people, as
there are no medical officials that could come to their rescue due to
the ongoing strike by medical practitioners in the state.

It was gathered that the epidemic claimed 4 lives in Ede North, 2 in
Sogbedere village, Ede South Local Government and 2 in the ancient
town of Ede.

The United Nations has warned that a cholera outbreak linked to dirty
water threatens Somali children already weak and on the brink of
starvation. At Banadir hospital in Mogadishu, medical staff are
struggling to cope with the influx of patients, the Associated Press
reported.

Dr Abdalla Abukar said the cholera outbreak began in July 2011, and
the hospital admits between 50 and 80 people with the disease per day.
One hospital in Mogadishu has had 181 patients die from the disease
since January 2011. Half of those were children younger than 2 years
old.

[4] Cholera - Somalia, internally displaced persons

Fears are mounting that a cholera epidemic could spread rapidly among
the hundreds of thousands of people living in often unsanitary
conditions in Mogadishu after fleeing drought, famine and insecurity.

"The number of cases is 2 or even 3 times what was there in 2010, so
we can say that we have an epidemic of cholera going on," said Michel
Yao, public health adviser at WHO.

In Mogadishu's largest health facility, Banadir Hospital, 4272 cases
of acute watery diarrhea, a symptom of cholera, have been recorded so
far in 2011, causing 181 deaths. Children under 5, weakened by
malnutrition, make up 3/4ths of the cases. Of the total cases, 1633
were reported in June and July 2011.

WHO spokesman Tarek Jasarevic said: "This sudden increase had various
reasons. 1st, the numerous informal settlements of internally
displaced persons with makeshift shelters, poor sanitation and limited
access to safe water; 2nd, the limited capacity of existing health
partners to access those informal settlements and provide essential
health services; and 3rd, the high number of malnourished children due
to the ongoing famine has increased the susceptibility to waterborne
diseases such as acute watery diarrhea."

An estimated 100 000 people, fleeing drought, famine and conflict,
have made their way to Mogadishu over the past 2 months, according to
Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. They
joined another 370 000 people who had fled to the capital earlier.
