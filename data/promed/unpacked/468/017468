State officials are warning that they have received reports of horses across Nevada that have been exposed to a herpes virus and a bacterial infection.

The Nevada Department of Agriculture said people have reported horses contracting equine herpesvirus type 4, or EHV-4, and _Streptococcus equi_ bacterial infection, also known as strangles or equine distemper.

Officials say these diseases are highly contagious among horses, and the state veterinarian has recommended postponing a high school rodeo in Moapa Valley this weekend [25-26 Feb 2017].

"Horses that were exposed last weekend [18-19 Feb 2017] may not exhibit clinical signs for several weeks, and we run the risk of exposing additional horses at the rodeo this weekend," Dr JJ Goicoechea said in a statement. "We may be issuing quarantine orders once confirmed. Our primary focus is stopping the spread and protecting our equine population."

Both EHV-4 and strangles affect the upper respiratory system in horses and can cause lifelong illness. Horse owners are advised to make sure vaccinations are current, and anyone who suspects a horse is exhibiting signs should contact a veterinarian and not let it come into contact with other horses.

State law requires any owner with knowledge of an infected animal to notify the state quarantine office.

[It seems there may be an outbreak of some sort and perhaps clinical signs are not as clear cut as the agency would like, and perhaps they are awaiting laboratory confirmation if they are dealing with a single disease or multiple diseases. Both of these diseases are contagious. While strangles is serious, it is more easily treated. Equine herpesvirus is a disease that is difficult to treat and can have devastating consequences. We look forward to a definitive diagnosis on these horses. - Mod.TG
