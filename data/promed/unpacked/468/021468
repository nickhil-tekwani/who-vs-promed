Cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Yaroslavskaya Oblast
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 2 cases of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) have been registered in the
Danilovsk region. Rodents are the source of this
infection. This is not an epidemic yet but there
are issues for concern. This infection is a
dangerous one and the reservoir is in the natural
environment. The risk of infection increases in
autumn, when plant and hay storage facilities are full.

Early diagnosis is difficult because of
non-specific signs and symptoms. Epidemiologists
recommend that particular attention should be
paid to possible contacts with rodents. In
addition, 3 more regions are also affected with
HFRS: the Uglichskoe, Rostovskoe and Lyubimskoe
regions. The public health authorities forecast
that the incidence will decrease during the
winter but will increase again in spring when rodents begin to breed again.

[Cases of HFRS occur regularly in the Central
Federal Okrug. This season cases have been
recorded also in the Voronezhskaya and Lipetskaya
Oblasts -- see ProMED-mail references below.
However, this is the 1st report from the
Yaroslavskaya Oblast during the past 5-6 years.
The number of new cases will depend on rodent
density, the prevalence of infection among
rodents, the level of pest control measures and other factors. Â­ Mod.NP
