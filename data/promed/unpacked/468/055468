Plague, bubonic - Mongolia (Central) 20010808.1871
Date: 4 Sep 2001
From: Pagbajabyn Nymadawa <nymadawa@hotmail.com> [edited

Mongolia is endemic for plague and it has been registered yearly 2-10 cases
with around 50 percent mortality. In this year 4 cases have been registered
so far (4 Sep 2001) with one fatality.
The information distributed through Internet by ProMED-mail (7 Aug 2001) is
not correct. In this [posting, 33 primary contacts and 156 secondary
contacts of a bubonic plague case in Lunsomon (district) of Tuv aimak
(province) located 140 km west from Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of
Mongolia, has been erroneously cited as 200 cases of plague. The index case
has fully recovered now and the contacts after a 7-day isolation (the first
contacts have received prophylactic antibiotic treatment) released, while
nobody has developed [any sign of plague according to the WHO
International Health Regulation (IHR).

[ProMED-mail appreciates this e-mail from Dr. Nymadawa. It corrects the
news agency report that we posted on 8 Aug 2001. It is sometimes difficult
to verify such reports, especially when we have a limited number of
subscribers in the area of the reported outbreak. We had some concerns
about the accuracy of the information contained in the prior report, but
chose to call this potentially significant outbreak to the attention of
subscribers in the hope that verification or correction would be
forthcoming. ProMED-mail is an early warning list, and by posting selected
edited news media reports we take some risks of this nature. - Mod.ES &
