State reports first West Nile case
----------------------------------
West Baltimore man, 72, has tested positive for virus; Fourth human case in
U.S. this year

A 72-year-old man has tested positive for the West Nile virus, city and
state health officials said Thursday [6 Sep 2001.
The West Baltimore man is the state's first confirmed human case of the
disease. Dr. Peter Beilenson, the city's health commissioner, said the man
is in a light coma and on a ventilator. He said the man has a history of
chronic health conditions.
It is the fourth confirmed human case of West Nile in the United States
this year. In humans, the virus can cause deadly swelling of the brain. But
most people only suffer a flu-like sickness and many who are exposed don't
get sick at all. The elderly and people with weak immune systems are most
susceptible.
The man, whom health officials did not identify, was admitted to Sinai
Hospital about two weeks ago, according to the Maryland Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene.
The positive West Nile test results were reported Thursday, and have been
sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.
At least 246 West Nile-infected birds have been found in Maryland this
year, according to state health officials.
