On 19 Mar 2015, a 55-year-old male has died of rabies at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), Kathmandu. In the last 6 months, 4 other patients (total 5) have died from rabies at STIDH. All patients were bitten by rabid dogs. The ages of patients ranged from 12 to 55 years. All patients were male.

Rabies is endemic in Nepal and is diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms and history of exposure to animals. No routine laboratory test of rabies in humans is performed in Nepal. In 2005-2006, 3488 patients received post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, while 18 004 received it in STIDH in 2012-2013. The annual number of human rabies cases (no of deaths) ranged from 8-14. Rabies is a neglected tropical disease in Nepal, and hence data so far available are not accurate or reliable. One Health Approach (intersectoral collaboration) could be one of the best models to control or eliminate of rabies in the long run in Nepal.

[Dr Pun informed us of this case using the ProMED-mail "submit info" form -- the tag is in the top right hand corner of the main ProMED-mail page at http://www.promedmail.org. We are very grateful to him for this report. But members should remember that you are our eyes on the ground. You see events before they are reported by governments or news agencies. You are a vital part of what we try to do. So a double thanks to Dr Pun.

Checking the OIE zoonotic reports for human rabies in Nepal there were none (yet) for 2014, merely "+" for 2013 and 2012, 28 human cases and deaths in 2011, "+" in 2010, and nothing reported for 2009. During the 1st 6 months of 2014 there were 23 cases of cattle rabies diagnosed, 12 in buffaloes, 16 in sheep and goats, and 34 in dogs.

If the Nepal government could mount an effective canine rabies control programme it would have significant impact both on human risk and on village livestock. Canine rabies control -- and eradication -- is straightforward and uncomplicated, and has immediate significant social and community benefits. Preventing human rabies through control of domestic dog rabies is a realistic goal and is justified financially by the future savings of discontinuing post-exposure prophylaxis for people. The problem in Nepal is a consequence of inadequate provision of rabies vaccine for both pre and post human exposure vaccination, no doubt ultimately due to financial constraints. Vaccinating dogs is a lot easier and cheaper.

Safe, effective vaccines can be used for pre-exposure immunization (PEP). This is recommended for travellers spending a lot of time outdoors, especially in rural areas, being involved in activities such as bicycling, camping, or hiking as well as for long-term travellers and expatriates living in areas with a significant risk of exposure. Pre-exposure immunization is also recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations such as laboratory workers dealing with live rabies virus and other rabies-related viruses (lyssaviruses), and people involved in any activities that might bring them professionally or otherwise into direct contact with bats, carnivores, and other mammals in rabies-affected areas. As children are considered at higher risk because they tend to play with animals and may receive more severe bites, or may not report bites, their immunization could be considered if living in or visiting high risk areas.

Prompt wound care and the administration of rabies immune globulin (RIG) and vaccine are highly effective in preventing human rabies following exposure. A variety of empirical schedules and vaccine doses have been recommended over time, based in part on immunogenicity and clinical experience in areas of the world with enzootic canine or wildlife rabies. As more potent vaccines were developed, the number of vaccine doses recommended for PEP has decreased, and studies aimed at further revision and reduction of PEP schedules and doses in humans have been encouraged. By the latter half of the 20th century, a 4- to 6-dose, intramuscular regimen using human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) was being recommended. In the USA, a 5-dose PEP vaccine regimen was adopted during the 1980s. In 2007, when human rabies vaccine was in limited supply, an ad hoc National Rabies Working Group was formed to reassess the recommendations for rabies prevention and control in humans and other animals. In 2008, a smaller Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Rabies Workgroup was formed to review rabies vaccine regimen options. This report provides updated ACIP recommendations regarding the use of a 4-dose vaccination regimen, replacing the previously recommended 5-dose regimen, for rabies PEP in previously unvaccinated persons.
