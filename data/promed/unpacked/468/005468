Doctors don't know why eating crawfish or buffalo fish sometimes causes the rare muscle-destroying illness that recently sickened 3 members of one Mississippi family. But they believe Haff disease is caused by eating bottom-feeders that have eaten the roots of a wetland plant called water hemlock.

The 3 people who became ill in early July 2013 after eating buffalo fish caught in the Yazoo River were Mississippi's 1st cases, but Haff disease has been seen at least twice in Louisiana since 2000. And in 1997, 7 people diagnosed with the disease in other states turned out to have eaten buffalo fish caught in Louisiana and Missouri.

No U.S. case has been fatal. Symptoms -- muscle weakness and pain, dry mouth, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and dark urine -- generally appear within 12 hours of eating buffalo fish or crawfish.

The disease is caused by a toxin that destroys skeletal muscle tissue, possibly cicutoxin, which is found in water hemlock, though the connection to Haff disease has never been proved, epidemiologist Mallory Becnel wrote last year [2012] in the Louisiana Mortality and Morbidity Report.

As muscle cells break open, their contents pour into the blood. Treatment is mostly large amounts of intravenous fluid to keep the contents of the cells from clogging and destroying the kidneys.

Only about 30 cases of Haff disease have been reported in the United States since 1984, the Mississippi State Department of Health said last month [July 2013], though water hemlock is found throughout North America.

"It's a really common plant in wetlands and other wet places, and roadside ditches," said Gary N. Ervin, head of the plant ecology lab at Mississippi State University. Because it generally grows in shallow water or moist areas that may flood for part of the year, it might not be readily accessible to some types of fish but would be easy for crawfish to get at, he said.

Water hemlock also is called cowbane, beaver poison, muskrat weed or musquash poison. The toxin is found throughout the plant but is especially concentrated in the chambered, tuberous roots, according to the U.S. Forest Service. In the book "Weeds of the Northern U.S. and Canada: A Guide for Identification," France Royer and Richard Dickinson describe water hemlock as the most toxic plant in North America.

In January 2012, a 62-year-old woman who had eaten buffalo fish went to a hospital because her arms, neck, back and chest were aching and she felt nauseated, Becnel wrote.

The chest pain can be mistaken for a heart attack, said Dr. Raoult Ratard, Louisiana's state epidemiologist.

Seven people went to emergency rooms within one week in 2001 with chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and sweating, according to an earlier article in the Louisiana Mortality and Morbidity Report.

Ratard said the 7 were fairly young. "At first, it looked like heart attacks," he said. But their blood didn't show high levels of enzymes found in heart muscles and used to diagnose heart attacks. Their blood did have high levels of CPK, an enzyme found in all muscle cells. That indicated the muscle destruction called rhabdomyolysis.

All had bought crawfish from the same store in the Zachary area.

"By the time we knew about it, some other people had bought crawfish and nothing had happened," Ratard said.

Five of the people were hospitalized. They recovered quickly, without remaining problems, LMMR reported.

People who think they have heart attacks probably make up the bulk of Haff disease diagnoses because the enzyme test isn't common, said Dr. Brobson Lutz, former health director for the City of New Orleans.

"I suspect that, like most diseases, the cases that get reported are the tip of the iceberg, and other people get mild symptoms that resolve spontaneously over a few hours. ... And if they did get into the emergency room, it's unlikely a CPK test would be ordered unless there was some sort of chest pain," he said.

[The following is reprinted from Louisiana Morbidity Report, March-April 2012, Vol. 23/2 Page 5, "Haff Disease - Louisiana 2012," By: Mallory Becnel, http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-CH/infectious-epi/LMR/2011-2020/2012/marapr12.pdf (Our thanks to ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka for forwarding the citation):

"In January 2013, a 62 year-old female in Louisiana ate several pieces of fried buffalo fish that were purchased frozen from a traveling vendor. She 1st ate 4 pieces of fish at midnight and then ate more at 7:00 A.M. Later that morning, her arms, neck, back and chest began aching, and she was nauseated. She went to her local emergency department and was given a gastrointestinal cocktail, with which she felt almost immediate relief. As her creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) was found to be elevated, she was transferred to another hospital.

The patient's CPK was 6300 IU/L, which indicated damage to her muscle cells. CPK is an enzyme found in all muscle cells including cardiac. Often, a high CPK suggests that a patient had a myocardial infarction [a heart attack]. In this case, the enzymes that are more specific to cardiac muscles (CK-MB and troponin) were normal.

After the physician obtained her history, she was diagnosed with Haff disease rhabdomyolysis secondary to buffalo fish consumption.

The patient was treated with fluids to protect her kidneys until the CPK was corrected. A sample of the fish was then sent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to help with their research of the disease.

This is the 1st case of Haff disease reported in Louisiana since 2002. There was also a small outbreak of Haff disease in 2001. Seven people were hospitalized for chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. All of them had eaten crawfish purchased from the same establishment and developed symptoms within 3-16 hours of their meal. They also all had a rise in CPK to 6000-8000 IU/L which went back down after a few days. They were diagnosed with acute rhabdomyolysis of undetermined etiology.

In 1997, there were several cases of Haff disease reported in the U.S.; they all had eaten buffalo fish that originated from Louisiana and Missouri.

Recent cases were identified in November 2011 in a New York hospital, according to an advisory from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. After consuming cooked buffalo fish, 2 patients from the same household were seen in the emergency department for vomiting and severe muscle pain.

Both patients had elevated CPK and developed symptoms 7 hours after they ate the fish.

Although its etiology is unconfirmed, Haff disease is believed to be caused by ingesting fish and other seafood that have consumed the roots of water hemlock. Water hemlock, which is also called beaver poison, muskrat weed, or musquash poison, is a fall plant that grows in swamps or wetlands. Beneath the stem, there is a bundle of chambered tuberous roots. The roots contain a toxin called cicutoxin, an unsaturated long chain alipathic alcohol.

Rhabdomyolysis is one of the major effects of cicutoxin."

Haff disease is a syndrome of unexplained rhabdomyolysis following consumption of certain types of fish; it is caused by an unidentified toxin. Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by injury to skeletal muscle that results in release of muscle cell contents into the circulation (1). In 1997, 6 cases of Haff disease were identified in the United States (4 in California and 2 in Missouri) among persons who ate buffalo fish (_Ictiobus cyprinellus_), a bottom-feeding species found mostly in the Mississippi River or its tributaries.

Haff disease, 1st identified in Europe in the 1920s, is unexplained rhabdomyolysis in a person who ate fish in the 24 hours (range: 6-21 hours) before onset of muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark brown urine; it is caused by an unidentified toxin.

Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK (creatine kinase) level with an MB (muscle/brain) fraction of less than 5 percent. Levels of other muscle enzymes (such as, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase) also are elevated. Myoglobinuria [the presence of myoglobin in the urine] is often mistaken for gross hematuria [blood in the urine]. Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.

Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes of fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin [an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of vertebrates] toxicity to the renal tubules. Possible complications include electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Symptoms usually resolve within 2-3 days. Historically, the case-fatality rate is approximately one percent.

Clinicians should be aware of food exposures that pose a risk to their patients and routinely obtain food histories, even from those patients whose illnesses may not appear to be food-related.

The CDC recommends that physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history, should report them to public health authorities for initiation of traceback and recall of implicated food items.

In a review, 10 of the 12 U.S. cases of Haff disease reported since 1984 occurred seasonally during March through August (Buchholz U, Mouzin E, Dickey R, et al. Haff Disease: From the Baltic Sea to the U.S. Shore. Emerg Infect Dis. 2000:6(2):192-195). Unlike most other seafood-related illnesses (e.g., ciguatera, scombroid fish poisoning, or paralytic shellfish poisoning), which are associated with saltwater fish, most reported cases or outbreaks of Haff disease have been associated with freshwater fish (burbot, eel and pike in Europe, freshwater crayfish in China, and buffalo fish in the U.S. The buffalo fish involved in U.S. cases had been caught in Mississippi, Louisiana or Missouri waters). Unusual smell or taste does not help identify toxic fish.

Now that we have addressed the disease, let us address the toxic agent of the plant.

Hemlock poisoning may refer to poisoning by either poison hemlock (_Conium maculatum_) or water hemlock family (_Cicuta_ species and _Oenanthe crocata_ L.). Historically, poison hemlock was reportedly used to execute Socrates, and the Old Testament describes rhabdomyolysis in Israelites who consumed quail fed on hemlock.

Although related, poison hemlock and water hemlock toxicity have different pathophysiologies and clinical presentations. The root contains the greatest concentration of toxin in both species, although all plant parts are toxic. Poison hemlock causes "crooked calf disease," a congenital abnormality among cattle formed via fetal exposure. No antidote is available for either toxin.

Poison hemlock, an exotic species introduced to the United States, is a ubiquitous plant with fernlike properties that may reach a height of 2 meters. Poison hemlock grows in diverse settings, including wooded areas, ditches, and waysides throughout the United States and may be mistaken for other plants such as fool's parsley (_Aethusa cynapium_).

Water hemlock is typically found growing in moist habitats, such as drainage ditches, marshes, and near bodies of fresh water. Water hemlock has compound leaves; small white or green flowers, and tuberous, large, hollow roots. Water hemlock may reach a height of 2.5 meters and can also be confused with other plants such as wild carrot, also known as Queen Anne's lace (_Daucus carota_), poison hemlock (_C. maculate_), pignut, sweet flag, watercress, wild parsnip, wild celery, wild ginseng, and kvanne. [2]

Poison hemlock contains several piperidine alkaloid toxins (namely coniine) that are structurally similar to nicotine. Coniine has direct effects on nicotinic (cholinergic) receptors, both agonist and antagonist. Clinically, initial manifestations include gastritis and CNS stimulation (tremor, ataxia, and seizures). Nicotine activation at autonomic ganglia can cause tachycardia, salivation, mydriasis, and diaphoresis. In severe cases, acetylcholine (nicotinic) receptor antagonism develops. This leads to bradycardia, ascending paralysis, and CNS depression (coma). Death is typically from respiratory failure.

Water hemlock contains cicutoxin, a potent, noncompetitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Using a rat model, Uwai et al showed that cicutoxin is an antagonist of GABA-mediated chloride channels. [3] Cicutoxin rapidly produces GI symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal pain) typically within 60 minutes of ingestion. CNS excitation leads to tremor and seizures, often refractory to therapy. A single bite of the root, which contains the highest concentration of cicutoxin, has been reported to kill an adult.

Poison hemlock poisoning is potentially lethal with large ingestions; water hemlock fatalities have occurred following a few bites of the root.

In cases of plant toxicity, history may be obscure, and ingested plants may not be available for identification.

History for poison hemlock may include the following: nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive salivation, tachycardia, Hypo or hyper tension, tremor, seizures (much more common with water hemlock), bradycardia (slow heart rate/late in clinical picture), ascending paralysis (late), coma, respiratory failure, delirium, seizures, coma.

Hemlock plants may be intentionally ingested. However, most ingestions are unintentional. Poison hemlock may be mistaken for wild carrots. Water hemlock may be mistaken for wild parsnips or artichokes.

Birds ingesting hemlock during migratory flight may be reported to cause coturnism (human poisoning after eating quail).

Differentials may include: methamphetamine, mushrooms, phenycyclidine and others.

Chemical screening test for alkaloids in plant material provides confirmation of toxicity due to poison or water hemlock. However, a plant specimen (or ingested material) is required, and these tests are not routinely available.

For patients with possible hemlock poisoning, maintain the airway, obtain IV access airway, and assist with ventilation as needed.

Rapidly assess and correct any life-threatening conditions. Since no antidote exists for the toxin, GI decontamination (if appropriate) and aggressive supportive care are mainstays of treatment for hemlock poisoning. Schep et al provide a concise review of water hemlock poisoning and management. [2]

Given the condition of the patients, this plant makes sense as a toxic agent. Knowing the plant likes its "feet wet," so to speak, makes it a good candidate as well. Now it would seem we know about the toxin bioaccumulating in the flesh of bottom feeding fish.
