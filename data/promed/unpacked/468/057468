Avian influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 28
--------------------------------------------------------
Thailand: Reports of infection in domestic cats
-----------------------------------------------
WHO is aware of reports of avian influenza a (H5N1) virus infection in a
single household of domestic cats in Thailand. Investigations are under
way, and no firm conclusions can be made at present. However, concern is
great and several specific questions are being raised about risks to humans
in close contact with infected cats and the need for surveillance of
disease in cat populations.

Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in 2 out of 3 dead domestic cats
was announced today by the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences at Thailand’s
Kasetsart University. The animals are part of a single household of 15
cats. Of these, 14 have died. Contact of one cat with dead chickens was
observed by the owner. Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health is
investigating the incident in cats and is monitoring the health of human
contacts. FAO is also contributing expertise.

While conclusions are premature pending the results of these
investigations, confirmation of H5N1 infection in cats is not considered
likely to enhance the present risks to human health. Nor is it considered
likely to influence the future evolution of the outbreak in humans in any
significant way. Several studies have shown that a small number of
mammalian species, including pigs, seals, whales, mink, and ferrets, are
[also] susceptible to natural infection with influenza viruses that are
purely avian in their genetic makeup. Of these species, only the pig has
significance for human health. Pigs can be co-infected with both avian and
human influenza viruses and can thus serve as the "mixing vessel" for the
mingling of genetic material, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new
influenza virus subtype. Most experts agree that pigs played a role in the
emergence of pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968.

Up to now, domestic cats have not been considered susceptible to disease
caused by natural infection with influenza viruses. Some older studies,
from1970, 1972, and 1981, reported experimental infection of domestic cats
under laboratory conditions. Although infection occurred (virus was
recovered from the respiratory tract), all of the cats remained healthy.
None developed typical symptoms of influenza, including fever, nasal
discharge, coughing, or sneezing. These findings are important, in that
they strongly suggest that, should additional cats become infected with
H5N1, they would not shed large quantities of the virus.

In contrast, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus replicates in the intestines as
well as the respiratory tract of birds. In the present outbreak, very large
quantities of virus are being excreted in the faeces of infected birds,
resulting in widespread contamination of the environment. This wide
presence of the H5N1 virus in the environment creates one of the most
important risks for human exposure and subsequent infection. Should
domestic cats prove to be easily infected with H5N1, which is considered
unlikely, their infection is not expected to contribute in a significant
way to the presence of H5N1 virus in the environment. Avian influenza
viruses, including the specific strain implicated in the present outbreak,
lack the receptors needed to infect mammals efficiently. However, the
infection of humans observed in this and 2 previous H5N1 outbreaks
demonstrates that transmission from birds to mammals can occur despite this
lack of receptors. The very small number of human cases -­ despite abundant
and widespread opportunities for exposure and subsequent infection -­
strongly suggests that transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals,
including cats as well as humans, is a rare event.

The reported infection of domestic cats with H5N1 is an unusual event in
what is an historically unprecedented situation. Results from the
investigation undertaken by Thai authorities will shed critical light on
this unusual event. Influenza viruses are highly unstable and their
behaviour cannot be predicted. Vigilance for suspected cases in various
mammalian species is presently high and should be continued. Reporting by
veterinarians of suspected or confirmed cases to national authorities, as
happened in the present situation, is a key component of this continuing
vigilance.

Situation (human) in Thailand
-----------------------------
Since 23 Jan 2004, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has reported 9
laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. Of
these, 7 have died. The situation is reviewed daily by a joint team of
ministry officials and WHO staff. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical
data on the first 5 cases were published last week by WHO. The subsequent 4
cases include 2 who have fully recovered (a 2-year-old boy and a
27-year-old woman), a 13-year-old boy, and a 4-year-old boy, who died on 3
Feb 2004. All cases have been announced in previous updates.

Thai authorities are currently investigating a further 147 reports of
patients admitted to hospital with suspicious symptoms. Of these, 21 are
being considered as suspect cases of H5N1 infection. All have a clinical
diagnosis of pneumonia. 8 have died, 8 have fully recovered, and 5 remain
hospitalized. The investigation of cases is following 3 lines: laboratory
testing, epidemiological tracing of likely sources of infection, and
examination of clinical features of disease.

Final results of laboratory testing are pending for the additional 126
patients under investigation. The results of virus isolation studies are
pending. These studies, which can take up to 14 days, are used to verify
and supplement the initial PCR findings. Recent enhancement of laboratory
facilities at Thailand’s National Institutes of Health, including the
addition of equipment for real-time PCR testing, has expedited the
processing of clinical samples, thus reducing the time from notification to
obtaining the initial laboratory diagnosis. In this group of 126 patients,
19 are still being investigated to obtain more details about either
potential exposure to affected poultry or the clinical features of disease.

The surveillance system in Thailand is on high alert. To date, 510 reports
have been brought to the attention of health authorities. Of these, 354
have been excluded from consideration following thorough laboratory,
epidemiological, and clinical investigation. The most recently announced
confirmed case was a 4-year-old boy from the northeastern province of Khon
Kaen. His family raised chickens, and many died shortly before the onset of
his symptoms. One of the most recently reported suspect cases is a
2-year-old girl from a southern province. The family’s poultry died 7 days
prior to the onset of her symptoms. The case is not yet
laboratory-confirmed. As H5N1 infection in poultry has not been reported in
this province to date, the Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and is
currently investigating animal illness in the area. To date, no evidence
suggests that human-to-human transmission has occurred in Thailand.

The number of reports brought to the attention of Thai authorities has
declined, and the numbers this week are low. The Ministry of Agriculture is
currently responding to the detection, earlier this week, of the
reappearance of infection in poultry in provinces where extensive culling
was previously carried out. Rapid culling in the newly affected areas is
now under way to prevent further spread, and thus reduce opportunities for
the disease to become endemic.

Situation (poultry) in Japan
----------------------------
Japanese authorities have confirmed that the country’s 2nd outbreak of
avian influenza, detected in Oita Prefecture, was caused by the avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus.

Situation (poultry) in China
----------------------------
As of today, Chinese authorities have reported 53 outbreaks in poultry in
16 provinces. Of these, 49 have been confirmed as caused by avian influenza
A (H5N1) virus. To date, an estimated 1.2 million chickens, ducks, and
geese have been destroyed.

[There is an increasing discordance between the number of suspected cases
of human avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection reported by the local
Thai and Vietnamese authorities (see above and below) and the
laboratory-confirmed figures reported by WHO. As of Fri 20 Feb 2004, the
total number of cases confirmed by WHO remained at 31, of whom 22 have
died. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: 4 More Suspected Human Cases Reported
-----------------------------------------------
An additional 4 cases of influenza A virus infection and [more] suspected
were detected between Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon, bringing the
total number so far to 271. Of the patients, who come from 36 cities and
provinces, 38 have died, 107 remained hospitalized, and 126 recovered, the
country's Health Ministry announced on Friday afternoon.

The latest locality reporting its 1st case of influenza A virus infection
or suspects is the southern province of Binh Duong. The patient from the
province is under treatment in the Ho Chi Minh City-based Cho Ray Hospital,
said the ministry. Over the past 24 hours, Viet Nam detected only one new
commune, in the northern province of Thai Binh, being stricken by bird flu,
and culled 47 000 fowls. To date, over 38.1 million poultry, or 15 percent
of the country's fowl population, in 2570 communes of 57 localities have
either died or been killed.

Cambodia; Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cambodian authorities were testing a man from southern Cambodia on
suspicion that he was infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection, a World Health Organization official said on Fri 20 Feb 2004.
The 27-year-old man, suffering from a fever and cough, met the "suspect
case definition," and specimens were being tested at the Pasteur Institute
in Phnom Penh, said Sean Tobin, a WHO medical epidemiologist.

He is the 2nd Cambodian to be tested on suspicion of having avian
influenza. A woman who has since died was the 1st suspected case in the
Takeo province. She was taken to a hospital in neighboring Vietnam where
doctors, however, said she didn't have the virus.

Tobin said the latest suspected victim worked at a site (also in Takeo)
where animals tested positive for bird flu, Tobin said. He showed symptoms
on Wednesday evening and appeared to get worse on Thursday when he was
examined and tested. His condition improved Friday, Tobin said. "He has
quite mild symptoms, so we suspect he probably won't test positive," Tobin
said. If the man tests positive, he would become Cambodia's 1st confirmed
human case. He is warded at a Phnom Penh hospital, Tobin said.

Cambodia is one of 8 Asian countries that is battling a form of bird flu
that also has jumped to humans. The country has confirmed 3 outbreaks, all
near Phnom Penh. More than 25 000 chickens, ducks, and swans have been
culled in Cambodia in an effort to stop the disease from spreading.
