Concerning the recently reported cholera imported cases I would like to let you
know that the countries in which the infection was probably acquired are already
declaring cholera. Therefore there is no need for an alert.
Concerning O139 we are very concerned about the potential spread of
this strain and we are therefore carefully monitoring cases. Among
the five imported cases [into the UK] one was O139, but came from
South East Asia, from a country already notifying cases - so no news.
The day we have any rumour or confirmed information aboutO139 cases
out of the region we will immediately inform the public health workers.
Seasons greetings and my best wishes for a very ProMED-oriented New Year.
