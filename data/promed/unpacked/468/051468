Foot-and-mouth disease south-east of Kibbutz Be'eri
--------------------------------------------------
1. On Thu 26 May 2011, a suspicion of FMD in 2 Bedouin sheep/goat
flocks located about 7 km [4.4 mi] south-west of Kibbutz Be'eri,
Hadarom (South) province, adjacent to the Gaza strip border, was
reported. The flocks included 200 and 150 head of sheep and goats
[respectively].

2. FMD virus serotype O has been isolated from samples sent to the
department of virology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute,
Beit-Dagan.

3. A zone in a radius of 10 km [6 mi] around the outbreak has been
declared infected; see map at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/F216FBDF-DFDD-4AF9-B9B8-5F4534C49974/0/mapa_pe_tlafaim_aza.jpg.
[The map includes the 3 km (2 mi; yellow) and 10 km (6 mi; blue) zone
circles around the focus].

4. All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats, issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10 km zone, are
void.

5. In entrances to the quarantined farms (Be'eri, Reim, Kissufim, and
Ein-Hashlosha), disinfection drive-through pools for vehicle wheels
should be activated.

[The circular includes additional information and guidelines such as
surveillance activities, revaccinations, special arrangements for
slaughter within the region, etc. - Mod.AS]

[This is the 7th FMD outbreak in Israel since the beginning of 2011.
In contrast to the 1st 6 outbreaks, all located within Hazafon
(=northern) province, adjacent to the Lebanese, Syrian, and Jordanian
borders, the current outbreak is located in south-west Israel, very
close to the Gaza strip and adjacent to the Egyptian Sinai territory.

For the location of Be'eri, which is 7 km (4.4 mi) north east of the
outbreak, see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/01/Beeri.html.
Subscribers can also refer to the map available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529
(see the marked new outbreak in south west Israel).

It will be interesting to compare genetically the current, southern
virus strain, which may have originated in Egypt, with the northern
one, which could probably belong to a separate, epidemiologically
unrelated cluster. According to the genotyping information of the
WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, UK), the
Egyptian FMDV serotype O, since 2009, is topotype ME-SA, strain
Sharquia-72. The FMDV serotype O isolate sampled in north Israel in
2011 was genotyped by WRLFMD as topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2
ANT-10. The most recent sample from Lebanon was sent to Pirbright in
2006, where it was genotyped as topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2.

Stram et al. (reference below) have sequenced and subjected to
phylogenetic analysis representative viruses isolated during the major
outbreaks in Israel from 1989 to 2007. They compared the complete
viral VP1 genes of the said isolates, showing that each outbreak was
initiated by introduction of a new virus lineage and not by endemic
and resident viruses.
