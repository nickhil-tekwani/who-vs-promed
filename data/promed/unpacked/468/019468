Wild Poliovirus Importations --- West and Central Africa, January
2003--March 2004
------------------------
Since the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis
(1), 3 World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Americas, European, and
Western Pacific) have been certified polio-free, and the number of
countries with endemic polio has decreased from 125 in 1988 to 6 in 2003
(Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan).
During January 2003--March 2004, importations of wild poliovirus (WPV)
occurred in 8 countries that were previously polio-free: 5 in the West
African block* (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo) and 3
in the Central African block (Cameroon, Central African Republic, and
Chad), resulting in 63 polio cases (2,3). This report summarizes the 1)
investigation and response to these WPV importations and 2) progress toward
polio eradication in West and Central Africa.
Routine and Supplementary Immunization
In 2002, reported routine coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine
(OPV) varied from 13 percent to 93 percent for countries in West and
Central Africa, excluding Ghana**. All West and Central African countries
conducted supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) annually during
1999--2002. In 2002, all except Algeria conducted National Immunization
Days (NIDs)***, vaccinating approximately 30.6 million children aged less
than 5 years with greater than 2 doses of OPV.
Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Surveillance
AFP surveillance quality is evaluated by 2 key indicators: 1) annual
reporting rate (target: nonpolio AFP rate of more than one case per 100 000
children aged less than 15 years) and 2) completeness of specimen
collection (target: 2 adequate stool specimens from greater than 80 of all
persons with AFP). In 2002, these targets were met by all but 6 West and
Central African countries (Algeria, Cape Verde, Chad, Equatorial Guinea,
Gambia, and Sao Tome and Principe). In 2003, the number of countries not
meeting the targets increased to 8 (Algeria, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad,
Ghana, Liberia, Niger, and Sao Tome and Principe).
WPV Importation and Spread
During January 2003--March 2004, a total of 63 cases of polio resulted from
importation of WPV into the previously polio-free countries of West and
Central Africa [see table at weblink provided above]. All imported viruses
were type 1 and could be traced to common ancestral strains that circulate
in endemic reservoirs shared by northern Nigeria and southern Niger [see
figure at weblink. During this same period, Nigeria and Niger have reported
497 cases of infection with WPV type 1 or type 3, with cross-border
transmission of both serotypes between the 2 countries. Of the 63 polio
cases resulting from importation of WPV, 48 (76 percent) occurred during
June--December 2003, coinciding with the peak transmission of indigenous
WPV type 1 in Nigeria and Niger.
East of Nigeria, the first importation occurred in Chad in August 2003 from
northeastern Nigeria, leading to an outbreak of 29 cases****. The outbreak
spread to the adjacent countries of Cameroon (2 cases) and the Central
African Republic (one case) during October--December. The continued
circulation of virus after importation suggests that Chad is at high risk
for reestablishment of endemic poliovirus transmission.
West of Nigeria, 3 independent importations into Benin (5 cases) occurred
from different parts of Nigeria from late 2003 to early 2004. In addition,
genetic sequencing data indicated that after a 2002 importation into
Burkina Faso, in early 2003, WPV spread to Ghana. In 2003, closely related
strains continued to circulate in Ghana (8 cases) and, during 2003--2004,
in Burkina Faso (13 cases). The WPV strains isolated in Cote d'Ivoire (4
cases) and Togo (one case) were linked genetically to the strains
circulating in Burkina Faso and Ghana, indicating spread of poliovirus from
Burkina Faso and possibly Ghana. These data suggest that independent
circulation of WPV might have been reestablished in Burkina Faso during
2003 and early 2004.
Among the 63 patients with WPV, 13 percent were aged less than 12 months,
21 percent were aged 12-23 months, 49 percent were aged 24-59 months, and
17 percent were aged >59 months. Of the 52 patients with known vaccination
status, 16 (31 percent) had never received OPV, 26 (50 percent) had
received 1--2 OPV doses, and 10 (19 percent) had received greater than 3
OPV doses.
Response to WPV Importation
Investigations were initiated within 2 days of identifying the index
patients in 4 of the 8 countries (median: 4 days; range: 1-22 days).
Clinical and epidemiologic information was verified, stool specimens were
collected from immediate contacts, and the search for unreported AFP cases
was intensified. 2 of the 8 index patients in the 8 countries had traveled
recently to a country with endemic polio, whereas the remaining 6 patients
had no relevant travel history or immediate contact with persons who
traveled to a country where polio is endemic. All index patients lived near
commercial centers with substantial foreign trade with countries where
polio is endemic.
All 8 countries implemented SIAs in response to detection of imported WPV.
The median duration from onset of paralysis to the start of SIAs was 12.5
weeks (range: 6-17 weeks). The magnitude of the response varied; 4
countries conducted NIDs, 2 countries conducted subnational immunization
days***** (SNIDs), and 2 countries conducted both SNIDs and NIDs. These
campaigns provided approximately 21.7 million children aged less than 5
years with greater than 2 doses of OPV.
Reported vaccination coverage exceeded 90 percent for all SIAs conducted;
reported coverage at district level ranged from 48 percent to greater than
100 percent. To determine the proportion of previously unvaccinated
children, caregivers were asked whether their children were receiving OPV
for the 1st time during the campaign. The Central African Republic (4
percent) and CÃ´te d'Ivoire (8 percent) were the only countries reporting
that greater than 4 percent of children received their 1st dose of OPV
during the most recent campaigns.
4 of the 8 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Ghana) detected WPV
after at least 2 rounds of SIAs. The most recent WPV patient in Burkina
Faso had onset in January 2004; 2 rounds of NIDs were then conducted in
February and March 2004. The 4 WPV cases in Chad in 2004 were detected in
provinces that had conducted at least 2 rounds of SNIDs in November and
December 2003 and in January 2004; 2 rounds of NIDs were conducted in March
and May 2004 after onset of these cases. The most recent WPV patient in
Ghana had onset in September 2003 after 2 SNIDs in June and July 2003;
since the most recent case, 4 rounds of NIDs were conducted (in October and
December 2003 and February and March 2004).

MMWR Editorial Note:
During 1999--2000, West and Central African countries began intensifying
and synchronizing NIDs, leading to a decrease in the number of countries
with endemic WPV from 13 in 1999 to one in 2001 (4). During January
2003--March 2004, 8 previously polio-free countries reported WPV
importations from endemic poliovirus reservoirs shared by northern Nigeria
and southern Niger, which were largely a result of suspension of
immunization campaigns in certain northern states of Nigeria in August 2003
(3). Many of these countries had continued transmission after importation
because of low routine vaccination coverage, increased intervals between
SIAs, and possibly declining quality of SIAs. The importations and spread
highlight the increased vulnerability of countries with low routine
vaccination coverage that are no longer conducting SIAs.
Preparedness for response to WPV importation should be strengthened in West
and Central African countries, which will continue to be at risk until WPV
transmission in Nigeria and Niger is interrupted. According to WHO
recommendations, greater than 80 percent of all outbreaks should be
investigated within 48 hours of their notification. However, only 4 (50
percent) of the outbreaks during 2003-2004 were investigated within the
recommended period. In addition, WHO recommends that outbreak response
vaccination occur within 4 weeks after confirmation of WPV; this was
achieved in only one (13 percent) of the 8 countries.
4 (50 percent) of the 8 countries had continued transmission of WPV after
completing 2 rounds of SIAs, indicating suboptimal quality of campaigns
despite reported high coverage. The main challenges faced in implementing
high-quality SIAs included 1) delayed provision of funds to support
detailed planning aimed at vaccinating every eligible child, 2) gaps in
supervision by national and subnational authorities, 3) lack of
consistently effective social mobilization, and 4) inadequate commitment to
conducting successful campaigns. The quality of SIAs has been improved in
certain countries through enhanced political commitment and strengthened
monitoring. In addition, experience was gained from the response to the
importations during 2003-2004. This will lead to improved planning and more
rapid implementation of high-quality SIAs during 2004-2005, an essential
step to achieving eradication.
Ongoing transmission in Nigeria and Niger has set back the goal to
interrupt poliovirus transmission in Africa by the end of 2004 (3). To
restore gains made in polio eradication in West and Central Africa, WPV
transmission must be interrupted in Nigeria and Niger. Until that time,
neighboring countries must create a population immunity barrier by
implementing high routine vaccination coverage and high-quality SIAs. In
2002, these steps proved successful in preventing importation of WPV into
Bangladesh and Nepal during resurgence of polio in India. Surveillance
standards also must be maintained to ensure rapid detection of any WPV
importation, allowing for timely response and containment.

[In addition to the importations of wild poliovirus genetically similar to
that currently circulating in Nigeria that result in 63 cases in West and
Central Africa, there has also been the importation of a genetically
similar wild poliovirus into Botswana (see Poliomyelitis - Botswana ex
Nigeria 20040415.1026). The recent reports of additional AFP cases in
Botswana (see Poliomyelitis - Botswana 20040524.1389) may also be
indicative of spread of wild poliovirus. Of note, while investigations in
Botswana did not identify known travel to Nigeria or contact with recent
travelers to Nigeria as a possible source of the importation, there is no
mention of possible contact with travellers to other countries in West and
Central Africa where other genetically similar wild polioviruses have been
isolated. Clearly the ongoing transmission of wild poliovirus in the
region is of concern to the bigger picture of achieving the international
goal of interrupting poliovirus transmission by 2005. - Mod.MPP]
