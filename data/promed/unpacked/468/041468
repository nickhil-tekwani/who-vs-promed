Kiwifruit-killing fungus rampant in Brazil
------------------------------------------
Kiwifruit vines [in Brazil] are dying within 3 days of showing signs of infection from _Ceratocystis fimbriata_. The fungus is decimating vines in the south of the country.

New Zealand industry representatives have travelled to Brazil to investigate. Barry O'Neil says, "It's a fungus that is quite common around the world, and one of our concerns was [that] a form of this fungus exists in New Zealand causing black spot in kumara [sweet potato] for many years." The representatives wanted to identify whether or not the fungus killing the vines in Brazil is the same as the New Zealand fungus, and what's being done to try to counter it.

Some orchards in Brazil have lost up to half their vines, and no successful way to control the disease has been found. "It kills the complete vine, and it kills it very quickly -- within 3 days the vine has gone from healthy to a totally collapsed vine," Dr O'Neil says.

He says the industry will continue looking at the genome of the Brazilian fungus to see how similar it is to New Zealand's strain. A full literature review is being commissioned and the industry is also considering sending a scientist to Brazil to work with scientists there.

[_Ceratocystis fimbriata_ (C.f.) is currently considered a fungal species complex. The different species/strains cause wilts and cankers on many woody hosts, including important crop and forest species, but vary in host specificity. They are soil borne and also spread by water, mechanical means (for example on pruning tools) and with planting material (cuttings, seedlings). Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts.

Ceratocystis wilt of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species) was first recognized in 2010 in Brazil as a new disease of the crop. Symptoms may include wilting and necrosis of leaves, reddish-brown discolouration of xylem, and reduced number of harvestable fruit. Most affected plants eventually die. The disease has devastated the small-scale kiwifruit industry in the country.

Members of the C.f. complex were known to exist previously in Brazil, for example on cocoa and eucalypts, but it is not clear whether one of these pathogens has spread to kiwifruit or if the new disease is caused by a new strain or species.

Disease management of soil borne fungi may include phytosanitary measures, crop rotation, and use of certified disease-free planting material. Fungicides are generally not very effective, but may be helpful as treatments for seedlings or scions before release. Genetic resistance is considered the best means of control, but kiwifruit varieties still need to be assessed for possible resistance to the new disease.
