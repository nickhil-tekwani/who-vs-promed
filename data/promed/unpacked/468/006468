https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=119ed0ab72

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 11 Jun 2018:
- a total of 59 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 7 suspected;
- 4 new suspected cases, including 1 in Bikoro, 2 in Iboko, and 1 Wangata;
- no new cases confirmed;
- no new deaths reported [to date total of 28 deaths; 14 of them among the confirmed cases].

Epidemiological analyses have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
- Vaccination
Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 2507 people have been vaccinated, including 753 in Mbandaka, 561 in Bikoro, 1163 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.

- Pan-African collaboration
On [Tue 12 Jun 2018], the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, met with his counterparts from the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic during a teleconference from Kinshasa Emergency Operations Center.

The teleconference aimed to take stock of the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo, share the country's experience in managing Ebola outbreaks, and address the concerns of health authorities in neighboring countries. In addition, the 3 ministers of health also discussed the issue of cross-border collaboration and agreed that it was important to hold meetings between their respective technical teams more regularly.

Health ministers plan to hold a regional workshop on cross-border contingency plan to be complemented by full-scale simulation exercise of cross-border response.

1. Situation update
-------------------
Grade 3; cases: 55, deaths: 28; CFR: 50.9 percent
The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains active. One month into the response, there is cautious optimism about the situation in Bikoro and Wangata (especially Mbandaka) health zones where the last confirmed EVD case was reported on 16 May 2018. The primary focus of the response has moved from the urban areas of Equateur province to the most remote and hard-to-reach places in Itipo and the greater Iboko Health Zone.

On 10 Jun 2018, 2 new suspected EVD cases were reported in Iboko Health Zone. 13 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. No new confirmed EVD cases and no new deaths have been reported on the reporting date. Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case was reported in Iboko Health Zone on 2 Jun 2018.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 55 EVD cases and 28 deaths (case fatality rate 50.9 percent) have been reported, as of 10 Jun 2018. Of the 55 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed, 14 are probable (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing), and 3 are suspected. Of the confirmed and probable cases, 27 (52 percent) are from Iboko, followed by 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro and four (8 percent) from Wangata health zones. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The outbreak has remained localised to the 3 health zones initially affected: Iboko (24 confirmed cases, 3 probable, 2 suspected, 7 deaths), Bikoro (10 confirmed cases, 11 probable, 1 suspected, 18 deaths), and Wangata (4 confirmed cases, 3 deaths). The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing with many completing the required follow-up period. As of 10 Jun 2018, a total of 634 contacts were under follow up, of which 633 (99.8 percent) were reached on the reporting date.

Context
-------
On 8 May 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo notified WHO of an EVD outbreak in Bikoro Health Zone, Equateur Province. The event was initially reported on 3 May 2018 by the Provincial Health Division of Equateur when a cluster of 21 cases of an undiagnosed illness, involving 17 community deaths, occurred in Ikoko-Impenge health area. A team from the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), visited Ikoko-Impenge health area on 5 May 2018 and found 5 case-patients, 2 of whom were admitted in Bikoro General Hospital and 3 were in the health centre in Ikoko-Impenge. Samples were taken from each of the 5 cases and sent for analysis at the Institute National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB), Kinshasa on 6 May 2018. Of these, 2 tested positive for Ebola virus, _Zaire ebolavirus_ species, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 7 May 2018, and the outbreak was officially declared on 8 May 2018. The index case in this outbreak has not yet been identified and epidemiologic investigations are ongoing, including laboratory testing.

This is the 9th EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the last 4 decades, with the most recent one occurring in May 2017.

Current risk assessment
-----------------------
WHO considers the public health risk to be very high at the national level due to the serious nature of the disease, insufficient epidemiological information and the delay in the detection of initial cases, which makes it difficult to assess the magnitude and geographical extent of the outbreak. The confirmed case in Mbandaka, a large urban centre located on a major national and international river, with road and air transport access, increases the risk both of local propagation and further spread within Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The risk at the regional level is therefore considered high. At global level, the risk is currently considered low.

The IHR Emergency Committee met on [Fri 18 May 2018] and concluded that the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) had not been met. However, if the outbreak expands significantly, or if there is international spread, the Emergency Committee will be reconvened to re-evaluate the situation.

The risk assessment will be re-evaluated by the 3 levels of WHO according to the evolution of the situation

Strategic approach to the prevention, detection and control of EVD
------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO recommends the implementation of proven strategies for the prevention and control of Ebola outbreaks. These include (i) strengthening the multisectoral coordination of the response, (ii) enhanced surveillance, including active case finding, case investigation, contact tracing, and surveillance at points of entry (PoE), (iii) strengthening diagnostic capabilities, (iv) case management, (v) infection prevention and control in health facilities and communities, including safe and dignified burials, (vi) risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, (vii) psychosocial care, (viii) immunization of risk groups and research response, and (ix) operational support and logistics.

2. Actions to date
------------------
Coordination of the response:
- On 11 Jun 2018, the WHO Director General (DG) and the Minister of Health visited Itipo health area (the remaining hotspot with active transmission) in Iboko Health Zone to conduct on the spot assessment and support response operations. The DG and the Minister of Health met the local coordination commission and the National Association of Ebola Winners (people who were cured). The mission also visited the newly established Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Itipo.
- Daily coordination meetings continue at the national, sub-national, and local levels to review the evolution of the outbreak, identify gaps in the response and propose key actions to accelerate the implementation of public health measures.
- As of 11 Jun 2018, WHO has deployed a total of 271 technical experts in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the EVD outbreak.
- WHO continues to conduct daily IMS team meetings and hold 3-level conference calls to review response operations and support field teams.
Surveillance
- Active surveillance activities are ongoing, including active case search at community and health facility levels, real-time investigation of suspected cases and alerts, and collection of specimens for laboratory confirmation and/or exclusion. Rigorous contact tracing activities continue in all areas.
- The Ministry of Health, with the support of WHO, CDC, Epicentre and other partners, continue to maintain an up-to-date EVD outbreak database, including line lists, contact lists, etc.

Laboratory:
- A full mobile laboratory was deployed to Bikoro Reference Hospital on 12 May 2018 and was fully operational by 16 May 2018. A 2nd mobile laboratory is active in Mbandaka and a 3rd one in Itipo since 30 May 2018.
- A National Laboratory Strategy has been developed, focusing on GeneXpert for confirmatory testing in key sites such as Ebola Treatment Centres (ETC). GeneXpert is now fully functional in Bikoro Health Zone and Mbandaka.
- Additional GeneXpert machines are being sent to the affected areas.

Case management:
- MSF has set up ETCs in Mbandaka and Bikoro, while 2 other ETCs are being set up in Iboko (MSF) and Itipo (ALIMA/Alliance for International Medical Action).
- WHO is providing technical advice on the use of investigational therapeutics under the monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework and provision of essential medical supplies. 4 of the 5 investigational therapeutics are in-country and all protocols have been approved by the Ethics Review Board (ERB). This is the 1st time such treatments have been available during an Ebola outbreak. Clinicians working in the treatment centres will make decisions on which drug will be most helpful to their patients, and appropriate for the setting. The treatments can be used as long as informed consent is obtained from patients and protocols are followed, with close monitoring and reporting of any adverse events. 4 of the 5 approved drugs are currently in the country. They are Zmapp, GS-5734, REGN monoclonal antibody combination, and mAb114.

Infection prevention and control and water, sanitation, and hygiene (IPC and WASH):
- Infection prevention and control supplies, including personal protective equipment and disinfectants, have been provided to health facilities in 8 health areas, namely: Mapeke, Bokongo, Itipo, Londo, Bokando-Bouna, Mpangi, Lokango, Boutela.
- A comprehensive triage plan for health facilities in Itipo health area has been developed. Red Cross is finalizing rehabilitation of an operational base for dignified and safe burials in Bikoro.
- There is continued support from MSF and the Congolese Red Cross in the organization of safe and dignified burials.

Implementation of ring vaccination protocol:
Since the launch of the vaccination exercise on 21 May 2018, a total of 2295 people have been vaccinated in Wangata (713), Iboko (1054), and Bikoro (498), as of 10 Jun 2018. The targets for vaccination are front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed EVD cases and contacts of these contacts.

Risk communication, social mobilization and risk communication:
- In Mbandaka, 65 women leaders including women's groups, women army officers and wives of military men were trained to support EVD social mobilization activities.
- Ongoing risk communication and social mobilization activities include:
mass awareness campaign through television, radio, and social mobilization teams going to communities; training response teams in the communities; training local journalists; meeting with local leaders

Logistics:
- WHO provided 4 ambulances to facilitate referral of patients, which were deployed in Mbandaka (3) and Kinshasa (1). 3 additional utility vehicles have been provided to support activities in Kinshasa.
- MONUSCO [UN Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo] has set up tents to accommodate responders in Iboko to address the acute shortage of accommodation in the area.

Resource mobilization:
- WHO's rapid response and initial scale up of operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been funded by a USD 4 million disbursement from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE).
- WHO and partners are appealing for rapid funding of USD 57 million for the current response to rapidly stop the spread of EVD. The amount of funding needed for the overall Ebola Strategic Response Plan has increased from USD 26 million to USD 57 million, based on the new planning assumption and requirements following the spread of the disease to Mbandaka (an urban area on a major transport route), the increased needs for community engagement, expanded number of contacts to be traced and followed up, and increased number of points of entry (PoE) (airports and water/land points) to be monitored.
- Funding towards the strategic response has been provided to WHO from Italy (Euro 300 000/about USD 350 000), CERF [Central Emergency Response Fund] (USD 800 000), GAVI (USD 1 million), USAID (USD 5.3 million), Wellcome Trust and UK DFID [Department for International Development] (USD 4.1 million), UK-DFID (GBP 5 million/about USD 6.7 million), Germany (Euro 5 million/about USD 5.9 million), Norway (Krone 8 million/about USD 100 000), Canada (CAD 1 million/about USD 770 000), World Bank PEF [Pandemic Emergency Financing] (USD 6.8 million) bringing the total to around [USD 32 million].
- Germany's contribution is in recognition of the critical role the WHO CFE [Contingency Fund for Emergencies] has played in responding to the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and will go to replenish the CFE, which has so far provided USD 4 million to Ebola response efforts.
- In-kind contributions for medevac have been received from Norway and EU ECHO [European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations] for flights between Kinshasa and Mbandaka. Technical expertise has been provided by Guinea, the UK, and Germany through the GOARN [Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network] network.
- Firm pledges to the overall Ebola response have been received from ECHO, Ebola MPTF [UN Ebola Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund], and the African Development Bank.
- There is a growing need to support operational readiness for PoEs in surrounding countries to prevent further spread and WHO has launched a Regional Strategic Plan for EVD Operational Readiness and Preparedness.

Preparedness:
WHO is supporting neighbouring countries to systematically assess and take action on Ebola preparedness, and to develop national contingency response plans. A regional readiness and preparedness plan has been developed and published, outlining activities to ensure that the 9 neighbouring countries can detect and contain Ebola should it be introduced. The regional readiness and preparedness plan requires USD 15.5 million.

Operations partnership:
GOARN Operational Support Team and the AFRO operational partnerships team continue to conduct twice weekly conference calls to share information and coordinate response actions of partners involved in the response.

IHR travel measures and cross border health:
- According to the advice of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee (EC), which was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, WHO currently advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, the EC advised that exit screening at airports and ports on the Congo River is considered to be of great importance to detect probable cases and to prevent the international spread of Ebola; however, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. The IHR EC advised that currently the outbreak does not meet the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, but the vigorous response of the Government should continue to be supported by the international community.
- WHO recommendations for international travellers related to EVD outbreak in DRC were published on 29 May 2018. In general the risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of infected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the average traveller. If symptoms consistent with Ebola disease develop, travellers should seek immediate medical attention (through specific hotline numbers). Travellers should be informed about where to obtain appropriate medical assistance at their destination and whom to inform should they become ill.
- There is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers should seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent travel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Information of close contacts of this person on board aircraft should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders at points of entry (such as airline reservation system) in order to undergo contact tracing.
- As the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers involved in caring for EVD patients or who suspect possible exposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning: 1) stay within reach of a good quality healthcare facility; 2) seek immediate medical attention (such as through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop EVD like symptoms.
- As of 12 Jun 2018, 26 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.
- In collaboration with WHO, IOM, Africa CDC, and other partners, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry, with the goal of avoiding the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the points of entry or congregation, including risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures.
- By 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/congregation had been listed and mapped along 3 cordon sanitaires [sanitary cordons] in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, Ntonde, Igende, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa/Kisangani). It is unrealistic and impractical to assume that proper screening can be conducted at all these points, and the efforts currently focus on the 30 prioritized points of entry/congregation. Further detail on this plan and implementation to date are available via the Disease Outbreak News webpage at http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/. Field exercises were also organized to identify key points of passage and congregation of travellers in Mbandaka as well as in Bikoro and its surroundings with participation of representatives from the population such as local authorities, police, church, trade. This work was facilitated by WHO and PNHF [National Programme of Hygiene at Borders] and with the support of IOM.
- Screening measures of persons departing or arriving from an affected area include travel health declaration to evaluate the risk of exposure to Ebola virus, visual observation for EVD like symptoms, temperature check and travel health promotion measures, as well as procedures for referral of suspect cases. Any person with an illness consistent with EVD is not allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation. Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria.
- As of 1 Jun 2018, no cases were detected at ports on the River Congo closed to Kinshasa (Muluku, Kinkole, Ngobila) as well as in the international and main national airports in Kinshasa (Ndili, Ndolo). As of 6 Jun 2018, 374 travellers were screened and sensitized to EVD in Bikoro, Ntondo, Ingende. As of 9 Jun 2018, 2707 persons were screened and sensitized to EVD in the key sites in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Ndonle, Ingende, and Irebu health zones.
- All 30 points of entry (ports and airports) and areas for congregation (parking, markets, churches, schools) are now assessed and gaps identified. On 6 Jun 2018, the sub-commission of surveillance at PoEs was established and meet daily. The focus of the group is to strengthen screening and sensitization capacity in the 30 prioritized PoEs and congregation sites: establish and disseminate procedures for surveillance (visual observation, screening of travellers, hand hygiene, risk communication); develop a training module for surveillance at PoEs for PNHF agents deployed and to be deployed; quantify gaps in terms of equipment and materials at each PoE; on 9 Jun 2018, a training of trainers took place in Kinshasa for PoEs with PNHF, IOM, WHO, CDC, and JICA [Japan International Cooperation Agency]

3. Summary of public health risks, needs, and gaps:
One month into the response, tremendous progress has been made in containing further spread of the EVD outbreak. Currently, active transmission is mainly taking place in the remote Itipo health area in Iboko Health Zone. The situation in Bikoro and Wangata (Mbandaka city) health zones is being cautiously monitored, with the last confirmed cases reported in mid-May 2018. Moving forward, the response is beginning to shift to a 2nd phase where the focus will be enhanced surveillance, including rapid case investigations of suspected EVD cases and alerts and thorough contact tracing in the remote areas. This will imply redeployment of field responders and response logistics.

[2] Status of outbreak
- 12 Jun 2018. Young Reporters of Bikoro are mobilizing against Ebola
[Ponabana, summ., edited]
http://ponabana.com/en/young-reporters-ebola/
[Byline: Christophe Yoka Nkumu Daddy]

On 8 May 2018, an Ebola epidemic was declared by the Minister of Health in Bikoro, a territory located at the heart of Equateur Province. To date, approximately 23 cases have been recorded in Bikoro, of which 18 resulted in the death of the patient. More than 250 people have been identified as having come into contact with them (directly or indirectly) and are under observation in Bikoro. ...

It was essential that the Young Reporters be briefed in the 1st few days so that they could mobilize without delay. Some children were a little reluctant... they knew nothing about Ebola, but after some explanation, fear gave way to motivation.

Raising awareness in schools is absolutely essential for combating the spread of the Ebola virus. The Young Reporters set up hand-washing stations and explained to the children the good practices that they should incorporate into their daily routines. In just a few days, 8 Young Reporters led awareness raising sessions with 2000 students in schools in the city of Bikoro! What's more, when one child speaks to another, we can be sure that the message will be understood and easily taken on board.

Children are discriminated against by other children at the school. I recall the example of one 12-year-old boy whose father was being treated at the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Bikoro is a small city, so when the school's management learnt that this boy's father was in the ETC, they decided that the boy would no longer be allowed to attend school. For more than 2 weeks, this 4th-year student had to stay at home. The Young Reporters then advocated for this discrimination against the boy to end and for him to be allowed to return to the classroom. All is well now for this boy. He is back at school and his father is out of the ETC.

For the moment, the awareness raising activities are only being run in primary schools, but I think that we should extend them to all schools. Ebola does not stop at the sixth year of primary school!

In addition to awareness raising activities in schools, we can also publicize our messages on a larger scale. Unfortunately, unlike in other districts, Bikoro does not have a community radio station through which to communicate good practices. That would be too easy. From one single location, we would be able to reach the most remote population without having to go there. As it is, how can we possibly cross hundreds of kilometres so that the Young Reporters can share their messages?

A community radio station would also enable us to publicize the International Convention on the Rights of the Child and raise people's awareness of the waterborne diseases that ravage our territory. We could easily talk about all this on the radio and reach populations that would ordinarily be inaccessible.

One thing which we had not considered: since the declaration of the Ebola epidemic in Bikoro, dozens and dozens of humanitarian workers have arrived on site. The result is that now we have difficulty accessing the internet... We would like to tell the outside world about the situation we face in Bikoro, but how can we do that if we cannot get online?

- 12 Jun 2018. Oxfam food support to Ebola effected areas
[UN OCHA, ReliefWeb/Oxfam report, summ., edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/oxfam-provides-desperately-needed-food-dr-congos-ebola-outbreak

Oxfam is distributing rice, beans and flour, to about 4525 people. It has already started in Mbandaka -- the Equateur province capital -- and plans to extend to rural communities. This is in addition providing clean water and working with communities to ensure they know how to protect themselves against the virus and prevent its spread.

The outbreak has reduced trade between rural areas such as Bikoro and Iboko, the places worst affected, and Mbandaka. Many people depend on this trade for food and other essentials. Households that have been in contact with a sick person have to rely on assistance because they are asked to stay in doors and avoid going out for 3 weeks, making it impossible to find food.

Jose Barahona, the Oxfam Country Director for Democratic Republic of Congo, said: "Getting food to families who have been in contact with sick people is vital to allow them to eat while protecting others from the disease. Failing to provide food means they need to get out to the market, potentially infecting other people. In the past weeks the increase of cases has slowed down thanks to joint efforts by the Government and aid agencies. But there are well over 50 cases of Ebola and that's far too many. ...

"We need to prepare a post-Ebola response, including helping people earn a living and providing clean water and sanitation. Oxfam's work should not stop when the outbreak has ended. ...

Notes to editors:
Oxfam is providing door-to-door information to the most vulnerable people, working with communities, and carrying out mass awareness activities including film screenings and working with local community radio stations.

Oxfam is also installing chlorinated water points in hospitals, health centres, schools, and ports, and helping to disinfect houses in which Ebola cases have been detected. It also provides disinfection kits and hygiene kits to communities.

[3] Research
- 12 Jun 2018. Experimental drug trials
[The Independent, Bloomberg report, edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/new-ebola-outbreak-may-open-door-to-finding-drugs-that-work-a8388341.html
[Byline: Marthe Fourcade, Naomi Kresge]

As another outbreak of Ebola claims lives in central Africa, researchers are seeing within it a rare ray of hope: a chance to find a cure.

For the 1st time, 5 experimental medicines are poised to undergo a real-life clinical trial against the virus at makeshift treatment centres in remote areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where most of the 59 new cases originated. The country's health ministry cleared all the treatments for use as of last week [week of 4 Jun 2018].

Hundreds of vials of drugs in development by Gilead Sciences Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and others are on their way or in place. Some have only been tested on animals and a handful of healthy volunteers, and none have been proven to work against the severe viral disease in a standard clinical test. Now, scientists are seeking a way to offer compassionate treatment for patients with few options while doing painstaking data collection to evaluate the drugs.

Health officials have already begun using an experimental vaccine, donated by US drugmaker Merck, in hopes it will protect people who may have been exposed to infection. The efforts could yield the 1st-ever weapons against a disease that has no cure and kills about half of the people it infects. At least 27 deaths have been confirmed from this outbreak.

"There's a consensus that we really need to move forward," says Vasee Moorthy, an infectious diseases doctor at the World Health Organisation (WHO) who coordinated vaccine research during the last Ebola epidemic. "We hope that by the end of this outbreak we gradually have more information about which drugs provide benefits to patients."

The obstacles are steep. Normally, researchers test an individual drug against a placebo, but they'd forego it in this case for ethical reasons. They must also devise a way to randomly assign patients to various treatment groups while taking into account individual medical needs and watching for side effects.

Carrying out a trial that pits multiple untested medicines against one another would be challenging in the best of conditions. This one would take place in an impoverished, equatorial nation of 78 million that is home to the river that gave Ebola its name and much of the world's 2nd-largest tropical forest.

Drugs will need to be shipped by riverboat, on unpaved roads or by helicopter to overcome a lack of infrastructure inland. Some must be kept cold in the hot, humid climate. "This is no simple piece of work," Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said at a briefing in Geneva last week [8 Jun 2018]. "But if we don't learn now, then we'll never know which are the better drugs to use."

One of the medicines, called ZMapp, has been through another potential pitfall of testing experimental treatments during a public-health crisis. Because it was only tried toward the end of the last Ebola outbreak -- just as international aid agencies were getting the contagion under control -- it wasn't given to enough patients to reach conclusive results. That epidemic, the largest in the disease's history, ended in 2016 after killing more than 11 000 people in West Africa.

Still, the drug showed promise. 8 of 36 people who took it died, compared with 13 of 35 who had standard care alone. Larry Zeitlin, president of closely held Mapp Biopharmaceutical, which developed the treatment with the US and Canadian governments, says the need for clinical data must not eclipse treatment priorities.

Another 3 medicines found suitable by a group of independent experts assembled by the WHO and cleared by the DRC's health ministry are Gilead's antiviral remdesivir; a Regeneron cocktail of 3 monoclonal antibodies known as REGN-EB3 that has only been tested in healthy people; and the antiviral favipiravir, made by Japan's FujiFilm Corp., that's already sold to treat influenza and was used in the West African outbreak.

Gilead shipped 360 doses of remdesivir to the DRC on [28 May 2018]. The intravenous drug, which requires monitoring of liver and kidney function, has been used just twice in Ebola patients, and Gilead is testing its safety in healthy volunteers. Regeneron completed a single test of its drug in healthy patients last year and hasn't published the results. Gilead says the DRC's Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa would distribute its drug for emergency treatment.

Another experimental treatment, an antibody against Ebola isolated from a survivor of the 1995 outbreak in the DRC and developed by scientists at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also approved for use.

Clinicians will evaluate patients on a case-by-case basis to determine their eligibility for receiving the drug candidates, says Jess Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the DRC's health ministry. Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups with emergency facilities will likely handle treatment. The DRC's national research institute will help collect and collate the data, backed by the WHO, and drugmakers are supplying their treatments for free, according to Moorthy.

- 12 Jun 2018. Unusual uses of off-label drugs
[Popular Science, summ., edited]

[Byline: Anna Brooks]

On [4 Jun 2018], an ethics committee in the Democratic Republic of the Congo approved the use of favipiravir, a drug originally developed by a pharmaceutical company in Japan to fight influenza, for treating Ebola patients. The experimental therapy comes too late for the 11 000 people killed during the last major outbreak of the virus, which swept West Africa in 2014. But after evaluation by the World Health Organization (WHO), favipiravir and 4 other experimental drugs that showed promise in animal models are now being administered to Ebola patients in the Congo, where the disease emerged in early May.

"This is the 1st time such treatments are available in the midst of an Ebola outbreak," says WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. "Under normal circumstances, such interventions undergo testing in clinical trials that are capable of generating reliable evidence about safety and efficacy," Jasarevic says. "However, in the context of an outbreak characterized by high mortality, it can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients investigational interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials."

So how could a drug used for the flu potentially treat a rare and deadly disease like Ebola? Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that possesses the unique ability to prevent RNA-based viruses, like Ebola and influenza, from replicating. Viruses are made up of either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid). The ability to rapidly reproduce and mutate at a high rate is what makes RNA-based viruses both so deadly, and so difficult to treat.

Animal studies suggest the drug has a high level of resistance to the Ebola virus. While there's no conclusive evidence yet that favipiravir will be the magic pill that ends Ebola, there was a case study during the last outbreak of a French nurse successfully treated using a number of experimental drugs, including favipiravir.

Using a drug approved for one ailment (like the flu) to treat another (Ebola) is known as off-labelling. ...
