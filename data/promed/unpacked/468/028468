The 2 latest confirmed cases of human bird flu in Thailand might be
[the result of] human-to-human transmission, a senior health official
has said. Dr Charoen Chuchottaworn, an avian influenza expert at the
Public Health Ministry's Department of Medical Services, said doctors
concluded after reviewing the history of the past 2 cases that both
victims presented very mild symptoms of avian influenza and neither
had any physical contact with chickens or birds.
One of the victims was a boy in Bangkok and the other was an
18-year-old man from Nonthaburi province, The "Nation" newspaper
reported on Fri 2 Dec 2005.
This left doctors no clues as to where the patients became infected
with the H5N1 virus and showed that avian influenza had moved from
causing severe human infection to milder cases.
Charoen, who is also a member of the National Committee issuing
guidelines for the treatment of avian influenza, made the remarks on
Thu 1 Dec 2005 at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting
2005 in Bangkok. Dr Kamnuan Ungchusak, Director of the Epidemiology
Bureau, challenged Charoen's assertion about human-to-human transmissions.
He told The Nation newspaper that while neither of the patients had
direct contact with chickens, they lived in an environment where the
virus was prevalent. "Chickens were dying near their homes and
chicken droppings were everywhere around their neighborhood," he
said. "They might have contracted the virus through contaminated soil."
Dr Charoen said the milder the symptoms, the harder it is for doctors
to diagnose infection. This means that a lot more advanced laboratory
facilities are needed with a testing technique called RT-PCR to
confirm cases and decide if patients should be treated with the
antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate). He said this meant that
avian influenza could become asymptomatic now. The only tool
[Tamiflu] available in Thailand to fight H5N1 infections at the
moment is insufficient, he said. At present, Thailand has about one
million capsules for 100 000 treatments of Tamiflu, but it is
estimated that about 120 million capsules of the drug will be needed.
Only severe cases of human bird flu have previously been detected in
Thailand simply because patients went to hospital for treatment. But
doctors believe that there have been many cases with mild symptoms of
the disease. "We believe that this is the tip of the iceberg," he
said. Signs of possible human-to-human transmission were closely
observed in Vietnam, where 10 clusters of probable human
transmissions were detected in which the victims had no contact with
infected poultry, Charoen said. Thailand and Indonesia had one
official cluster, he said, but the Indonesian cluster showed
clear-cut evidence because a child contracted H5N1 without going to
an infected area, as her father had.

[No human cases of avian influenza had been reported from Thailand
for more than one year before mid-October 2005. It is not clear from
the text of this report whether the 2 cases described above are new
cases or are 2 of the 4 cases previously described since mid-October.
The mildness of the 2 cases described above may be significant, in
that asymptomatic human cases could have gone undetected in the
intervening period. This situation further emphasizes the need for
comprehensive serological surveys of the general population in East
Asian countries.
From an analysis of a cluster of 3 cases in the same family in 2004,
it was concluded previously that person-to-person transmission may
have occurred in Thailand at an earlier phase of the outbreak. 2
family members (a mother and an aunt) appeared to have contracted
infection from a critically ill index patient, but onward
transmission was not observed (see: Avian influenza, human - East
Asia (18): Thailand 20050124.0258).
The recent identification of 2 unrelated avian influenza cases
without known contact with poultry may not be an indication of
imminent widespread person-to-person transmission of avian influenza
virus in Thailand. The alternative view is that there may be
significant environmental contamination with virus where there are
high numbers of poultry in the vicinity. The available information
does not allow firm conclusions about the source of the virus. - Mods.MPP/CP]
