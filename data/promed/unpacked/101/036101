The Federal Government has announced that wheat streak mosaic virus
is too widespread and well-established to be eradicated. Federal
Agriculture Minister Warren Truss says a meeting of the National
Disease Management Group has determined the cost of eradication will
far exceed the benefits.
Mr Truss says the virus is now confirmed at more than 30 sites and he
expects this number to continue to grow as more tests results come in.
Each state should decide the best way to manage the disease, but
growers should continue with business as usual. Truss told farmers to
plant their crops as usual because there is little else that can be
done.
An economic study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics (ABARE) concluded that the costs of eradicating
WSMV were many times the likely benefit.
Grains Council of Australia president Keith Perrett, disappointed by
the news that WSMV could not be eradicated, says the industry needs
to accept that the virus is here to stay and [that] growers will need
information about how to minimise any impact.
A spokesman for the Australian Wheat Board Ltd. does not expect the
announcement to have any impact on overseas sales.

[The decision taken by the National Disease Management Group to take
no further action regarding eradication of WSMV in Australia is the
only one that makes sense. Farmers in North America learned long ago
that they have to live with the disease. Disease management relies
heavily on removing volunteer host plants during autumn so as to
prevent survival of _Aceria tosichella_, the wheat curl mite, which
transmits WSMV. - Mod.DH]
