A Mexican farm official denied Tuesday [27 Sep 2005] Japan's suspicion that
illegal bird flu vaccines from Mexico may have been linked to recent
outbreaks of avian influenza in Japan.
"No one has virus to produce vaccine besides those we preserve in this
office," Jose del Valle, general director in charge of animal health at the
Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry, said. He indicated the ministry has
strict control over production of vaccines, saying, "We have registered who
produced vaccines, and all viruses used to produce vaccines in this country
are property of the government."

[The Mexican observation is related to data included in posting
20050925.2821, quoting the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun of 9 Sep 2005,
which said: The Japanese government decided to ask Mexico to provide
information of unauthorized vaccine.
Previously, officials of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries expressed suspicions that there was "a strong possibility that
the infection was caused by the use of an unauthorized and defective
vaccine that contained an active virus".
The source of the vaccine virus, if eventually incriminated as the cause of
the recent/current H5N2 outbreak in Ibaraki, might be revealed if/when the
sequencing of the virus is accomplished. It will then remain to discover
the manufacturer and distributor of a vaccine which included a live
(attenuated?) H5N2 virus.
Control of production, testing, and distribution of animal vaccines is an
essential part of animal disease control programmes; governments are
responsible for their approval and certification. Chapter 1.5.2. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code deals with risk analysis for veterinary
vaccines. The specific requirements for each vaccine are laid down in OIE's
Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. A new
version of chapter 2.7.12 thereof, dealing with avian influenza, was
adopted by the General Session in May 2005; see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00037.htm>.
Japan experienced a similar situation in August 2004, when the Ministry of
Agriculture discovered that an outbreak of classical swine fever in
Kagoshima Prefecture had been caused by an unauthorized vaccine.
In view of the vital role vaccines play in disease control and the risks
related to the use of unauthorised vaccines, intensification of law
enforcement, coordinated internationally, deserves prioritisation. - Mod.AS]
