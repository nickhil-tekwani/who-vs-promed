The former Congress Minister B Shivaram has appealed to the Union
Government to set up a Potato Research Centre in Hassan [state of
Karnataka] on the lines of the one in Shimla.

Addressing the press, Mr Shivaram said that potato crop on over 37
000 hectares (91 400 acres) of land in Hassan district had withered
owing to blight disease. Poor quality of seed potatoes supplied by
traders had to be blamed for the situation, he said.

If the centre was set up in Hassan, awareness could be created among
farmers on prevention of such diseases and they could be supplied
with quality seed potatoes.

Potato farmers warned of late blight threat
-------------------------------------------
New Brunswick potato growers are battling a fungus striking the
provincial potato crop due to steady rains and humidity throughout
July [2008]. The good news is there are ways to battle late blight
and salvage the crop, but it takes vigilant spraying and good
sanitation techniques.

Provincial potato pathologist Dr Khalil Al-Mughrabi said late blight,
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, is the same disease
that spawned the great Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s. Due to
scientific advances, however, there are plenty of tools in a farmer's
arsenal to combat the disease that attacks the roots, the leaves, and
even the tubers of the potato plant, Al- Mughrabi said.

"If leaves are not protected and the (air-borne) fungus lands on
these leaves and starts forming lesions, without the fungicide these
lesions can expand and kill the leaves ... and the spores can wash
down those leaves and go to the tuber and ... the tuber can rot in
the ground," Al-Mughrabi said. "Most of our growers have the
expertise to protect their crop against this from happening."

Al-Mughrabi said he has issued an official warning to the province's
200 or so potato producers that late blight is striking the fields,
not only in New Brunswick but in Maine [USA] and Prince Edward Island
as well.

Spraying potatoes is essential to control it, but with all the rain,
spray can wash off, although Al-Mughrabi said there are newer
"designer" fungicides that will still protect potatoes if some of the
spray is washed into the soil. Late blight will also damage tomatoes,
peppers, eggplant, petunias, bitter sweet, and hairy nightshade.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is spread by plant
material (including seed tubers), wind, and water. Solanaceous weeds
can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria often
invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber breakdown.
Disease management includes preventative fungicide treatment of seed
tubers and additional fungicide applications to the crop. In India,
infected seed potatoes are often a problem, and cultivars with
reduced sensitivity to PLB are being developed and distributed for
national use.

PLB is considered an increasing threat worldwide because new and even
more virulent pathogen strains continue to emerge. For more
information on PLB see links and previous posts below.
