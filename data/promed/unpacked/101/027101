Japan: Hepatitis E Virus Infection Associated with Wild Boar Barbecue
---------------------------------------------------
11 elderly men have been infected with hepatitis-E virus after eating wild
boar meat at a barbecue party in Nagasaki Prefecture 14 months ago, a
taxpayer-funded hospital here said today [Thu 13 May 2004]. This is the 1st
time it has been confirmed that more than 10 people had contracted
hepatitis-E virus from the same source.

Doctors suspect the 11 men may have either eaten meat that had not been
grilled thoroughly enough to kill the virus or used chopsticks that had
touched raw meat. "Since hepatitis E virus is similar to hepatitis A virus,
the virus is generally killed if sufficiently heated. I urge people to be
careful when handling raw meat," Koji Yano, a doctor at the National
Nagasaki Medical Center in Omura, said. [Hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E
virus are enteric viruses with similar routes of transmission and tissue
tropism. They are not phylogenetically related, however: Hepatitis A virus
is classified in the genus _Hepatovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_,
whereas Hepatitis E virus is more calicivurus-like but is now classified in
the unassigned genus _Hepevirus_. - Mod.CP]

13 men aged between 64 and 82 held a barbecue party in Nagasaki Prefecture
in March last year [2003] using meat from a wild boar they had caught,
according to Yano. 2 of the men, both aged 69, showed symptoms of acute
hepatitis, such as lethargy and jaundice, in late April [2003], and
underwent a medical check-up at a hospital. The doctor who examined the 2
suspected that they may have contracted hepatitis from the wild boar and
notified the medical center. The center detected hepatitis-E virus in their
blood samples. Noting that the genes of the virus in the 2 samples were
almost identical, doctors said the 2 men were infected from the same
source. The medical center managed to conduct tests on 10 of 11 other men
who had attended the party, and found 3 of them showed symptoms of acute
hepatitis while 6 others had contracted the virus.

Infection with hepatitis-E virus has occurred occasionally throughout the
country on a smaller scale. In March 2003, 2 people living in Tottori
Prefecture suffered from hepatitis-E after eating the raw liver of a wild
boar, and one of them died later [see ProMED-mail post: "Hepatitis E virus,

[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is globally distributed and is transmitted
enterically as well as between humans and animals. Phylogenetic analysis
has identified 5 distinct HEV genotypes (types III and V have been
confirmed as present in Japan). In developing countries HEV is transmitted
principally by the fecal-oral route, and water-borne epidemics are common.
In industrialized countries zoonotic transmission may be more usual.
Sporadic cases of hepatitis E have been reported in Japan in the past, and
widespread infection of HEV has been reported among wild rats in different
parts of the country. Zoonotic spread of HEV is indicated by the fact that
human and swine isolates of HEV are closely similar in terms of nucleotide
sequence, and experimental cross-species transmission of swine HEV to a
chimpanzee and of human HEV to swine have been demonstrated. The genetic
relatedness of Japanese human and swine HEV strains, and the possible modes
of HEV transmission -- one of which is described above -- indicates that
HEV should be considered in the diagnosis of acute or fulminant hepatitis
of non-A, non-B, non-C etiology, even in Japanese patients who have not
traveled abroad. A recent survey suggests that generally 15.4 percent of
Japanese patients with liver diseases had a history of HEV infection. - Mod.CP]
