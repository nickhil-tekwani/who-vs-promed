MALARIA EPIDEMIC CONTROL: REQUEST FOR INFO

From: Ricki Orford <orford@safrimal.org>

I'm hoping all you out there can help me. Have any of you experience
working with severe malaria epidemics? It could be at any level and in
any
capacity but the situation must have been one greater than the normal
seasonal increase. If so, please kindly contact me at:
Southern Africa Malaria Control
c/o WHO Offices
Zimbabwe
