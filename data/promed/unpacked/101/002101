Industry Fact Sheet: Specified Risk Materials (SRM)
---------------------------------------------------
In Canada, the following tissues are defined in regulations as SRM
[specified risk materials]: skull, brain, trigeminal ganglia
(clusters of nerve cells connect to the brain and closely apposed to
the exterior of the skull), eyes, tonsils, spinal cord, and dorsal
root ganglia (clusters of nerve cells connected to the spinal cord
and closely apposed to the vertebral column) of cattle aged 30 months
or older, and the distal ileum (part of the small intestine) of
cattle of all ages.

Specified risk materials, with the exception of the skull, are
tissues that in BSE-infected cattle have been shown to contain the
infective agent and transmit the disease. The skull has been
designated because of the high probability of its becoming
contaminated at the time of stunning and during manipulation of the
other tissues if their separate removal was permitted. The SRM must
be removed at slaughter or, in the case of the dorsal root ganglia,
during the cutting/boning process, and disposed of along with other
inedible material from the establishment.

In order to ensure complete removal of the dorsal root ganglia,
operators are required to remove the vertebral column from cattle
aged 30 months and older. For the purposes of this policy, the
definition of the vertebral column excludes the vertebrae of the
tail, the transverse processes of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae,
and the wings of the sacrum. The CFIA and Health Canada will
entertain proposals from industry on possible changes to this
definition that would increase economic return while still providing
the necessary assurance of complete removal of the dorsal root
ganglia. In any case, the vertebral column of cattle over 30 months
of age cannot be used as raw material in the preparation of
mechanically separated meat or finely textured meat.

Similarly, in order to ensure removal of the distal ileum in a manner
that can be verified by inspection staff, operators are required to
remove the entire small intestine from cattle of all ages. This
requirement may be modified when procedures are identified that would
enable removal of the distal ileum in a manner that is visually
verifiable by inspection staff.

Implementation
---------
In accordance with Meat Hygiene Directive 2003-18, the effective date
for implementation of the SRM removal policy in federally registered
establishments is 24 Jul 2003.

As of 23 Aug 2003, the requirement to remove the SRM will apply by
regulation to all businesses and individuals who slaughter cattle in
Canada and, in the case of the vertebral column, to all businesses
and individuals who cut up or debone carcasses or quarters of cattle
over 30 months of age to produce beef or beef products for human
consumption.

Directive 2003-18 describes requirements for the removal,
identification, control, and disposition of SRM. While the Directive
was developed for application in federally registered establishments,
it can also serve as a guide or reference document for other
jurisdictions.

Background
---------
While BSE is a cattle disease, the human disease called variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) has been associated with the
consumption of products derived from BSE-infected cattle. Cattle
tissues identified as SRM are not generally consumed as food.
However, during processing, SRM could be unintentionally included in
meat products destined for human consumption.

The SRM policy is being introduced to prevent tissues that may
contain BSE infectivity from entering the human food chain and
thereby further enhance public health protection. The detection of
the one case of BSE has not compromised the safety of Canada's food
supply. Although only one animal has been found to date to be
infected with BSE, taking action to remove SRM from cattle at
slaughter will further enhance the safety of the food supply in
Canada. Canada's food supply is also protected from BSE by the CFIA's
feed ban, import restrictions, and routine animal surveillance. The
development of this new policy on SRM removal reflects the
government's commitment to strengthening Canada's BSE measures and to
protecting the health of Canadians.

[The implementation of an SRM ban was regarded as "the most critical
and valuable central measure for public health protection and food
safety" by the international BSE expert team in their report to the
Canadian government of 26 Jun 2003. They underlined the need for "the
safe removal, collection and destruction of the SRM" and that "SRM
are not included in human food and animal feed" (see ref
20030627.1582). This means that SRM must be removed from the human
food and animal feed chains.

The current Canadian measure, initially published by the CFIA in a
press release of 18 Jul 2003,
<http://www.hcsc.gc.ca/english/media/releases/2003/2003_59.htm> is to be
implemented on 23 Aug 2003. It
will address the requirement to remove SRM from the human food chain;
the slaughterhouses are required to treat SRM "as inedible meat
products." - Mod.AS]

Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies in sheep and goats
------------------------------------------------------------
The European Commission has issued a series of answers to a selection
of questions on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE), the
family of illnesses that includes Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (CJD) in
humans, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and scrapie
in sheep and goats <http://europa.eu.int/rapid/start/cgi/guesten.ksh?p_action.gettxt=gt&doc=MEMO/03/157|0|RAPID&lg=EN&display>.

The document states that scrapie is not considered to be
transmissible to humans or to pose a risk to man on the basis of the
available data. European Union (EU) legislation to prevent the spread
and transmission of BSE, however, does apply also to sheep and goats
as a precautionary measure (for example, removal of specific risk
material like brain and spinal cord since 2000, and ban on feeding
mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) to ruminants since 1994).

The principal transmission route of BSE is thought to be MBM derived
from infected animals. BSE has never been found in sheep living in
fields. During the 1980s and early 1990s, sheep in the United Kingdom
and elsewhere were partially fed with feedstuffs containing the same
type of contaminated MBM that was responsible for causing the spread
of BSE in cattle. This has caused scientists to question whether BSE
might also have infected the population of small ruminants. The
feeding of MBM to ruminants has been forbidden in the EU since 1994
(1), and a total ban on feeding MBM to farmed animals has been in
place since January 2001 (2).

It has also been known for some time that a BSE-like disease can be
experimentally transmitted to sheep by feeding them material derived
from the brains of BSE-affected cows. This artificially produced
disease in research trials cannot be distinguished from scrapie by
examination of clinical symptoms or by rapid tests on the brains. It
can only be distinguished with certainty by the use of a mouse
bioassay, a testing technique that may take up to 2 years to
complete. The limited number of mouse bioassays that have been done
on natural scrapie cases so far have failed to yield a BSE-like
strain, and to date there is no evidence of the existence of BSE in
the sheep and goat population under natural conditions. New evidence
is constantly being reviewed by the EU scientific committees.

The most recent opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) on BSE
in small ruminants were adopted in April 2002
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out257_en.pdf> &
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out256_en.pdf>,
updating previous opinions of October 2001 <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out234_en.pdf>,
February 2001 <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out170_en.pdf>, &
September 1998 <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out24_en.html>.

The opinion reaffirms the SSC's view that there is no evidence that
BSE is present in small ruminants under field conditions. It issues a
range of recommendations in terms of specified risk material, use of
rapid tests, individual identification, breeding for resistance,
flock certification, and culling measures. It also describes how a
combination of approaches might be used to protect public health in
the event of BSE being confirmed in small ruminants under field
conditions.

section of the European Commission website

Italy's Mad Cow Cases Rise to 104
---------------------------------
Italy's mad cow rose to 104 in the last 2-1/2 years, after confirming
a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the Reggio Emila
province, Italian health officials said Monday.

Confirming a positive field test, Italy's main testing lab in Turin
said it was the 18th BSE case in 2003.

Italy has so far carried out more than one million tests for the
brain-wasting disease since it launched a BSE testing program in
January 2001 in compliance with European Union regulations. All
animals over 24 months old now undergo such testing prior to
slaughter.

An Italian government task force was formed and BSE measures stepped
up in February 2002, after the discovery of the first suspected case
of the human form of the deadly disease, new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (nvCJD), in a young Sicilian woman. The
case of nvCJD was confirmed in November 2002.

USDA Wants Stronger Surveillance for BSE on U.S. Farms
-----------------------------------------------------
The USDA wants to expand its testing authority for BSE to include
sick and dying animals on the farm so that diseased meat will not
reach the food supply. Department veterinarians have the authority to
secure samples from cattle that die in the field, but when it comes
to "downer" animals, those too sick to even stand, the USDA must wait
until they are brought to the slaughterhouse to collect samples.

USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, in a call earlier
in 2003 for public comment on the issue, said it believes "dead stock
and downer animals represent the most significant potential pathway
that has not been addressed in previous efforts to reduce BSE risks."
While USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service oversees the
slaughterhouse inspections, APHIS is more concerned with making sure
that BSE-infected cattle never make it to slaughterhouses or
rendering plants that produce animal feed, cosmetics, and other
products.

U.S. law prohibits including rendered ruminants in feed for
ruminants, but APHIS stressed concern that the prohibition is not
foolproof. "Since some BSE agent survives rendering, if BSE were to
be present in a rendered product that is used in cattle feed (in
deliberate or accidental violation of the feed ban imposed by the
USDA), it could lead to the amplification and spread of BSE among
cattle consuming that feed," APHIS said.

Despite the risk APHIS points out in allowing downer or dead cattle
to be rendered, the agency also stresses that the dangers of
producers burying diseased animals on farms may be worse. In the case
of BSE, APHIS said it believes a cattle carcass could transfer the
disease to other ruminants in the form of a related transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy, such as chronic wasting disease or scrapie.

The USDA, in a Federal Register notice, touched upon several
acceptable methods for cattle disposal, such as composting of dead
stock or incineration, but the department also asked the public for
suggestions.

BSE testing to focus on sick, dead cattle
------------------------------------------
Canada could test up to 6 times more cattle for BSE after a single
animal was found with the disease in May 2003, a federal official
told cattle producers here last week. But the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) will not test all cattle that go for
slaughter.

CFIA veterinarian George Luterbach said the agency tested about 10
000 head in 2003. That could increase to between 20 000 and 60 000.
The testing will focus on animals that have any disease, or are found
down, dying, or dead on farms.

Luterbach said this targeted approach would provide the best
surveillance program. "Testing normal healthy animals is not the most
efficient way to find BSE," he told reporters at the Canadian
Cattlemen's Association semi-annual meeting.

Japan has asked Canada to test all its animals, something that
country has done since BSE was discovered there in 2001.

Luterbach said the details of a more intensive surveillance program,
including how the samples would be gathered and tested and the
results received quickly, still have to be worked out. As part of a
review of its animal health policies, the agency is also looking at
the rules governing animal feed.

In 1997, Canada banned the use of ruminant protein in feed for other
ruminants. Scientists believe BSE is spread when protein from
infected animals is fed to others. However, ruminant protein can
still be added to feed for other animals, such as pigs and chickens.
Luterbach said those rules may have to be tightened further.

CCA executive vice-president Dennis Laycraft said Canada shouldn't
get too far ahead of its neighbour as it develops new policies.

The United States is also working on its BSE surveillance programs.
Laycraft said the 2 countries should have similar policies because
they have similar risk factors. Although Luterbach couldn't say how
soon policy changes would be made, Laycraft said it should happen
within the next 2 months.

[In the event that Canada and/or the USA decide to increase their BSE
surveillance in risk animals (fallen stock, clinically suspected, and
emergency slaughtered bovines), they will have to test annually CNS
material from at least 2 percent of their respective adult bovine
populations. According to Canada's GBR (Geographic BSE Risk; see ref
20030529.1311), performed in 2000, the adult bovine population of
Canada (older than 24 months) was 6 million. - Mod.AS]
