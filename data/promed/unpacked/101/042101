The wet season in north Queensland has usually started by Christmas,
so we start seeing cases of melioidosis from January. So far in 2005,
there have been 10 cases of melioidosis in the region (population
approx. 597 000). From 2000, the number of cases in the region with
an onset in the 1st quarter of the year has ranged from a minimum of
3 to a maximum of 14, so this year is (so far) a very "average" year.
Of note however, only 3 cases this year have been in Indigenous
(i.e., Aboriginal) people. As mentioned in the posting, there have
been 3 deaths this year, but one of these was a very elderly person,
and the other had a terminal malignancy. The out-of-state visitor (a
diabetic) was hospitalized in north Queensland; there was no delay in
implementing appropriate treatment. She died from an overwhelming
melioidosis pneumonia/septicemia on the 2nd day after being
hospitalized.
