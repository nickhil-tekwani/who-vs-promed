Related to a salmonellosis outbreak in Limestone County, Alabama, 5 people were hospitalized, 45 people were treated, and 8 cases were confirmed, Athens-Limestone Hospital reported Tuesday [8 Oct 2013]. Hospital officials confirmed they had treated a total of 45 people for what they believe is salmonellosis.

Between Saturday and Tuesday, 5-8 Oct 2013, dozens of people in Limestone County and elsewhere were stricken with diarrhea, vomiting and, sometimes, cramps and fever. Officials believe victims contracted the salmonellosis from food served at the annual bean dinner fundraiser for the Foundation on Aging in Athens, Alabama. However, the state health department is in the process of trying to confirm both the cause and the source of the illnesses.

Danny Yocom, lab director at the hospital, said the lab has confirmed 8 cases (through sample testing) and it has sent the pathogens to the state health department for analysis. Also, an untouched takeout order from the bean day dinner was sent to the state for analysis, said Micheal Estremera, infection preventionist for the hospital.

"It was a plate that someone here got Friday [4 Oct 2013] and put in the refrigerator but did not eat," she said. "Several people (from the hospital) had eaten there and did not get sick and some did get sick."

The 5 who had to be hospitalized were treated mainly for dehydration due to diarrhea, Estremera said. She believed the 45 who were treated for symptoms had eaten at bean day. She said the figure does not include those treated at Medical East, Decatur or Madison facilities. The hospital did not obtain stool specimens from all 45 of the people who were treated for symptoms because once salmonella bacterium was confirmed as the cause of illness in several people, hospital employees simply treated the symptoms.

The Alabama Department of Health's Epidemiology Division is investigating the outbreak, though an official could not comment on the status of the probe Tue 8 Oct 2013. "Our investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment on anything until we conclude it," said Mike Tyler, emergency preparedness coordinator for Area II, which includes Limestone, Morgan, Madison, Lawrence, Cullman, Marshall, and Jackson counties. He could not estimate how long the investigation would take. "It varies depending on how many people we have to interview," Tyler said.
