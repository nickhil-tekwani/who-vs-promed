61 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Stavropol Krai
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, 9000 people have sought medical treatment for tick bites. The rise
in incidence of tick bites is attributed to favorable weather conditions
and to an increase in outdoor activities by the human population. According
to the Russian Public Health Surveillance Centre so far 5 people have died
from this dangerous infection.

[During the past 2 weeks a 30 per cent increase in the number of cases has
been observed: 43 cases were registered up to 26 Jun 2008 and 61 by 15 Jul
2008. This number of cases is approaching the total of 64 cases observed
last year (2007). It is likely that last year's total will be exceeded. -
