3 Cases of Human Anthrax Detected in Uruguay
-------------------------------------------------
Physicians have detected 3 cases of anthrax among rural workers in Soriano
province, 174 miles west of the capital. Eduardo Sarutte, the treating
physician, said that the patients, who were probably infected while removing
the hides from cattle affected by the disease, were in stable condition. He
added that the patients presented fever and malaise, and that, although the
cases are severe, a "benign" evolution is expected, since the infection was
acquired through the skin.
Anthrax develops through the presence of the bacteria in cattle and may be
transmitted to humans. For the time being, no special sanitary measures to
address the situation have been announced by the Ministry of Agriculture or
the Ministry of Public Health.

[Anthrax is sporadic in Uruguay. They report a steady trickle of outbreaks
in cattle, but only note its presence in sheep and goats: e.g., cattle
outbreaks in 1999 (6), 2000 (10), 2001 (2), with 2 human cases in 1995 and
one in 2001. This report indicates multiple cattle affected, not just one.
Vaccination coverage is hard to determine, as the OIE numbers lump together
all ruminant species vaccinated, but it would seem to be at about 50
percent. Unfortunately, there is no information as to why the disease is
persisting. If I were to guess, I would say the actual attack rates are
higher than reported due to undiagnosed cases. Anyone with hard information
is encouraged to share it. - Mod.MHJ]
