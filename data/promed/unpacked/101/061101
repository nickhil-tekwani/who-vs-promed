The 1st cases of measles in 7 years have been recorded in Chelyabinsk. A woman resident of Leninsky district of Chelyabinsk is presently hospitalised. The medical authorities have declared that that there is no need for panic. More than 99 percent of the population in the South Urals region has been vaccinated. However the medical authorities have carried out additional vaccination in the building where the affected patient lives.

According to neighbours the patient is a hospital employee. The medical administration has now confirmed that the initial case was a girl from a family of immigrants with relatives in Kyrgyzstan who came to visit. The sick child was admitted to hospital and passed the infection to the hospital worker. Both patients are being treated and are now recovering.

Svetlana Luchinina, deputy director of the Chelyabinsk region Office of Epidemiology commented that Chelyabinsk is now at risk for a measles outbreak due to the presence of Roma immigrants and that there are 39 cases among this population in Troitsk. Since the incubation period for measles is approximately 3 weeks the residents of the buildings where the Roma families live will remain under surveillance for this period. The occupants are cooperating with the city administration.

[2] UK: vaccination consent, comment

Re: ProMED-mail Measles update (41) 20131013.1999869, part [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------
The UK court case listed in Measles update 41 is not unique. To understand it, you need to understand the law on consent for minors in the UK.

Prior to a court case in 1999, consent for a minor who did not have capacity ("Gillick Competence") to give consent on their own behalf was required from only one "person with parental responsibility". The court case related to a situation in which one parent wanted the child circumcised (a much less common procedure in the UK than in the USA, and one which has recently become more controversial -- but that's a topic for another day...). In this case the court decided that for "controversial" procedures -- like circumcision -- the consent of all persons with parental responsibility was required. Without this, or a court order, the procedure could not be undertaken.

In 2003, at the height of concerns about MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] caused by Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent and since discredited research, an appeal court heard appeals in 2 cases where parents held contrary views about whether a child should receive the MMR vaccine. In each case the court found that it would be in the best interests of the child for the vaccine to be given, and ordered for this to proceed. However, sadly, the court also decided that MMR vaccination was a "controversial" procedure, like circumcision; and made it clear that his decision related only to the 2 children involved in those 2 cases. Each such case in the future would have to be decided on its merits, by a judge.

Since then we have learned about Wakefield's fraud; and ***further research has completely disproven*** the scare stories he raised. MMR vaccination was never, for anybody aware of and able to understand the medical literature, a controversial procedure -- even if it did temporarily become one in the UK for many people, due to ignorant and/or irresponsible press reporting. While it may have been understandable for the procedure to be classified as controversial in 2003, it is clearly not controversial now; and it would have been very helpful for the court in the recent case to make this point, and to end the situation where the consent of all persons with parental responsibility is required before MMR vaccine can be given.

I'd just like to add another couple of practical notes about UK practice.

1. It is very clear in guidelines that if a child is brought for vaccination, a healthcare worker (usually a GP -- what I think might be called a family physician in the USA, as it is not UK practice for children to be seen by paediatricians unless referred by a GP -- or a practice nurse) is entitled to assume that the parents have consented to the vaccine. The fact of the child being brought in is considered evidence enough. Unless, that is, the parents have previously stated that they object (or do so at the time they bring the child in to discuss the vaccine, for other vaccines, or whatever). When cases such as the one that went to court arise, parents have usually made their views on vaccination clear to the practice in advance.

2. The law on consent for minors allows a person under 18 to consent to treatment, if they understand the implications of the treatment, and it is thought to be in their best interests. From the age of 16 the ability to understand is assumed -- for most practical purposes 16 year olds are not considered minors in UK medical practice. Bizarrely, however, minors -- technically including all of those under the age of 18 years -- do not have the right to withhold consent. If a parent -- or all parents in the case of a "controversial" procedure -- give consent, and the procedure is thought to be in their best interests, the individual minor may not withhold consent... In theory the procedure could be given against their consent. However the "best interest" part usually comes into play here; and it would seldom, if ever, be considered to be in the best interests of a competent adolescent to perform a procedure on them -- even one as benign as vaccination -- against their wishes.

The Directorate of Health and Social Services has announced that it is currently busy with a measles vaccination campaign in Ohangwena Region, after another measles outbreak in the Engela district recently.

According to the acting health director for Ohangwena Region, John Hango, 18 measles cases were suspected in September [2013] of which 5 have been confirmed.

Hango said the ministry started the vaccination campaign on Tuesday [15 Oct 2013] in villages where the cases were confirmed, as well as in other 12 surrounding villages. These include Oshikango, Onamhinda, Eeshoke, Ohalushu, Okamukwa, and Omafo. All children between 6 months and 5 years in those areas will have to be vaccinated, Hango announced.

Hango also told The Namibian that so far the ministry has managed to vaccinate close to 3000 children, with most of them coming from the Oshikango area. The Acting Health Director said they were suspecting the measles to have come from southern Angola. "Namibia's regions bordering with other countries, such as Angola, are always in a crisis when these kind of diseases are reported in those countries. We always have to be on the outlook and put measures in place, such as the diagnosing of those diseases among our people, to treat and immunise the suspect villagers," Hango said and added that the vaccination campaign that will end today [18 Oct 2013] has been going very well. He explained that the vaccination teams worked very hard and tried to get through to all target groups in the affected villages.

"We have everything in place, and will fight this measles disease in our region," Hango stated, commenting that this disease had made its appearance at the same time last year and that then too, it was successfully controlled.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) have confirmed a case of measles in the Lethbridge area and is advising of potential exposures. AHS are in process of contacting unimmunized individuals who have been identified as immediate contacts. "We are asking all potentially exposed individuals to monitor their health for symptoms of measles disease," said Dr Vivien Suttorp, medical officer of health, south zone. "These individuals must continue to watch for symptoms of measles through 4 Nov 2013." Individuals may be at risk for developing the disease if they have not already had measles disease in the past, or have not been vaccinated against measles.

Individuals with symptoms should avoid contact with others and call Health Link Alberta 1-866-408-link (5465) or a physician as soon as possible to discuss their symptoms, prior to attending a clinic or hospital. By calling ahead before seeking treatment, the potential risk of spreading the disease to others can be reduced, according to Suttorp. Unlike many other infections, people do not have to have close contact with an infected person to catch measles. In addition to being spread by coughing and sneezing, measles is also spread through air currents. Because it is an airborne disease, it is extremely contagious.

There is no cure for measles, but it can be prevented with vaccination. "This case is a reminder of the importance of vaccination," said Suttorp. "We are seeing outbreaks of measles around the world, and whether you're travelling yourself or staying at home here in Alberta, there's an increasing risk of being exposed to measles and other vaccine preventable illnesses. We strongly encourage all Albertans to ensure they are up to date with all immunizations."

The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, is part of the routine childhood immunization program in Alberta. Children in Alberta typically receive their 1st dose of MMR vaccine at 12 months of age, and their 2nd dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years. Both doses are [necessary to provide full protection].

There are fears of a serious measles outbreak around Byron Bay after a 7-year-old boy and his mother attended hospital yesterday [17 Oct 2013] with the highly contagious disease. It is understood the boy was not vaccinated and his mother was a registered conscientious objector. Their case comes after a 13-year-old Byron Bay boy was diagnosed with measles last week, sparking a major health warning after it was revealed he had visited Dreamworld, on the Gold Coast, earlier this month [October 2013]. And yesterday [17 Oct 2013] it was revealed another teenager had been diagnosed with measles after attending Byron Bay High School from Monday to Wednesday, and catching the Bangalow-Byron bus each day. 3 other people in the Byron Bay area have been diagnosed with measles over the past 2 weeks the unit said in a statement today [18 Oct 2013].

The North Coast Public Health Unit has advised people in the area to be alert for measles and will run a free vaccination clinic at Byron High [School] on Monday [21 Oct 2013]. Byron Shire has the lowest rates of immunisation in the state -- just 46 per cent of 2-year-olds in Mullumbimby and 69 percent in Byron, well below the state average of 92 per cent.

A North Coast resident, whose 7-year-old daughter died of the measles complication subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), said it was outrageous other children were being put at risk. "You only get SSPE through measles and these kids could be a time bomb, no child survives SSPE," her mother said. [But that mother had presumably failed to get her own daughter vaccinated. SSPE strikes about 1/100 000 measles cases, and may take several years post-infection to appear. - Mod.JW]

According to the latest National Communicable Diseases Surveillance Report for the fortnight 21 Sep to 4 Oct 2013, there have been 69 cases of measles reported so far this year [2013]. The median age of all cases this year is 21 years and based on vaccination status data, over 50 per cent, or 34 of the total cases this year were not vaccinated, "including 2 infants who were less than one year of age and too young for vaccination," the report said. 12 of the cases (17 per cent) were vaccinated, but all but one had only had one dose, not the recommended 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. The remaining 22 cases were of unknown vaccination status.

[The level of vaccination in Byron Bay is extremely low and unsurprisingly the number of measles cases is high. Cases of SSPE as a result of measles virus infection are rare.

[Queensland's] top doctor has taken the extraordinary step of writing to the parents of more than 13 000 children to ram home the warnings about the state's measles outbreak. With help from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young has identified 13 117 Queensland children aged between 4 and 6 who have missed scheduled vaccinations, and written to their families to urge them to immunise their children.

Since August [2013], 16 people have contracted measles in southeast Queensland. Most of those diagnosed have been from Ipswich, west of Brisbane. Dr Young said most areas of Queensland had 90 per cent of children fully vaccinated, with the Torres Strait and Cape York regions having the highest rates of immunisation. The Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast regions are below national rates, with more than one in 10 children either not immunised at all, or missing some of their scheduled vaccinations.

Dr Young said this was the 1st time she had used the Australian Childhood Immunisation Registry to approach parents and urge them to vaccinate their children. She said she would continue to work with registry staff to identify Queensland children younger than 4 who were not adequately vaccinated, and planned to write to contact their families as well.

Dr Young said measles was a very serious disease which could have potentially life-threatening consequences. Some patients with the virus develop pneumonia and encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. "Around one-third of adults who contract it require hospitalisation," she said.
