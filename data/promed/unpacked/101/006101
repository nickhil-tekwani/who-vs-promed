As China has largely brought the coronavirus pandemic under control within its borders, another highly contagious disease -- one affecting livestock -- is reappearing and raising questions about the accuracy of the country's reporting.

For about 4 months from mid-November 2019, pig farms in China reported no new cases of African swine fever (ASF), the deadly hemorrhagic disease that last year [2019] resulted in the loss of around 120 million hogs in the country. Chinese authorities said in February [2020] that the epidemic situation was stable.

"Underreporting is rampant as government agencies at all levels face serious challenges in collecting and reporting outbreak information from swine farms," the US Department of Agriculture said in an April [2020] report on China's livestock sector. "Some farms are reluctant to report outbreaks for fear of economic losses, while others report being actively discouraged" from disclosing cases of ASF, it added.

Several farming veterans and veterinarians hired as consultants by Chinese farms said fresh outbreaks of ASF were plaguing some domestic farms they visited shortly before the coronavirus pandemic took hold across the country earlier this year [2020]. They said other farms they have been in touch with more recently via video calls have also seen new infections.

The consultants said farms were struggling with the disease, while Chinese authorities were encouraging and providing financial incentives to pig farmers to rebuild their herds. The government has been trying to ease pressure on domestic pork prices, which more than doubled in 2019 as a result of meat shortages and are still near record highs.

China's statistics bureau on 17 Apr 2020 said the country's pig population rose by about 3%, or 10 million hogs, during the first 3 months of this year. That increase was partly because fewer pigs were slaughtered, as many pork-processing plants closed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Pork production, as a result, was down by almost one-third on the prior year [2019].

Several veterinarians interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said they personally witnessed or diagnosed Chinese pig herds with the disease even as the government said the country had seen no new cases. Edgar Wayne Johnson, an American veterinarian, said he visited a small farm in northern China in January [2020] and found a gory scene of 100 pigs that were dead or dying. A local government vet had earlier said the animals were suffering from a nasal disease or some other unspecified illness.

Dr. Johnson, who was hired as a consultant for an animal-feed company, said tests he conducted for ASF produced "red hot positive" results. The animals were bleeding from the nose and their skin was covered with black lesions, common signs of the illness.

The problem "is certainly not getting better," said the longtime consultant, who has worked in China for more than 20 years. In March [2020], as the country was emerging from coronavirus-related lockdowns, the lab Dr. Johnson operates on the outskirts of Beijing received blood and tissue samples from dead pigs at several farms that tested positive for ASF.

[China's most recent official reports to the OIE on new ASF outbreaks addressed outbreaks in domestic pigs in the provinces Shaanxi and Jiangsu. They were submitted on 13 and 17 Apr 2020, respectively, and are addressed in 20200424.7265246. Subscribers are referred to Mod.CRD's commentary in the said posting.

On 22 Apr 2020, the country reported ASF-positive pigs illegally moved from another province that were seized at a checkpoint at Qiaoheqiao Parking, Nanjiang, in Sichuan Province. The vehicle loaded 106 pigs, of which 2 were sick and died; the remaining 104 were destroyed.

According to information cited today (29 Apr 2020) from the official website of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, a video conference on the supervision and control of ASF was convened today. The meeting emphasized that animal husbandry and veterinary departments at all levels should insist on the recovery of hog production and the prevention and control of major animal diseases such as ASF, taking more pragmatic measures to ensure that the disease does not recur. The meeting pointed out that the current situation of prevention and control of ASF is still complex and grim, while the basis for the resumption of development of live pig production is not yet firm. Various prevention and control measures must be continuously strengthened. The risk of ASF spread is dependent upon prevention of illegal transfer of pigs; some breeding plants fail to fulfill their responsibilities. According to the report, prior to today's meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs had dispatched 14 supervision teams to 54 cities and 27 counties in 27 provinces and autonomous regions to supervise ASF prevention and control and hog production, and inspected more than 200 sites on site (see the report, in Chinese, at https://tinyurl.com/y8ucgk82).

Another emerging animal epizootic that has recently obtained China's attention is African horse sickness (AHS), a vector-borne viral disease that has invaded Thailand. The Chinese authorities declared a state of alertness and is engaged in preparedness, having undertaken preventive measures (see commentary in 20200425.7265390). - Mod.AS
