Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) field doctor Dominique Lafontaine said
"There are serious risks of outbreaks of disease from terrible health
and nutritional conditions, but there is a problem with the way needs
and solutions are prioritised."
"While there is an urgent need to restructure the water and sanitation
system, the government responds with mass vaccination campaigns against
cholera," he said. MSF said it is unsure where the North Korean
government was obtaining the cholera vaccines.
There are no vaccines against cholera that are internationally
recognised as effective, and aid agencies do not provide them. [By

[As we have seen from recent reports from China, the fact that the
government is conducting a mass vaccination campaign against cholera
does not mean that disease has actually been confirmed as occurring, and
in fact MSF does not say that there is an epidemic of cholera ongoing -
