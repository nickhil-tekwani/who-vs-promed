Lumpy skin disease suspected on the Golan heights
--------------------------------------------------
We are informed that cases, clinically suspected to be Lumpy skin disease (LSD), have been recently observed in beef-cattle pasturing in the northern part of the Golan heights, adjacent to the Syrian border. Among the mentioned locations are the Druze villages Majdal Shams and Mas'ada. For their locations, see map http://tinyurl.com/dyeqx9z; also, in the interactive map
http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html, go to square 1: Majdal Shams is at x=660, y=90 and Mas'ada at x=580, y=150.

[If confirmed, this will be the 1st time LSD is recorded in Northern Israel. The disease was recorded in southern Israel, more than 200 km south to the currently suspected cases, in 1989 (eradicated by stamping out), 2006 and 2007, around the Gaza strip. LSD Cases were also observed at the time within the Gaza strip, suspected to be introduced from Egypt, where the disease has become endemic since 1988 and mass vaccinations in cattle are annually applied (during 2011, 2 272 393 cattle reportedly vaccinated).

If confirmed, the current observation may be indicative of possible circulation of the LSD virus in cattle within Syria. The Lebanese border is also rather close to the mentioned locations (see in the maps).- Mod.AS.]
