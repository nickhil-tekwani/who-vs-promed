A Kathmandu resident who had been admitted to hospital with symptoms of swine flu [see moderator's comment below concerning the identity of the virus] died in a capital's hospital on [Sat 28 Feb 2015], officials from the Ministry of Health confirmed. They also said this is the 1st instant of a patient dying of swine flu this season [2014-2015]. Last year [2014], 18 people had died due to swine flu. The 50-year old woman, a long-time asthma patient, was also detected with pneumonia after being admitted to the Kathmandu Model Hospital last week [week of 23 Feb 2015]. She had not left the capital in recent times. This had led the medical fraternity to conclude that swine flu has already affected several people in the Kathmandu Valley, although the actual spread of the disease is not yet known.

As of [Fri 27 Feb 2015], the number of people who have tested positive for the swine flu rose to 31, and of these, 23 are from the capital, reports said. The medical fraternity here is divided about the exact reach and impact of the swine flu virus. Some, like Dr Sher Bahadur Pun of the Tropical Hospital in Kathmandu, warn of grave consequences if the government did not take measures to control the spread. There are concerns about the adequate supply of flu medicines as well. However, Dr Baburam Marasini, director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division at the Department of Health Services, said the disease was not yet an epidemic and the situation was under control.

The government has set up health desks at major transit points along the border with India and also at Kathmandu's international airport to screen people.

[According to the most recent WHO Global Update (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/) globally, influenza activity remained high in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Some countries reported an increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity. The correct designation of the H1N1 influenza virus that is currently circulating in the Northern Hemisphere is: A (H1N1)pdm09. This virus is only remotely derived from swine and it should not be assumed that this virus is in any manner transmitted from pigs. - Mod.CP
