Health officials have played down fears of a chronic skin disease spreading nationwide. However, they have urged the public to seek medical treatment for longstanding insect bites noting the serious nature of the disease.

Last week, several media reported that the tropical skin disease, leishmaniasis, which had been present only in certain areas of the country, was now spreading.

While there is a spike in the numbers of reported cases of leishmaniasis, it does not necessarily mean the country is facing a widespread epidemic, Director of the Health Ministry's Epidemiology Unit, Dr Paba Palihawadana stressed.

Dr Palihawadana said most cases of the disease found in Sri Lanka had been reported from the dry zone; areas such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, and Matara.

These cases were confined to rural areas and leishmaniasis was not widely reported in urban areas like Colombo, she added. While there was no need to panic over the disease, Dr Palihawadana said adding that if anyone had a longstanding wound that had occurred as a result of an insect bite, they needed urgent medical treatment.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more common in Sri Lanka than visceral leishmaniasis (Ranasinghe S, Wickremasinghe R, Munasinghe A, et al: Cross-sectional study to assess risk factors for leishmaniasis in an endemic region in Sri Lanka. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2013; 89(4): 742-9; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/89/4/742.long). The report cites no numbers, so it is difficult to comment on the apparent rise in numbers and ProMED will be happy to post further details. - Mod.EP
