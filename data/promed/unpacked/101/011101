A dog has died after eating a "glutinous" substance which has washed up on beaches in west Cornwall. Penzance vets said the 3 year old miniature schnauzer had eaten a white object on Long Rock beach on Tuesday [22 Oct 2013]. Two other dogs are seriously ill after eating the same substance on beaches in the area, vets have said.

Dog owners have been warned to keep their animals away from west Cornwall's beaches. Coastguards are trying to identify the substance.

David Fenwick, who reported the "glutinous" substance at Long Rock to coastguards, said it smelled of firelighters. "Some were the size of a cow pat, while others were much smaller, scattered all over the beach," he said.

Paul Moseley's golden retriever became ill after coming into contact with the substance at Praa Sands, about 4 miles (6 km) from Long Rock, on Tuesday [22 Oct 2013]. "Within 15 minutes she was sick," Mr Moseley said. "I presume she had eaten a small piece or licked it. "Some of the pieces were as small as marbles."

Coastguards said another substance, described as "vegetable oil-like," was found washed up at Pedn Vounder beach, near the Minack Theatre, on Sunday [20 Oct 2013]. Small pockets of the same substance were found at Porthcurno and Porthchapel beaches.

A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said: "Samples of the suspected vegetable oil found near Land's End have been sent to 2 accredited laboratories for analysis. The MCA expects to have the results before the end of this week."

Surfers and swimmers have been warned to avoid some west Cornwall beaches after a mystery substance was found.

A dog that ate the white glutinous substance died and several others were made sick, according to vets.

Public Health England said the substance, which is being analysed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, was a "source of worry".

Cornwall Council is putting up warning signs at beaches in the affected areas.

[The substance is described above as white, glutinous, smelling like firelighters, and likened to vegetable oil. Firelighters are solid fuel tablets used to replace or reduce the need for kindling when starting a fire. Common ingredients include hexamine and 1,3,5-trioxane, both of which break down in acid environments -- such as the mammalian stomach -- to form formaldehyde, which is very toxic. As yet, we do not know what the substance on the Cornish beaches is, or how it arrived there. Information from informed sources would be welcome. - Mod.SH
