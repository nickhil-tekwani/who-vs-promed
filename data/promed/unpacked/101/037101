The 1st known mosquitoes with the potential to carry such diseases as Zika and yellow fever have been discovered in Shasta County.

The 1st mosquito was found on Fri 14 Aug 2020 in a trap north of Lake Boulevard and west of North Market Street, also known as Highway 273, according to the Shasta Mosquito and Vector Control District.

The mosquitoes, known as _Aedes aegypti_, have been found in other areas of California, but the recent finding in Redding marks a 1st for Shasta County, according to mosquito district manager Peter Bonkrude.

"We plan to do everything we can to eradicate this mosquito to protect our residents from the potential disease risk of these invasive mosquitoes," Bonkrude said in a statement. "Currently, we only have found one female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, and we are trying to determine and limit the extent of the infestation."

Bonkrude said the district already discovered more of the mosquitoes on Monday [17 Aug 2020]. "The teams out today have already located some additional adults and immature mosquitoes. The question now (becomes) how widespread, so we've set a perimeter around the initial find and are intensifying surveillance in that area," he said.

Control efforts could include door-to-door surveillance and control, ultra-low volume spraying and live trapping, Bonkrude said.

In addition to Zika and yellow fever, the mosquito species also has the potential to carry chikungunya, a disease that has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe and areas surrounding the Indian and Pacific Oceans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Chikungunya symptoms include fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash, according to the CDC.

About one in 4 people will get sick from dengue fever, the CDC says. The most common symptom of dengue is fever and could also include nausea, vomiting, rash and aches and pains.

Yellow fever [YF] is very rare in the United States and is found in subtropical areas of Africa and South America, according to the CDC [YF is absent in the USA today. The last outbreak of yellow fever in the United States occurred in 1905, when New Orleans, Louisiana and other ports of the South were invaded by the virus. - Mod.TY]. Symptoms include fever with aches and pains to severe liver disease with bleeding and yellowing skin (jaundice).

Many people infected with Zika virus won't have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes and muscle pain.

As long as the numbers of the _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes remain low, there is very little likelihood the mosquitoes found in Shasta County will carry Zika, yellow fever, dengue or chikungunya, Bonkrude said.

The mosquitoes need a host to pick up the disease and carry it, Bonkrude said. Since those diseases are very rare [or absent] in the USA, someone getting it from a mosquito locally is unlikely, he said.

Since no one is known locally to carry the disease, transmission would have to come from someone who picked up the disease outside the area, Bonkrude said.

"The concern comes with a permanent expansion of their range, and continued opportunities to come in contact with an infected person, the probability starts to go up," he said. "We'll be working with the state and county health departments to monitor returning travelers that may be exposed to these diseases to limit the potential even further."

Mosquito district officials said the public plays a critical role in controlling the spread of this particular mosquito population.

"This species is different than the ones we normally control; they prefer to live around people and breed in small containers associated with homes. Eliminating all standing water regardless of size is essential to effective control," Bonkrude said.

The mosquito district urges people to take the following steps to prevent the spread of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito:
- Inspect yards for standing water sources and drain water that collects under potted plants, in bird baths, discarded tires, and anywhere else water collects.
- Check your rain gutters and lawn drains to make sure they aren't holding water and debris.
- Check and clean any new containers that you bring home that may contain water. _Aedes aegypti_ eggs can remain viable under dry conditions for months.

The district also urges residents to use mosquito repellent and dress with long sleeves and pants when mosquitoes are active.

[A new location, Redding municipality in Shasta county California, is now added to the geographic range of _Aedes aegypti_.

_Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years. Although the above report points out that the probability of introduction of any of these viruses with ongoing transmission is unlikely, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito in the Redding area as quickly as possible is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort.

As noted in an earlier ProMED-mail post, a recent report describes automated processes to rear and release millions of competitive, sterile-male _Wolbachia_-infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes and the use of these males in a large-scale suppression trial in Fresno County, California. In 2018, 14.4 million males were released across 3 replicate neighborhoods encompassing 293 hectares [724 acres]. At peak mosquito season, the number of female mosquitoes was 95.5% lower (95% CI, 93.6-96.9) in release areas compared to non-release areas, with the most geographically isolated neighborhood reaching a 99% reduction. This work demonstrates the high efficacy of mosquito sterile insect technique in an area 9-fold larger than in previous similar trials, supporting the potential of this approach in public health and nuisance-mosquito eradication programs (see Invasive mosquito - USA: (CA) control 20200408.7197860). - Mod.TY
