Trypanosomiasis in a Dutch tourist infected in Serengeti National Park
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [Sun 12 Jul 2009], a 25-year-old Dutch woman was admitted to a
hospital in the Netherlands because of fever and cellulitis of the
left forearm.

She had returned the same day from her holiday to Tanzania. Eight
days before she had been bitten by gray brown flies during her visit
to the Serengeti Park.

Four days before admission a red papule developed, which became
larger with a central blister. The day of admission she developed
fever and headache. She appeared moderately ill. Body temperature was
39.4 deg C [102.9 deg F]; pulse rate 108 per min; blood pressure
140/70 mmHg.

On her left arm a large soft swelling was seen with a central dark
blue center covered by a blister. Later a distinct lymphangitis was
seen. The was no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory examination showed a
leukocyte count of 5.4 x 10e9/L; thrombocyte count 279 x 10e9/L.

In the blood film 2 trypomastigotes were seen. Lumbar puncture
revealed 1 leukocyte, protein concentration was normal. The diagnosis
of stage 1 human African trypanosomiasis by _Trypanosoma brucei
rhodesiense_ was made, and treatment with suramin was started.

Comment from WHO
----------------
The last visitor infected in Serengeti was an American tourist
treated in South Africa early June this year [2009]. Although he
presented multi-organ failure and a borderline CSF [cerebrospinal
fluid], he was treated with the same suramin regime (WHO technical
report series 881, annex 1) and he recovered.

Due to recent reports on cases infected from Serengeti, WHO organized
last April [2009] in Mugumu hospital a capacity building session on
human African trypanosomiasis diagnosis and treatment for health
facilities in and around Serengeti National Park. The training was
conducted by staff of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and
Training on Human African Trypanosomiasis Diagnostics (Parasite
Diagnostics Unit, Department of Parasitology, Institute of Tropical
Medicine Antwerp) and the National Institute for Medical Research, in
Tanzania (Tabora Medical Research Centre). 14 health facilities were
involved. After this training, in addition of cases from Serengeti,
cases from Waso district in Ngorongoro have been also reported.

[Trypanosomiasis is endemic in Central Africa and has been emerging
in the Congo DR over the past 15 to 20 years [see ProMED-mail
Trypanosomiasis, African: emerging (02) 20000816.1363].

In 2001, ProMED-mail reported 10 cases of trypanosomiasis in tourists
visiting Serengeti and Tarangire national parks, and an additional 2
cases were reported in 2005. The case reported in October 2008 was
not infected in the Serengeti National Park, but the report of this
case and the comment from the WHO indicate that trypanosomiasis is a
risk in the park. - Mod.EP]
