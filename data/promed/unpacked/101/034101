[In January 2008, there were 42 outbreaks in the province of West
Bengal, which like Assam is also located in Northeastern India. The
country of Bangladesh separates the Indian provinces of West Bengal
and Assam. The last outbreaks in West Bengal were resolved in April
2008 and subsequent OIE reports in July and October 2008 indicated no
new outbreaks in the country.

A very nice analysis tool provided by OIE graphs the HPAI outbreaks
in India by month for the last 3 years. A quick look indicates that 7
outbreaks occurred between January and April in 2006. The only
outbreak in 2007 occurred in July. Thus, the pattern of
outbreaks,while not strictly seasonal, tends to occur in the winter
months. Admittedly, the data are not sufficient to identify a
seasonal causality but there does seem to be a grouping in the winter
months. A similar pattern exist in Nigeria when the January to April
months register most of the outbreaks in 2006, although the number of
outbreaks there has been greatly reduced in 2008.

However, when thinking about seasonal effects it is important to
remember that there may be many risk factors for disease which vary
by times of the year, including animal and human movements for
commerce, holiday celebrations, wild bird migrations etc. This is a
very interesting aspect of the epidemiology of HPAI and as more data
collects, should be examined closely. For OIE - WAHID graph of
disease by month over specified time periods see:
