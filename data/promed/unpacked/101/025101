A single case of bird flu has been confirmed at Point Pelee National Park.

The park took to Facebook this week to announce it while had identified a case of avian flu, the park remains safe to visit.

This year [2022], the country has seen outbreaks of a highly infectious strain -- H5N1 -- of avian influenza, a virus affecting wild and domestic birds. The disease can be fatal to birds. However, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs reports avian flu is not a public health concern or food safety risk for anyone not in regular contact with infected birds.

"Diseases such as avian influenza are naturally occurring in wildlife populations and past outbreaks eventually declined as populations of wild birds build immunity," Parks Canada told the Star in an email. "Parks Canada will continue to follow all health precautions and work with Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to monitor the situation."

A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in Saskatchewan, prompting a warning to poultry producers in the province.

The Ministry of Agriculture said Friday [8 Apr 2022] producers with flocks of all sizes should follow all necessary biosecurity protocols after the strain of bird flu was detected in a snow goose found near Elrose.

It's the 1st time since 2007 that a case of HPAI has been found in Saskatchewan in either commercial poultry or wild birds.

HPAI has been detected in poultry and wild birds in the United States and in several Canadian provinces in recent months.

"Protecting commercial flocks includes preventative measures such as keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health," the Ministry of Agriculture said in a release.

"Producers should contact their veterinarian immediately if they have concerns about the health status of their flocks. If HPAI is suspected, producers should also contact their local Canadian Food Inspection Agency office."

Owners of small flocks are being urged to keep their birds indoors if possible, to limit their contact with wild birds or places that may have been visited by birds that may be contaminated with HPAI virus.

According to the ministry, strains of bird flu normally don't result in obvious signs of disease in wild birds. However, this strain has killed some wild birds, including snow geese and Canada geese.

People are urged to call the Inquiry Centre or email <centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca> if they find:
• Clusters of 2 or more dead waterfowl (such as ducks and geese) or other water birds;
• Dead raptors or avian scavengers (including ravens, crows and gulls);
• Raptors, waterfowl or avian scavengers that appear to be sick; and/or
• Large groups of dead birds (more than 50) of any species.

Reports also can be made to the Canadian Wildlife Health Co-operative.

The ministry said the risk of transmission to humans is considered low, but people shouldn't touch dead birds or wildlife with their bare hands. Protective eyewear and masks also are recommended.

The bodies of the birds should be placed in a plastic bag before they're submitted for testing.

"This strain of HPAI does not pose a food safety risk," the ministry added. "Regular food safety and hygiene precautions should be followed when preparing wild game. Hunters should avoid eating birds which are visibly ill."

More information on avian flu in poultry is available by calling the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Unit.

[3] Indiana (Elkhart County): ducks [currently unconfirmed]

[At the time of this posting, this suspicious case has NOT been confirmed to be Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. It is likely the confirmed report will be released on Mon 11 Apr 2022. - Mod.TG]

Avian influenza has been detected in a northern Indiana duck farm, state officials said Thursday [7 Apr 2022], marking the disease's spread to a 3rd poultry species.

Laboratory testing of a commercial duck flock in Elkhart County has come back as presumptively positive for the virus, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said. The samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.

The duck flock has an estimated 4000 birds, the agency said. Now, 78 other commercial poultry farms in the same area have been quarantined and their flocks are being tested for this latest strain of the avian flu.

The animal health board in an announcement Thursday night [7 Apr 2022] did not say whether the ducks would be killed, which has happened with 6 turkey farms in southern Indiana's Dubois and Greene counties.

So far this year [2022], there have been cases of bird flu in 24 states affecting chickens and turkeys.

Pending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus that has been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.

Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.

Even if you just have chickens in your backyard, the state's animal health experts say now's the time to watch for issues.

"A sudden die off of a large number of birds, if they have respiratory problems, crusty eyes, discoloration of their heads, swollen heads that type of thing, just generally ill like that," said Denise Derrer Spears with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. "If you're concerned, you can call the state to ask about testing if you think there's a problem."

The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.

"Food safety wise, your eggs, your poultry, your chicken, your turkey, all the meats are safe to eat, so that's not an issue," Spears said. "Any of those birds and eggs get tested before they get sent to processing."

Four additional cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were confirmed in commercial turkey flocks in South Dakota on [5 Apr 2022].

The same day [5 Apr 2022], HPAI cases were confirmed in North Carolina, Missouri and Iowa. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), each of the 4 new South Dakota cases was confirmed in a different county.

In Falk County, a flock of 48 114 turkeys was affected, while a flock of 24 000 turkeys was affected in Clark County. A case in Spink County affected 26 500 turkeys, while a case in Beadle County affected 57 000 turkeys.

APHIS announced that an earlier reported presumed-positive case in a commercial turkey flock in Wayne County, North Carolina, has become a confirmed case. There were 14 175 turkeys in that flock. Two other suspect cases in Clark County -- both of which involved commercial broiler flocks -- had not yet been confirmed.

In Iowa, the presence of HPAI in a commercial turkey flock in Hardin County was confirmed, with 40 000 turkeys affected.

APHIS also confirmed the presence of HPAI in a commercial poultry flock in Lawrence County, Missouri, but the agency did not specify the type of commercial operation affected. The number of birds in that flock has not yet been announced.

That same day [5 Apr 2022], APHIS updated the list on its website to include 6 new cases of HPAI in Minnesota which were earlier announced by the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. With those new cases, avian influenza's toll in Minnesota has topped 1 million birds.

The 2022 HPAI outbreak in North America has affected 24.1 million head of commercial poultry.

The highly contagious bird flu that has resulted in the euthanizing of millions of captive birds across the state has now spread to a flock in northern Wisconsin.

A case of "highly pathogenic avian influenza" was found in a commercial poultry flock in Barron County -- the 4th captive flock in the state found to be infected, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection said Saturday [9 Apr 2022]. All birds on the property are going to be euthanized to prevent further spread of the disease, the DATCP said.

This strain of the bird flu, called EA (East Asian) H5N1, is deadly to captive and domesticated birds -- such as those found in farms, zoos and in people's homes -- but is not as dangerous to the wild birds spreading it throughout the state.

Last week, the state Department of Natural Resources said the strain was found in several wild species of birds in Dane, Columbia, Grant, Milwaukee and Polk counties, meaning wild birds are actively spreading the virus in Wisconsin.

So far, the strain has been found in flocks in Jefferson, Rock and Racine counties. All of the birds in those flocks have been euthanized to prevent further spread. In just one of those depopulations, nearly 3 million chickens were euthanized.

Bird flu does not pose a public health concern because the virus is not spreading to humans. Cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees [F, 74 deg C] kills the virus, DATCP said.

But the continued spread of the disease in Wisconsin could threaten birds in zoos, pet birds and the egg and poultry industry. Dane County's Vilas Zoo closed its bird exhibits on [22 Mar 2022] because of the outbreak.

On Friday [8 Apr 2022], DATCP announced it is suspending all poultry shows, exhibitions and swap meets throughout Wisconsin until [31 May 2022] to try to prevent the spread.

The DNR is asking residents to call if they see waterfowl, raptors such as eagles, or avian scavengers such as crows, ravens and gulls displaying tremors, circling movement or holding their heads in strange positions. Residents are also asked not to touch sick or dead birds.

DATCP is encouraging residents with their own flocks to call during business hours or after hours and weekends if they spot signs of infected birds, which include:
• Sudden death without clinical signs.
• Lack of energy or appetite.
• Decrease in egg production; soft, misshapen eggs.
• Purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs.
• Difficulty breathing.
• Runny nose, coughing, sneezing.
• Stumbling or falling down.
• Diarrhea.

The bird flu is spreading through Maine with another case reported, this time in a new county. Officials said this latest report is in Waldo County and involves 47 birds from a backyard mixed species.

It is now the 12th case in the state, with nearly 900 birds killed as a result.

The state says migratory birds are the culprits for spreading the virus, making it a real challenge for the state to control it.

Officials say they are depending on bird owners to help. They say the best way to protect your flock is to keep them inside.

If you do see dead birds, contact the state as that is an indicator of the virus.

Experts say warmer months should help the avian flu to subside, but it will likely return in the fall.

[7] Vermont (Grand Isle and Chittenden Counties): wild birds

A deadly strain of bird flu sweeping through flocks around the country is in Vermont.

At least 2 bald eagles were found dead and tested positive for avian influenza, known as bird flu.

The eagles were found in Grand Isle and Chittenden counties near Lake Champlain.

Bird flu has been spreading across the country, and it has hit the Green Mountain State.

The CDC says the risk to the general public from this strain is low.

David Mears of Audubon Vermont says we need to learn more before we know how much of a risk this will be to bird populations here.

"It's too soon to know but definitely of concern. We just recently recovered the bald eagle from the endangered status, we don't want to see it go back that direction. But it's of significant concern to the poultry industry," Mears said.

A concern, but it's important to note there are no confirmed cases in poultry in Vermont.

The state says the virus is often initially introduced to domestic poultry by infected wild birds, through direct contact or contact with their droppings.

The state adds anyone involved with poultry, from the small backyard coop to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds.

Areas where birds congregate are a concern, so Audubon Vermont wants you to take down your bird feeders now. You're supposed to anyway to avoid attracting bears.

If you see any dead birds, not just bald eagles, the state wants to hear from you. Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the USDA or Vermont authorities through USDA's toll-free number as soon as possible.

[As one can see, the cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 are spreading rapidly across North America. This disease is extremely contagious among birds and spreads very rapidly. It is resulting in the destruction of millions upon millions of birds. It is devastating to producers, to owners, regardless of the size of their operation or their back yard birds. The disease does not discriminate regarding size of flocks or species of birds.

It is critical to protect your birds. Bring them inside. Then practice biosecurity with a consciousness of protecting the birds. Before you go into any bird area, be sure to have on clean boots (that have never been used around other birds), clean scrubs/coveralls, hair nets, gloves, and by all means blow your nose before you enter the facility. While this may seem like a lot, the safety of the birds, yours or someone else's, should make it worthwhile. - Mod.TG
