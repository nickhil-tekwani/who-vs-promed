CHOLERA - UK, IMPORTED FROM INDIA: RFI
======================================
Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 17:27:27 GMT
From: "Dr Robert N Davidson [Infection and Tropical Medicine]"
<r.n.davidson@ic.ac.uk>

We would be interested to hear of other cases of cholera imported from Bombay.
On Mar.21, 1997, we received from London Heathrow Port Health a 57 yr old lady
with onset during the flight of very severe watery diarrhoea and vomiting.
She had severe dehydration and hypovolaemic shock (unrecordable BP, no
peripheral pulses) but was energetically and successfully resuscitated upon
arrival at our Unit (Lister Unit for Infection and Tropical Diseases,
Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow UK). The stool grew _Vibrio cholerae_, biotype
El Tor 01, serotype Ogawa; sensitive to doxycycline and ciprofloxacin.

The patient was discharged home in good health today (Mar.27). She had
been travelling in Baroda and Bombay; had observed very careful food hygiene
and said she only consumed bottled water. She had not been immunised against
cholera.
[I hope this has been duly reported to WHO Geneva as required under the
International Health Regulations? - Mod.JW]
