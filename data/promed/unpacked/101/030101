Russia dysentery bug fells 1000
-----------------------
MOSCOW, Russia (AP) -- More than 1000 people have been hospitalized
in a dysentery outbreak across southern Russia, emergency officials
said.
As of Saturday morning, 9 Oct 2002, 1171 people, including 796
children under age 14 were been treated with suspected dysentery,
said Alexander Lemeshev of the Emergency Situations Ministry. He
said the dysentery bacillus [presumably _Shigella species_ - Mod.LL]
so far had been found in 120 patients.
Authorities continued combing store shelves and seizing products from
a dairy that has been blamed for the outbreak. The dairy, located in
the town of Kropotkin in the Krasnodar region, about 1200 kilometers
(750 miles) south of Moscow, was shut down on Wednesday, 6 Oct, and
its products were banned from sale.
Health officials stepped up inspections at other dairies in the
region, Lemeshev said.

Suspected dysentery outbreak in Russia affects 1137
----------------------------------------------
A total of 1137 people, 80% of them children, have been admitted to
hospitals in southern Russia as suspected dysentery cases, Russian
television said on Friday evening, 8 Oct 2002.
ORT television said the number was cited at a conference in
Kropotkin, Krasnodar region, chaired by chief Russian sanitary
official Gennady Onishchenko. The conference heard statistics on a
recent outbreak of disease that swept across the regions of
Krasnodar, Stavropol, North Ossetia, Adygea, and Rostov.
Onishchenko confirmed at the conference that milk products
manufactured by the Kropotkin dairy factory were considered the
likeliest cause of the outbreak.
"Today's inspection of this enterprise showed a number of gross
violations in the technology of manufacture of milk products," he
said. He proposed as the main measure that the factory's entire
contaminated output be removed from the retail network. He
complained that poisoned products were still on sale in many of the
bigger cities.
He also denied rumors that there may have been dysentery germs in
drinking water. "Water tests have already been made in all regions of
southern Russia without exception" and have shown zero content of
dysentery germs, ORT quoted Onishchenko as saying.
The epidemic has shown signs of decline - more than 100 people were
discharged from hospital on Friday and another 110 are due to go home
on Saturday.
