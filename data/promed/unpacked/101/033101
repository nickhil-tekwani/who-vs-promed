1st report of Australian grapevine viroid from the Mediterranean region
A. Elleuch (Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire, Immunologie et
Biotechnologie, Faculte des Sciences de Tunis, Campus Universitaire El
Manar1 2092 Tunis, Tunisia), M. Marrakchi (as for Elleuch), J.P. Perreault
(RNA group/Groupe ARN, Departement de biochimie, Faculte de Medecine,
Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, J1H 5N4, Canada), and H.
Fakhfakh <hatem.fakhfakh@fsb.rnu.tn> (as for Elleuch).
Of 5 different viroids infecting grapevines, Australian grapevine viroid
(AGVd) is the least studied. Here we report the use of RT-PCR for the
detection of this viroid from infected grapevines in Tunisia. RT-PCR
results were confirmed by cDNA sequencing.
The data presented indicate a wider geographical distribution of this
viroid than previously reported and record its occurrence in Africa. The
molecular variability of AGVd from 2 different cultivars, Carignan and
Syrah, was studied by restriction analyses and by cDNA sequencing. Sequence
variability was not clustered in any specific domain or region of the genome.
This is the first report of AGVd from the Mediterranean region.

[There are now at least 6 grapevine-infecting viroids (Hop stunt (HSVd),
Citrus exocortis (CEVd), Grapevine yellow speckle (GYSVd 1 and 2),
Australian grapevine (AGVd), and Grapevine 1B). These pathogens are
ubiquitous, and unfortunately some induce ephemeral symptoms that
complicate their detection. PCR-based diagnostic detection systems are now
available for some of them. AGVd appears to be the result of recombination
between nucleotide sequences in PSTVd, CEVd, Apple scar skin viroid
(ASSVd), and GYySVD-1. Interestingly, Vein banding disease in grapevine
results from the synergistic interaction between grapevine viroids and
Grapevine fanleaf nepovirus. There is evidence that some viroids are seed-
and pollen-transmitted in grapevine. Disease management requires the
planting of viroid-free planting stock, sterilization of pruning tools, and
eradication of infected vines. - Mod.DH]
