[On 23 Dec 2021, a media report mentioned that: "A cocktail of factors has hit the Russian pork production in 2021, causing a drop in pork production in Central Russia after several decades of consistent growth". Within which African swine fever (ASF) has been one of the biggest factors, claiming lives of 700 000 pigs in Tver, Pskov, Tambov and Voronezh regions in late 2020 and early 2021. The intensified ASF epidemic entailed long-term consequences for pork production in Russia.
