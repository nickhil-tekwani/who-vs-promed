Banana farmers suffer losses from disease
-----------------------------------------
The banana crop in the Jasin district [of Melaka State] is hit by a
rare disease that blackened the fruits since early last month [June
2009] causing farmers to suffer losses.

A farmer who had since reported a loss of RM 10 000 [USD 2800] said
the disease rendered the crop in his 10-hectare [25-acre] farms [near
Jasin city] inedible. The harvest from the district is sought for
banana fritter and chips, he told Bernama.

The farmer who is also a director of Jasin Area Farmers Organisation,
said banana smallholders in Jasin were losing between RM 200 [USD 56]
and RM 300 [USD 84] a month.

"I learned that banana farms in northern Johor are also hit by the
disease," he said, adding that his banana farms in Durian Tunggal
[Negeri Sembilan State] and Selandar [Melaka, about 25 km (15.5 mi)
north of Jasin city] were not affected. He said he was astonished as
the disease hit only ripe bananas.

[Banana is one of the most important fruit crops in Malaysia with most
of the bananas produced in the country consumed locally. Banana
cultivation is carried out largely by smallholders who are often not
trained well in disease management, and diseases are the major
constraint to the crop nationally. Poor quality planting material
lacking disease resistance and certification of pathogen freedom is
also considered a problem. A general increase in banana diseases,
especially panama disease (ProMED-mail post 20080816.2541), has been
reported from Malaysia in recent years.

From the report above, it is impossible to draw conclusions about the
cause of the problem, or whether it is the same as reported at the end
of 2008 from Johor (ProMED-mail post 20081215.3937). Only fruit
symptoms are mentioned, and premature ripening or blackening of fruit
may be due to fungal or bacterial pathogens, or other factors. We
would be most grateful for any further information on possible
pathogens involved in the reported problem.
