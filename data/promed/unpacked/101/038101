In London, 2 individuals have been diagnosed with monkeypox, confirms the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The cases live together in the same household. They are not linked to the previous confirmed case announced on 7 May [2022]. Where and how they acquired their infection remains under investigation.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild, self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some people.

The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.

One of the cases is receiving care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London. The other case is isolating and does not currently require hospital treatment.

As a precautionary measure, UKHSA experts are working closely with the individuals and NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact to provide information and health advice.

People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity to the individuals are being contacted to ensure that, if they do become unwell, they can be treated quickly.

Dr Colin Brown, director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said, "We have confirmed 2 new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on 7 May [2022]. While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low.

"We are contacting any potential close contacts of the case. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.

"UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed."

Professor Julian Redhead, medical director at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said, "We are caring for a patient in our specialist high-consequence infectious diseases unit at St Mary's Hospital. All of the necessary infectious control procedures have been followed, and we are working closely with UKHSA and NHS England."

Symptoms
Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion.

A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet.

The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

Health chiefs are on high alert amid fears 3 people have caught the rare and deadly monkeypox virus. The patients are under strict quarantine in their home after a close contact in London was confirmed as having the killer bug.

It's thought the trio flew from England to Glasgow without knowing their associate was infected.

Monkeypox is mainly spread by wild animals in West Africa and can cause severe illness or even death.

A source said the revelation is similar to the case of Scots nurse [PC] who contracted Ebola while working in the same region.

They said: "It's the same alert level as Ebola. There are 3 people who have been identified as close contacts, but we have to be prepared for more. It's like [PC] all over again."

A spokeswoman for Public Health Scotland said, "We are liaising with the UK Health Security Agency over the contact tracing of a small number of individuals related to the monkeypox case identified in England. This is a standard and precautionary exercise, and the risk to the general public remains very low."

'Patient zero' recently arrived in the UK from Nigeria, where they are understood to have contracted the bug. Medics are treating them at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust.

Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said, "Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk is very low.

"We are working to contact the individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.

"UKHSA and the NHS have well-established infection control procedures."

Up to one in 10 cases of monkeypox can be fatal, according to the World Health Organisation.

Britain's 1st case of the illness was in 2018, when the person was also believed to have been to Nigeria.

[The above report indicates that there are 2 new monkeypox (MPX) cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on 7 May [2022]. The 2 infected individuals live in the same household. Although not entirely clear, it appears that both had been in Nigeria and acquired the MPX infections there. We are not given the dates when they entered the UK or when one of them was hospitalized. Monkeypox (MPX) cases have been reported in Nigeria since 2017, and transmission of the virus continues there.

The question remains about the source of these recent infections and the cases above. As mentioned before, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrences of MPX cases can be expected.

A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently. Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced on 11 Jun 2021 that the company was recently engaged by Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to supply its IMVANEX smallpox vaccine in response to new cases of monkeypox in the UK. Even if a vaccine were available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge. - Mod.TY
