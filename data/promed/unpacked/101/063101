ProMED-mail received a message from Dr. Simon Mardel regarding the recent and
on-going outbreak of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone. I footnoted that message
with comments of my own, as ProMED-mail Moderator. In response we received
and posted a message from Dr. C.J. Peters, Chief of the Special Pathogens
Branch, U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta.
Dr. Mardel had indicated that one obstacle to adequate treatment of patients
in Sierra Leone was the lack of availability of ribavirin, an antiviral shown
to be efficacious in the treatment of this and other virus diseases. Dr.
Mardel also had indicated that ribavirin was no longer being produced in the
U.S. In a separate message to ProMED-mail, I asked a number of questions,
simply from ignorance and because I was certain that if I wanted to know why
ribavirin was not being produced in the U.S. others also would want to know.
We received comments from a number of subscribers (and from people who are
not subscribers but who had had the postings forwarded to them by others who
do subscribe). Forgive me if I do not mention the names of who sent what,
but there would be no real purpose in this. Three people wrote to say that
the postings were excellent; we are appreciative but did not find this
helpful to us in this particular endeavor.
One other person said that "ribavirin is widely available in China and Korea.
It is widely used in those countries. Only in the USA and Western Europe
does ribavirin find limited application. Ribavirin is not particularly
costly..." and went on to ask if I "want to buy ribavirin? How much do you
want? Do you want the raw material or capsules?" and "Do you study
ribavirin?" From this message I have a vision of a guy who is making this
stuff in his garage and can "get me a deal". No real information here, so I
moved on.
Another person said the claim that ribavirin is not produced in the U.S. is
not true and went on to provide second-hand information. Again I moved on.
Another person provided information straight from Goodman and Gilman and from
his memory, some useful historical perspectives about the aerosol version of
ribavirin known as Virazole, as well as some suggestions for obtaining more
information.
Another wrote from Europe to say that ribavirin is sold under various names
in various European countries. For all I know, the manufacturer is the same
for all of them. This person also indicated that she saw "no reason why the
drug should be so expensive or in [such] short supply".
What we wanted were first-hand facts about the availability or lack of
availability of ribavirin. Therefore, I made some semidiscreet inquiries and
summarize the responses below.
1. We have information from two people who ought to know, that
ribavirin (a) is and (b) is not now being produced. Unsubstantiated hearsay
has it that after a manufacturing difficulty, a new lot will be available
early this summer.
2. If this drug "should be" inexpensive and it is not, why not?
Various estimates of a course of treatment ran from "very little" to >$1000.
3. One suggestion was that when this drug is "off patent" perhaps the
Government should manufacture it.
4. Short-term and long-term ribavirin supply problems are quite
different.
There are other pieces of information we received but I do not feel
comfortable posting them. However, I will continue to work to see that the
lack of an adequate and inexpensive supply of ribavirin is addressed and that
ribavirin becomes available to laboratory workers and to peacekeeping
personnel.
Ribavirin is an antiviral that promises to be useful for application against
a variety of viruses, some of them exotic to the U.S. However, the fact that
it takes someone a relatively short time to get on a plane and land in the
middle of an area epidemic for one of these viruses, modifies the definition
of "exotic". In addition, given that United Nations forces hop from this to
that trouble spot (my definition: a place where people have temporarily lost
their collective civility), U.N. peacekeeping troops at this moment could be
at risk to a number of recognized or previously unrecognized viruses.
Therefore, the need for a military supply of ribavirin is high and the need
for an auxiliary supply of ribavirin is desirable for humanitarian purposes.
If we cannot protect our laboratory personnel after inadvertent exposure,
cannot protect our troops from sporadic disease (such as Congo-Crimean
hemorrhagic fever), and cannot protect civilians in an epidemic zone (for
Lassa fever or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome), what CAN we do? The
risk also is high that a lunatic might test the system. We cannot have
that.
Until the manufacturer has submitted data demonstrating the efficacy of
ribavirin, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cannot consider approving
it. This is not a question of blame, it a question of problem-solving.
Seems like a simple problem to me, but I am a baseball umpire and lots of
things seem simple to me.
When we have received definitive information about the solution to this
dilemma, we will post it on ProMED-mail. Thanks for your patience.
