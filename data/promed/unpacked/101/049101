Over half a million poultry birds have been killed in and around
Khurrianwala and Jaranwala due to the spread of a mysterious
disease among them.
According to poultry farmers, this virus [sic has caused the
mortality rate in the broilers and layers to increase 60 percent.
Poultry Production Department has opened two camps at
Khurrianwala and Jaranwala and collected the dead birds from
poultry farms to ascertain the nature of the virus so that the
spread can properly be tackled.

[Faisalabad is in northern Pakistan, about 150km (100 miles) west
of Lahore, which is on the border with India. You can't say it's a
virus until it's been identified -- it could be a bacterium or parasite,
for example. Let's hope it's not another virulent mutant Newcastle
disease virus like the one in Australia. If anyone knows the cause,
please tell us - Mod.JW
