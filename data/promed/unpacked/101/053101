[The following statement is summarized from an ICA [Colombian Agricultural and Livestock Institute] press release reported on 26 Oct 2018:

The affected premises belongs to the Wayuu indigenous community.

"ICA's National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory conducted molecular tests (PCR) that were positive, and virus isolation tests where FMD serotype O was identified. Following this testing, ICA indicated that the virus isolated from this new outbreak is directly related with the virus that has been circulating in the Department of Cesar (see ProMED-mail posting 20181012.6087823), ICA quarantined the premises, placed movement control measures on the premises, and started cleaning and disinfection procedures.

The government has called on all livestock owners to vaccinate their animals against the disease and to continue reporting any suspect clinical signs they observe in their animals. In addition, the federal government has called on all points of control and all department and local governments to counter and address the entry of illegal animals in the country since most of the smuggling comes from Venezuela."
