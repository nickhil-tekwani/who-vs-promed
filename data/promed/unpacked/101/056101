A Comment from Drs Wolfgang Preiser and Rene Gottschalk
-------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the outbreak of respiratory illness outbreak in children in
Guangdong, China whose etiology is still unclear, we would like to
draw attention to the fact that, despite the clinically less severe
course of SARS illness in children compared to adult patients, SARS
will have to be ruled out as a differential diagnosis.
In accordance with current WHO recommendations, Guangdong is in the
highest risk category ("Emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from
wildlife or other animal reservoirs").
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_1/en/>),
In our opinion, the affected children should be tested for infection
with SARS-CoV or closely related coronaviruses "as part of enhanced
surveillance for SARS in populations at risk", following of course
the stringent rules for virological laboratory testing as stipulated
by WHO to avoid false alerts.

[Drs Preiser and Gottschalk raise an important issue. However, the
initial concern in my comment was to emphasize that no specific
diagnosis had been made, and that the terms "influenza" and "flu"
were being used only in the symptomatic sense of acute febrile
respiratory infections. Consequently, there was no reason -- other
than geography -- to suspect that avian influenza virus might be the
cause of this outbreak. On the evidence available, any respiratory
tract viral pathogen might be the culprit, including of course both
SARS-related and non-SARS-related coronaviruses. - Mod.CP]
