[1] China's Ministry of Agriculture data on H7N9 in pigeons
Date: Wed 1 May 2013
From: Dan Silver <dgsilver@yahoo.com> [edited]


In response to ProMED-mail's request, I've aggregated H7N9 reports on China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) website. Between 4 and 26 Apr 2013, a total of 46 samples from (eastern) China tested positive for H7N9.

The positive samples were derived from:
Chicken: 29
Pigeon: 5
Duck: 3
Environmental: 9

MOA provides the location in China where each positive sample was found.

Here is the information reported by MOA on the 5 positive samples from pigeons [The numbers of the corresponding ProMED-mail postings, citing the relevant OIE notifications, are added in brackets].

1. Type: Pigeon
Sample taken from: Huhuai Agricultural Products Wholesale Market, Songjiang District, Shanghai.
MOA published report date: 4 Apr 2013 [According to OIE immediate notification, 4 Apr 2013: "A pigeon for consumption in a wholesale market"].

2-3. Type: Pigeon (translated as "Columba," but the Chinese word is basically "pigeon").
The 2 samples have been taken from: Fengzhuang Market, Minhang District, Shanghai.
MOA published report date: 5 Apr 2013.

4. Type: Rock dove
Sample taken from: Qinhuai District, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province.
MOA published report date: 16 Apr 2013 [according to OIE follow-up report No.3, 16 Apr 2013: "wild pigeon"].

5. Type: Carrier pigeon
Sample taken from: Pigeon Farm ("Pigeon Raiser"), Haian County, Nantong, Jiangsu Province.
MOA published report date: 22 Apr 2013 [according to OIE follow-up report No.4, 22 Apr 2013: one sample from a pigeon in a farm, no deaths, all 340 susceptibles, including the case, were destroyed].

[2] H7 suspected in Guangdong
Date: Wed 1 May 2013
Source: Xinhua [in Chinese, machine trans. summarized, edited]

A Xinhua reporter has learned from Guangdong Province that from 3-5 May 2013, all live poultry markets in the province are to be closed for one day in order to apply comprehensive cleaning and disinfection to prevent and control human infection with avian influenza virus H7N9.

According to the vice governor of Guangdong Province, 3 samples from a local wholesale market have been found suspected as infected by an H7 subtype of the avian influenza virus. This is regarded as indicative of a clear risk for human health in the province.

The vice governor, Lin Shaochun, said that, to minimize risk, it is important to strengthen strict control measures in the poultry market, including daily and weekly clean-up procedures. The Guangdong provincial government decided that between 3 and 5 May, all activities in the live poultry markets in the province will be stopped for a day to carry out comprehensive cleaning and disinfection.

[Though reports on the detection of H7-contaminated samples from a live market in Guangdong have been published by the media already on 27 Apr 2013, it is not clear why a confirmation or otherwise has not been published by a reference laboratory yet. Guangdong, a south eastern Chinese province bordering Hong Kong, has not reported, so far, any case in humans. In case the suspicion is confirmed, this will become the very 1st case of animals being sentinels for humans during the emerging H7N9 epidemic. - Mod.AS]

[3] Comments on item 3 in posting 20130429.1679734
Date: Wed 1 May 2013
From: Jack Woodall <jackwoodall13@gmail.com>


Regarding section [3] of "Avian influenza (47): China zoonotic LPAI H7N9, animal," available at http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20130429.1679734, I have the following observations on the journal article:

- There is no evidence (yet) that pigs are involved, and the authors admit it is speculation.

- The only wild bird from which H7N9 RNA has been detected so far is one feral pigeon, and pigeons don't migrate.

- Many of the gene segments of the new H7N9 are the same as those of an H9N2 avian strain (A/brambling/Beijing/16/2012) registered last year [2012]; ref. 2013 Andrew Rambaut, Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/influenza_H7N9_analysis.

This came from a wide-ranging finch, a sparrow-sized bird called a brambling (_Fringilla montifringilla_) in Beijing; see illustration at http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_unmHAncyD4E/TI4MA2gZwtI/AAAAAAAABT0/MJem4KQYvRk/s1600/brambling_300_tcm9-139624_v2.jpg and its range map at: http://www.planetofbirds.com/Master/PASSERIFORMES/Fringillidae/maps/Brambling.gif.

Note that the range of this wild bird is from western Europe to China and across to Alaska, but no detection of H7N9 from this finch has been reported.

- At the end of part 4 of the full paper in the Chinese Science Bulletin http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11434-013-5880-5.pdf, the authors suggest, as a preventive measure, the use of "sanitary electronic live bird markets". I don't understand what those are, unless they mean internet trading, but they also say "far away from residential areas", which suggests a physical location. Shanghai-based Tony's Farm and Beijing-based Tootoo.cn (http://www.tootoo.cn) halted internet sales by 7 Apr 2013 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/alibaba-s-taobao-bans-live-poultry-trading-on-bird-flu.html.

Lastly, there is a misprint in the 1st author's name in the citation at the end of the abstract, spelling it Zhang without a U. The original source shows Zhuang QY, as can be confirmed on PubMed for his (her?) other publications.
