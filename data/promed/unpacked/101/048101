A suspected outbreak of avian cholera has killed 1300 to 1500 snow
geese at Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge in north-central
Arkansas, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials.
The dead include some Ross' geese, a smaller cousin of snow geese.
Wildlife officials say humans are not at a high risk for infection
with the bacterial strain causing avian cholera.
Refuge workers found the dead and dying geese Monday, according to
Dennis Widner, head of the agency's East Arkansas refuges that also
include Cache River, Wapanocca and Big Lake.
The refuge is 2 miles south of Bald Knob in White County and is on
the White River. It covers 14 800 acres and is the newest of the
Arkansas national wildlife refuges, created in 1993.
Widner said when the dead snow geese were found, he contacted the
U.S. Geological Survey Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., and
the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University
of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, both leaders in the field
of wildlife diseases.
Based on the description of symptoms provided by the refuge
biologists, experts from both locations suspected avian cholera.
The outbreak is confined at present to snow geese and Ross' geese
with no other species of waterfowl affected, Widner said. The birds
are contained in a part of the refuge that is designated as a
sanctuary and not accessible to the public.
"We are doing everything possible to contain the disease outbreak
here at the refuge by not disturbing the rest of the flock of geese
here now," Widner said. "While we can't capture the thousands of
geese here, our recovery operations are designed to not chase them
away from this site. This should help reduce the chance of spreading
the disease."
Dr. Lou Sileo, a wildlife pathologist from the National Wildlife
Health Center, made a field diagnosis at the refuge this week and
said the snow geese found dead on the Bald Knob refuge most likely
died from avian cholera, a bacterial infection which is one of the
most prevalent diseases in waterfowl populations nationally.
Specimens have also been collected and shipped to the NWHC for
complete necropsies, which is standard procedure to confirm the field
diagnosis, he said.
"We have done field necropsies that have all indicated avian cholera
as the cause of death," said Sileo. "We will need laboratory
confirmation to be 100 percent certain."
Outbreaks of avian cholera are fairly common, especially in
California, Texas and Oklahoma, and occur among many waterfowl
species, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.
In the past 6 years, there have been 41 outbreaks of avian cholera
across the United States that killed nearly 70 000 geese, ducks,
grebes and other species.
Snow geese populations have greatly expanded in the past 2
decades. Waterfowl biologists are concerned that the large numbers
of snow geese are destroying the prime nesting habitat for all bird
species and other wildlife in the Hudson Bay area of Canada.
Concentrations of wintering snow geese continue to grow each year in
Arkansas and surrounding states. Fish and Wildlife officials said the
growth could be a contributing factor to infection outbreaks. Another
factor may be reduced habitat from lack of rain that concentrates
flocks onto smaller wetlands -- increasing the transmission of disease.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has liberalized snow geese hunting
regulations to reduce the size of their populations and thin out the
number of birds on the breeding grounds in Canada and the affects on
other species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service says persons around wild birds should:
-Observe wildlife, including wild birds, from a distance to prevent
possible exposure to pathogens and to minimize disturbance.
-Avoid touching wildlife. If there is contact with wildlife do not
rub eyes, eat, drink or smoke before washing hands with soap and water.
-Avoid picking up diseased or dead wildlife. Contact a state or
federal wildlife agency if a sick or dead animal is found.
-Avoid handling or eating sick game.
-Wear rubber or disposable latex gloves while handling and cleaning
game, wash hands and thoroughly clean knives, equipment and surfaces
that come in contact with game.
-Thoroughly cook game (well done or 160 degrees Fahrenheit).

[Avian Cholera is caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_
Type 1. The disease may be transmitted by aerosol or by contact
between birds, primarily through feces or consumption of contaminated
feed or water.
Generally, the 1st sign of the disease is large die-offs of
apparently healthy birds. Ducks are sensitive to the disease and are
affected peracutely. The birds are generally in good flesh and may
literally fall from the sky if affected while in flight, or die while
eating with no other clinical signs. Birds less acutely affected may
appear ill with listlessness, swimming in circles, and erratic
flight. They also have a mucous discharge from the mouth, and there
may be blood; the vent is generally matted, and the droppings are
pasty with a tan to yellow color.
The disease is easily and rapidly spread. Carcass removal is
essential to controlling the disease. Although humans are generally
not considered to be at risk of contracting this disease, gloves are
recommended when handling the carcasses or sick birds. Thorough hand
washings are also recommended, even if gloves are worn. - Mod.TG]
