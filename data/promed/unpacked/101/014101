1st report of Chilli leaf curl virus affecting chilli in India

publication 23 May 2006.
Chilli (_Capsicum annuum_) is an important spice crop cultivated
throughout India. Leaf curl disease of Chilli has emerged as a
serious problem in the Jodhpur district, the major chilli growing
area of Rajasthan state. During December 2004, very high disease
incidence (up to 100 percent of plants) was observed in farmer's
fields in Narwa and Tinwari villages. The characteristic field
symptoms were upward curling, puckering and reduced size of leaves.
Severely affected plants were stunted and produced no fruit. The
virus from field samples from Narwa village was transmitted by
whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_) to 50-100 percent of chilli test plants,
which produced vein clearing, curling and stunting symptoms. Electron
microscopic examination of field samples revealed few, typical
geminate particles. Sequence analysis showed that the virus isolated
from Jodhpur was distantly related (59.1-67.9 percent identity) to
CLCuMV, PepYLCIDV and ToLCNDV. However, it shared 96.5 percent
identity with ChiLCuV-[Pak:Mul]. Given the close sequence identity
with ChiLCuV-[Pk:Mul], the virus isolated from Jodhpur is considered
to be ChiLCuV. To our knowledge this is the 1st report of ChiLCuV
affecting chilli in India. Our findings along with the recent report
of Khan et al. (2005) show that chilli leaf curl in India is caused
by more than one begomovirus.

In July 2004, a survey of plants with virus disease symptoms was
conducted in the Seychelles archipelago on Mahe Island, located north
of Madagascar. A small number of leaf samples showing curling
symptoms were collected from bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), pepper
(_Capsicum annuum_) and tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_). Leaf
extracts were tested for the presence of begomoviruses by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). using 2 sets of degenerate primers designed to
amplify portions of the coat protein (CP) gene of the DNA A
component. No PCR products were obtained from pepper or bean leaf
extracts. For 2 tomato samples, PCR products of the expected size
were obtained with both sets of primers. Analysis showed between 88
percent and 89 percent nucleotide sequence identity with ToLCYTV
isolates (AJ865339 and AJ865340) and between 85 and 86 percent
identity with Tomato yellow leaf curl virus isolates from Reunion
Island (TYLCV-[RE], AM234066; and TYLCV-Mld[RE], AJ865337). These
results suggest the presence of a new tomato begomovirus in the
Seychelles archipelago; genetically related to the ToLCYTV isolates
and so to the African tomato monopartite begomoviruses previously
identified in the South West Islands of the Indian Ocean (Delatte et
al., 2005). The new virus is tentatively named Tomato leaf curl
Seychelles virus (ToLCSCV).

1st report of Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus infecting kidney
bean in China
-----------------------------------------------
J.H. Dong, Y.Q. Luo, M. Ding, Z.K. Zhang* and C.K Yang Institute of
Biotechnology and Genetic Resources, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, Kunming 650223, China *<Zhongkai99@sina.com>. Accepted for
publication 16 May 2006.
In 2004, a virus isolate (Bean-YM) was obtained from Kidney bean
(_Phaseolus vulgaris_) showing leaf curl symptoms (Fig. 1) from
Yuanmou, in the Yunnan province of China. Sequence comparison showed
that the begomovirus cDNA fragment was most closely related to Tomato
yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) isolate [Y43] (Acc. No.
AJ781302) with 92 percent nucleotide sequence identity. The complete
DNA-A sequence of Bean-YM was determined to be 2731 nucleotides
(DQ256460). Comparisons with other begomoviruses showed that DNA-A of
Bean-YM is closely related to TYLCCNYV-[Y43] with 92 percent
nucleotide sequence identity.
Figure 1: Symptoms exhibited by kidney bean infected with Tomato
yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) isolate Bean-YM
<http://www.bspp.org.uk/ndr/july2006/2006-33-1.jpg>.
All previously characterized TYLCCNV isolates have been shown to be
associated with DNA beta molecules (Cui et al., 2004). Sequence
analysis revealed that DNA beta of Bean-YM is 1336 nucleotides long
(DQ256459) and most closely related to the DNA beta associated with
TYLCCNV-[Y10] (AJ421621; 80.8 percent nucleotide sequence identity).
TYLCCNV has previously been reported to infect tomato, tobacco and
weeds. This is the 1st report of TYLCCNV infecting a legume.

Molecular Characterization of a Distinct Tomato-Infecting Begomovirus
Associated with Yellow Leaf Curl Diseased Tomato in Lembang, Java
Island of Indonesia.

Three distinct tomato-infecting begomoviruses have been identified
from Indonesia (GenBank Accessions Nos. AB100304, AB100305, and
DQ083765). Severe yellow leaf curl epidemics have been observed on
tomato on Java Island since the late 1990s. Viral DNA was extracted
(2) from one such sample collected in Lembang, West Java in 1998.
Highest nucleotide sequence identity (74.1 percent) was with Tomato
leaf curl Mayotte virus-[Kahani] (GenBank Accession No. AJ865340).
Comparison of the full-length DNA-A sequence with the 3 above
mentioned tomato-infecting begomoviruses from Indonesia also showed
less than 71 percent nucleotide sequence identities. Because the
DNA-A sequence had less than 89 percent identity with other
begomoviruses, it should be classified as a distinct virus according
to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name
Tomato yellow leaf curl Indonesia virus-[Lembang] (TYLCIDV-[Lem]) is
proposed. The presence of at least 4 distinct tomato-infecting
begeminiviruses on Java Island needs to be considered when developing
tomato cultivars with stable resistance to tomato (yellow) leaf curl disease.

[5] Tomato begomovirus - Mozambique: suspected

Mozambique: Line of Credit for Vegetable Producers
-----------------------------------------------
A viral disease has affected tomato production, mainly in the
district of Chokwe, in the southern province of Gaza, Mozambique. The
disease wiped out all the tomato crop of some farmers, and others
lost between 70 and 90 percent of their crop.
Government measures to manage the disease include "the movement of
non-certified tomato seedlings from affected to non-affected areas is
expressly prohibited." The government has also ordered the
destruction of the affected fields as a means to check the disease.
It has also arranged a line of credit of 7 billion meticais (USD 280
000) to help re-launch vegetable and particularly tomato production
in some districts.
Other measures include chemical control of the disease, which means
attempting to kill off the white fly, which transmits the virus, and
enforcing the law on the import of plants and their certification in
their country of origin.
The latest news on the tomato disease is that it has spread from Gaza
into Moamba district, in Maputo province. So far, at least 7 hectares
of tomato are affected in Moamba, and there are fears for this year's
[2006] tomato harvest.
Chokwe and Moamba are the largest tomato-producing areas in
Mozambique. Crop failure here will push Mozambican consumers into
ever greater reliance on South African tomatoes.

[Vegetable crop plants often develop leaf curl symptoms when infected
with begomoviruses. These are ssDNA viruses (family: _Geminiviridae_,
genus: _Begomovirus_) which are transmitted by whiteflies (_Bemisia
tabaci_). They have a great capacity to form hybrids and therefore
new viruses. Once introduced into an area, they are difficult to
control. There are about 100 previous postings on begomoviruses in
ProMED-mail archives (search term: begomovirus or begomoviruses). The
postings included in the "see also" section are for begomoviruses
reported in articles written in 2006.
This is yet another set of reports pointing out the diversity of
begomoviruses, the frequent discovery of new viruses of the group,
the need to prevent their introduction with transplants, and their
increasing importance in worldwide agriculture.
In this posting, new begomoviruses are reported in tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) in the Seychelles archipelago on Mahe
Island, in Lembang, Java Island of Indonesia, and in Mozambique
(suspected); in chilli (_Capsicum annuum_) in Jodhpur, India; in
kidney bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) from Yuanmou, in the Yunnan
province of China. The detection of a Chinese strain of TYLCV in a
legume is noted to be a 1st report. The methods used to clone and
sequence all or parts of the viral ssDNA genomes have been edited out
(see original links for details). The West Java virus seems the least
related to other previously characterized begomoviruses, but all 4
that have been partially or entirely sequenced are unique. The
article from Mozambique repaints the picture of how severe an impact
these viruses are having in developing counties.
