Ten people from the St. Helens area have contracted measles amid the most widespread outbreak of the disease in the area since the 1980s. In total, there have been 301 laboratory-confirmed cases across Merseyside since the start of the year [2012], including 42 in neighbouring Knowsley. A further 148 probable cases are still under investigation.

Dr Roberto Vivancos, a consultant in communicable disease control with the Health Protection Agency, said: "This has been the largest outbreak of measles in the North West since the introduction of MMR vaccine 24 years ago, and it has demonstrated just why this vaccine is so important in protecting the public health. Parents of young children clearly value the protection, security and peace of mind that the MMR vaccine affords, but there remains a pool of older children, teenagers and young adults who are not vaccinated and remain vulnerable to measles, mumps and German measles [rubella]. Our message to older teenagers and young adults is that if you were not vaccinated as children, it's not too late. You should speak to your family doctor about the MMR vaccine because, without its protection, you will remain vulnerable to 3 potentially very serious diseases." Dr Vivancos added: "It is a tribute to the hard work of the team here at the Cheshire and Merseyside Health Protection Unit, and to our colleagues in local NHS services, that this outbreak was largely confined to Liverpool and neighbouring areas.

After the last measles vaccination campaign that took place last April 2012, a new outbreak of the disease has been reported in some communities in Malabo district, and for this reason, the Ministry of Health initiated a new vaccination campaign [Malabo is the capital of Equatorial Guinea, located on the northern coast of Bioko Island. - Mod.CP].

Activities started last Thursday, with the cooperation of the National Vaccination Programme (PAV, according to its Spanish initials). The campaign will concentrate its activities in the most severely affected communities, such as Santa Maria III, Lampert and Sunco.

Some medical officers gathered in Madre Bisila Health Centre in order to organise local vaccination units and to deal with mothers who brought their children to the Health Centre in order to have them vaccinated. Vaccine will be dispensed throughout the next 10 days, and subsequently, the vaccination campaign will continue in the Continental region of Equatorial Guinea.

Local officials from the Ministry of Health are inviting the population, particularly mothers, to bring their children to local health centres or to bring their children to mobile vaccination units when these teams arrive to their communities.

[According to La Voz de Rusia (http://spanish.ruvr.ru/2012_06_22/Guinea-epidemia-sarampion/), the last major measles epidemic in the country occurred in November 2008, when more than a dozen children died in various hospitals in Equatorial Guinea. No fatalities have been reported in the current outbreak so far.

Equatorial Guinea, officially the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, is a country located in central Africa. It has 2 parts: a Continental Region (Rio Muni), including several small offshore islands including Corisco, Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico; and an insular region containing Annobon island and Bioko island (formerly Fernando Po), where the capital Malabo is situated.

Health authorities are investigating the reported emergence of measles in 4 towns in Cebu province. Rennan Cimafranca, epidemiologist of the Department of Health in Central Visayas, said they investigated 61 cases in Barangay [district] Lusong in Tuburan town last month [May 2012]. Cimafranca said there are 32 suspected measles cases in Minglanilla, 15 cases in Barangay Catarman and more than 20 in Barangay Sta. Cruz in Liloan. Five cases were also reported in Barangay Poblacion Dos, Tuburan.

At least 29 blood samples have been taken from patients from the affected areas, and these will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila. Of the batch of blood samples from Lusong, Tuburan, Cimafranca said only one was confirmed by RITM to be positive for rubella virus [causing] German measles. But he said the negative results were not conclusive as the blood samples were probably taken in the later stage of the disease.

Dr. Nayda Bautista, head of DOH Central Visayas' Communicable Diseases Division, said measles is a communicable disease. Bautista said a person with German measles can infect 18 to 20 people within its 14-day incubation period in a human body. German measles, locally known as "dapdap," is the milder form of measles or "tigdas." But the virus, when untreated, could also cause congenital heart defects, among other problems. "Females who contract German measles during pregnancy may give birth to infants who may become deaf or suffer from cataracts and heart defects," said Bautista. Cimafranca said the emergence of the disease may be due to ineffective vaccines or absence of vaccination.

He said the patients may have transferred residence when the government vaccination program was implemented in their area. He said DOH can address the problem by intensifying the government vaccination program.

[In the absence of confirmatory laboratory diagnosis, it is unclear how many of these cases of "measles" have been caused by measles virus infection (causing rubeola), and how many have been caused by rubella virus infection (causing German measles). These viruses are unrelated and responsible for distinctly different diseases. The commonly used MMR triple vaccine provides immunity to both rubeola (sometimes distinguished as English measles) and German measles (rubella).

An outbreak of the highly infectious measles virus [infection] has been contained across the southwest, but doctors are still warning residents to be vigilant of warning signs. The alert comes after an infected person was believed to have been at Mt. Ommaney Shopping Centre at Target and Coles stores and The Nook cafe at Jindalee on 3 Jun 2012. However, Queensland Health has since advised that the 10-day cooling off period for symptoms to surface passed last week with no news of additional outbreaks.

Bywater Medical Jindalee, located nearby The Nook cafe, had recently seen a few children with cold-like symptoms, but said they were not confirmed with the virus. General practioner Dr Luke Holborn said measles is no longer common in Australia due to the successful immunisation program in place. "Measles is very easy to pick up if you have not been vaccinated," Dr Holborn said. "However, the vaccination efficiency is about 99 percent. The key is to make sure mums and dads vaccinate their kids. It's a free injection children receive at 12 months of age and then a booster at 4 years."

In some cases, it can take up to 21 days for symptoms to appear after coming in contact with a contaminated person. Public health medical officer Dr Brad McCall urged people who were in the affected locations during the same time as the infected individual to be wary about their health if they had not been immunised.

"Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases and is spread by tiny droplets through coughing and sneezing," Dr McCall said. "The initial symptoms are fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough, and sore and red eyes, followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash. "The rash starts on the face then becomes widespread."

Queensland Health said the infected person had no history of overseas travel and had acquired the disease in Brisbane. The latest case followed another confirmation of the virus in Brisbane last month [May 2012] believed to have been contracted in Southeast Asia. Dr McCall urged anyone who believed they may have developed these symptoms to contact their GP for advice. "It's very important to call the medical practice 1st to say you could have measles so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others." Queensland Health recommended anyone born during or since 1966 who had not had the 2 documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or proven measles should visit their local GP to be vaccinated.

Dr Holborn said measles could be very distressing and could lead to complications. "One in 1000 confirmed cases will develop pneumonia or encephalitis -- swelling of the brain -- which can result in mental retardation or death," he said.
