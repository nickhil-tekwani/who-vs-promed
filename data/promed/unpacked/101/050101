An official document confirms the deaths of 8 people from Rift Valley fever.

Rift Valley fever (RVF), a disease that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans, has killed 8 people in Mauritania since September [2015], according to a new report released on Saturday [10 Oct 2015] by the World Health Organization (WHO).

"From the beginning, the assessment made by the government (of Mauritania), which ensures transparency, confirmed 8 deaths out of 25 suspected cases," WHO representative in Nouakchott Jean-Pierre Baptiste, explained to the AFP.

The Mauritanian government sent the report to WHO on Friday [9 Oct 2015]. The Mauritanian authorities in charge of this case could not be reached for further information on Saturday [10 Oct 2015].

Mr. Baptiste praised "the strong mobilization of the government for the management of patients suspected of having Rift Valley fever in all affected regions."

The Mauritanian government said that the central and southeast regions were mainly affected by the disease.

During an interview on Friday [9 Oct 2015], the Mauritanian Health Minister, Ahmed Ould Jelvoune, reassured people, declaring that "his government had full control of the situation in the country."

Rift Valley fever, named after the Kenyan region where it was identified in 1931, killed 17 people in Mauritania in 2012.

This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, and, according to WHO, in the vast majority of cases, the infection occurs in humans as a result of direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.

WHO said that there was no treatment, but potential vaccines are in development.

[The report above adds additional information that was not included in the previous RFV report from Mauritania (ProMED-mail archive no. 20151007.3694282), including human case numbers.

As Mod.AB noted: "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by arthropods of the genus _Aedes_.

"The disease was confirmed in Mauritania in the early 2000s, and, since then, it has reappeared recurrently; the most recent epidemic dates back to 2012-2013."

It is still not clear whether epidemiological investigations have been conducted in farm animals, which are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune. RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.
