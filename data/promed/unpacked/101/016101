In Colombia, 2 new cases of monkeypox were detected, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 5, local health authorities reported on Saturday [2 Jul 2022].

The new cases were 2 related adults, one of whom had recently arrived from Europe and infected the other, said Bogota's Secretary of Health Alejandro Gomez, adding the 2 patients are currently in isolation, with their care managed on an outpatient basis.

"We have 4 cases of monkeypox in the city of Bogota, and the 4 cases are not serious," he said, noting, "The epidemiological cordon, contact tracing and the studies are being carried out normally, as is usually done."

The first 3 monkeypox cases in Colombia were detected on 23 Jun 2022 in people who had returned from Europe, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection reported. The ministry has urged the public not to panic but also called on them to stay alert to any symptoms or contact with infected people.

Current situation
-----------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is working with provincial and territorial public health partners to investigate cases of monkeypox in Canada. As the investigation evolves, it is anticipated that additional cases will be reported in Canada. Provinces and territories have publicly reported 300 cases of monkeypox as of 4 Jul 2022 at 1:00 pm EDT.

Jurisdictions in Canada with confirmed cases
--------------------------------------------
Province / Number of confirmed cases
British Columbia / 4
Alberta / 8
Ontario / 77
Quebec / 211
Total: 300

PHAC is continuing to collect and analyze epidemiological information reported by the provinces and territories to help define the national scope of the investigation and to determine if there are any increased health risks to people in Canada. Going forward, case numbers may change as provinces and territories continue to receive confirmatory testing results from PHAC's National Microbiology Laboratory. On an ongoing basis, provinces and territories are reviewing case data in their jurisdictions and those that meet the case definition will be reported to PHAC to be included in the national investigation.

How Canada is monitoring monkeypox
----------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak and the prevention of further spread.

Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of monkeypox occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.

Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory is performing diagnostic testing for the virus that causes monkeypox. In addition, the laboratory is also conducting whole genome sequencing, an enhanced fingerprint analysis, on Canadian samples of monkeypox. This sequencing will help our experts understand the chains of transmission occurring in Canada. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories to provide testing guidance and to increase testing capacity for monkeypox.

Panama registered its 1st case of monkeypox in a resident who was infected after being in contact with tourists from Europe, Panama's health ministry said Tuesday [5 Jul 2022].

"Yesterday [4 Jul 2022] in the afternoon, the 1st case of monkeypox in our country was confirmed," Health Minister Luis Sucre said during a press conference, adding the patient "is completely stable" and the "case is properly controlled."

The patient, whose nationality and sex were not revealed, was isolating at home after being notified of a possible monkeypox infection, Sucre said. The person was later transferred to a medical facility.

There were 3 lesions typical of monkeypox found on the patient's body, though the person is "practically asymptomatic," authorities said. Tests confirmed the patient was infected with the "least serious" strain of monkeypox, which is less lethal, according to the director of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, Juan Pascale.

The Bahamas government has confirmed that health authorities are investigating a 2nd suspected case of monkeypox. Health and Wellness Minister, Dr. Michael Darville, told a news conference that a Bahamian national is suspected of having the virus.

Last month [June 2022], the Health and Wellness Minister had reported that a foreign national who traveled to the country was being closely monitored by health officials and suspected of having the disease. The individual was believed to be in his mid-40s and had been placed in isolation after showing symptoms associated with the disease. He has since been flown out of the country.

Dr. Darville confirmed that the foreigner had indeed tested positive. "Yes, I would like to inform the general public that the suspected case of monkeypox that was in the country on 9 Jun 2022. Our national reference lab did the analysis and that case was confirmed to be monkeypox on the 24 Jun 2022," he said.

"There is another suspected case in the country that we are monitoring. That individual went through the quarantine process, for I think 21 days, and all the contacts associated with that case are also being monitored," he told reporters. He confirmed that the new suspected case has a history of contact with someone from a foreign country.

New monkeypox infections in New York City are up 28% since last Friday [1 Jul 2022], city health officials said Tuesday [5 Jul 2022], as the clock ticks on more vaccine doses to confront the outbreak.

There are now 111 cases, the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene tweeted, versus 87 last Friday [1 Jul 2022]. Cases have now fully doubled in the last week.

The city launched a surprise vaccine clinic last month [June 2022], but it lasted only hours before running out of enough doses of vaccine to handle walk-ins. That situation may improve shortly, though.

"We're expecting to receive more doses of the monkeypox vaccine in coming days and will make appointments available soon," the city tweeted.
