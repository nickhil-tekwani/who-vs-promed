State health officials are investigating a cluster of possible botulism cases in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta that began with a shared meal of fermented fish heads, an epidemiologist said Mon 18 Aug 2014. Of 4 people who ate together last week, one died, and 2 others fell ill, said Louisa Castrodale, an epidemiologist in the Alaska Division of Public Health.

Alaska State Troopers on Sun 17 Aug 2014 evening said the man who died was 59, of Lower Kalskag, a village of about 300 people on the Kuskokwim River 350 miles west of Anchorage. He ate the fish Wed 13 Aug 2014 and complained of seeing double and feeling ill, according to the trooper's report. He was found dead in his home Fri 15 Aug 2014. His body was flown to Anchorage for an autopsy by the state medical examiner.

Health officials are testing samples of the food as well as clinical samples from the people who may have been infected to look for signs of the botulinum toxin. Testing takes about a week, Castrodale said.

Botulism is a life-threatening disease and a public health emergency. The bacteria can incubate in some traditional Alaska native foods including fermented "stink heads," which some in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region consider a delicacy, but others stay away from. The traditional way of aging the fish in grass or straw has given way to glass or plastic containers that can increase the risk, according to a 2011 state report, "Botulism in Alaska."

If officials confirm that the man died from botulism, it will be the 1st Alaska death from the bacteria since 2007, Castrodale said.

Health care providers are urged to immediately report suspected cases to ensure quick treatment and to stop others from eating suspect food. People may suffer from nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, skeletal muscular weakness and partial paralysis.

[Seafood is generally associated with type E botulism. The following article is a review of type E: Horowitz BZ: Type E botulism. Clin Toxicol. 2010;48:880-895.

Abstract:
"There are 7 known serotypes of botulism, designated A through G [now 8 - Mod.LL]; almost all human cases of botulism are caused by types A, B, and E. Botulism type E is the predominant serotype causing disease associated with native Arctic foods. In the circumpolar regions of the world, the coastal soils are rich in botulism type E, and consumption of fish and marine animals in these areas are the sources of clusters of botulism. Unlike spores of type A and B, botulism type E can withstand freezing down to 3.5 C [38 F]. Alaskan native fermentation of fish heads, fish eggs, and beaver tail allow proper anaerobic conditions for botulinum toxin to be elaborated from _Clostridium botulinum_. The consumption of whale meat, "muktuk," has also been associated with outbreaks of botulism in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. Elsewhere in the Arctic regions, type E botulism has been associated with Norwegian "rakfisk" prepared by a process similar to fermented Alaskan foods. Outbreaks in Egypt with the salted gray mullet "faseikh," in Israel and New York linked to salted uneviscerated whitefish "kapchunka," in Iran from eating "ashbal," an uncooked salmon, and in Japan with "izushi," a traditional fermented fish preserved in rice have occurred. Importation of vacuum-packed whitefish from Alaska and Canada has also been associated with sporadic cases of botulism type E in Europe. In March 2010, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention released the heptavalent antitoxin (H-BAT) for use in the USA under an Investigational New Drug program as the preferred treatment for food-borne botulism, including type E, which had not been covered by the bivalent antitoxin, the prior approved antitoxin product in the USA." - Mod.LL
