CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
with the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype I 4,[5],12:i:- infections. Investigators are
using DNA analysis of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through
diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may be part of
this outbreak.

From 1 Nov through 27 Dec 2010, 94 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S. enterica_ serotype I 4,[5],12:i:-, whose
illnesses began since 1 Nov 2010, have been reported from 16 states
and the District of Columbia. The number of ill people identified in
each state with the outbreak strain is as follows: California (1),
Connecticut (1), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (1), Hawaii (1),
Iowa (1), Illinois (51), Indiana (9), Massachusetts (1), Missouri
(17), New York (1), Pennsylvania (2), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (1),
Texas (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (3).

Among 91 persons for whom information is available, illness onset
dates range from 1 Nov to 14 Dec 2010. Case-patients range in age from
1 to 75 years, with a median age of 28; 61 (67 percent) of patients
are female. Among persons with available information, 24 percent
reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Because the
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern associated with this
particular serotype commonly occurs in the USA, some of the cases
identified may not be related to this outbreak.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of local, state, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies have linked this outbreak to
consumption of Tiny Greens Organic Farm's Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy
Sprouts. The sprouts were distributed to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and
Missouri, and may also have been distributed to other Midwestern states.

Approximately half of the illnesses occurred in Illinois, where many
of the ill individuals ate sandwiches containing sprouts at various
Jimmy John's outlets. Jimmy John's restaurants have voluntarily
suspended serving sprouts at their Illinois franchise locations.

This investigation is ongoing. CDC, FDA, and state and local public
health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases and
trace potentially contaminated products. CDC will continue to update
the public on the progress of this investigation as information
becomes available.

Advice to Consumers, Retailers and Others
-----------------------------------------
Since 1996, there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of
foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly
cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_
and _E. coli_. Persons who think they might have become ill from
eating potentially contaminated products should consult their health
care providers.

Below are additional recommendations
------------------------------------
Consumers should not eat Tiny Greens brand Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy
Sprouts, and restaurant and food service operators should not serve
them. Consumers, retailers and others who have Tiny Greens Alfalfa
Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts should dispose of them in a closed plastic
bag placed in a sealed trash can. This will prevent people or animals
from eating them.

Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and persons with weakened
immune systems should avoid eating raw sprouts of any kind (including
alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts).

Cook sprouts thoroughly to reduce the risk of illness. Cooking kills
the harmful bacteria.

Request that raw sprouts not be added to your food. If you purchase a
sandwich or salad at a restaurant or delicatessen, check to make sure
that raw sprouts have not been added.

[Although the overall number of outbreak cases has not increased much
since the last report on 24 Dec 2010, the source of the sprouts has
seemingly been determined on epidemiologic grounds. It has not been
stated whether the same strain was actually isolated from the sprouts.
