An Asian tiger mosquito has been spotted in Eindhoven [North Brabant province], prompting government safety experts to put up more traps around the city in an effort to see if the mosquitoes are breeding. Locals living in a 500 metre [550 yd] radius of the sighting have been sent a letter by the public-safety body, Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit; NVWA), warning about the presence of the mosquito and asking people to empty plant pots that may contain water where the mosquitoes could breed.

The mosquito was caught in a residential area, but it is unclear how it came to be in the hands of the NVWA. The NVWA is going to take steps to eradicate potential breeding grounds. Asian tiger mosquitos have been spotted in Weert, Amstelveen, Assen, and Almere so far this year [2018]. The 1st one was found in the Netherlands in 2005.

The tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) is a native of South East Asia and is thought to spread via bamboo-plant imports and on car tyres. Dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis are among the diseases it spreads.

[This is not the 1st time that _Aedes albopictus_ has been found in the Netherlands. In 2010, eggs and larvae of this mosquito were found in imported used tires in Brabant. In 2013, they were found in Oss, Weert, Montfort, Almere, Lelystad, Emmeloord, and Harderberg but were eliminated (see: ProMED-mail. Aedes albopictus - Netherlands 20130817.1885955). Although currently present in Eindhoven, Weert, Amstelveen, Assen, and Almere this year [2018], it is very unlikely that _Ae. albopictus_ is sufficiently abundant to permit ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses should they be introduced by travelers from countries where the viruses are currently being transmitted. Nevertheless, elimination of these mosquitoes is prudent.

One does not know if the _Ae. albopictus_ found in Eindhoven or in Weert, Amstelveen, Assen, and Almere are capable of going into diapause [akin to hibernation. - Mod.SH] and surviving winter temperatures. The Netherlands has a maritime climate, and winter temperatures may not fall much below 0 deg C (32 deg F). _Ae. albopictus_ can survive in considerably colder conditions, such as those in the Midwestern states of the USA. Although this mosquito is present now in these localities in the Netherlands, it is unlikely to become established there. A map of the distribution of this mosquito in Europe shows that it has become established in southern Europe but not in northern Europe as of 2017 (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-europe-april-2017). - Mod.TY
