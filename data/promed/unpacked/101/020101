Reports have been circulating that there is a disease similar to mare
reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS) occurring in Australia.
In a correspondence, Nigel Perkins, BVSc, MS, Dipl. ACT, FACVSc, of the
private consulting firm AusVet Animal Health Services, said that "between
March-November 2004, a number of mares in the Hunter Valley region, and in
Queensland, suffered abortions due to a similar disease process. A small
number of farms suffered devastating losses (15 of 25 mares on one farm),
while most affected farms had one or 2 cases. Preliminary data indicate
that between 15-20 separate farms may have been affected." He has termed
this problem equine amnionitis and fetal loss (EAFL).
John Freestone, DVM, Dipl. ACT, resident veterinarian at Coolmore,
Australia, said, "I can talk with confidence about the situation on
Coolmore, and over the last season, we had less placentitis and abortion
than in any of the past 5 years."
It was noted that there are similarities between EAFL and MRLS, in that
pathologists have found amnionitis and infection of the amniotic portion of
the umbilical cord. However, there have been no widespread abortions
throughout all the gestational stages in Australia as there were in the
United States in 2001 and 2002. Some Australian veterinarians are reluctant
to put a label on this problem at this time.
Perkins, who formerly was head of the epidemiology group at Massey
University in New Zealand, went on to say, "Abortions occurred in mid to
late pregnancy without any illness in the mare. The most consistent
pathologic change has been inflammation of the amnion and amniotic portion
of the umbilical cord, and variable changes have been observed in the fetus.
Cases do not have significant involvement of the outer placental membrane
(chorion). Bacteria cultured from affected fetuses have included a range of
organisms that normally live in soil, on plants, and in water, and that are
not typically considered to be the cause of disease in animals (isolates
include _Microbacterium_ spp, _Cellulosimicrobium_ spp, _Athrobacter_ spp,
and _Curtobacterium_ spp)."
Similar cases of mare abortion have been reported occasionally from farms
in New South Wales over the past several years, added Perkins, including
instances in which small farms have had more than half of their pregnant
mares abort. Perkins noted that pathology records from 2004 indicated that
EAFL accounted for up to one third of all abortions in the Hunter Valley in
2004, in cases in which a fetus was found and submitted post mortem.

[This is a difficult and baffling case for producers and researchers.
In the United States, Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS) was determined
to originate from the Eastern Tent caterpillar (_Malacosoma americanum_).
This caterpillar tends to accumulate a cyanide compound. Consequently, the
low oxygen tension of the developing fetus was affected by the even lower
tension resulting from the presence of the cyanide compound in the mare's
system. The syndrome was reproduced successfully.
Hopefully, the Australian researchers will be able to determine the cause,
and alleviate the problem, so that most of the industry will be unaffected.
We look forward to knowing the results. - Mod.TG]
