Farmers of Mandi district are worried. The Arabi (colocasia roots), which is one of the major vegetable crops of the area, has been infested with a blight disease. Farmers fear losing [their] crops.

A farmer said the blight disease had infested all agricultural fields in the whole area this year [2014]. The disease had come as a shock. Most farmers were not aware of the precautions to be taken while planting colocasia. He said the government should provide compensation for the loss of colocasia root crops as a majority of the farmers had lost a major part of their fields.

Agricultural scientist SR Pant said farmers planting colocasia roots were not aware of seed [tuber] treatments needed to save the plants from blight or [other] fungal diseases. He said the agriculture department had added the treatment process of colocasia roots to the list of proposed awareness campaigns.

[Taro [_Colocasia esculenta_] leaf blight caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora colocasiae_ was 1st reported in Java in the early 1900s. Since then, it was found in various parts of Asia and the Pacific, and in 2010, it was also reported for the 1st time from Africa (see ProMED-mail post 20100715.2365). Both leaves and tubers of the crop are used, with taro blight resulting in yield losses of 30-50 per cent or even total crop losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the harvest.

Symptoms include purple-brown water-soaked lesions on leaves oozing a clear yellow liquid; lesions enlarge and eventually destroy entire leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis and vigour of the plant. Disease development and spread are favoured by free water collecting on older leaves, high temperatures and high humidity. The pathogen can be spread by wind, splashing rain and mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Spores survive in plant material for several weeks, and, therefore, infected planting material (seed tubers) is a common means of pathogen spread over long distances and between seasons.

Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in addition to differences in the genetic background of local taro varieties. Some of these strains appear to be able to infect some other aroid crops (for example _Alocasia_ species) as well, but further information is needed on whether non-aroid crops like yam (_Dioscorea_ species) and cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) could be affected by these pathogens.

Disease management using an integrated approach has been successful in the Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides as sprays or treatments for seed tubers (as suggested above), phytosanitation and use of cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility. Programmes specific to different areas for the assessment of taro blight resistance levels of local cultivars have been set up by some countries.
