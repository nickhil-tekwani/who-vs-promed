A rare parasitic infection, trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness,
endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, has been detected in parts of
Maharashtra including Mumbai, baffling health officials.

A total of 3 persons have been diagnosed with the infection this year
[2007], all from different areas and backgrounds. A World Health
Organisation (WHO) team, which collected blood samples from the
victims a few months ago, is still trying to find out how the
disease, which is common in cattle, was transmitted to humans.

The matter has become urgent with the death of one of the victims, a
Pune-based water supplier, last month [November 2007]. One person
from Chandrapur and an infant from Mumbai were the others diagnosed
with trypanosomiasis.

Curiously, none of the patients developed any neurological symptoms.
The parasite travels through the circulatory system to the brain,
causing lethargy and inconsistent behaviour. It starts as a fever
with the patient suffering from joint pain and body ache. If left
untreated, it breaks down the person's immunity and may lead to death.

In India, only animals were known to be infected by certain
trypanosomes. "There is still a big question mark how it was
transmitted," said Dr R Katti, state nodal officer for the Integrated
Disease Surveillance Project. "The death of the Pune patient despite
appropriate treatment has confused and worried us."

The 1st confirmed case in India was that of a 56-year-old farmer from
Shiwni village in Chandrapur district. He was treated and cured. The
2nd was reported from Pune in May [2007]. But the 57-year-old water
supplier [was] never in direct contact with cattle. "A WHO team was
also involved in the treatment," said Dr Katti, "but we could not
save him."

An 8-month-old from Mumbai was the 3rd person to be affected. After
treatment at Parel's Wadia hospital, she was declared healthy. "But
she is being monitored," said one of the doctors at the hospital.

In this case too, experts have failed to establish a link between the
child and the parasite. "Her parents were not affected by the
parasite, so she might have got it accidentally," said Dr Asish
Chandra Dhariwal, joint director, National Institute of Communicable
Diseases, Delhi. A remote connection is that her father deals in
dairy products. Another assumption is that she may have been bitten
by a fly.

Maharashtra has procured in bulk an injection, sodium suramin, which
is used to treat human trypanosomiasis.

[After the last report in ProMED-mail in January 2005 (see below),
our entomologist moderator wrote, "Species of _Trypanosoma_, such as
_Trypanosoma evansi_, are widely distributed in Central and South
America and also Asia and infect domestic and wild animals causing
animal trypanosomiasis. In the absence of tsetse flies other biting
flies such as tabanids and stable flies are the vectors (Mod MS)."

Humans have innate immunity against _Trypanosoma brucei brucei_,
which involve apolipoprotein L-I (APOL1). The serum of the infected
patient [in India in 2005] was found to have no trypanolytic
activity, and the finding was linked to the lack of APOL1, which was
due to frameshift mutations in both APOL1 alleles. (Vanhollebeke B et
al., N Engl J Med. 2006;355:2752-6).

The villages where the case was found were further studied by a
serological survey (Shegokar et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2006; 75:
869-70), which found that 81 out of 1806 persons tested were
seropositive by both screening and confirmatory tests.

It seems likely that _T. evansi_ is transmitted by tabanids and
stable flies on a regular basis to humans in the area, but very
rarely results in clinical disease, except possibly in individuals
with the frameshift mutation in the APOL1 gene. - Mod.EP
