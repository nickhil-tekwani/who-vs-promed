Ebola fight in Beni: MSF renews its commitment to support the population

The NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is responding to the threats that Ebola response teams are facing these days. The organization advocates for the safety of healthcare workers so that they can effectively contribute to the Ebola response and the care of several other patients in the framework of free health care.

MSF remains in Beni at the request of the population. Regardless of ADF [Allied Democratic Forces] threats, it remains active. Despite the departure of other NGOs, this organization is resisting.

"MSF is still in Beni. I think the people of Beni still need it. And are still in contact with this population because if MSF is there it is to support the population of Beni by offering care ... We felt it was important that we still stay in Beni to support this population in distress," stated the MSF coordinator in Beni city.

MSF also promises to strengthen donations of medicines that can treat the wounded in 6 health centers and carry out other actions of Beni's general reference hospital.

"In Beni we support some health centers where people can access quality primary health care in free of charge. This is the 1st activity we have in Beni. Apart from that, our teams promise to strengthen the response to the care of the wounded, if necessary. And for preventive measures, MSF is preparing a donation of wound dressing kits to at least 6 health centers, while working with Beni General Hospital," said Pamphyle Bashimbe.

DRC: 6 dead and 4 vehicles burned (Attack against WHO agents in the East)

According to the Center for Studies for the Promotion of Peace, Democracy and Human Rights (CEPADHO), the attack was planned by a group of Mai-Mai whose majority would come from Kabasha in the Beni territory (North Kivu). They would have split into small groups to distract the police. One section reportedly invested the base housing the response teams, while another raided the police sub-station of the square.

The militiamen who have invested the base of the response have successively killed 3 agents of the response, including Ms. Belinda Kasongo, assigned by the WHO to the Immunization Commission and 2 drivers attached to team 7 of the response in Byakato. In addition, they burned 4 jeeps of the response and a motorcycle, before sabotaging the tents, mattresses and other effects they accessed. Those who attacked the police sub-station managed to sabotage with bullets 2 guarded jeeps of the response. The intervention of law enforcement and security forces to put the attackers out of harm's way was not so easy. The exchanges of fire lasted until 7:15 am on the morning of [Thu 28 Nov 2019]. One Mai-Mai militiaman was killed and 4 others captured.

In addition, according to CEPADHO, the death of another civilian killed by the crossfire of the belligerents is deplorable. She was a woman known in the city as suffering from a mental illness and 3 other civilians were also reportedly seriously injured by stray bullets. In addition, other CEPADHO sources report a soldier who fell under enemy fire during FARDC [Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo] intervention in support of law enforcement.

For the time being, although the army and police are in control of the situation after the Mai-Mai rout, activities have remained paralyzed in Byakato. Shops, the market, and schools have remained closed and traffic on public roads has been interrupted. Meanwhile, response teams evacuated their personnel, fearing for their safety, they say. The Monusco evacuated by helicopter the bodies and agents of the response teams that survived the attack. This is of greater concern to the inhabitants.

While these attacks are recorded in Byakato, in the neighboring village of Lwemba 4 community deaths have been reported, including 2 occurring on [Wed 27 Nov 2019] and 2 others on [Thu 28 Nov 2019]. A case would already be confirmed Ebola and other people should be sampled to know their condition before burial dignified and secure. A few weeks ago the Ebola response teams were forced to leave Lwemba after the multiple attacks.

At the same time, another attack aimed at sabotaging Mangina's CTE (Ebola Treatment Center) was barely prevented by the police. During the shootings with militiamen in Mangina, one assailant was killed and 2 others were captured that night. Early in the morning, in their search and search operations, the police still managed to get their hands on 2 other Mai-Mai, including one wounded, thus making a total of 4 captured.

WHO shocked by death of 4 Ebola response agents in Biakat
---------------------------------------------------------
Two attacks targeting Ebola response agents in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo left 4 dead and 5 wounded. The attacks took place during the night on a Biakato "base" where the intervention teams live and in a coordination office for the Ebola response in Mangina (Ituri).

The dead include a member of the vaccination team, 2 drivers and a police officer. No WHO officer was among the dead, even though one of them was wounded. The other wounded are mainly agents of the Ministry of Health.

"I am wholeheartedly with the families and friends of these key players who have been killed in these attacks. We are doing everything in our power to ensure the safety of the injured and the front-line workers in the affected areas. These constant attacks must stop. We will continue to work with the DRC government, our partners and MONUSCO to ensure the safety of our staff and other health workers, " said Ms. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

In the past week, the number of Ebola cases has dropped to 7, after a peak of more than 120 cases per week in April 2019.

International organizations warned on [Fri 29 Nov 2019] of a potential resurgence of Ebola in Congo after deadly militia attacks on health centers forced aid groups to suspend operations and withdraw staff from the epidemic's last strongholds.

"Ebola was retreating and now it is likely to resurge," World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a news briefing in Geneva. WHO has relocated 173 staff while the U.N. children's agency UNICEF has evacuated 20 staff.

After [Thu 28 Nov 2019]'s fatal raids on health centers in Mangina and Byakoto, a screening center was also attacked overnight in the town of Oicha, Congolese health authorities said. (...)

The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) halted operations in the towns of Mangina, Beni and Butembo. (...)

The World Food Programme (WFP), another U.N. agency which provides food to those around infected people and at risk of Ebola, said its activities had also been interrupted due to insecurity.

Congolese health authorities said they had evacuated 13 staff and other transfers were underway.

The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) charity said activities at its treatment centers in Mambasa and Katwa towns were not suspended but it was monitoring the security situation closely.

[3] Virus persistence
Date: Sat 30 Nov 2019.
Source: The New Humanitarian [edited]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/11/28/Ebola-sexual-transmission-breastfeeding-women-children


The New Humanitarian [TNH] has been covering the latest Ebola outbreak since it emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018. After more medical studies began showing how the virus can live on in survivors for months, TNH sent a reporter to the outbreak zones to investigate whether the risks of sexual transmission and breastfeeding were part of the general prevention messaging, as they had been in the HIV epidemic in the 1980s and '90s. It turns out they're not, and experts are concerned a lack of consistent messaging is putting even more women and children at risk.

At a glance: Key findings
-------------------------
- Risks associated with sexual transmission or breastfeeding are not part of the general prevention messaging in the Ebola response.

- A large number of people TNH interviewed were unaware of the transmission risks associated with unprotected sex or breastfeeding; few knew survivors could be contagious even after they had been cured.

- Community outreach workers admitted being confused by guidance on sex or breastfeeding risks, sometimes omitting information.

- Better treatment and vaccines have led to a growing community of survivors in the latest outbreak, but medical evidence shows survivors can still infect people.

- Ebola can live in the semen of survivors for more than a year, while the virus has also been found in the breast milk of mothers [for up to 500 days].

- Women and children are hardest hit in the outbreak that has killed 2200 people and counting. Roughly 70% [of the more than 3300 cases] have been women and children.

There have been 33 cases up until March 2016 of possible, probable, or confirmed Ebola transmission through sex, according to a 2018 report in Viruses.

(...) Ebola virus has been found in the breastmilk of mothers in acute and convalescent phases of EVD from day 7 to day 26 after symptom onset, as well as in asymptomatic mothers (table). Data on long-term presence in breastmilk is limited and inconclusive. There was some discordance between Ebola virus in blood and breastmilk in 2o cases (cases 3 and 4), and possibly in a 3rd case (case 5), indicating that Ebola virus blood negativity is not sufficient to ensure safe breastfeeding in asymptomatic or convalescent mothers. Similarly, the current recommendation of testing breastmilk only in mothers who are known EVD survivors might be insufficient because asymptomatic lactating mothers in households affected by EVD have also been shown to have Ebola virus-positive breastmilk.
