Evidence of a Naturally Occurring Recombinant Isolate of Plum Pox Virus
from Slovakia. M. Glasa and O. Kudela, Institute of Virology, Slovak

2001. Accepted for publication 10 May 2001.
Sharka, caused by the Plum pox virus (PPV), is the most detrimental viral
disease of stone fruit[s... worldwide. 2 main groups of PPV isolates have
been identified, PPV-M and PPV-D (1). Natural variability of Slovak PPV
isolates in Prunus hosts has been recently evaluated (3).
The PPV isolate BOR-3 was isolated in the summer of 1996 from a 5-year-old
apricot tree, cv. VS 123/9, in a [western Slovakia orchard . The host ...
tree was propagated from seed; hence infection via aphid transmission from
the immediate surroundings is highly probable.
... The isolate was [maintained by chip budding ... from a diseased tree
to seedlings of _Prunus persica_, cv. GF 305. In contrast to other PPV
isolates collected from the same location, infection of GF 305 with BOR-3
[induced weak symptoms or was symptomless. ... Sap-[inoculated young
seedlings of _P. insititia_ Ã— _P. domestica_ St. Julien No. 2 presented ...
chlorotic spots and rings [on leaves similar to those produced by other
... Slovak PPV isolates.
Serological typing with group-specific MAbs (1) and restriction fragment
length polymorphism of RT-PCR products amplified from the C terminus of the
capsid protein (CP) gene demonstrated that BOR-3 is a member of PPV-M group
(3). However, nucleotide (nt) sequence analysis of the P3-6K1 genomic
region (GenBank accession AF357541) has shown a strong similarity with
PPV-D group isolates (reaching 97%).
To obtain more information, a 1846-nt long 3 genomic region encompassing
the C-terminus of NIb, CP and 3 noncoding region (NCR) was subsequently
sequenced (GenBank accession AY028309). The sequence comparison revealed
that the BOR-3 isolate was ... most [similar to ... PPV isolate delta 6
(GenBank accession S57404) isolated more than 10 years ago in [the former
Yugoslavia, ... about 550 km from the Slovak focus. The delta 6 isolate is
known to be the only PPV RNA recombinant at present (2).
Nucleotide sequence identity in [the 3'NIb+CP+NCR region between BOR-3 and
delta 6 isolates reached >98%, contrary to 96% identity with PPV-M isolates
(PS, SK68) and 88% identity with PPV-D isolates (Dideron, Rank). Further,
the potential recombination site in the BOR-3 genome has been located in
the C-terminus of [the NIb gene near nt position 8450 (numbered according
to PPV-PS isolate, AJ243957). This site corresponds to the location of the
recombination crossover identified in ... PPV-delta 6 isolate (2). Despite
geographical and temporal distinctiveness of the 2 PPV isolates, an
identical origin of delta 6 and BOR-3 cannot be excluded.
The hypothesis that these PPV isolates are the product of 2 independent
recombination events at a recombination hot spot in the PPV genome situated
near the C terminus of NIb gene also should be considered. Based on these
data, the ... BOR-3 isolate is a product of a natural homologous RNA
recombination ...between M and D isolate[s. Evidence of homologous RNA
recombination in [BOR-3 significantly enriches current knowledge on the
occurrence of recombination among potyviruses and emphasizes the role of
RNA recombination in viral evolution and adaptation.
This report indicates that occurrence of ... PPV recombinants infecting
perennial crops might not be as rare as previously suggested (4).

[This is a good example of what is undoubtedly a common occurrence among
RNA plant viruses. Evolution of this PPV recombinant presents an
opportunity to compare it against other PPV isolates. PPV infects several
stone fruits (peach, plum, apricot, nectarine, almond, and sour and sweet
cherry). The virus is transmitted by about 20 aphids but only 3 species
(_Brachycaudus helichrysi_, _Myzus persicae_ and _Phorodon humuli_) are
considered the most important. The virus is also transmitted by grafting
tissues from diseased to healthy ones and by mechanical inoculation. There
is no evidence of PPV being transmitted by seed. Infected fruit are
essentially unmarketable for human consumption. PPV is the only potyvirus
that infects Prunus species.
The disease is widespread in Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Former Yugoslavia. It is restricted in its
distribution in many other European countries, United States and Canada,
and believed to have been introduced and possibly established in Azores,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Egypt, Former USSR, India and Lithuania. The status of
the disease in Chile and Denmark is unknown.
