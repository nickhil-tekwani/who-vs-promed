Accordingly, National Veterinary Laboratories (NVL) conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Other suspected cases of LSD were reported from Jamshoro and Thatta region of Sindh dated 1 Dec 2021, and Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL) Sindh conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Provincial veterinary authorities instantly took control and prevention measures. Since disease was 1st time seen in Pakistan, and diagnostic kits and reagents had to be imported, which took longer time therefore, LSD has been confirmed in March 2022. AHC/CVO Pakistan has immediately issued guidelines for control and prevention of LSD for Provincial Veterinary Authorities. Now, the situation is under control.

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterized by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and, occasionally, death. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. Between 2012 and 2018, LSD spread into south-east Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus as part of the Eurasian LSD epidemic."

Since 2019, LSD has been reported by several countries in Asia: Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, China, Chinese Taipei, Viet Nam, Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR-RPC), Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and, most recently, Indonesia and Pakistan. - Mod.CRD
