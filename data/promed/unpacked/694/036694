A large number of deaths of feral domestic rabbits has occurred in Calgary, and this time, it's in Nose Hill Park.

Local veterinarians are raising the alarm about the 1st time a highly contagious disease has made the jump to a wild rabbit in the city.

[MH] normally encounters around 50 or 60 feral rabbits around the Nose Hill parking lot near Edgemont, but this weekend [8-9 Oct 2022] she hasn't seen any jumping around.

"It's been really sad. I noticed on Tuesday [4 Oct 2022] about 4 dead ones lying around," she said. A look under a storage container reveals one live rabbit but many more dead ones -- likely the latest victims of a highly contagious virus called rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV2).

"I did see somebody putting some in a plastic bag the other day and pulling some out from underneath but there were some that they couldn't reach, so there are dead ones under there," said [MH].

"There's been a mass die-off of animals in the Nose Hill Park area," said Dr Leticia Materi, a veterinarian at the Calgary Avian and Exotic Pet Clinic. She said the 1st reported cases this summer [2022] were in Manchester Industrial and Seton.

"This virus is highly contagious and it's only a matter of time before large pockets of feral rabbits are affected. It is spread, not only by rabbit to rabbit but also by scavengers and people can pick it up on their hands and clothing."

Since the end of August [2022] in Calgary, there have been 7 confirmed cases of feral domestic rabbits.

RHD is contagious among rabbits, hares, and pika -- members of the order called lagomorphs -- but has not been known to pass on to humans or other animals.

Now a case in Calgary of a mountain cottontail in Queen's Park Cemetery shows the virus has made the jump to a wild animal for the 1st known time in the province.

"It's the 1st that we have identified here in Alberta," said Dr Jennifer Davies, a veterinary pathologist and director of the Diagnostic Services Unit with the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Calgary.

"They (wild rabbits and hares) won't have immunity, and it could lead to significant die-offs in the population and they are an important part of our ecosystem as herbivores and prey species for other carnivores and scavenging animals," Davies said.

Materi said RHD has been seen in Edmonton and in the Lethbridge area and has been been making its way through Ontario now.

She said the concern now is the disease spreading outside urban areas. "It's horrifying. It could potentially have a devastating effect on certain species. If it gets into the wild population, there is a chance that it can spread beyond the borders of the city," Materi said.

[MH] said the suffering could have been avoided by people not dumping their unwanted pets. "People keep dumping and abandoning them. They are little domestic animals," she said. "It's really cruel to dump them because they can't really fend for themselves and they become vulnerable to predators and disease, starvation, and winter temperatures."

Rabbit owners are being warned to get their pets vaccinated and stay away from known hot spots.

Dead rabbits in the city can be reported to Alberta Environment and Parks or the city at 311.

[In the 1980s, populations of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled to wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (< 2 month-old) and RHD-vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia.

It is of conservation concern that RHD jumps from feral domestic rabbits to native lagomorph species. Alberta has 3 native species of lagomorphs. They are the mountain cottontail rabbit (_Sylvilagus nuttallii_), the snowshoe hare (_Lepus americanus_), and the white-tailed jackrabbit (_L. townsendii_). According to the news report above, the virus was found in a cottontail rabbit. - Mod.PMB
