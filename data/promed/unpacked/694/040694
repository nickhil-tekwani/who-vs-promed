At least 55 persons fell ill due to suspected food poisoning on Saturday [31 Jul 2021] after consuming wazwan at a marriage party in the Mirnag Haihama area of north Kashmir's Kupwara district. Locals said that soon after villagers took the feast at a marriage ceremony, they complained of vomiting, dysentery and fever, prompting some of them to seek treatment at Sub District Hospital Kupwara. They said that also more than 30 people subsequently complained of the same problems following which they were admitted to SDH Kupwara. "All the guests who had consumed the food and those with whom they shared the mutton at home fell sick," said Mushtaq Ahmad Baba, a local journalist.

Chief medical officer Kupwara Mehraj Ud Din Sofi told Greater Kashmir that SDH Kupwara has received 55 patients who were undergoing treatment at the facility. "All of them are stable as of now," he said. He said that people who have consumed the wazwan complained of vomiting, high fever and dysentery soon after they finished the meals. "The people have fallen ill due to food poisoning and it will take them few days to recover," he added. He said that a health team was sent to the area for collection of food samples. He said that the team has been directed to collect water samples also.

Wazwan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazwan) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, the preparation of which is considered as an art and a point of pride in Kashmiri culture and identity. It is unclear how soon after the meal that symptoms began which can assist in the differential diagnosis. Mutton has been implicated as the vehicle for the illnesses but that has not yet been established nor has the etiology.

Kupwara district is one of the 10 districts located in the Kashmir Valley region of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Jammu and Kashmir is a state in northern India, often denoted by the abbreviation J&K. It is located mostly in the Himalayan mountains and shares borders with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south. The Line of Control separates it from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north, respectively, and a Line of Actual Control separates it from the Chinese-administered territory of Aksai Chin in the east. Its location can be seen on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory. - Mod.LL
