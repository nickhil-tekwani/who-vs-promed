EU Commission makes one more attempt for EU regime on SRMs.
The European Commission will make a final attempt to establish an European
Union regime on specified risk materials (SRMs) as it considers that these
measures are essential to achieve a high level of consumer protection from
the risk of BSE. Faced with Council of Ministers inaction, the Commission
will propose for the last time an amendment to the Decision of 30 July 1997
on the removal of the specified risk materials. This Decision, which is due
to enter into force on 1 April 1998, cannot apply as it stands on account
of new scientific advice received since and because of the problems it
would cause to the supply of essential or life-saving pharmaceutical
products. If this renewed attempt fails, the Commission will withdraw its
July 1997 Decision on SRMs, thus making clear that the full responsibility
will lie on the Member States which will have to keep or take all necessary
measures on SRMs removal taking into account their respective
epidemiological situations and national risk assessment. In order to
establish a comprehensive approach and to achieve a long term solution on
the controls of TSE, the Commission will submit as soon as possible to the
Council and the European Parliament a new proposal based on Article 100a of
the EC Treaty (co-decision between the European Parliament and the Council).

[For those not keeping up with the Byzantine EU activities in Brussels, USA
and other countries without BSE had objected strenuously to various
restrictive EU proposals in relation to the international trade in SRMs. -
