Kenya has been advised to establish an animal health surveillance system for early detection and control of Rift Valley fever [RVF].

Since the outbreak was first reported in Wajir on [3 Jun 2018], 17 counties are on high alert. At least 10 people have been killed in Wajir and Siaya [counties].

The outbreak is suspected to be a result of heavy rains that caused flooding in semi-arid areas.

The World Health Organisation yesterday [21 Jun 2018] said Kitui, Wajir, Kajiado, and Marsabit counties are reporting high death rates and miscarriage among animals. But accurate reporting and investigations have been hampered by logistical challenges.

WHO cited bad roads that have limited access to affected areas.

The outbreak has been reported in villages in Moyale while Balesa, Demo, Shuur, and Maikona in North Horr have also recorded cases.

The world health agency said the outbreak in animals often precedes human cases.

As such, the establishment of a surveillance system will provide early warning to veterinary and public health officials.

WHO has recommended routine animal vaccination to prevent further outbreaks.

However, the organisation discouraged vaccination campaigns, saying they may intensify transmission among herds through needle propagation of the virus.

"Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages should focus on reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission," WHO said in a statement.

Animal-to-human transmission arises from consumption of raw or unpasteurised milk or infected meat.

Mosquito bites can be reduced through the implementation of vector control activities like insecticide spraying.

The UN agency advised against travel or trade restrictions to Kenya but said it was concerned by the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock.

Last month [May 2018], the government through the Health ministry and the veterinary department issued an alert warning about the risk of RVF following heavy rains that caused serious flooding.

Home slaughter of livestock without inspection by a veterinary [service] has been banned and livestock movement restricted after the outbreak was reported.

[The title of the current media report, "Improve RVF surveillance, Kenya urged", is striking.

The index case of RVF during the current event in Kenya was identified as an 18-year-old male who was admitted on 2 Jun 2018 at Wajir County Referral hospital (WCRH), presenting with fever in the previous 5 days and with a 3-day history of bleeding. He died in few hours. Following his diagnosis, several dozens clinical cases and at least 10 fatalities in humans, in several counties in Kenya's Eastern province, have been officially reported. Undoubtedly, this has been preceded by dissemination of the virus in susceptible, amplifying animals, within Kenya's RVF-endemic regions. Preparedness activities for RVF have, reportedly, been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding; an alert was issued in May 2018 to all County Directors about a general national alert.

The 1st, "immediate notification" of a suspected outbreak in animals was submitted on 8 Jun 2018. This addressed a farm in Wajir where 25 clinical cases, out of 250 susceptible camels, were suspected, of which 17 died. The ELISA test, applied in the Kenya's National Veterinary Laboratory on 6 Jun 2018, led to "inconclusive" results and consequently the report indicated the "nature of diagnosis" as "suspicion".

In Kenya's 1st follow-up report of 15 Jun 2018, 2 outbreaks, in Wajir and Tana River counties, the ELISA tests involved sheep and goats, and the results were positive, leading to the definition of the "nature of diagnosis" as "laboratory (basic)".

The summary of Kenya's outbreak, as of 15 Jun 2018, follows:

Total outbreaks = 3 (submitted)

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 530 / 27 / 17 / 0 / 0
Goats / 456 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 500 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0

Additional statistics and other details, and a map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000026928_20180618_142748.pdf.

Since the lab test results of the camel samples were inconclusive, and in view of the unusually high case fatality recorded on this farm, compared to absence of deaths in the infected sheep and goats, further information on the event in camels, including clinical signs and post-mortem results, in case performed, will be of interest. The possible involvement of other potential disease agents, either as mix infections or otherwise, deserve to be excluded. One of diseases which may be taken into consideration is PPR (peste des petits ruminants), which has been reported from Kenya's Rift Valley in 2007 and has been continuing its spread since. PPR may, potentially, affect camels.

Following the initial diagnosis of RVF in Kenya, in early June 2018, a Government's task force representing the human and animal sectors, was established in Kenya.

The measures implemented included:
- On 14 Jun 2018, a multi-sectoral investigation team was deployed in Wajir county to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit county team.
- Active surveillance in humans has been enhanced in the affected county, including active case search in humans (human surveillance in the community). All local health authorities in the country have been alerted to increase vigilance and enhance preparedness measures. In Wajir county, 5 treatment centers have been established.
- Ring vaccination in livestock in affected areas is on-going.
- The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has issued a ban on slaughtering animals for public consumption in Eldas and Wajir west sub-counties, and up scaling of food quality controls in the other 4 sub-counties through the public health officers, enforcement officers and veterinary officers.
- Restrictions to livestock movement from the affected areas to all other parts of the county has been imposed.

During a previous major RVF event in East Africa, In 2006/7, the epidemic affected Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Comoros, and Madagascar.

Subscribers are referred to an updated (2015) RVF review, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf. - Mod.AS

Effective reduction of vector mosquito populations over a wide geograhic area where rains and flooding have extensive breeding sites would be difficult and expensive to achieve. Avoidance of exposure to RVF virus from the other sources mentioned above are prudent but require prosepective public education. - Mod.TY
