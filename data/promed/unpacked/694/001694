About new outbreaks of African swine fever in Poland
----------------------------------------------------
Disease outbreaks have been registered in pigs in Sokol and Byalostokskom, within the Podlaskie voivodship [Poland is divided into 16 voivodships, primary subdivisions]. The diagnosis was confirmed in the European Union Reference Laboratory for African swine fever. To date [8 Jul 2014], 6 ASF outbreaks have officially been registered in Poland.

Rosselhoznadzor has repeatedly warned the European Commission about the need to depopulate wild boars in Poland in view of the risk of ASF introduction and its spread from Poland to Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria.
