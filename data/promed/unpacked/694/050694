As of 16 May 2006, Angola has reported a total of 35 775 cases and 1298
deaths (case fatality rate (CFR) 4 per cent). In the last 24 hours, 546 new
cases including 31 deaths have been reported. 11 out of 18 provinces are
affected; of all cases, 51 per cent have occurred in Luanda and 21 per cent
in Benguela province. The CFR, broken down by province, ranges between 1
and 30 per cent. Although current trends show a decline in Luanda and
Benguela provinces, a daily incidence of around 600 cases is still being
reported. [for graphics including map of Angola, see original URL - Mod.LL])
The National Laboratory of Public Health has confirmed the isolation of
_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serotype Inaba in 9 out of 13 samples.
The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and other partners continue to develop
field activities to control the outbreak: daily coordination meetings;
house-to-house visits for following up of contacts; disinfestations;
collection of specimens for bacteriological laboratory examination;
distribution of safe drinking water and chlorine; dissemination of
preventive measures through the local media and distribution of health
education materials by social mobilization groups. WHO has sent 6
international experts to reinforce the national team in providing support
for coordination, water and sanitation, logistics and epidemiological
surveillance.

Cholera has killed at least 60 people in the south of Guinea in 2006.
Guinea, which remains poor despite its vast reserves of bauxite, the
mineral from which aluminium is extracted, was one of several West African
countries hit by an outbreak of cholera in 2005 that killed more than 800
people across the region.
"The cholera epidemic is still affecting Guinea, especially at Gueckedou
(in the south)," the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said in a
report.
The report said 448 cases of cholera had been reported in Guinea between
the end of Jan and 23 Apr 2006. Of the 60 deaths recorded from the
waterborne disease so far, 47 had been registered at Gueckedou, near the
border with Liberia.

An outbreak of cholera has killed nearly 40 people and sickened hundreds
more on mainland Tanzania and the semiautonomous Zanzibar archipelago since
Mar 2006, officials said Thu, 18 May 2006.
The death toll in Zanzibar was 22 and will likely rise, said Dr Omar
Mohammed Suleiman of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Zanzibar.
At least 15 have died on the mainland, said Dr Deo Mtasiwa, chief physician
of the Dar es Salaam City Council.
The disease erupted amid heavy rains in the region hit by a drought that
has hurt farmers across East Africa, leading to severe food shortages in
Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti. The rain is washing
garbage and other waste into wells or water catchment areas.
The 1997 outbreak killed 124 people and sickened 1100 in Zanzibar, which
has a population of 1 million, reports the AP.

[7] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland Central)

Cholera has killed at least 12 people while 26 others were hospitalized in
Kachuta, Guruve District.
Addressing a Civil Protection Committee meeting in Bindura over the
weekend, the provincial medical director for Mashonaland Central Province
Dr Clemence Tshuma said a cholera outbreak has been reported in Guruve,
with the first case having been identified sometime early in May 2006 when
a sick man was diagnosed for cholera.
According to Dr Tshuma, this man had apparently caught the cholera at a
funeral of yet another victim who had died without medical attention. When
a team of health personnel finally visited the area to investigate, it was
further ascertained that about 8 more deaths had occurred in Apr 2006,
apparently as a result of cholera but no notification had been given to
health officials as to the cause of the death.
Health officials said the cholera outbreak had spread even wider as more
cases from as far as Mushumbi Pools, Guruve Centre and Matsitsi have been
reported. "So the outbreak has spread from the epicentre of Kachuta to as
far as Mushumbi Pools, Guruve Centre and Matsitsi," he added.

Several areas of Varmul district and some places in Rafiabad area have been
severely gripped by cholera, causing panic among the population.
The medical faculty of district hospital Varmul told Greater Kashmir that
from the onset of summer, they have received many cases of cholera,
jaundice and other gastrointestinal diseases from the town and its
adjoining areas. "To date we've received 200 to 250 patients including
children suffering from cholera and jaundice, all waterborne diseases," one
of the hospital faculty members Dr Masood said, adding the patients came

[9] Cholera, Vibrio O139 - Taiwan
Date: 19 May 2006
From: Chan-Hsien Chiu, MD, MS <ihrfocalpoint@cdc.gov.tw>

Taiwan's Center for Disease Control (CDC) herein notifies you that a native
cholera case in Taiwan was confirmed on 19 May 2006. This patient, a 58
year old female farmer, lives in Tainan County in southern Taiwan. The
causative agent was _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 confirmed by our reference
laboratory.
On 10 May, this patient developed severe watery diarrhea with vomiting
symptoms after she sprayed agricultural chemical products. She was sent to
an ER at a local hospital and was then admitted the next day. Due to the
onset of severe acidosis and acute renal failure, she was admitted to ICU
for dialysis and further treatment on 12 May. The next day, her diarrhea
was improved after receiving antibiotics. On 15 May, she was transferred to
a general ward and was discharged on 17 May. The stool culture, which was
collected at ER on 11 May, revealed _Vibrio cholerae_ after her discharge.
On the same day, the doctor reported her as a suspected case of _Vibrio
cholerae_ and the patient was readmitted to the same hospital for isolation
and further evaluation. Her specimens were sent to a reference laboratory
of Taiwan CDC for further testing. On 19 May, _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup
O139 was identified.
After receiving the report from the hospital, Tainan County Department of
Health conducted an immediate investigation and put all exposed individuals
under investigations on 18 May. Due to the delayed diagnosis, there are 45
contacts including 29 health care workers. Rectal swab samples for all of
the contacts were collected and all of the results are pending. No
diarrheal illness has been identified from those persons in close contact
with the patient. To identify the source of the infectious agent, we have
taken the environmental specimens and food samples from her house.
Laboratory tests are being conducted on these specimens. Additionally, we
have conducted environmental disinfection in the patient's home.
Because this patient has had no recently travel history, she is confirmed
as the first native cholera case in Taiwan in 2006. Moreover, no contacts
have exhibited such symptoms one week after she got sick. Therefore, Taiwan
CDC considers that it is only a single sporadic case and unlikely to cause
spread of this disease in Taiwan.
