Malaria in an Italian tourist ex Dominican Republic
---------------------------------------------------
We recently saw a case of acute, uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an
Italian traveller who had spent a week in a touristic resort in Punta Cana,
Dominican Republic from 16 to 24 Apr 2001. He had not taken any antimalarial
chemoprophylaxis. On 4 May 2001 he was admitted to the hospital in Varese
with
fever, chills, and headache. Haemoscopy showed _P. falciparum_ parasitaemia
at a density of 5.8%. The patient was treated with quinine plus sulpha
combinations and recovered successfully. The traveller reported extensive
building works being carried out by local workers near the resort he was
living in.
So far, this report remains the only one within the network. The last
reported patient within TropNetEurop was seen in February 2000. All
information received from the Dominican Republic indicated that the
outbreak 1999/2000 had been eliminated.

[The outbreak of falciparum malaria in the Dominican Republic 1999/2000 was
in the end thought to be due to migrant construction workers from Haiti
acting as asymptomatic carriers. It is therefore interesting to note in
this message that the hotel was close to a construction site. Despite this
so far single case, the risk of acquiring malaria in the Dominican Republic
is still very low. - Mod.EP
