2 people test positive to _Vibrio cholerae_
-------------------------------------------
Both are residents of the city of Astrakhan in the south of Russia. All
water reserves and sources of drinking water in the regional center have
been brought under strict medical control, Itar-Tass was told at the
Regional Sanitary Surveillance Inspectorate on Sat, 9 Aug 2003.
Nonetheless, the Astrakhan Health Service Department has played down fears
of a cholera epidemic, saying that no cholera patients were registered
either in Astrakhan or neighboring regions.
Nevertheless, the presence of _Vibrio cholerae_ arouses concern, the health
department said. Measures have been taken in the Astrakhan region so as to
prevent an epidemic.
The local authorities have ordered to chlorine water discharge sites and
examine all the beaches on the Volga and Akhtuba rivers.

Worst cholera outbreak in 5 years
---------------------------------
As many as 715 cholera cases have been reported from various parts of the
capital, the MCD (Mutual Corporation of Delhi) said today, Sat 9 Aug 2003.
Health department officials said it's not an epidemic.
MCD's health officials said insanitary conditions had led to the cholera
outbreak in the city. "One of the main reasons for the outbreak has been
the supply of contaminated water by the Delhi Jal Board," alleged MCD
officials.
The last such serious outbreak was in 1998; 567 cases up to June of that
year. In 2002 the MCD recorded 837 cases of cholera. Officials admitted
that this will be the largest outbreak in the past 5 years.
Meanwhile, the MCD has already been directed by the Delhi government to
take immediate action to ensure that the outbreak does not escalate to an
epidemic. An epidemic is declared only after the number of cases exceeds
1200, but officials admitted that, since cholera is communicable disease,
strict precautions need to be taken to prevent its spread.
The MCD will be initiating a special sanitation drive tomorrow onwards. MCD
Commissioner Rakesh Mehta said: "We will be conducting a one week intensive
sanitation drive for which we will mobilise all our manpower. The aim is to
clear all of Delhi's roads of garbage." Mehta said that the special drive
was being undertaken as a measure of public health to ensure that "diseases
such as gastroenteritis and cholera do not spread".
The largest number of cases have been reported from the Civil Lines zone,
which had reported 212 cholera-afflicted cases. Rohini, the second most
affected zone, has registered 143 cases as of this date.
Chief medical officer at the MCD, Dr KN Tiwari, said: "Precautions have
already been taken by the health department to ensure that the condition
does not worsen. ORS has been supplied and chlorine tablets have been
distributed to all the zones." Officials also blamed the lack of a proper
drainage system.

Liberia's war-torn capital Monrovia is in the grip of serious cholera
epidemic as a result of tens of thousands of people being displaced from
their homes and living in conditions of extremely poor sanitation, the
medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Thu 31 Jul 2003.
MSF said it had set up 3 specialist treatment centers for cholera in the
city of 1 million people, and these were now treating more than 300 cases
per week. The number of cholera cases had soared by mid-July, prompting the
Liberian Ministry of Health to officially declare an epidemic, it added.
Relief agencies estimate that about a quarter of Monrovia's population has
been made homeless by 3 rebel attacks on the city over the past 2 months.
MSF said treating cholera was simple, but controlling its spread in the
prevailing conditions in Monrovia, where there is little food and almost no
clean drinking water, was very difficult.
The agency had set up 3 cholera treatment units with a total capacity of
400 beds and was also working in 6 clinics and 2 hospitals in Monrovia.
Action Contre Faim (ACF) and OXFAM have joined other relief agencies,
including Merlin and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in
providing water to thousands of displaced people living in accessible areas
of Monrovia, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) reported.
The ICRC said it had flown in another water truck into Monrovia aboard a
chartered cargo plane, along with a fresh consignment of emergency medical
supplies.
