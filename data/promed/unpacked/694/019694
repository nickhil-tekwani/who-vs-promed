Significant numbers of several species of mainly fish-eating birds have
died over the past 5 weeks on southeastern Lake Huron (between Kettle Point
and Grand Bend, approximately 50-80 km NE of Sarnia, Ontario), and along
north west shore of Lake Erie (between Point Pelee and Rondeau,
approximately 60-80 km SE of Windsor, Ontario).

On Lake Erie, minor mortality was noted throughout September, with an
increase about 28 September that persisted for a few days, and a larger
episode beginning 26 October, that now is apparently subsiding. About 90%
of birds found sick or dead have been common mergansers, though common
loons, grebes, diving ducks, ring-billed gulls, herring gulls, and
Bonaparte's gulls also have been affected. Mortality is likely of the order
of 1000 birds, with 1-2 carcasses per 10 metres of beach in some localities.

On Lake Huron, where beached carcasses were observed beginning about 14
October, with a notable increase on 23-24 October, approximately 90% of the
birds involved were common loons. Fewer common mergansers, grebes,
red-throated loons, some diving ducks, ring-billed gulls and Bonaparte's
gulls also were reported. The number of birds affected has not been
determined, but based on carcass counts, at least 700 loons died.

Type E botulism has been diagnosed in mergansers that died in late
September and late October on Lake Erie, and in loons from Lake Huron. Live
sick loons had flaccid paralysis, and some were successfully rehabilitated
and released following supportive care. In late July and early August a
large number of gulls and sanderlings were found dead on the dead on the
beaches at Point Pelee after a large fish die-off in the area. We were
unable to confirm botulism in these birds, but no other disease was
recognized, and the circumstances and reported behavior (some sick birds
recovered and were released following supportive care) are compatible with
botulism.

Type E botulism is associated with fish, and the majority of birds involved
in these outbreaks are fish-eaters or scavengers. Even diving ducks, which
are primarily mollusc feeders, had fish in their digestive tracts at the
time of death. At this time of year, large rafts of migrating loons,
mergansers and diving ducks are resting and feeding offshore in the
affected areas. Episodes of Type E botulism are periodically recurrent in
fish-eating birds, especially loons, on the Great Lakes in late fall [see
Brand, C.J. et al., An outbreak of Type E botulism among common loons
(_Gavia immer_) in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Journal of Wildlife Diseases
24: 471-476, 1988. We diagnosed botulism as the cause of a smaller die-off
of common loons in the Kettle Point-Grand Bend area in fall 1998. What is
unclear are the circumstances under which fish become toxic. No unusual
fish mortality has been detected in association with the episodes on Lakes
Erie and Huron over the past 5 weeks, and loons, mergansers and grebes
would not be expected to consume dead fish.
