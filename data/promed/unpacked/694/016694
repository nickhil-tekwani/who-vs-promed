The local press reports that 15 cows have died because of anthrax, on grazing land between Bronte and Randazzo, province of Catania, Sicily, Italy. In fact, the 1st warning came from the discovery of a dead cow seemingly killed by anthrax, at Contrada Saletto of Randazzo [see map at http://tinyurl.com/z9jr6ln].

Laboratory confirmation is pending.

The health authorities have delimited the contaminated area and have ordered strict preventive measures, as in the ordnance of Randazzo Mayor, at http://212.46.65.44/randazzo/mc/mc_attachment.php?mc=10803.

[Our thanks to Francesco for this report, and the map and ministry orders. Most appreciated. This outbreak would seem to be a secondary to the Maniace outbreak in the same part of Sicily, reported by OIE on 3 Oct 2016, that started on the 22 Sep 2016 (see archive no. 20161003.4533396).

In that 15 cows died in this outbreak indicates a slow response from the farm owner/manager. With such a bovine feast I think we can expect more outbreaks in the area from the biting flies that fed on these 15 moribund cows. - Mod.MHJ
