China will allow large-scale pig farms and breeding farms to test for African swine fever [ASF] in a bid to help early detection of the disease, overturning an earlier prohibition on commercial firms carrying out their own testing.

The agriculture ministry has asked local husbandry bureaus to encourage large farms to obtain testing kits for the deadly virus that has swept through the country, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on its website on Tuesday [16 Apr 2019; see comment].

The move comes as China struggles to control the epidemic, which some analysts predict could see up to 200 million pigs die or be culled this year [2019], causing a huge shortage of pork in the world's top producer.

Previously, Beijing required testing to be handled by government agencies after signs of illness had been detected, and test kits were not legally available in the market. The change would help in the "early detection, early reporting, and early handling" of ASF, reducing the risk of it spreading through transport, slaughtering, and processing of infected pigs.

Outbreaks of the disease, which is not harmful to humans, has already been reported in almost every region of mainland China. Many cases are also going unreported, industry insiders have told Reuters, and the detection and handling of outbreaks has been hampered by the previous rules on testing.

The statement said test kits should be approved by the ministry or the China Animal Disease Control Center. Authorities should provide funding to the farms for testing, and local animal husbandry departments should help with technical services, it added.

Prior to diagnosis, farms should isolate pigs and other potentially infected items, and positive samples should also be retained and not used for further tests without the ministry's approval, it said.

While the agriculture ministry has repeatedly said the disease is under control, the statement noted that "the awareness of epidemic prevention in pig farms in China is generally weak." It added, "The overall level of epidemic prevention is low, and the cleaning and disinfection measures are difficult to fully implement."

[The revised policy document of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), titled "Notice of the General Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Strengthening the Investigation of African Swine Fever in the Breeding Process" ("Farming and Animal Husbandry [2019] no. 39," issued 16 Apr 2019) is available, in Chinese, at http://www.moa.gov.cn/govpublic/SYJ/201904/t20190416_6179370.htm.

The gravity of the situation, as seen by the Ministry, is apparent from the document's introduction (machine trans. abridged, edited):

"At present, African swine fever [ASF] virus has formed a certain pollution surface in the country. The awareness of epidemic prevention in pig farms in China is generally weak, the overall level of epidemic prevention is low, and the cleaning and disinfection measures are difficult to fully implement. The problem of vehicle-borne dissemination of the epidemic cannot be ignored. Though feeding of kitchen residues to pigs is banned, the risk of epidemic transmission in the breeding sector persists. Strengthening the control of ASF in the breeding sector is a key measure for the prevention and control of the current epidemic situation. It is an important means to detect and eliminate risks in a timely manner ... Animal husbandry and veterinary departments at all levels must earnestly improve their ideological understanding, strengthen policy propaganda, and guide pig farmers to strengthen the investigation of ASF and jointly create a good atmosphere for prevention and control."

Between 3 Aug 2018 and 12 Apr 2019, ASF has been officially reported from a total of 126 villages/sites in 30 out of China's 34 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities: Liaoning (n=21), Anhui (n=9), Hunan (n=8), Yunnan (n=7), Sichuan (n=6), Heilongjiang (n=6, of which one in wild boar), Inner Mongolia (n=6), Shanxi (n=5), Hubei (n=6), Beijing (n=4), Jilin (n=4, of which one in wild boar), Guizhou (n=4), Shaanxi (n=4), Fujian (n=3), Jiangxi (n=3), Guangdong (n=3), Zhejiang (n=3), Jiangsu (n=3), Chongqing (n=3), Tibet Autonomous Region (n=3), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (n=3), Guangxi (n=2), Henan (n=2), Tianjin (n=2), Qinghai (n=1), Ningxia (n=1), Gansu (n=1), Shandong (n=1), Shanghai (n=1), and Hebei (n=1). As of 16 Apr 2019, more than 1 010 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

While the published number of culled animals might be close to accuracy, the actual number of infected farms is generally estimated to be many-folds higher than reported. Though anthropogenic activities evidently play a major role in the virus dissemination, the possible involvement of wild boar should not be neglected. So far, no information on surveillance activities in China's wild boar population has become available.

As published 18 Apr 2019, financial services firm Rabobank estimates that China could lose up to 200 million pigs to disease or slaughter during the epidemic, almost 3 times the pig population in the USA; see further in https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3006601/african-swine-fever-not-enough-pork-whole-world-fill-chinas. - Mod.AS
