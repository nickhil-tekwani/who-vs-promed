For the last 4 months, Canada's public health experts have been racing to stop the spread of COVID-19 by trying to figure out how everyone is getting it, and to whom they may have given it. But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than a third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ. Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003. This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up. But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28 000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with 6 regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150 000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108 000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped. The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March [2020]. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

[Interesting application of genetic tools for epidemiologic investigations of chains of transmission and well worth investing in as a means of tracking and hopefully interrupting transmission as cases occur. Given the immunologically na√Øve population, the occurrence of numerous cases with unknown chains of transmission in the community, this endeavor may be a game changer for dealing with undefined community based transmission. Unfortunately it is currently cost prohibitive as a regular tool, but if it proves its worth, demand should drive costs down to more affordable. - Mod.MPP

Governments must be held accountable for the deaths of health and essential workers who they have failed to protect from COVID-19, Amnesty International said today [13 Jul 2020], as it released a new report documenting the experiences of health workers around the world (https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol40/2572/2020/en/).

The organization's analysis of available data has revealed that more than 3000 health workers are known to have died from COVID-19 worldwide -- a figure which is likely to be a significant underestimate. Alarmingly, Amnesty International documented cases where health workers who raise safety concerns in the context of the COVID-19 response have faced retaliation, ranging from arrest and detention to threats and dismissal.

"With the COVID-19 pandemic still accelerating around the world, we are urging governments to start taking health and essential workers' lives seriously. Countries yet to see the worst of the pandemic must not repeat the mistakes of governments whose failure to protect workers' rights has had devastating consequences," said Sanhita Ambast, Amnesty International's researcher and advisor on economic, social and cultural rights. "It is especially disturbing to see that some governments are punishing workers who voice their concerns about working conditions that may threaten their lives. Health workers on the frontline are the first to know if government policy is not working, and authorities who silence them cannot seriously claim to be prioritising public health."

There is currently no systematic global tracking of how many health and essential workers have died after contracting COVID-19. However, Amnesty International has collated and analysed a wide range of available data that shows that over 3000 health workers are known to have died after contracting COVID-19 in 79 countries around the world. According to Amnesty International's monitoring, the countries with the highest numbers of health worker deaths thus far include the USA (507), Russia (545), UK (540, including 262 social care workers), Brazil (351), Mexico (248), Italy (188), Egypt (111), Iran (91), Ecuador (82), and Spain (63).

The overall figure is likely to be a significant underestimate due to under-reporting, while accurate comparisons across countries are difficult due to differences in counting. For example, France has collected data from just some of its hospitals and health centres, while figures of deceased health workers provided by health associations in Egypt and Russia have been contested by their governments.

[Media reports have called attention to the toll taken among health care workers (HCWs), but not all countries are consistently tracking and reporting consistently the numbers of HCWs. The report goes on to mention shortages of PPE (personal protective equipment) in nearly all of the 63 countries surveyed. In addition it raises the issues of penalties for HCWs who may be involved with protests re: dangerous working conditions. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 605 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 512 confirmed cases, 289 deaths
[C] Italy: 243 230 total cases, 34 967 deaths
[D] Iran: 259 652 total cases, 13 032
[E] USA: 3 479 483 total cases, 138 247 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas, in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[The 3 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were all imported, and it is now 8 days that no new cases have been reported from Beijing.

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (all imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 52 new cases. The newly reported cases involve 27 males and 25 females aged between 5 months and 92 years and 11 had a travel history during the incubation period. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/13/P2020071300814.htm).. Hong Kong has implemented new restrictions: 1) masks mandatory on public transport. 2) dine-in services banned 6 PM to 5 AM, maximum 4/table: 3) Bars, gyms, karaoke lounges, and amusement parks closed; public gatherings back from 50 to 4 people max; 4) passengers from high risk countries must produce proof of negative PCR before boarding flight to Hong Kong. https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3092920/coronavirus-hong-kong-toughen-social-distancing.
Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions -- new severe restrictions announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 33 cases with no new death, compared with 63 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (12 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 91 consecutive days. There were 14 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (7), Gyeonggi (4), Jeonbuk (2), Chungbuk (1), and 19 imported cases: airport quarantine (12), Gyeonggi (5), Gwangju (1), and Daejeon (1). There were 11 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 9 provinces yesterday, 12 Jul 2020).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +169 cases and +13 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (12 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +234 cases and +9 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (94); Emilia-Romagna (18), and Lazio (24) are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases A total of 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (10 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 68 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 52 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase, but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

"Unfortunately, in the past 24 hours, we have lost 203 of our compatriots due to the COVID-19 disease," said health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari. "Based on this figure, the total number of victims has reached 13 032," she told a televised news conference. Lari said another 2 349 people had tested positive for the virus, raising the overall figure in the country's outbreak to 259 652.

Official figures have shown an upward trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May 2020, when Iran hit a near 2-month low in daily recorded infections. The Iranian government made the wearing of masks compulsory in closed public spaces from [4 Jul 2020], including on public transport. State television, whose presenters now wear masks, said on Monday [13 Jul 2020] that police in Tehran were stopping commuters without masks from entering the subway. Authorities in Qom tightened controls in banks and administrative offices to ensure the implementation of health protocols, including mask-wearing, Tasnim news agency reported on Monday [13 Jul 2020].

The health ministry spokeswoman called on everyone to keep a physical distance from others, to wash their hands and to use masks. "The more time you spend in an overcrowded environment, the more likely you are to contract the disease," Lari said.

New York City had a cumulative total of 216 199 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 13 Jul 2020 (+275 since 12 Jul 2020) including 18 708 (+38 since 12 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4615 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, (US Military), Alabama, Louisiana. South Carolina, and Arizona, This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1357 to 12 624. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 43 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.9%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 22.2% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 13 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 41 761 392 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 60.2% of the global newly reported cases and 63.9% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 48.1% (62 369) of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 30.1% (39 023), Mexico 4.7% (6094), Colombia 3.5% (4586), Argentina 2.7% (3449), Peru 2.4% (3064), and Chile 2.3% (3012).

- The European region reported 8.4% of the global newly reported cases and 4.5% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 36.3% (6537) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 9.1% (1646), Israel 6.6% (1194), Turkey 5.6% (1012), Bulgaria 4.7% (853), the UK 3.6% (650), Ukraine 3.4% (612), Azerbaijan 2.9% (520), Kyrgyzstan 2.7% (488), Uzbekistan 2.7% (487), Bosnia and Herzegovina 2.7% (482), and Romania 2.5% (456).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.1% of the global newly reported cases and 11.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.1% (2779) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 18.0% (2753), Iraq 15.1% (2312), Iran 14.3% (2186), Oman 8.6% (1318), Egypt 6.0% (912), Kuwait 5.5% (836), Bahrain 3.1% (471), and Qatar 3.1% (470).

- The African region reported 7.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 74.1% (12 058) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cote d'Ivoire 4.4% (714), Nigeria 3.5% (571), Algeria 3.0% (483), and Kenya 2.3 % (379).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.4% of the global newly reported cases and 3.2% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 69.0% (2037) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 12.4% (366), Australia 8.3% (244), Singapore 6.0% (178), South Korea 2.1% (62), and China 1.6% (46).

- The South East Asia region reported 15.4% of the global newly reported cases and 12.3% of global deaths. India reported 86.2% (28 701) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 8.0% (2666), Indonesia 5.0% (1681), Sri Lanka 0.32% (106), and Nepal 0.21% (82).

Impression: Caution in interpretation of individual country standings as data reflect reporting on Sun 12 Jul 2020 and most likely have weekend artifact. That being said, the overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions, but increased over the usual less than 1% representation due to major increased reporting of cases and deaths from the Philippines.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 13 235 751, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours though, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (65 488) followed by India (28 179) and Brazil (21 783). It is sobering to tally the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), and see that they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.4%). A global total of 575 525 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4007 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Bangladesh, and Argentina. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3099 to 65 488. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Noteworthy is that Kazakhstan is in the top 20s (number 20), having reported 1646 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Also worthy of note is that 6 out of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SAR-CoV-2 activity.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
