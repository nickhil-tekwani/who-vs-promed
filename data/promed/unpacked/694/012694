Bird disease reported in several valley cities
-----------------------------------------------
A bird disease, that has killed hundreds of mourning doves in the high
desert, appears to have infected some Coachella Valley birds, but, not in
particularly large numbers. The disease, called trichomoniasis, has killed
possibly thousands of birds in the high desert, Los Padres National Forest,
and Northern California, and is thought to have touched the Coachella Valley.

A Sky Valley man said that he has found 7 or 8 dead doves at his home, and
an Indio bird expert said she that has heard reports of dove deaths in
Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage.

"Once it gets going, it's like the flu," said Linda York, executive
director of the Coachella Valley Wild Bird Center. "There is not a whole
lot you can do." [Trichmoniasis] primarily affects doves and pigeons
because of their eating habits. "They put their beaks in the parents'
beaks. The scratching allows the pathogen to get going," York said. Once
infected, the disease chokes the birds, and they eventually die, she said.
"It actually cuts off their trachea, and they can't breathe," York said.

She said that some who reported dead birds were worried that the deaths
were caused by the West Nile Virus, a mosquito-borne disease that affects
birds but can also spread to humans. In rare cases, it can cause death. "So
far, it is not West Nile that we are aware of," she said.

Richard Webster, of Sky Valley, said that he started finding dead birds
around his home about 10 days ago. Webster, who said he has been feeding
birds for about 25 years, says his area plays host to finches, grackles,
thrashers, crows, and doves, among other birds. "It is only the doves that
have been dying," Webster said.

York said that one way to reduce the spread of the disease is to regularly
clean bird baths, because doves contract the bug at watering holes. She
also said that the disease is known to crop up periodically. She said that
several years ago, it killed birds in La Quinta and Indian Wells. "It is
cyclical," she said. "It can happen anywhere. Don't panic."

[Trichomoniasis in pigeons is caused by _Trichomonas gallinae_. Pigeons are
the primary hosts, but it also occurs in their predators, e.g. hawks,
falcons, and eagles. The disease is very common in domestic pigeons, but
lesions are predominantly seen in nestling and young pigeons, not in
adults. Birds suffering from trichomoniasis shed the parasites through the
saliva and crop milk. Pigeons are infected by the uptake of contaminated
water, or, oral contact with affected birds during fighting or feeding of
squabs. The parasites colonize the upper digestive tract, predominantly the
crop.

In adult pigeons, the disease is associated with poor racing performance
but manifests no clinical signs. Thus, affected doves would be easy prey
for raptors. Heavily infested adults show fluid droppings with a sour odor.
Rarely, adult pigeons may die acutely when the parasite affects large blood
vessels. Sudden death, and wasting, are seen in affected nestlings.

All in all, pigeons and doves being somewhat colonial, the infection is
easily spread, especially at common drinking areas, whether urban, or, in
the high deserts of Northern California. Raptors feeding on the sick birds
are at risk. - Mod.MHJ]
