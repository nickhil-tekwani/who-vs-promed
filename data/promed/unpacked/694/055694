HSE investigation of the Pirbright site
---------------------------------------
Immediate action was taken to investigate the possible link with the
Pirbright site through the regulatory framework with a Health and
Safety Executive (HSE) led investigation at the Institute for Animal
Health (IAH), and at Merial.
A copy of the initial report of the HSE-led investigation (published
on 7 Aug 2007) can be found on the HSE website
<http://www.hse.gov.uk/news/archive/07aug/pirbright.htm>
The Spratt review
-----------------
An urgent independent review of issues raised by the Defra
investigation was commissioned, led by Professor Brian Spratt of
Imperial College London University, to report to Hilary Benn
(Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) and the
CVO (Chief Veterinary Officer). The review team commenced work on 7
Aug 2007, and included in their evidence the outcome of the immediate
investigation carried out by officials from the HSE. Professor
Spratt's report has made a number of recommendations to improve
biosecurity and biosafety at the Pirbright site, and to reconsider
the future safety of laboratories that work on FMDV and other
important exotic animal pathogens.
Epidemiological investigation and report
----------------------------------------
The epidemiological investigation is undertaken to determine when
infection was introduced and all possible sources of infection. This
involves investigating possible movements of susceptible animals and
their products, people, vehicles, equipment, feedstuffs, bedding
material, etc. In this case there has been specific involvement of
experts to assist with investigating a link to the activities being
undertaken at the Pirbright site.
The final epidemiological report concludes that release was most
likely due to escape of live virus from the drainage system that
connects the vaccine production plant to the sodium hydroxide
treatment tanks on another part of the Pirbright site. Movement of
the virus off site was most likely from movement of fomites
(substance capable of carrying infectious organisms) created from
soil, water, or other material contaminated by effluent, and
deposited on the road from which the track to the 1st infected premises leads.
Interim epidemiological reports are available as follows:
- Summary epidemiology report, 9 Aug 2007

- Summary epidemiology report, 13 Aug 2007

[This appears to bring to a close quite an unusual event, which was
investigated in a rapid and thorough fashion. A key step in the
outbreak investigation is the publication of findings, so that we
don't have to repeat these mistakes at another time in another place.
Outbreaks are an opportunity for learning, so enjoy the reading
wherever you might be investigating outbreaks in the future. - Mod.PC]
