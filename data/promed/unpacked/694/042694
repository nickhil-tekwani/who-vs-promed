Two horses and a donkey were euthanised in Gorakhpur [Uttar Pradesh] on [Sat 9 Sep 2017] after they were detected with the deadly glanders disease. A high alert has been sounded in the district and movement of equines -- horses, ponies, mules, and donkeys -- has been restricted.

The disease can spread quickly in animals and also infect humans. This is the 1st time it has been detected in Gorakhpur.

Gorakhpur Chief Veterinary Officer Dr KP Singh said samples of 20 equines were sent to the National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar around a month ago. 2 weeks ago, the laboratory sent its 1st report confirming the disease in the 3 animals. "We rushed to owners of the animals at Karwal Machgawa village.

They were isolated and their samples collected again and sent to Hisar for re-confirmation. 2 days back, we got the 2nd report confirming the findings," said Singh. DM Rajeev Rautela was informed and directions issued to euthanise the animals.

A report will be sent to animal husbandry headquarters in Lucknow, seeking compensation to the animals' owners.

India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome glanders, are often published by the Indian press. This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to the recent ones, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period Jul-Dec 2016 is not yet available.

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however. prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref 2).
